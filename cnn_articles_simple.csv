bf2824c76da6,"Jonathan Powell had no role in dropping of China spy case, senior minister says",,"The government’s national security adviser had no involvement in the prosecution being dropped against two British men accused of spying for China, a senior cabinet minister has said. Jonathan Powell had no connection to discussions about the “substance or the evidence” of the case, Bridget Phillipson said on Sunday, adding that Keir Starmer had full confidence in him. Powell’s role has been under intense scrutiny since it emerged that the sudden abandonment of the prosecution in September appeared to be because Starmer’s government was unwilling to say that China posed a threat to UK national security, a decision to which Powell would appear to be central. According to reports, the cases against Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China, were dropped after Powell said China would not be described as an enemy in any trial – considered necessary for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Cash and Berry deny accusations that they provided information about Westminster to China’s politburo. Under the updated national security strategy released in June, China was listed as a “geostrategic challenge” rather than an enemy. Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, Phillipson was asked why the case had lapsed. She said: “Obviously, the Crown Prosecution Service are best placed to explain why they were not able to bring forward a prosecution, but what I can be absolutely clear about is that ministers and others, including the national security adviser, had no role to play in either the substance of the case or the evidence in question.” Speaking earlier on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, the education secretary was asked for assurances that Powell took no part in the decision. “Yes, I can give that assurance,” Phillipson replied. “We’re very disappointed that the CPS were not able to take forward the prosecution.” Asked if the prime minister still had full confidence in Powell, she said he did. The centrality of government decision-making emerged last week when Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, wrote to the chairs of two parliamentary select committees to say that the case was dropped after ministers and officials declined to set out that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, despite what he called “many months” of efforts. This is key because of case law relating to the Official Secrets Act, which emerged after Cash and Berry were charged. This, connected to the separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, clarified that under the act, a country must be a threat to the UK’s national security at the time of the offence, prompting the need for clarification from the government. Phillipson told the BBC that because some of the legal changes dated back to 2023, it was a matter for the previous Conservative government. “I’m not making a partisan point when I say this, but there was a different government in office then,” she said. In a letter to the prime minister on Sunday evening, Kemi Badenoch urged Starmer to address “key questions which remain unanswered” about the case, claiming the government’s “account of what has happened has changed repeatedly”. She added: “This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on members of parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It puts them on a potential course to overtake the Conservatives and comes little more than a week after the Greens announced they had moved past the Liberal Democrats in membership numbers, getting to 83,500. If the same momentum continues, party officials say, they could be on course to become bigger than the Conservatives. Tory party membership figures are not made public, but recent reports say the total is slightly above 120,000. Such numbers do not necessarily translate into electoral success, with Labour having had a peak of more than 500,000 members under Jeremy Corbyn, who lost two general elections. And while one recent poll put the Greens at 15%, most such surveys have put the party nearer to 11% or 12%, not much changed since Polanski took charge. But the influx of members does point to Polanski’s apparent ability to galvanise attention and enthusiasm for a party that has often struggled to get its message across, with a mass of interviews, social media videos and TV appearances. The Greens’ surge has caused worries among some senior Labour figures, who believe it could take votes and seats from the party in next May’s local elections in England, particularly in some London boroughs. Polanski has repeatedly set out what he sees as the Greens’ ambition to supplant Labour. In a speech this month to the party’s annual conference, he said that without action Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK. Responding to the new membership figure, Polanski said: “More than 100,000 people have now joined the Green movement. That’s 100,000 people who believe politics can be honest, fair and hopeful again. “When I was elected leader last month, I said that we’re not here to be disappointed with Labour but that we’re here to replace them. I was serious. Because while Labour talks about change, people can see in their weekly shop, their utility bills and crumbling services, Labour are offering more of the same. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

9e7e2fd304dd,UK to host international summit on Gaza recovery plan,,"The UK is to host an international summit on the recovery of Gaza, Downing Street has said, as Keir Starmer prepared to attend a multi-nation event in Egypt intended to finalise a truce in the Palestinian territory. The prime minister will be among an estimated 20 national leaders, among them Donald Trump, who will gather in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, with Starmer saying the aim must be to ensure a lasting peace after two years of devastating loss of life. As humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza , the UK has said that £20m in already-pledged aid will now be focused on water, sanitation and hygiene services. The funding will be delivered through Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Norwegian Refugee Council. The UK will also host a three-day conference organised by the Foreign Office’s Wilton Park agency, based in West Sussex, beginning on Monday afternoon. The event will include representatives from the Palestinian Authority as well as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and Italy. Other participants will include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, and private sector and development financiers. The discussions “will also cover efforts to support the Palestinian Authority’s own transformation and reform programme to ensure it can support Gaza’s recovery”, a Downing Street statement said, adding that while the process would be Palestinian-led, there was “absolutely no role for Hamas”. In a comment at the summit in Egypt released in advance, Starmer said: “We stand determined to seize this opportunity to deliver a lasting peace, and a stable, secure future for the whole region. “Today is the first, crucial phase of ending this war and now we must deliver the second phase, in full. “The UK will support the next stage of talks to ensure the full implementation of the peace plan, so that people on both sides can rebuild their lives in safety and security.” Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, said: “The UK has worked intensively with international partners in recent months to create the momentum that has led to President Trump’s peace initiative, and to support the ceasefire that is now in place, but we now need to work with the same intensity and urgency to develop a plan for Gaza’s recovery and reconstruction. “Gaza has been completely devastated. The ceasefire gives us the opportunity not just to urgently scale up humanitarian efforts but also to look to the future of Gaza’s recovery. Rubble must be cleared, infrastructure repaired, healthcare restored and homes rebuilt.” Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “We know that we need to see a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel . That’s the government’s position. That’s what we want to continue to be involved in making happen and why the prime minister, Keir Starmer, is tomorrow travelling to Egypt.” Asked what part the UK had played in the ceasefire, she said: “We do have a role, but of course, the role of the US has been critical in this. We can all recognise that.” Speaking later to the BBC, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “I think we have to be honest at the fact that Britain has had no role, no role whatsoever.” She added: “I think it’s extraordinary that Keir Starmer apparently is going to Egypt tomorrow when we’ve got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving and sorting out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/uk-to-host-international-summit-on-gaza-recovery-plan,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05db5169b643683a8fbce122f7804296b83cda85/435_100_1417_1134/master/1417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=edb0027368d74ace55f247031b7d6ebd",2025-10-12T21:00:02+00:00,924679a4f4a29eb1fe9e44ed40fa7275b6830d0c
c650ed8e9ace,Lucy Powell calls on Labour not to ‘write off’ May local elections,,"Labour should not “write off” next May’s elections as a likely moment for big losses but use the budget as a way to seize back voters’ attention, Lucy Powell has said as the battle to be the party’s deputy leadership entered its final period. With voting among party members under way, Bridget Phillipson , Powell’s rival for the post, said if she won she would set up a formal system to reflect the views of members and unions to the cabinet on a regular basis. Powell was sacked from the cabinet in last month’s reshuffle after the departure of Angela Rayner and has become the favourite to win on an outsider platform, promising to present tough truths to Keir Starmer and his team when necessary. Speaking after a series of events with members over the weekend, Powell said there was concern about the possible impact on the party of the elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and councils across England next May, with Labour predicted to see heavy losses, many to Reform UK. Powell, who was leader of the Commons until the reshuffle, said she was “not prepared to write off this hugely important set of elections” as inevitable midterm pushback, calling for a bold budget in response. “It’s not OK if we are losing good Labour councillors and councils through no fault of their own, because of the missteps we’ve taken nationally,” she said. “We need to reset the agenda so that more communities don’t wake up to Reform and other councils after election day next May.” The 26 November budget should be “a moment to draw a line under our past mistakes, and show the country whose side we are on”, Powell said, saying it should lift the two-child benefit cap and make sure the tax burden was shared more fairly. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson, the education secretary, indicated she believed the cap would be lifted. “I am confident that we as a government will do the right thing by children growing up in poverty in our country,” she said. “We’ve already started that process. There’s more to do. I will make that happen.” Phillipson argued that as a cabinet minister she could make sure members’ concerns were heard directly at the top of government. In a subsequent pledge, her team said she would formally solicit views from members and trade unions every three months to present in this way. She said: “The Labour party draws its strength from its members. That’s why I want to give them a stronger voice in how the government delivers its agenda, with more avenues for our movement to tell us about their priorities. “Only under my deputy leadership will members have their voices heard loud and clear at the cabinet table.” Electronic voting among party members began last Wednesday and will run until 23 October, with the result announced two days later.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/lucy-powell-calls-on-labour-not-to-write-off-may-local-elections,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ab272bb5d2ecfbb71be150d5f8572aba021427/254_0_3099_2480/master/3099.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=636f15cf5b081eb1160cfd43ac2c4c7d",2025-10-12T16:00:21+00:00,b38b8c9a89ef79a170dcffbfb1a29dc4220c81cd
6bcca05532c9,William Hill owner says it could shut shops if Reeves raises gambling taxes,,"The debt-laden company behind William Hill is considering closing up to 200 betting shops if Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget raises taxes on the gambling sector. Evoke, formerly known as 888, which acquired William Hill in a £2bn takeover in 2022, is drawing up plans for different scenarios before expected gambling tax increases in the chancellor’s budget on 26 November. Evoke is considering shutting a number of outlets, in news first reported by the Sunday Times , which said closures could range from 120 shops to closer to 200. This would amount to between 9% and 15% of William Hill’s chain of 1,300 betting shops, with up to 1,500 jobs potentially affected. Between five and 10 people typically work in a betting shop. Evoke, which also owns the 888 and Mr Green brands, has 10,000 staff in total. The FTSE 250 company is struggling under a debt pile of £1.8bn after its largely debt-funded acquisition of William Hill, and made a pre-tax loss of nearly £78m in the first half of the year. A spokesperson for Evoke said: “We are mindful of potential tax increases in the forthcoming budget which would impact investment in the UK and drive more customers to the black market. “As part of our ongoing planning, we are assessing the potential impact of different overall tax scenarios on our UK operations. This includes the difficult but necessary consideration for shop closures.” The company stressed that no decision had been taken yet. It is the second big gambling company to warn of the impact of tax rises within a week. Stella David, the chief executive of Entain, the FTSE 100 owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, also said higher gambling taxes could lead to shop closures and investment being diverted to other countries. The government has been consulting on gambling taxation, and wants to simplify the various rates of duty applied to gambling products – a move the sector fears would raise its overall tax bill. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are consulting on bringing online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy. It is not about increasing or decreasing tax rates, and we welcome all views.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

5896dcb868dc,UK ministers take control of £10bn Lower Thames Crossing,,"Ministers have stripped the government’s road-building agency of responsibility for a £10bn tunnel under the River Thames amid a drive by Keir Starmer’s cabinet to take tight control over important infrastructure projects for fear of cost overruns and delays. Oversight of the Lower Thames Crossing – the UK’s largest planned infrastructure project – has been taken away from National Highways and handed to the Department for Transport (DfT). An artist’s impression of the Lower Thames Crossing, southern tunnel entrance. Photograph: Joas Souza/National Highways Internal consultation documents, seen by the Guardian, said the costs of the Lower Thames Crossing would be overseen by the DfT, leaving National Highways to “focus on managing, maintaining and renewing the network”. However, campaigners warned that the move could in fact lead to HS2-levels of overspending and ministers approving developments behind closed doors that would harm the environment. Treasury officials are thought to be behind the shift to centralise the management of large infrastructure projects after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made clear her frustration at “ bats and newts” delaying major schemes and adding to the final costs. The consultation documents showed that the “Tier 1” project – which is considered by the DfT to be “one of the largest, highest risk, novel and/or contentious” schemes now being undertaken – would be overseen by the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander . Reeves and Starmer have put planning reform at the heart of their growth plans after drafting legislation earlier this year to make it easier to build without paying as much for expensive wildlife protection . The chancellor is keen to include a number of initiatives designed to allow developers to build houses and infrastructure projects, in the hope that higher economic growth will fill about £3bn of an estimated £30bn shortfall in the Treasury’s finances. Earlier this week, Reeves was taped claiming that she had unblocked a development of 20,000 homes that was being held up by a rare snail. The new Thames crossing has received final planning consent and secured £590m for early-stage excavation, surveys and consultations. In addition, the construction firm Balfour Beatty has landed a £1.2bn contract to build roads connecting to the tunnel. However, funding for the full project has been delayed while the chancellor searches for a partner that could contribute as much as £2bn to the scheme in return for charging a toll. Work is expected to get under way before the end of the decade. The site lies east of the Dartford crossing, which takes traffic from the M25 and lorries travelling to and from the ports of Dover and Folkestone. A map showing the Lower Thames Crossing route Environmental campaigners argue that vital habitats on Kent’s north shoreline and the south Essex coast will be lost if the tunnel goes ahead. It will also increase carbon emissions without solving congestion on existing roads, they added. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alexander said earlier this year that the government was “finally getting on” with the crossing, adding that the “crucial project” had “been stuck in planning limbo for far too long”. National Highways has said that an extra connection between north Kent and Essex is also needed to allow for maintenance on the existing Dartford tunnels. It is understood that National Highways will remain responsible for the development of the crossing and will publish a breakdown of costs in its annual report, but decisions over the scope and funding of the project will be taken by ministers. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Backed by £590m, the Lower Thames Crossing is the most significant road-building project in a generation – and will cut local congestion, better link up motorists and businesses in the Midlands and north with key ports in the south-east, and spreading growth throughout the regions, as set in our plan for change.” Quick Guide Contact Guardian Business about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

40c8f01a1917,SNP backs Swinney’s ‘clear’ strategy for new independence referendum,,"SNP members have overwhelmingly backed leader John Swinney’s “clear and unambiguous” independence strategy that a majority election win is the only route to another referendum. On the first day of the party’s annual conference in Aberdeen, the vast majority of members backed the leadership’s motion that next May’s Holyrood elections should be fought on a “clear platform of national independence” and that winning a majority in the Scottish parliament – by securing 65 seats or more – would be “the only uncontested way to deliver a new vote on Scotland’s future”. After a passionate – and at times highly technical – debate, the conference rejected a rebel amendment put by more than 40 local branches that set out a more fundamentalist strategy of treating next year’s election as a de facto referendum, meaning that if the SNP and other pro-independence parties win a majority of the popular vote in 2026, it should be treated as a mandate to open independence negotiations directly. This de facto idea was first promoted by the former party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who acknowledged it as a “mistake” in her recent memoir. Echoing the confidence of SNP strategists reported in the Guardian yesterday, Swinney told the packed conference hall that “we are within touching distance of the 65 seats that will make the world sit up and take notice” and urged the party to back taking a “clear, unambiguous message” to the public. Depute leader Keith Brown, who seconded the motion, told delegates: “The only way we can achieve independence is to ask a clear question and get a clear answer.” This call to clarity is key: while independence is not high on the list of voters’ priorities, activists have unhappy memories of trying to explain what many believed was a fatally muddled independence strategy on the doorstep for the general election last year, where the SNP was humiliated by the resurgent Labour party, losing 38 of its 48 Westminster seats. A year on, the party’s pivot to its core message is a mark of renewed confidence, with the SNP once again leading the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, and an understanding that the battleground demographic for the coming campaign is made up of those “soft yes” independence supporters who have drifted away from the party. Speaking for the de facto amendment, veteran activist Graeme McCormick insisted that it was not proposed by “romantic nationalists”. He warned that the SNP was being “hollowed out” because it had failed to inspire its membership with a date for another referendum. The former MP Tommy Sheppard said it was “remarkable” that such a large conference was able to have such a detailed discussion in public and in front of the media, but insisted there were “no quick fixes”. “We have been chasing the next election for too long,” he said, arguing that the party needed a strategy to take it into the 2030s and deepen support for independence. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

382d275f6695,"The Guardian view on Labour targeting nature: the problem isn’t snails, but a broken housing model",,"I t began with gastropods. Last Tuesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told a conference of tech executives that she’d intervened to help a developer build about 20,000 homes in north Sussex that had been held up, she said, by “some snails … a protected species or something”. She added that they “are microscopic … you cannot even see” them. No one could miss the direction the chancellor was headed in. The snail in question, the lesser whirlpool ramshorn, is one of Britain’s rarest freshwater creatures, found in only a handful of locations and highly sensitive to sewage pollution . But Ms Reeves portrayed it as a bureaucratic nuisance. She then bragged that she’d fixed it – after a friendly developer gave her a call. It’s a bad look for a Labour politician, let alone the chancellor, to boast that green rules can be bent for chums. The scheme was given the go-ahead a day before drought was declared in Sussex, potentially giving water companies cover to breach their licence obligations – including measures meant to protect the snails. Ms Reeves won’t like being compared to Liz Truss, but the analogy works. Three years ago, Ms Truss railed against an “anti-growth coalition” of environmentalists, lawyers and regulators who, she claimed, were blocking Britain’s path to prosperity. Ms Reeves is framing the issue the same way: growth is the priority, nature the obstacle. But the public don’t agree. Luke Tryl of More in Common told a Conservative conference fringe meeting that most Britons can’t be categorised as “ nimby ” or “ yimby ”. They want both: to build and also to protect the countryside. However, when asked whether wildlife should be protected even if it delays or raises the cost of infrastructure, every single voter group – including Labour, Conservative and Reform UK – chose wildlife. Among the general public, 62% prioritised nature protection while 18% sided with building at any cost. The Treasury reportedly plans to gut green rules with amendments to its planning and infrastructure bill – ditching the precautionary principle, slashing species protections and curbing legal challenges. The bill, currently in the Lords , already allows developers to bypass environmental obligations by paying into a fund to offset damage elsewhere. Under its “environmental delivery plans”, ministers could disapply environmental protections in exchange for vague promises of ecological improvement within 10 years. Labour, significantly, is turning its back on the work of the Dasgupta review . This argues that nature is not a constraint on growth but its foundation, a form of capital on which the economy depends. Labour is not only rejecting that view but deluding itself by claiming housebuilding will be accelerated by dismissing concerns around conservation. The Wildlife Trusts points out that more than a million homes already have planning permission since 2015, but remain unbuilt. The real barriers to housebuilding are skills shortages, hoarded land and slow delivery. They need sorting out. Blaming snails, it would seem, is easier. Many of Labour’s younger voters are already tempted by the Green party, which combines environmentalism and leftwing economics. Now, by mocking green protections and cosying up to developers, the chancellor is giving these voters more reasons to jump ship. The problem isn’t the planning system . It’s a broken, profit-driven housing model that banks land and starves supply. Scrapping nature protections won’t build 1.5m homes , it will just bulldoze public trust and the countryside.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/the-guardian-view-on-labour-targeting-nature-the-problem-isnt-snails-but-a-broken-housing-model,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d22c32e1b9889c35a88e06ee05667588a092dd/329_0_4304_3442/master/4304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2e9683e3222c856e2225a65397fff8c7",2025-10-12T16:30:56+00:00,9af80332755b16e08e499dc65da5d37ab2ecb960
18fae14c0868,France is not alone in its crisis of political faith – belief in a democratic world is vanishing,,"E mmanuel Macron sounded like a man in grief. Not angry, not defiant, just a little triste . Europe, he lamented, was suffering a “ degeneration of democracy ”. Many threats emanated from outside, from Russia, from China, from powerful US tech companies and social-media entrepreneurs, France’s president said. “But we should not be naive. On the inside we are turning on ourselves. We doubt our own democracy … We see everywhere that something is happening to our democratic fabric. Democratic debate is turning into a debate of hatred.” Squeezed between vituperative extremes of right and left, Macron knows of what he speaks. But “ungovernable” France is not alone in its bitter, intractable divisions . Across Europe, in the UK and the US, distrust and grievance daily deepen political dysfunction and social discord. Macron’s words apply, in fact, to almost any country espousing democratic principles. Belief that democracy is the form of governance best suited to the modern world is dwindling, especially among younger people . Meanwhile, the public space grows coarser and more violent. Macron was speaking at an event marking the 35th anniversary of Germany’s 1990 reunification, a moment of great optimism. Yet, like France, today’s polarised Germany faces an acute crisis of political faith. Just look around. In elections last weekend, the Czech Republic followed Poland, Austria and other EU states in lurching towards the populist hard right, swept along on a rising tide of anti-establishment negativity. Support for opportunistic bigots who feed on fear, resentment and loss – while lacking credible policies on complex issues such as migration – is not an endorsement of democracy but its despoliation. This ugly rush to extremes is a vote of no confidence in the democratic system itself, exacerbated by reduced levels of participation and turnout among disadvantaged social groups. In all these countries, a national democratic consensus is woefully lacking. In declining, despairing Britain, where national flags are worn like comfort blankets, both leading mainstream parties are flailing; yet the alternatives are implausible or downright pernicious. In the US, the “home of democracy”, effective opposition to Republican one-party rule has all but collapsed, at least at national level. Striving to gerrymander congressional districts , Donald Trump increasingly resembles a dictator. Lack of genuine democratic choice and economic opportunity, fuelling alienation and revolt, beset countries as diverse as Morocco , Kenya and Bangladesh , all of which have witnessed recent upheavals. In the Philippines, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia and Madagascar, corruption and abuse of power have triggered anti-government protests. In Nepal last month, young people powered a “gen-Z revolution”. All these countries, in Europe and beyond, are different – except in one vital respect. Compared with authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia, their societies remain relatively open and free, for now. This is the fundamental challenge each faces: democracy isn’t working, or it is working so badly it risks being jettisoned. The once exemplary US – a paradigm lost – and fractious western Europe are faltering. And once again, less established democracies in the global south, and in central and eastern Europe, are frontline states in a reviving cold war of influence and values fought against the Beijing-Moscow axis. Like Moldova and Georgia , to name two recent battlegrounds, they could go either way. A crunch is coming. In its annual report, Freedom House, the US-based rights watchdog, found that violence, poll manipulation and repression marred more than 40% of national elections held in 2024. Global freedom, assessed in terms of political liberties and civil rights, declined for a 19th consecutive year. “Conflicts spread instability and thwarted democratic progress around the world,” the report concluded. In the US, a recent survey found a record 64% of Americans believe their democracy “is too politically divided to solve the nation’s problems”. In the UK, a poll of people aged 16-29 found 63% think democracy is in trouble . While young people “preferred to live in a democracy over a dictatorship by 57% to 27%”, only 35% said they would consider getting involved in organised politics. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Short- and long-term economic issues – the cost of living, inflation, lack of good jobs, de-industrialisation, shattered communities, institutional failures, wealth inequality, globalisation, mass migration linked to the climate crisis, the busted myth of infinitely sustainable growth – are all factors. Untrustworthy leaders, reflecting falling moral standards, is another. Insidious election meddling and online fakery by Russia and others hasten breakdown. Younger generations are pitted against ageing populations. And there is hopelessness, as well as anger, about the mess the world is in, environmentally and geopolitically. For Andreas Reckwitz of Humboldt University of Berlin, all this discontent is rooted in an overall, profound and ubiquitous sense of loss. “Western modernity’s foundational lie” – the post-Enlightenment belief that human progress is constant and inevitable, that everything gets better over time, that life improves – has been brutally exploded by the experience of recent decades, Reckwitz argues . “Loss has become a pervasive condition of life … The question is no longer whether loss can be avoided but whether societies bound to ‘better’ or ‘more’ can learn to endure ‘less’ and ‘worse’.” Seen this way, rejection of failing democratic structures and the advance of demagogic throwbacks pledging a return to “the way things were” are more easily understood. “If politics continues to promise endless improvement, it will fuel disillusionment and strengthen populisms that thrive on betrayed expectations,” Reckwitz writes. “Populism channels anger over what has disappeared but provides only illusions of recovery. The crucial question then becomes: how to deal with loss?” Reckwitz has his own suggestions, involving resilience and redistribution. If anyone has a definitive answer, Macron, with much to lose, would surely love to hear it.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/france-crisis-political-faith-belief-democratic-world-vanishing,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5622669477b5eae1034bdd5e7b06e606031d3067/404_0_4492_3593/master/4492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c1d471c87aa33813482b70b453549c64",2025-10-12T05:00:42+00:00,2133eefdc3204ea52dee6e4981014d6e78b6ca47
286be389b0af,Don’t fall for the authoritarian hype – Reform and the hard right can be stopped in their tracks,,"N igel Farage portrays his Reform UK party as a unique phenomenon that has burst on to the global stage, its meteoric rise an exceptional epochal event. But this week, in every one of Europe’s major countries and from India and Thailand to the US and Argentina, hard-right, anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation parties like his are also ahead in the opinion polls. In last Saturday’s Czech elections, the rightwing, pro-Putin populist Andrej Babiš toppled prime minister Petr Fiala. National Rally , which has just brought down yet another French prime minister , is leading the polls for both the French presidency and parliament. In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is currently the most popular party. Hungary’s Fidesz party, Robert Fico’s pro-Russian Slovakian coalition and the Brothers of Italy are already in government, while the Freedom party of Austria (FPÖ), the Netherlands’ Freedom party (PVV) and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang – all hardline nationalists – are part of an international coalition of anti-internationalists, inspired by far-right propagandists like Steve Bannon , seeking to dethrone the international rule of law, diminish human rights and destroy multilateral cooperation. The populist nationalist surge exposes a new and unavoidable truth that democrats ignore at our peril: an authoritarian ethnic nationalism – once thought toppled with the Berlin Wall – has replaced neoliberalism as the dominant ideology of our age, giving us a world of firsts: “America first”, “India first”, “China first”, “Russia first”, “my tribe first” and often “my tribe first and only” regimes. It is this ethnic nationalism that helps explain why the world is now composed of 91 autocracies and only 88 democracies , and ethnic nationalism is the force behind the violations of international human rights law not just by Russia in Ukraine but in almost every one of the world’s 59 cross-border conflicts and civil wars. It is important to understand the underlying forces, common to almost every country, that have fuelled this new age of nationalism. It starts with a widely felt sense that a globalisation that was open but not inclusive has been a free for all that has not been fair to all. For more than a decade, leaders have not only been slow to respond to the millions who feel left out and left behind, but also to the changing balance of global economic power, moving us from a unipolar world once dominated by the US to a multipolar world of competing superpowers, and from a rules-based order to a power-based one. The ethnic nationalism that this has incited means free trade is giving way to protectionism. Where economics used to drive politics, the politics of nationalism is now driving economic decisions, and already more than 100 countries are running mercantilist policies marked out by reshoring and friend-shoring and by bans on cross-border trade, investment and technology transfer, sinking international cooperation to its lowest ebb since 1945. But all is not lost. The cement is still wet, and even as it hardens we can find hope in the common sense of the global public. In a survey by Focaldata , of 36,000 people in 34 countries we find a clear majority are more resistant to an exclusionary nationalism and more willing to embrace international cooperation than many of the leaders who rule over them. Across the world there is, perhaps surprisingly, only a small group of hardened anti-internationalists representing 16.5% of the global population (even if 25% in today’s US) who either feel coexistence between ethnic and religious groups is impossible or have a zero-sum mindset that if they or their country do well, it has to be at the expense of others doing badly. But there are another 21% at the opposite extreme, whom we might call committed internationalists, who either still see cooperation across borders through open trade as a positive sum win-win, or are what the US philosopher and writer Kwame Anthony Appiah calls “rooted cosmopolitans”. Nigel Farage 'doesn't like Britain': Keir Starmer takes dig at Reform leader – video The vast majority of the global public are somewhere in between: not narrow, inward-looking nationalists, as “America first” ideology would suggest, or all-in cosmopolitans. They are patriotic but don’t see the world as in a never-ending struggle between the “us” and the “them”, adversaries permanently set apart from each other in an unbridgeable divide. Do the majority in the middle prefer a duty-free or a dutiful world? Are they prepared to accept obligations beyond their garden gate or city wall? Yes, under certain conditions. A first group, 22%, will back humanitarian action to relieve suffering and are prepared to act out of altruism, supporting emergency help for disaster zones. Those we might call “good cause” multilateralists feel the pain of others and believe in something bigger than themselves. A second group comprising 22% are pragmatic multilateralists who want to know that any taxes paid out for international development are spent well. And there is a third group, 21%, self-interested multilateralists, who will endorse cooperation if they can see that it benefits them and their communities, whether it be through guaranteeing them food on the table or peace and security. So a clear majority can be constructed not just for humanitarian aid if money is well spent but also for global action to deal with global problems, like climate crisis and pandemic prevention, as long as this case is argued on grounds of enlightened self-interest, and if we stress the reciprocal benefits that flow to them and their own country. And thus for those who have long wondered whether we cooperate out of need or if we have a need to cooperate, the answer is both. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And while in-depth polls tell us that across the west, illegal immigration is currently the biggest national issue – and no one should doubt that it must quickly be brought under control – the snapshots of opinion also tell us that the public are even more concerned about what is happening in their own lives and within their own local communities. Last month, Keir Starmer spoke movingly about how what’s good about Britain can drive out what’s bad, doing so precisely because in most western countries, “broken” and “in decline” are the words people have for years most commonly cited when asked about both our economy and society. But as the prime minister also reminded us, the far right is more interested in exploiting grievances than ending them. Farage hailed Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget as “ the best Conservative budget since 1986 ”. But he would also enact Truss act two – what she planned to deliver – the biggest ever cuts in public services. Reform’s plan to reduce public spending by £275bn would not repair downtrodden communities but ravage them, turn citizen against citizen and wreck any spirit of solidarity. Under a Farage hard-right regime, you will not be able to afford to be sick, disabled, poor or vulnerable. Every day from now on, and in every constituency, Reform should be asked which hospital, which school and which public service will be the first to be cut or closed. “Faragism” is neoliberalism at its most inhumane, more destructive even than monetarism, and vindictive far beyond austerity. What the public are telling us all over the west is that they want their governments to rebuild our economies and our civic societies . “Reform” and its global allies should be exposed day after day for policies that would devastate both. And for those of us who believe our best days could be ahead of us, we can go beyond highlighting Reform’s hypocrisy by setting out a case for a better Britain that appeals not just to idealists, but to pragmatists, to self-interest, and to the everyday compassion of the British people.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/reform-nigel-farage-hard-right-politics-gordon-brown-labour,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f88d36ac4c240f8bd0bb64e9786d1fd1839191/1122_0_6436_5151/master/6436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=febc73ddb146d4cbf657336b940b2883",2025-10-11T09:00:20+00:00,6ff5a86b90109092b817a5bde8dd5cccc005e2a1
3a023e18e83e,Why should you be Labour’s next deputy leader? Guardian readers quiz the candidates,,"What would you do to tackle the cost of living crisis that has ravaged working-class communities? Stephen Heinson , Cardiff Bridget Phillipson: I wouldn’t be here without Labour governments. They spurred me on my journey from a tough council street in the north-east all the way to the cabinet. We had no heating upstairs when I was growing up, and we struggled with damp. But that story’s not unique: it’s shared by so many working people across Britain. That’s why I have been fighting for changes that will make a difference to working families. Such as reviving Sure Start for a new generation, funding childcare from nine months old, rolling out free breakfast clubs, expanding free school meals for half a million more children and capping the branded items schools can require. Together these changes save working-class families thousands of pounds. As co-chair of the Child Poverty Taskforce, I am clear everything is on the table, including removing the two-child limit. As deputy leader I would continue fighting for policies that change the lives of working people: investment in public services, ensuring the full delivery of our employment rights bill so people get fair pay for a fair day’s work – change that makes Labour members proud of this government, proud to campaign, proud to win again. Lucy Powell: The cost of living crisis, Covid, austerity and the global financial crisis have all hit working-class communities hardest. Each has deepened inequalities in class, region, education and opportunity. Addressing this is what this Labour government is about. We have an economy that serves the few, not the many – a “trickle-down” model that needs rewiring. I want to see a much stronger sense that tackling economic inequality and fairness unites everything we do. That’s one of the reasons I strongly support lifting the two-child benefit cap at the forthcoming budget, looking at Gordon Brown’s measures on gambling taxes to pay for it. As deputy, I would help to seize back the political megaphone to set the terms of the debate, being clear about what we are doing to reshape the economy in the interests of working-class communities – buses and trains back in public hands, a new energy company, GB Energy, owned by us all, more dignity and security in work and at home with the employment bill and renters rights bill. The job of the deputy leader isn’t to write a separate budget or policy programme but to ensure that our values shine through, and what we are doing is rooted in the communities we are here to serve. Stephen Heinson: Sadly, neither candidate seems able to acknowledge that the cost of living crisis is really a crisis of our failed economic model. There’s a direct link between declining living standards and unrestrained corporate greed: the private energy companies skimming off huge profits from ballooning household bills, for instance, or the property developers and letting agents cashing in on renters’ misery in a broken housing market. Tackling this crisis meaningfully would mean defying the corporate interests of Labour’s CEO donors. How are you going to address the rise of the far right in this country? Dominique Sandring , London BP: The Labour movement has been defined for generations by our core values – solidarity, compassion, fairness and social justice. As deputy leader, I’d campaign with hope and optimism, underpinned always by those Labour values that mean so much to our members. We should be proud of our values – proud to stand up for them, never ashamed of them. The far right feeds off fear and negativity, exploiting the struggles of people across the country and offering false solutions and empty promises. Let me be clear: we won’t win by parroting the language of Reform UK and Nigel Farage. We are Labour and we must govern, campaign, and win as Labour. We must deliver on the change that we promised voters so we can build the society we all want to see. That means expanding free school meals, renewing Sure Start and reforming employment rights to make work pay. It is only a united Labour party, the greatest vehicle for social justice this country has ever seen, that can deliver real change in our communities and country. LP: Fighting the forces of division and hate is the challenge of our age. The future of our democracy depends on us winning the battle of hearts and minds, showing that mainstream progressive politics is a force for change. We’ve got to up our game. As deputy leader I would help Labour do that. We shouldn’t try to out-Reform Reform UK. Nigel Farage wants the country to believe that immigrants are the root cause of all our problems. I wholeheartedly reject that. Yes, we need secure and strong borders as a foundation of a secure and fair country, but the reasons for deep-seated inequalities go much deeper. We need to seize back the political megaphone and set out far more strongly our diagnosis of what is really wrong with this country, and what Labour is doing to fix it. We have an economy that hasn’t worked for ordinary people for decades. From Margaret Thatcher to austerity, Covid and the energy crisis, those with wealth and assets have done well. For everyone else, life has got harder and less secure. We need to show that every single thing we are doing is in service of addressing this – to tell our own story about how we’re fixing the real problems. Dominique Standring: Reading the answers side by side, my sense is that Lucy Powell has answered the question better in that she has identified that Reform are winning the battle of hearts and minds – and that Labour’s message is not cutting through. Bridget Phillipson talks of Labour’s values being “solidarity, compassion, fairness, and social justice”, but I have not seen much evidence of this with the Labour government: from its stance on family reunification for those with visas to the genocide in Gaza and focus on ID cards. Crucially, neither of them have answered the “how” part of my question in any detail. Why isn’t Labour adopting a wealth tax? Can you give an example of a country where such a tax has been successful? Norma Spark , London BP: I’ve always believed in progressive taxation – it’s at the core of building a fairer and more equal society. The nature of our economy has been changing, with more people earning money from the wealth they hold; we have started to address that through the changes on carried interest, by increasing capital gains tax. And of course through non-dom reforms – you can’t simply be allowed to opt out of paying your fair share. It’s right that we all pay a fair share to deliver a better public realm, and that the broadest shoulders carry the greater burden. In government, I’ve put those values into action already, taking on the private school lobby to end tax breaks so we can invest in state education. I’ve been pilloried for it across the rightwing press, but I’ll never back down on that. I’m not afraid to take on vested interests to improve public services. The chancellor sets and makes our policies on taxation, but with a seat at the cabinet table and as deputy leader, I’d be relentlessly focused on pushing for more investment in public services so we can fix the foundations of our society and give everyone the best chance in life. LP: Let’s be honest, we need to tell a much stronger story about fairness and addressing inequalities, and whose side we are on. That must run through everything we do, including the budget. We have an economy in which those with assets and wealth do very well, yet for ordinary working people or those on fixed incomes, life has got harder and harder. Turning that round should be at the core of what this – and any – Labour government is about. That’s why I’ve been clear that the two-child benefit cap needs to be lifted. It’s also why we need to recognise how trust in us has been damaged by mistakes on the winter fuel allowance and proposed cuts to Pip. These measures did not seem fair. We need to give a much clearer sense of whose side we are on – and in whose interests we are governing. It’s not my job to write the budget, but it will be my job to ensure that what we do is connected with the views and experiences of our broad movement and the communities we seek to serve. Norma Spark: Bridget Phillipson cites steps the Labour government has taken or is taking to address tax inequity – all of which I applaud, but I hope Labour can be bolder. Lucy Powell recognises the need for Labour to “tell a better story” and acknowledge the mistakes it has made. This doesn’t address the benefits or pitfalls of a wealth tax. Last year, the G20 leaders agreed to engage cooperatively to ensure high net-worth individuals are effectively taxed. Neil Kinnock advocates an annual wealth tax of 2% on people with wealth of more than £10m. And Gordon Brown is advocating raising tax on the UK gambling industry to lift 500,000 children out of poverty. Though the deputy leader of the Labour party does not set the budget, they do have an important seat at the table. In advocating for options for a wealth tax, both candidates could signal their commitment to a more equitable and fair society and tell a good story! Would you tell Keir Starmer some home truths about policy, about sidelining the north-west – and about his perceived arrogance? Lee Stringfellow , Bury BP: I know this government has made mistakes – I won’t pretend otherwise, but I will promote our achievements. I have fought for policies that are true to Labour values – investing in state education by ending private schools’ tax breaks, reviving Sure Start, rolling out free breakfast clubs. I have argued for policies true to my values, to Labour’s values, and I worked with Angela Rayner doing the same. She challenged us as ministers to always go further for working people, to be impatient for the change they deserve. With my own mandate as deputy leader, I would continue that role. But I absolutely refuse to pit one area of our country against another. It’s the role of the deputy leader to bring all the parts of our party together, from every corner of our country. Last year I campaigned up and down the country to get Labour candidates elected, I’ve not stopped as education secretary and I won’t stop as deputy leader. With local elections and elections in Wales and Scotland around the corner, the role is going to be more important than ever. LP: This isn’t about personalities, it’s about how we use power effectively after 14 years out of government, and we have some achievements to shout about. The problem is they are being drowned out by unforced errors. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a straight talker, unafraid to be an honest voice. I told home truths on welfare, and maybe it wasn’t well received, but it won’t stop me speaking truth to power. But I won’t snipe from the sidelines or take to the airwaves. Discussion isn’t dissent – it’s vital if we’re to rebuild our electoral coalition. I really want this government to succeed. With the mandate of members I would have a strong, independent role, outside but alongside government. It’s a responsibility I would take very seriously and use wisely, but I think it’s self-evident that we can do better. There’s been too much groupthink, disconnected from the voices, talents and experiences of all of our broad movement, which is Labour’s strength. I’ll be that bridge with our members and elected representatives, pushing us all to be the best version of a Labour government we can be. Lee Stringfellow: All Bridget Phillipson has done with her answer is given a response Starmer would want me to hear. She has zero credibility as a serving minister to fight against the wrong decisions and actually listen to members. As for Lucy Powell: what is wrong with a little discord and actually saying what you believe – and indeed, what the party members and voters believe? This government has tied itself in knots with its no-sense fiscal rules and left itself with little room to manoeuvre; and all the while, who suffers? Normal taxpayers. We are heading for electoral oblivion sooner than we think if we do not grasp the nettle this year with some zinger policies that outflank Reform. Powell answered the better of the two – but I suspect Starmer will sideline her. Thanks for your answers, but this longtime Labour voter is now considering the Lib Dems. Why isn’t the government considering rejoining the customs union? What will you do to convince Starmer to see sense? Toby Hannam , Bristol BP: Back in 2016 I argued that Brexit would inflict serious economic damage on areas such as Sunderland. No part of the UK had more at stake than the north-east of England. That’s why I campaigned for remain and was one of the first MPs to call for a second referendum on the details of the deal. But those decisions are in the past – we need to focus on the future. What businesses need most now is certainty to drive economic growth and stability. The progress we have made securing an SPS trade deal with the EU is essential for British businesses, as are the protections secured for British steel. In my own portfolio we’re working on opportunities to once again boost educational exchange through schemes like Erasmus+, but of course there is more to do. I will say that I think we need to change this debate and challenge toxicity. Reform are far too happy to whip up anger about immigration, and I won’t do it. My family came to Britain as immigrants, and our story is shared across this country. I want to campaign and win on Labour values, not use the language of Reform. LP: I voted remain, and worked cross-party during the Brexit years on a proposal called Common Market 2.0, because I felt strongly that we needed to respect the outcome of the referendum, even though it was not what I voted for. One of the main reasons why we ended up with Boris Johnson as prime minister and a hard Brexit, losing so much of the so-called red wall, is because we didn’t listen and accept that a majority voted to leave and wanted Brexit. We shouldn’t reopen old wounds but focus on how we can make that botched Brexit deal better so ordinary people can feel the benefits – whether that’s action on e-gates to ease travel, closer ties on goods to lower food prices, or joint action on defence, security and irregular migration. People voted for Brexit, they voted for Johnson – and they voted for us in 2024 because they want change: more control over their lives and an economy that works for them, not just those at the top. The most important thing now is that we deliver the change people voted for. Toby Hannam: This is very much the party line response. The fact is we are willingly economically harming ourselves with the appalling deal Johnson and David Frost made. This idea that nothing can be done is symptomatic of the utter capitulation Labour have allowed. They’re too frightened to go near the issue due to the howling of the press and Reform – even when the benefits to the country are so clear. The deals that the government have obtained in office are such small beer. Other countries use the customs union and are not in the EU. Personally I would rejoin tomorrow. Without the significant improvement that the customs union could bring, our economy will continue to stumble on anaemically. The massive rebuilding that Labour wants to achieve won’t happen because they need at least another term. Why doesn’t Labour commit to building council houses? Sarah Woods , North Yorkshire BP: Labour’s £39bn social and affordable homes programme aims to deliver 300,000 new homes, 60% of them, or 180,000, for social rent – including new council homes. This is six times more than delivered in the past decade. It’s the biggest increase to social housing in a generation. I grew up in a council house in Washington, Sunderland, raised by a single mother and reliant on free school meals. I know first-hand the importance of council housing. Angela Rayner’s sense of the urgency of this was exceptional – she knew, as I do, that children need secure, warm, dry and safe homes in order to have the childhood and the opportunities all of us deserve. The changes Angela announced to the right to buy scheme – protecting existing social housing stock to meet housing need and delivering a fairer, more sustainable scheme – are essential. Councils will be able to retain 100% of receipts from the sale of right to buy so it can be invested in delivering more social homes. I’ve secured more than £600m to boost construction skills to ensure we have the workers we need to build housing – including introducing new construction technical excellence colleges in each region of the country. LP: We have committed to building more council housing – the biggest such commitment in a generation. Maybe people don’t hear enough about the good things Labour are doing, and that’s something I will seek to put right. The legacy Angela Rayner leaves on housing is a great one. As well as being a colleague and friend, I saw up close what an effective minister she was. More social homes, changes to right to buy so we don’t lose as much stock as we have been doing, a massive housebuilding programme and much more. Having a secure home is the bedrock of everything. In government I led on legislation, and I was proud we included a strengthened renters rights bill in the king’s speech. Sarah Woods: Bridget Phillipson has helpfully provided figures, but this raises further questions. The social and affordable homes programme has a 2035 horizon. Is the intention to build 18,000 council houses a year? According to Shelter England, as of 2023-24, there are 1.33m households on the social housing waiting list. In that year, their figures show a net loss of homes for social rent of 650. I am very glad to hear of the changes to protect existing stock from right to buy, but there will still be a loss through housing stock deterioration. Unfortunately, a considerable “Brexit benefit” was to lose free movement of workers, leaving a hole in construction capacity. It is good to see that Bridget Phillipson has secured funds to boost construction skills. However, this doesn’t deal with the immediate problem. Lucy Powell raises a very valid point on Labour’s messaging. I would like to see clearer messaging – Green party leader Zack Polanski is a breath of fresh air, showing how it’s done. Both candidates agree on the importance of a secure home. My husband and many of my schoolfriends were raised in council housing. The costs to this country from the failure of successive governments to replenish this asset are immense. A Labour government should be building with the rapidity of the 1950s, when 200,000 council houses were built annually. Do the candidates agree that reports that Earth’s carbon sinks are failing should be a turning point for humanity? Sigurdur Bennett , Edinburgh BP: The climate crisis is the biggest challenge facing humanity. I’m proud of the strong climate action this Labour government has taken to bring down emissions, showing leadership on a global stage. The weakening of the global consensus on the urgency of climate action is profoundly troubling, and Labour must continue to show that leadership. This is another example of where I’ll be ensuring we stay true to our values. I want the world of tomorrow to be a world worth living in, not a planet on fire, and the responsibility falls to us to make that happen today. We’re already seeing the effects of global warming – wildfires, failing carbon sinks , flooding. But with decisive action it’s not too late to turn things around. We simply must not let ourselves be blown off course by climate deniers and opponents criticising our vital net zero policies. LP: We have a strong agenda on the environment, and I’m proud to have Ed Miliband’s backing to be the next deputy leader. Ensuring there’s a just transition, tackling the climate crisis and achieving clean power by 2030 is a huge task, but one that Labour is up for. It’s not the job of the deputy leader to write an alternative policy manifesto – we were just elected with a strong programme on climate and nature. As deputy leader I would make sure that Labour is shouting about what we’re doing to improve our environment and motor ahead to net zero – and call out the backwards policies of Reform and the Tories, which would cost jobs and investment and worsen the climate and nature crisis. Sigurdur Bennett: Repeated failure of Earth’s carbon sinks now seems to be a serious possibility, which is frightening. Not that you’d know it from the candidates’ responses. Which might explain why the government may incentivise further North Sea oil drilling. What can you say about such an initiative? Only that it’s insane.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/labour-next-deputy-leader-guardian-readers-debate-candidates,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18fb58e2c2ef78ea0b9d13f50db22de3c0ab58b/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3ffbfe5e9808e6351591b10b93b69e6e",2025-10-11T05:00:18+00:00,ac7243c733be1ce3488a88d65af462b9e24ddcd2
d2390a6c3cd3,English democracy relies on local councillors. So why are so many facing the axe?,,"I t’s extraordinary that a profound reshaping – and shrinking – of our democracy is happening under our noses, and virtually no one notices. For baffling reasons, soon after the general election a government with a sky-high in-tray of problems embarked on a gigantic local council reorganisation no one knew about. It didn’t feature in the manifesto, nor in the local government secretary Steve Reed’s conference speech last week – but England has plans to axe unknown numbers of local councillors – some estimates put it at nearly 90%. The white paper outlining these plans actually boasts that there will be “fewer local politicians”, pandering disgracefully to the general scorn for politics. Yet voters trust councillors twice as much as they do Westminister politicians. For all the talk of localism and connecting to neighbourhoods, these are the unheralded foot soldiers of democracy. It is councillors who run political parties and much that binds their communities . Few people ever join political parties, yet the whole tottering democratic system relies entirely on those who do. Running the council and becoming a councillor is part of party members’ purpose and motivation. Abolishing so many will diminish democratic engagement over time. Many councils will be ordered to merge into unitary councils to serve a population of at least 500,000 , to deliver all local services; this will entail the abolition of hosts of district councils. (There is some “flexibility” for some with populations of fewer than 300,000.) Some won’t go quietly. Some submit alternative plans, grouping together so more of them survive. County councils, the winners from enlargement, strongly support the plan: today they launched a salvo urging the government to plough on and block their ears to the districts’ counter-plans. The budget approaches, a wretched brew of hard choices whichever way the chancellor turns. On all sides the beleaguered government faces bereft public services in need of money. The plight of councils is particularly serious: there is no money for social care’s escalating needs, Send children or the rising numbers being taken into care. There were smirks all round from other parties when Kent council, one of many captured by Reform, had to backtrack on nonsense promises for cutting of waste and taxes in its array of unicorn policies: within months Kent and the others declared defeat, finding few “net zero” and “equality” savings; it is likely to raise council tax by the maximum 5%. Council budgets have dwindled sharply as a proportion of all spending says Prof Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, and now councils’ democratic voice will shrink too. Hoping to save money with fewer councils “rationalised” under larger unitaries means some will be enormous. North Yorkshire will be a three-hour drive across; forget delivery close to home. Is there a perfectly efficient size of council? “No,” says Travers. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.” Will this save money? House of Commons library research finds : “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.” Portsmouth, one of the many towns and cities resisting , protests that its 208,000 population is an adequate size: it already delivers all services well, has no debts, and no wish to be swallowed by Hampshire. Susan Brown, Labour leader of Oxford city council with 166,000 people, is struggling to avoid being eaten by Oxfordshire into a monster council unitary of 750,000. She tells me she’s bidding to enlarge the city’s border to include its green belt, and become a unitary controlling all their services. All these boundaries will be marked out finally next March by the minister. Does anyone care much, when most are clueless about what councils do and few vote in local elections? Well they may sit up and take notice when it dawns on them that Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more ancient towns and cities will be devoured by mega-county councils that feel distant, not local at all. It may dawn on Labour MPs that this is a reverse gerrymander, damaging parties of the left. Many of these lost town councils have been little islands of Liberal Democrat yellow and Labour red, amid deep blue counties, which will now outvote them. Besides, Reform will sweep through quite a lot more next May. Don’t lose these small strongholds. Britain already has fewer elected representatives than European countries of a similar size, says Travers. Cavalier map planners at Westminster never consider how reorganisations cause huge waste of time and effort. Council CEOs complain of time spent on this, amid all their other crises. What to do about contracts when the council may no longer be there? Who wants to absorb Thurrock with its £1bn debt ? Oxfordshire county council just signed an eight-year highways contract : can that be unpicked if Susan Brown of Oxford city gets her way? skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

efbbc07815b4,We all know Brexit’s to blame for the crisis facing UK steel – it’s time for politicians to be honest and reverse it,,"W hile Keir Starmer fiddles in India , Rome burns. The British steel industry now faces a calamity so severe, insiders say it could be “terminal”. The vast majority – 80% – of its exports go to the EU , which this week revealed plans to cut tariff-free steel import quotas by almost half. The remainder will be subject to a 50% tariff. The UK steel industry will be butchered. Thank you, EU. Thank you, Brexit. Whenever I meet politicians who championed Brexit nowadays, I ask them a simple question: do you still think you were right? A few fools mutter, “Yes, on balance” and “In the long term, perhaps.” The honest ones shrug and look uncomfortable. We can all accept that some day a new generation of British politicians will resume open trade across the Channel. It is normal for an island, and makes sense. So I ask the honest ones: why not go public? Make a headline, stand up, apologise and get the ball rolling? None has done so. In May, Starmer timidly negotiated a “Brexit reset” with Brussels. This injected pockets of sanity into increasingly chaotic border controls, especially on food. A few more EU students whom Brexit had crassly restricted may be admitted, along with a new e-gate for passport entry. There must still be checks – they start rolling out from this Sunday – to enforce the rule limiting Britons to no more than 90 out of any 180 days inside the Schengen area . Further resets are mooted in coming years. According to the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, most industries just cannot wait. They are struggling to keep open markets, and if necessary realign themselves with the EU by the back door. The chemicals industry exports more than 60% of its output to the EU. Brexiteers boasted it would be liberated from EU regulation, but setting up the UK’s own regulator cost £2bn and has not worked. According to the Chemical Industries Association, output has fallen by 35-40% since 2021. Between 2021 and 2023, British exports to the EU fell by a serious 27% . Brexiteers boasted that leaving the EU would be worth hundreds of billions a year. Cambridge Econometrics estimates that over the next decade Britain’s economy will be £300bn smaller than if we had not left the EU. This is self-harm on a heroic scale. What matters is how to scramble out of the pit. For most politicians, Brexit was never a policy priority. It was a leadership stunt, conducted with the grain of Britain’s shambolic political climate in the mid-to-late 2010s. Parliament enacted what a majority of members on all sides of the Commons knew was wrong. Worse still, when a soft Brexit was a feasible least-bad option, the Labour party failed to unite with anti-Brexit Tories to retain trading links with Europe. A hugely critical national issue sank into a swamp of parliamentary infighting, on a level approaching that now being repeated in Paris . The excuse was that the public wanted it. There is no such excuse now. Voters have had the courage to look at the facts and admit the mistake. According to YouGov, 61% have concluded that Brexit is a failure. Just 13% now regard it as more of a success. Almost half want another referendum within five years, and 63% oppose loosening ties with the EU any further. That figure should daub every public meeting staged by Nigel Farage. The need is urgent for some coalition of politicians to take the lead and state baldly that Brexit was an error. Of the many failings of parliament, its inability to rise to the occasion above party politics is the most glaring. Britain’s re-entry into some trading relationship with Europe should now be the subject of a crossparty forum or select committee. They should press Starmer towards an urgent and concerted bid to reassociate with the EU. It will not be cheap, but it will be worth it. The leadership of the Tory party may find it hard to get its head round the necessary U-turn. That is tough. Its failure to explain or justify other aspects of its performance in government is already not serving it well. To accuse Starmer last May of “betrayal” and “surrender” over his EU deal was idiotic. There must be Tories who know the truth: honest politicians who follow Keynes’ purported advice and allow circumstances to alter their views. At present, as with anti-Trump Republicans in the US, the question is, when do they have the guts to surface? The public is clearly ready to see Brexit reversed. There cannot be a single industry that would oppose it. The need is for leadership. This should not be a partisan matter, except insofar as it might isolate Farage’s Reform party – and perhaps be his undoing. It should become a consensus. Of course it will not be easy. But it will be right. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

d7609ad3a0d2,I saw desperation at the Tory conference – but all traditional parties may be in this position soon,,"M uch of democratic politics is about getting people’s attention. That’s a particular problem for struggling, less-than-compelling leaders. The further your party falls in the polls, the larger the temptation to launch dramatic, supposedly transformational policies. It’s like speaking more and more loudly to someone who has stopped listening. Thus this week’s Conservative conference in Manchester, with the party at historic lows in the polls, featured a frenzy of policy announcements, on once-successful Tory themes such as tax cuts, law and order, welfare and immigration, that were often made to half-empty rooms. Expanses of blue carpet had been installed in the huge, barn-like convention centre – as if to reassure delegates that the party still had an identity – yet much of the time they were eerily deserted. The Conservatives, famed and feared for their durability, seem to be disappearing before our eyes. Their current crisis, probably their worst ever, is not just one of popularity; but of leadership, political positioning, ideology and credibility. Within a few minutes of arriving at the conference, I overheard two delegates, both suited Tory Boys of the kind that traditionally express total confidence, having a conversation that would become very familiar, away from the fixed grins of the main stage events. “I don’t think the Conservatives are in a position to win,” said one delegate, self-protectively referring to his party in the third person. “They’re in a position to stay alive.” The other interjected: “If you replace her [leader Kemi Badenoch] now, you’re polling at 10%. I think she should resign in 2028. Be a sacrificial lamb.” The other nodded. “We don’t have many [leadership] choices. A lot of good people have lost their seats …” Even more drastic solutions to the crisis are also being considered. According to a new YouGov poll, almost half the Conservatives’ shrinking membership support a merger with Reform UK – the erasure of the Tories as an independent party after almost 200 or almost 350 years, depending on how you define their hazy origins. British Conservatives can be brutally pragmatic, and the defection of their voters, members and politicians to Reform may soon reach a tipping point. “As long as there’s a rightwing party,” another delegate told me who had been a Tory for decades, “I don’t mind which one it is.” Yet frequently in Manchester the Conservative crisis created not equanimity but feverishness. Each new policy or rhetorical trope seemed more rightwing, and often more authoritarian, than the last. Deporting migrants, deregulating business, disciplining schoolchildren, dumping net zero targets, detaining more minor criminals, dismantling the supposedly liberal judiciary: all the favourite preoccupations of modern rightwing populism and much older, free-market Conservatism were recited like articles of faith. Fringe meetings with hard-right themes were better attended than most events in the main hall, with chairs running out and sweat shining on speakers’ foreheads in fuggy rooms. At one gathering, Chris Philp spoke so fast, almost ranting, about the “scourge of illegal migration”, and how “many of those migrants in hotels commit crimes and work illegally”, that he sounded more like a hotel protester than the shadow home secretary. Elsewhere on the fringe, the Tory peer David Frost had an ominous explanation for why their party is radicalising. “A good chunk of the public is probably to the right of where [Nigel] Farage is.” The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, told a fringe event: “Public opinion is shifting very fast right now, on a whole range of issues.” In his speech from the main stage, he put it more melodramatically : “The collapse of the old order is in sight. A new one is coming!” Offstage, his replacement of Badenoch as leader was constantly discussed. Yet the argument that more hard-right policies will revive the Tories, under him or anyone else, is undermined by the fact that Reform, and Tommy Robinson, are already catering to that market. Moreover, Badenoch has already moved the Conservatives sharply rightwards without halting their decline. After years of austerity, acute inequality and growing public anger at the privatised utilities, Reform’s promise to address these issues, however partially and cynically, makes their reactionary populism more in tune with the times than the Tory version, which is still stuck in the 1980s, dreaming of a small state and endlessly dynamic businesses. In the more depopulated zones of this year’s conference, there were sometimes as many cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher as delegates. Badenoch’s speech on Wednesday – her second of the conference, a break with precedent that suggested a desperation to be heard – pledged “a new approach” to Britain’s problems. But it stayed in the traditional Tory comfort zone of promising to liberate individuals and businesses while reining in the state. Even the speech’s supposed big surprise, a vow to abolish stamp duty, had a retro flavour: a tax cut that would most benefit the wealthiest in the old Thatcherite heartlands of southern England. Nothing Badenoch said suggested that she or her party were doing the self-questioning and fresh thinking that their dire position ought to prompt. If you’re not a Conservative, and have suffered from their decades of dominance, it’s tempting simply to relish their difficulties. But the attention-seeking in Manchester this week was just the most extreme and undignified version of a neediness that also afflicts other parties, in an era of tuned-out voters, low election turnouts and political fragmentation. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s cartoonish stunts and Farage’s hyperbolic press conferences, while seemingly more successful as political theatre, are also pleas to voters to notice their parties. Meanwhile Labour’s conference in Liverpool last week, which tried to use attacks on Reform to make the government’s underlying principles more compelling, has so far generated no improvement in the polls . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

4ff1ab93a1f1,Tories and Reform battle to be heirs to Thatcher’s legacy on her centenary,,"It is a glittering annual dinner in honour of the Conservative party’s most successful leader and, on the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher’s birth, one that is bigger than ever. Yet as Tory grandees, celebrity backers and wealthy donors prepare to sit down at a gala dinner at London’s Guildhall on Monday evening, a battle for her legacy is under way between the party she once led and the insurgent threat to its survival, Reform UK. Boris Johnson will make a keynote speech at the event, the Guardian has been told by its backers, joined by the main speaker, Thatcher’s son, Mark, and guests including Joan Collins, Julian Fellowes and Jeffrey Archer. But a notable absentee will be Kemi Badenoch , as the current Tory leader struggles to stave off the threat of extinction looming over the party Thatcher led to three consecutive election wins. “There is a competition as to who is best to carry forward her legacy,” said the event’s main sponsor, Mohamed Amersi, who has donated £500,000 to the Tories in the past but, like other donors, has been backing Nigel Farage’s party more recently. He said: “There’s no doubt that she would have been sympathetic to much of what Reform are saying, though at the end of the day she was still a reluctant remainer.” Amersi said it would “take time but we will find somebody”, adding there was “not a chance in hell” that Badenoch was the answer to the Tories’ challenges. Badenoch is expected to appear instead at an official party fundraiser dinner in Greenwich. She has likened herself to Thatcher, telling Tories at their annual conference that she too was being written off like Thatcher once was. While Thatcher’s face was a constant presence at this year’s Tory conference, party sources say even many on its rightwing pay lip service to her memory while regarding her small-state philosophy as out of kilter with Britain in 2025. “She is very important though when it comes to mobilising donors,” they added. Many of those donors and those who were close to Thatcher are preferring to go to more private dinners. Among those is Sir Rocco Forte, the Brexit-backing hotelier who helped to fund Johnson’s election win and knew Thatcher. He remains tentatively supportive of Badenoch. He said: “I don’t think there really is a standard bearer for [Thatcher] at the moment in politics. I would say the Conservative party itself now is divided between a big faction which I would not even call Conservative and Kemi Badenoch, who I do still think is a serious believer in what Margaret Thatcher advocated.” Tickets for the sold-out Guildhall event ranged in price from £195 for an individual up to £3,000 for a VIP table. While there will also be Tory grandees such as Michael Howard at the dinner this year, they will be joined by Reform UK figures including its deputy leader, Richard Tice. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tice said: “She was always about challenging the status quo, with strong conviction, and in a sense that is Nigel’s philosophy. The key thing is that she was a transformational leader of a country that was in trouble then, as it is now.” Events elsewhere include a dinner at the Carlton Club and an 80s-themed disco that Conservatives are holding on Monday at a location described as an ‘‘iconic central London nightclub”. Organisations that have been putting on events include the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the thinktank Thatcher co-founded and which provided the intellectual stimulus for her policies. Its director, Robert Colvile, said the Tory conference had probably gone “too far” by displaying her dresses in glass boxes. But he insisted that her political echoes remained powerful, pointing to a CPS event that was packed out by delegates. “If you look at the polls, she is consistently viewed as the most effective leader we have had. Her self-appointed mission was to turn around a Britain that was in decline and we are pretty obviously in that situation again now. Even people like Keir Starmer, while disagreeing with her policy, admit that they admire her for bringing change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/tories-reform-uk-battle-heirs-margaret-thatcher-legacy-100th-birthday,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a15d5961b573f74f5ffc8396e485daaa59fd191/921_0_4658_3726/master/4658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c34d340e0be1764e13134c3d5f5bdfc",2025-10-12T14:00:56+00:00,21057734a504112a0daf702bfb112ad9fb6b26f7
d86adcf17b9b,‘Brummies united against racism’: poster campaign takes on the far right,,"W hen Mus unfurled the leaflet lying on her driveway, she was left shocked, angry and upset. “White Britons are already a minority in London … it is clear that if these trends continue white people will become a minority in Britain,” it read. The leaflet, written by a far-right group, was distributed along her street three years ago in Moseley, a leafy suburb of Birmingham . It went on to blame NHS waiting lists, a shortage of social housing and even traffic on “the rising population”. “There we go again, blaming us for everything and causing division,” she thought at the time. But instead of ignoring it, her neighbours came together to figure out a response. “That’s what gave me hope, that people stood together and said ‘not in our names’.” They decided to fight back with their own words by creating a poster with the message: “Brummies united against racism and hate crime”. They were placed in the windows of homes all along the street. “Not long after, a neighbouring street said: ‘Oh, we had those leaflets. Can we have your posters?’” Mus said. Mus was horrified to find far-right propaganda on her doorstep. Photograph: Andrew Fox The campaign continued to grow and last year was endorsed by Birmingham city council. Now it has found renewed salience after a number of alleged hate crimes carried out in the city. Last month a Sikh woman was allegedly raped in a park in Oldbury, in what police are treating as a hate crime. A few weeks later in another park, a 12-year-old boy was allegedly beaten up in what his father described as a racist attack. A man in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of assault. “Operation raise the colours” in which St George’s and union jack flags have been erected across the UK has also caused fear and anxiety. Hope Not Hate and Stand Up to Racism said it had been organised by well-known far-right figures. The Birmingham campaign has been inundated with people who want to show solidarity with people of colour and religious minorities under increasing threat. “People are literally begging us on WhatsApp, can we have a poster?” said Anthony, who lives on the same street as Mus. To meet the demand, a fundraiser has been launched to print out 10,000 posters and distribute them across the city. “Birmingham is a multicultural city and I think it’s important to stand in solidarity with our neighbours, regardless of race, culture or religion,” he said. “Recent events such as flagging and rise of Reform UK are not things I feel comfortable with.” The campaign also hopes to spread beyond the city. According to Mus, activists in Worcester want to mobilise a similar, poster-led initiative. Like Birmingham, the city has recently had a number of racist incidents. Last month, swastikas and the words “no Jew” were painted on garages and on Friday a man and child were sprayed with an unknown substance in an attack described by police as “racially aggravated”. Mus said since the attacks she had avoided visiting parks for fear of being attacked. She is not alone. As a Muslim woman, Raiza* said she felt like a “walking target” in the city. She said her area was full of lamp-posts adorned with the St George’s flag. “I felt quite intimidated by it. I thought, how am I going explain this to my young kids?” One woman felt that Robert Jenrick’s attitude was ‘irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community he is commenting on’. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty She has also stopped taking her children to the park after the alleged assault on the 12-year-old boy. “You don’t know who’s hostile towards you or who’s completely fine. My kids are fourth-generation British, so we’re pretty established here, but I haven’t felt like this in the past.” She feels that politicians have “done nothing to stop this”, adding “if anything, it’s been encouraged”. Earlier this week, comments by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, complaining about visiting an area of Birmingham where he “didn’t see another white face” were revealed by the Guardian. Razia called the comments by Jenrick, who is seen as still harbouring ambitions to become the next leader of the Conservative party, “unhelpful, irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community that he is commenting on”. She has a poster, but she is hesitant to display it in her window for fear of being marked as a target. “We don’t know if we have any allies where we are living,” she said. “I think it’s important for white people to actually stand up and say, ‘no, I’m not having it’, now more than ever,” said Anthony. “If people want to wave flags and be patriotic, I have no problem with that, but the way that it’s being used now is to stir up resentment. It intimidates people, which I don’t think some seem to understand.” It is hoped that the posters will draw lines in the sand to fend off the far right and show solidarity to those feeling under threat. “People are really behind the idea. It doesn’t take a lot of effort to put up a poster in your window,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/12/brummies-united-against-racism-birmingham-poster-campaign-takes-on-the-far-right,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e306031449b36a3a35df4c311a007b7c99b75fef/610_0_5581_4463/master/5581.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=475ab66a4bc66673b680059a39913f66",2025-10-12T06:00:44+00:00,cfdabe3a97aae4eb09275a618211c4e3994209b9
2785e1d33eba,Rachel Reeves v the OBR: chancellor aims to loosen the watchdog’s grip,,"For a crew of 50-odd nerds sharing an uninspiring concrete block in Westminster with the Ministry of Justice, the Office for Budget Responsibility has come to wield extraordinary power. It was the OBR projections of Rachel Reeves’s evaporating headroom that left the chancellor scrambling for welfare cuts in March. And it is the watchdog’s rethink about productivity growth that means the chancellor is sure to deliver a second tax-raising budget on 26 November. The Treasury is determined to avoid being dragged around by the OBR in 2026. And so, as she draws up a revenue-raising package, the chancellor is aiming to accumulate more headroom against her fiscal rules, so that every £1bn shift is less make-or-break; and to downgrade the status of the OBR’s spring forecast. Set up during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, the independent forecaster was meant to prevent politicians from tweaking economic forecasts to suit their own ends. As Labour came to power it embraced the new system, now 15 years old, with Reeves even legislating to prevent future fiscal events taking place without an OBR forecast, as she sought to remind voters of Liz Truss’s catastrophic tenure. Labour saw complying with the the watchdog’s strictures as a crucial signal to investors in government bond markets that the incoming administration had a clear plan for fixing the public finances. Led by the former Treasury and International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Richard Hughes, recently reappointed for a second five-year term, the OBR produces two forecasts a year by law, measuring the chancellor’s tax and spending plans against her fiscal rules . With Reeves’s tricky second budget approaching, it is the OBR’s decision to revisit its long-term assumptions about productivity growth that is causing alarm in No 11. The OBR’s view of this key determinant of economic growth has long looked optimistic relative to the consensus. The resulting reassessment is expected to put forecasts for the public finances in 2030 between £10bn and £30bn adrift of where they appeared to be in March. Reeves and her ministerial colleagues privately grumble that the OBR could and should have reviewed its productivity forecasts earlier. If it had done so while the Conservatives were still in power, Jeremy Hunt’s pre-election cuts to national insurance contributions might have looked unaffordable. Instead, with Labour already struggling in the polls, it will be Reeves who has to explain to the public that the economy is weaker than previously thought – and impose tax increases to make up for the shortfall. Tensions between the OBR and the Treasury have spilled into the open in recent weeks, with Reeves using an interview to call on the forecaster to “score” , that is to say include in its projections, pro-growth government policies. To avoid another spring scramble for savings, Reeves is also considering having the OBR assess her against her rules only once a year. As recommended by the IMF in May , the spring forecast would be indicative rather than binding – perhaps focusing on economic growth rather than the fiscal picture. “The IMF have said that we should move to just one major fiscal event a year, and I agree with their recommendations,” Reeves told Times Radio last week. “To be able to do that, we do need to change the way that the OBR do their forecasting. Two full forecasts a year make it harder to have that one fiscal event.” Hughes has expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for that plan, however – telling MPs at a recent Treasury select committee hearing: “The UK has been doing two economic forecasts and fiscal forecasts a year since 1975 … Were we to reduce the number of forecasts to one, that would make us one of the least fiscally transparent countries in Europe and of any major advanced economy.” Adding that his reading of the IMF’s recommendation was that if the government looked set to miss its fiscal rules in the spring it could “let it ride, and make more policy decisions in the autumn”, Hughes insisted: “The government have that option now, and they always had that option.” With Labour losing support in the polls, some of the party’s backbenchers have expressed concern about what they see as the OBR’s malign influence, with Louise Haigh calling it an “unelected institution” that “dictates the limits of government ambition” . Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England, said: “It’s really about how do you stop this silly dance where the government adjusts long-run plans to short-run moves in bond markets. Forecasts are not a bad thing per se, but it’s the tail wagging the dog.” The leftwing thinktank the New Economics Foundation has called for forecasting to be taken back into the Treasury , with an external Office for Fiscal Transparency acting more as a quality check and the chancellor making the final decision. It argues this would be a more democratic framework. James Meadway, a former economic adviser to John McDonnell and host of the podcast Macrodose, argues that it is impossible to drain the politics out of forecasting. “These aren’t neutral facts at all – they’re hotly contested, just like everything else in economics,” he said. He argues for the OBR to act more like the US Congressional Budget Office, which has a wider role in analysing economic policies, including costing opposition plans, for example. However, Jonathan Portes, a former government economist and now professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, said it was a mistake to lay the blame for the government’s predicament with the OBR. “Are the current rules and the current horizons the right ones? There is no right answer. But the big picture is, that’s not the constraint at the moment – the constraint at the moment is the markets’ view of whether the UK’s position is fiscally sustainable.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/11/rachel-reeves-v-the-obr-chancellor-aims-to-loosen-the-watchdogs-grip,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff33dfa476f52d953898428179b241bf0362054f/529_55_2275_1820/master/2275.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=232c0f68c346a12756cbd95133c8637e",2025-10-11T06:00:17+00:00,55faae680a6d8d737b0dd0ee873d6cedc69f8f24
be9e4c47e93e,Will UK taxpayers get their £122m back from PPE Medpro?,,"The five-year unravelling of Britain’s most high-profile Covid contracts scandal involving a baroness, her husband and multimillion-pound government deals accelerated last week with a high court judgment against the company linked to the former Tory peer Michelle Mone . The judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, ruled that PPE Medpro, owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, supplied defective personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in the NHS during the pandemic. Cockerill ordered that PPE Medpro must return the sum of £122m, which the Department of Health and Social Care paid for the order of 25m sterile surgical gowns, under a contract awarded in June 2020 via the VIP lane. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hailed the judgment as vindication for the Labour government’s stated determination to recover some of the billions of pounds in public money wasted during the Covid crisis by Boris Johnson’s administration. “We want our money back. We are getting our money back,” Reeves posted on X . “And it will go where it belongs – in our schools, NHS and communities.” The June contract, and another worth £80.85m to supply face masks, also paid for by the DHSC, were granted to PPE Medpro after Mone approached the then Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in May 2020. Her offer was processed via the “VIP lane”, the system operated by Johnson’s government, giving priority to politically connected people such as Mone, treating them as more credible than experienced PPE suppliers. For years afterwards, Mone and Barrowman through their former lawyers denied involvement in PPE Medpro, until in late 2023 they acknowledged their roles and Mone admitted they had lied . Michelle Mone first approached the the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, in May 2020 with an offer to supply surgical equipment. Composite: Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock/Indigo/Getty The gowns were rejected on inspection in September 2020 at the NHS warehousing facilities in Daventry, Northamptonshire, because their labels were invalid, and also signalled that they had not been certified as sterile, a life-protecting requirement. Cockerill ordered that the £122m be repaid by 15 October. Yet in this apparent tale of British justice finally restoring taxpayers’ millions paid out for unsafe medical supplies, there is a looming snag. The judgment is not against Barrowman personally, but his company, which has been left with very little money or assets. In fact, on 30 September, the day before Cockerill delivered her judgment, PPE Medpro Ltd was put into insolvency and administrators appointed. So although the company has until Wednesday to repay the £122m, there appears no realistic possibility that it can. In a series of public statements since the judgment, Mone has accused Reeves of inflammatory language after the chancellor jokingly confirmed that the government had “a vendetta” against the couple, and Barrowman has repeatedly said the judgment was wrong, “a white wash [sic] of the facts”. Neither had given any indication that they intended to fund the repayment of the money, until a new statement on Friday evening when their spokesperson said for the first time that the PPE Medpro “consortium” was prepared to discuss “a possible settlement with the government”. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had been paid at least £65m from PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. The couple said in a BBC interview in December 2023 that Barrowman’s children were also beneficiaries of the trust. In a statement on 4 October, Barrowman’s spokesperson hit out at PPE Medpro’s supply-chain companies, saying the administrator could bring legal claims against them. It is difficult to see the basis for this, given that PPE Medpro accepted the gowns five years ago and has always argued they complied with the DHSC contract. Barrowman describes PPE Medpro and its supply-chain companies as a consortium. Barrowman’s spokesperson confirmed PPE Medpro’s profits, saying of the £203m from the DHSC, the company paid £137m to the supply-chain companies to source and buy the PPE, which left a profit of £66m for Barrowman’s company. Of that, according to the spokesperson’s figures, PPE Medpro made a £39m profit on the contract for the gowns that were never used. However, although Barrowman made so much from the PPE Medpro deals, and the couple have over the years owned luxury yachts, a private jet and prestige properties in different locations, there is no clear route to the government recovering even a penny after the judgment. The Guardian asked the couple’s spokesperson this week if Barrowman intended to provide the £122m so that PPE Medpro could repay the DHSC. The spokesperson replied: “We are unable to comment on any matters that relate directly to PPE Medpro Ltd. This is not an attempt to avoid your questions. PPE Medpro is now in administration and only the administrators are able to comment on the company. It is vital to make clear, to avoid any misunderstanding, that the court case and subsequent ruling was against PPE Medpro, NOT Mr Barrowman.” The Guardian asked the spokesperson to clarify if that meant Barrowman and Mone did not intend to fund the return of the £122m, or repay any of the money received from PPE Medpro profits. The spokesperson replied: “This is not what my statement said at all, and is a huge leap and incorrect for you to reach this conclusion. Let me be clear: ‘At no stage have we stated that Mr Barrowman has no intention of making any payment to the DHSC. We have been clear that we cannot answer any questions regarding PPE Medpro.’” Michelle Mone and her husband, Doug Barrowman. Photograph: Jeff Moore/PA Media The spokesperson added: “Furthermore, you include Baroness Mone – why? She received no money from the DHSC contract. Her involvement as an introducer was fully disclosed to the DHSC … so to connect her and suggest she must repay money simply because she is married to Mr Barrowman is both unfair and disingenuous and shows that you have a personal/public agenda against her.” In the new statement sent on Friday evening, Barrowman’s spokesperson said: “The consortium partners of PPE Medpro are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government.” PPE Medpro is now bust – put into administration by Perree Ptc, a private trust company linked to Barrowman registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, which had a mortgage-style charge against the company. Barrowman’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about Perree, or the circumstances in which it had put the company into administration. The whole legal basis for limited companies is to protect the people who have put money in from becoming personally liable for all its debts: to give the owners limited liability. If Barrowman, who described himself in the 2023 BBC interview as the ultimate beneficial owner of PPE Medpro, and who received £65m in profits, does not wish to pay the DHSC, the legal routes to enforcing the judgment appear difficult. There are only narrow circumstances in which an administrator or somebody owed money, the government in this case, can get behind a company’s limited liability – “pierce the corporate veil” in legal terminology – and enforce payment from directors or shareholders. “There is no obvious, easy route to recover money from any individuals behind the company in this case,” Simon Walsh, a commercial litigation partner at SA Law , said. “The circumstances for piercing the corporate veil can include where an administrator proves that transactions have been improper, or fraudulent. This may not apply here and investigating it will inevitably be costly, complex and time-consuming. There is a real risk of a pyrrhic victory for the government in this case.” It appears that any process for seeking repayment of the £122m is separate to the long-running investigation by the National Crime Agency into PPE Medpro and whether Mone and Barrowman may have committed criminal offences, including fraud by false representation , in the procurement of the contracts. The couple deny any criminal wrongdoing. The NCA has confirmed that it began its investigation in May 2021, and in April the following year law enforcement officers raided the couple’s mansion on the Isle of Man and their London home, as well as the PPE Medpro offices. In December 2023, Mone and Barrowman agreed to a freezing order of more than £75m worth of assets, including bank accounts, wealth management accounts and shares held in companies owning luxury properties, after an application by the Crown Prosecution Service under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The NCA has not provided any detailed information about the time it is taking or when the CPS might decide whether there will be any criminal charges. PPE Medpro’s barrister, Charles Samek KC, complained during the high court trial that the NCA investigation was “long-running and seemingly never-ending”, and “hanging … like Damocles’ sword” over the company “without ever seemingly being progressed”. In response to questions about how long it was taking, the NCA has said in a statement: “Investigations must pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. In serious economic crime investigations these lines of inquiry can be incredibly complex. It can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted.” Illustration: Guardian Design Reeves has insisted the government is determined to recover money lost in failed pandemic spending, pointing to the establishment of the Covid counter-fraud commissioner among other initiatives. In the PPE Medpro case, however, it risks having spent more millions for an expert legal team led by Paul Stanley KC to win a hard-fought £122m judgment it cannot enforce. Government sources have not provided any information about what it might do if the money is not paid on Wednesday. The DHSC has declined to expand on the comments of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who said on the day of the judgment: “PPE Medpro must now repay the government and the taxpayer £122m. My department will work closely with PPE Medpro Limited’s administrators to recover everything we can.” Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, a key member of the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition which was a core participant in the Covid public inquiry into the pandemic contracts debacle, said: “There appear to be very few levers the government has available to recover anything close to the £122m the high court has ordered PPE Medpro to repay. The whole case stands as a further indictment of the ‘VIP lane’ and the flawed, wasteful procurement of PPE during the pandemic.” This saga of the Conservative peer, her businessman husband, Johnson’s Tory government and the multimillion-pound Covid contracts has some way to run yet.

5b3062cc6487,Israelis and Palestinians Await Hostage-Prisoner Swap With Relief and Elation,"israel gaza war, palestinians, kidnapping and hostages, israel katz, benjamin netanyahu, abdel fattah el-sisi, donald trump, hamas, egypt, gaza city, gaza strip, israel, jerusalem, sharm el sheikh, internal-open-access-from-nl","Israelis and Palestinians prepared on Sunday for an exchange of all of the living hostages still held in Gaza for about 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, the cornerstone of a new cease-fire agreement. The Israeli government said the exchange was expected to begin on Monday morning local time, but Israel was prepared for it to happen even sooner. Under the agreement, Israel is supposed to free the Palestinian prisoners — scores of them serving life terms for deadly attacks on Israelis — in parallel with the hostage releases. “This is a historic event that blends sorrow over the release of murderers and joy over the return of hostages,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a recorded statement broadcast on Sunday evening. On both sides, there was relief mixed with elation after two devastating years of war. Adding to the hope: The open-ended truce between Israel and Hamas, which was brokered by the United States and Arab mediators and began at noon on Friday, appeared to be holding over the weekend. As part of the first phase of the cease-fire deal , Israeli forces have withdrawn to a new defensive line inside Gaza. The war created a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the deal provides a pathway for desperately needed food, medicine and other supplies, which are starting to flow in. On Sunday, efforts appeared to be underway to increase aid deliveries, with dozens of trucks crossing the border from Egypt, according to news footage. The number of trucks entering Gaza is supposed to double under the cease-fire, to about 600 per day. The United Nations World Food Program said on Saturday that it had begun scaling up its operations in Gaza and that in the coming weeks it planned to increase the number of bakeries it supports to 30 from 10. The war in Gaza killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Most of the two million residents of Gaza were displaced multiple times. With the cease-fire signed, thousands of displaced Palestinian residents have headed back to Gaza City in the north of the territory over the past days. President Trump left the United States on Sunday and land in Israel on Monday for a short visit. He is set to meet with the families of hostages and address the Israeli Knesset, or Parliament, in Jerusalem. He then is scheduled to fly to Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea, where he and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt will lead a summit with other Arab partners who supported the deal. World leaders have also been invited to attend. Unveiling the cease-fire plan late last month, Mr. Trump described the occasion as “potentially one of the great days ever in civilization.” His celebratory declarations about bringing peace to the Middle East may be premature, however. Mr. Netanyahu struck a more sober tone in his own statement on Sunday, speaking in Hebrew to his domestic audience. “Everywhere we fought, we won,” he said. “But in the same breath, I must tell you: The campaign is not over,” Mr. Netanyahu cautioned. “There are still very great security challenges ahead of us. Some of our enemies are trying to rebuild themselves to attack us again. And as we say, ‘We’re on it.’” Analysts say the Gaza cease-fire deal lacks details and leaves many critical questions unanswered, including whether Hamas will be disarmed and stripped of its power in Gaza and how the territory will be governed after the war. Mr. Trump’s road map for ending the war envisions Hamas laying down its weapons and the demilitarization of Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu has long insisted on those steps as conditions for ending the war in Gaza. But Hamas officials have expressed deep reservations about both steps. It is also unclear which, if any, countries were planning to send troops to join an international stabilization force that Mr. Trump had suggested would handle security in postwar Gaza. Adding to the confusion, Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, issued a statement on Sunday saying that the greatest challenge for his country after the hostages’ release would be “the destruction of all of Hamas’s terror tunnels in Gaza.” Mr. Katz said that mission would be carried out directly by Israeli military forces “and by means of the international mechanism that will be established under the leadership and supervision of the United States.” Destroying the tunnels would be the main expression of the demilitarization of Gaza and the dismantling Hamas’s weapons, Mr. Katz said. He said he had “instructed the Israeli military to prepare to carry out the mission.” But Israeli forces have now withdrawn from Gaza City, where much of the Hamas military infrastructure remains intact, according to Israeli leaders, who only recently described the city as one of the militant group’s last bastions. Israeli forces had been taking over the core of Gaza City in a new phase of their campaign aimed at destroying Hamas’s military and governing abilities when the deal stopped them in their tracks. Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli forces cannot return to areas from which they have withdrawn as long as Hamas is seen as complying with the deal. Asked about Mr. Katz’s statement, an Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under army rules, said there were different ways to deal with the demilitarization of Gaza and disarming Hamas. He said that Israeli forces could still operate east of their new line within Gaza, in areas they control, and that the international mechanism was still to be determined. But one commentator warned Israel may have less freedom to resume fighting this time around. “Israel is mistaken in thinking that it will be able to afford either to return to war or to maintain a Lebanese model of frequent attacks,” Yoav Limor, a commentator on military affairs for Israel Hayom, a right-wing daily, wrote Sunday. He was referring to Israel’s frequent military strikes against targets in Lebanon despite a cease-fire reached almost a year ago that was meant to end its war with Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militia. “That will never be tolerated, and judging by Trump’s recent statements, he, too, is determined to move on and has no interest in getting sucked back into Gaza’s problems,” Mr. Limor said. Hamas set off the war in Gaza by leading an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians. It was the deadliest day in the country’s history. Roughly 250 other people were abducted. Scores of hostages were released during two past, temporary cease-fires, and a handful were rescued in military operations. The Israeli government says that 20 hostages are now expected to be freed, and the remains of 26 who died in captivity are to be returned. The condition of two other captives has not been confirmed.

The Lost Chances to Reach a Hostage Deal, and a Cease-Fire, Months Ago","us politics, israel gaza war, war;armed conflicts, peace process, palestinians, hamas, donald trump, benjamin netanyahu, joe biden, steven witkoff, israel, gaza strip, internal-open-access-from-nl","Why now? Why did it take 736 days? That was the question coursing through the celebrations on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday night, as hundreds of thousands of people poured into Hostage Square. They were anticipating the release early Monday of the 20 hostages believed still alive and the possible end of a brutal war that left Gaza destroyed, and Israel at once stronger and more diplomatically isolated than ever. Holding up photos of the remaining hostages, the crowds cheered on Saturday evening at the mention of President Trump, who many Israelis believe forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize this moment. They listened intently to Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, address the cheering throngs. But overarching the moment was the question of whether this deal could have been done far sooner, when more hostages may have been alive, and before tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed. That argument lay behind the boos that ran through the crowd when Mr. Witkoff mentioned Mr. Netanyahu. Hearing the reaction, Mr. Witkoff tried to defend Mr. Netanyahu, insisting that “I was in the trenches with the prime minister” and saw how he was seeking “a safer, stronger future for the Jewish people.” That was met with more booing. Historians may argue for years whether the Israel-Hamas war could have ended a year ago this week, when Israeli forces tripped upon and killed Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. Or, alternatively, whether Israel and Hamas missed a chance to build on the cease-fire that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his aides left in place before Mr. Trump took over. Despite the fact that Mr. Witkoff was involved in the January deal, it did not stick, and early in Mr. Trump’s term the war resumed, bringing with it more death and suffering. Debates over how wars could have ended sooner, and saved thousands or millions of lives, are hardly new. Historians are still arguing over whether Japan would have surrendered anyway if President Harry S. Truman had decided against dropping two atomic weapons; whether President Richard M. Nixon waited years too long to get out of Vietnam. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump argued for an earlier exit from Afghanistan. “This is a different moment — we didn’t have then what President Trump has now,” Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden’s secretary of state, said in a telephone interview over the weekend. “Hamas is defeated as a military organization, isolated diplomatically, it’s lost its patrons — Iran, Hezbollah and the Houthis — and it has alienated the people of Gaza.” He added: “Israel long ago achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas’s capacity to repeat Oct. 7 and killing the leaders responsible — at great cost to Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire. The Israeli people want the remaining hostages home and the war to end.” Here is a look at some of the explanations for why the hostage release — and perhaps a new start for Gaza — is happening now. Feints, Bluffs and an Election Two years ago this week, after the Oct. 7 attack, Mr. Biden traveled to Israel to show his solidarity. But he also issued a warning — strongly in private, his aides reported later, and more gently in public — that there was a risk to overreaction. “Justice must be done,” Mr. Biden said on his one-day visit on Oct. 18, 2023. “But I caution that, while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.” Mr. Biden was reacting to the fact that Israel had already cut off virtually all food and fuel to Gaza. For a while, the United States kept the pressure off the Israelis, even vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution to keep humanitarian corridors open to allow the flow of food and civilians. Mr. Biden would need time, American officials maintained, to quietly negotiate a deal. But neither side was ready. Hamas spent the summer of 2024 arguing over how far Israeli forces would have to pull back along the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip along the border between Gaza and Egypt. “The blame is on Hamas, because it could have been done all these steps earlier, but they refused to discuss disarmament or relinquishing control,” said Amos Yadlin, a former head of military intelligence for Israel who runs MIND Israel, a strategic consulting company. “But it is also on Netanyahu, because it wasn’t until last summer that he was even willing to lay out demands for ending the war.” Then Mr. Trump won the presidency back, and the Biden administration was determined to get a cease-fire in place by January, before it left office. It drafted a peace plan, much of which was quite similar to the “20 point plan” Mr. Trump recently issued. There was slow progress: More than 130 hostages had been released by the time the January cease-fire took place. “We handed over a cease-fire that silenced the guns, had hostages coming out and aid going in, along with a day-after plan to make it permanent,” Mr. Blinken said. But when the new administration took over, “the moment was squandered,” he added. “Israel and Hamas went back to war for eight months.” Israeli officials tell a different story. Mr. Biden was a lame duck, they noted, and disengaged. Trump was a known entity, less likely to lecture Mr. Netanyahu in private or public. They put their money on a new president, and a new negotiating team. A Changed Battlefield in 2025 Much changed in Israel’s favor in the new year. Mr. Sinwar’s death sent Hamas into a leadership crisis. Israel’s military pressure grew as Hamas’ supply of ammunition was depleted. And “the 12-day war with Iran really moved the needle,” said Brett McGurk, who had negotiated in the region since the Bush administration and was running the talks for Mr. Biden. Suddenly, Hamas realized that the country that had both bankrolled and supplied it could no longer be relied upon. Multiple factors, Palestinian analysts say, pushed Hamas to begin rethinking the value of continuing to hold the hostages. “In the beginning, Hamas thought taking the hostages would deter the Israeli government from waging a big war,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian professor of political science in Egypt, who fled Gaza early in the war., Now, the logic of holding hostages may have flipped: Rather than protect Gaza from attack, several analysts have noted, their existence was giving Mr. Netanyahu an excuse to press ahead. “If Hamas said no, the war would have gone on — the bloodshed, the destruction and the killing would have gone on and on,” Mr. Abusada said. “So Hamas decided: Let’s just accept this offer and believe the guarantees that the war will not return.” The Trump Factor Mr. Trump famously has little time or patience for traditional diplomacy. If the State Department’s approach to cease-fires and peace negotiations is to labor over maps and work through diplomatic channels, defining boundaries and anticipating loopholes, Mr. Trump negotiates the way he struck real estate deals in New York: in broad concepts, leaving the details to others . Administration officials say the result suggests that this should be Mr. Trump’s model for the future. “He pursued a very nontraditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it,” Vice President JD Vance said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “And, of course, the president was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it.” Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Netanyahu largely benefited from a changed tone. Mr. Trump has hosted him at the White House four times, more than any other world leader. He has called for the cancellation of the prime minister’s corruption trial, he has opposed calls for the recognition of a Palestinian state, and he has ordered U.S. forces to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. On Gaza, the president put few, if any, guardrails on Israel’s offensive, bucking international demands for a cease-fire. Moreover, to Israel’s delight, the new president wasted weeks consumed with a bizarre plan to annex Gaza, somehow pushing out the Palestinians and building a glistening beach resort, similar to Miami. (Mr. Trump once held a similar fantasy about North Korea, and even made North Korea’s leader a short film, with mock-ups of water parks and luxury condos.) In the case of Gaza, he circulated an AI-created video of a luxury resort city, with images of him and Mr. Netanyahu sipping coffee. The prime minister humored him, praising his vision even while stepping up military pressure. And Mr. Trump signaled the importance of a deal by bringing Mr. Kushner back into the swirl of diplomacy, hoping that his business connections with Qatar and other players in the region could be leveraged to good advantage. It was Mr. Kushner who negotiated the Abraham Accords in the first term, in which Arab states recognized Israel — a huge step. Of course, those connections fuel Mr. Trump’s critics, who see a blurring of diplomacy and for-profit deals. But the Israeli attempt to kill Hamas negotiators in Qatar, dropping a bomb on their temporary residence, both angered Mr. Trump and awakened him . It gave the United States the opportunity to rally Arab states around the 20-point plan, even if they thought many of the details would not work. And so when Mr. Trump called Mr. Netanyahu to the White House in September, following the opening of the U.N. General Assembly, the prime minister was in no position to resist him. He had to call the prime minister of Qatar and read an apology to him — while White House photographers recorded the moment. The message was clear: Mr. Netanyahu was now in a new world, where he had to heed some American mandates. Then Mr. Trump pressed the Israeli leader to sign on to his 20-point plan, with its cease-fire and the insertion of a “technocratic” temporary government in Gaza backed by an international stability force. While it fell short of Mr. Netanyahu’s maximalist demands, he had to agree to the document. He was both indebted to Mr. Trump and aware that provoking his capricious counterpart could lead to negative consequences for himself and for Israel. He may have also been betting that Hamas would reject the deal, because it required the terrorist group to disarm and leave the territory. Hamas said “yes, but,” agreeing to the first terms — the hostage release in return for a prisoner swap — but insisting on more negotiations on the critical next steps. Mr. Trump ignored the “but,” and simply took the partial yes as full agreement. “Trump succeeded in convincing Prime Minister Netanyahu to do what perhaps should have been done right after Israel’s victory over Iran — or even earlier, during the second phase of the January 2025 deal,” Mr. Yadlin wrote on Sunday in The Jerusalem Post. “He grasped what Netanyahu did not: that the war was inflicting immense diplomatic damage and that ‘total victory’ in Gaza was unattainable without killing the hostages, sacrificing soldiers and harming civilians behind whom Hamas hides. He understood the Israeli public mood far better than the government — an overwhelming 80 percent supported bringing the hostages home even at the cost of ending the war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/us/politics/lost-chances-hostage-deal-gaza-israel.html,World,BBC,By David E.

e0f60775e263,A Test Now for Israel: Can It Repair Its Ties to Americans?,"israel gaza war, polls, judaism, benjamin netanyahu, israel, us","The war in Gaza may finally be ending, after two years of bloodshed and destruction. But among the damage that has been done is a series of devastating blows to Israel’s relationship with the citizens of its most important and most stalwart ally, the United States. Israel’s reputation in the United States is in tatters, and not only on college campuses or among progressives. For the first time since it began asking Americans about their sympathies in 1998, a New York Times poll last month found that slightly more voters sided with the Palestinians than with Israelis. American Jews, long Israel’s strongest domestic backers, have turned sharply critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Gaza conflict. A majority believe Israel has committed war crimes as it has killed tens of thousands of civilians and restricted food aid, and four in 10 believe it is guilty of genocide, a new Washington Post survey found — a charge Israel denies. The shift has created new incentives for even moderate Democrats in Congress to get tough on Israel , including by curtailing U.S. military aid. The damage is also increasingly bipartisan. Despite Republican efforts to identify their party with Israel and to tag Democrats as providing aid and comfort to its enemies, younger evangelical Christians are breaking with their parents on the issue, seeing Israel as an oppressor rather than as a victim. And the breakup extends beyond evangelicals. “Everybody under 30 is against Israel,” the conservative commentator Megyn Kelly offhandedly told Tucker Carlson on his podcast last month. The question is whether those younger Americans will be lost to Israel long-term — and what Israel’s advocates will do to try to reverse that. Shibley Telhami, a pollster and scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the University of Maryland, argues that it’s too late. “We now have a paradigmatic Gaza generation like we had a Vietnam generation and a Pearl Harbor generation,” he said. “There’s this growing sense among people that what they’re witnessing is genocide in real time, amplified by new media, which we didn’t have in Vietnam. It’s a new generation where Israel is seen as a villain. And I don’t think that’s likely to go away.” Yossi Klein Halevi, an American-born Israeli writer, said he was struck on a recent campus tour in the United States not so much by the rhetoric of the anti-Zionist activists he met, but by the degree to which they appeared to be influencing their apolitical peers. “They’re absorbing this toxic idea that there’s something basically illegitimate about a Jewish state,” Mr. Halevi said. “That’s my concern: this general perception that Israel has a bad odor attached to it.” Others argue that an end to the fighting, and to the horrific images from Gaza that have flooded social-media feeds for two years, could allow American boosters of Israel to regain their footing. “I do think there would be a bit of a reset in the way Israel is viewed,” said Halie Soifer, chief executive of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. “There is room for a bounce-back,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an American-born Israeli pollster who is a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “People tend to overestimate how bad the damage has been. Just stopping the slaughter will allow some people to go back to their comfort zone of being supportive.” What undergirds that more sanguine view is a belief that the foundation of the U.S.-Israeli relationship remains solid. That is most persuasive when it comes to shared national interests, like the deep, mutually beneficial collaborations between the two countries’ intelligence communities, militaries and technology sectors — collaborations that may be more visible to government officials than to the public at large. “We’re an asset in the great-power competition against China. We’re at the core of American interests in the Middle East,” said Avner Golov, a former official on Israel’s National Security Council who tracks the Israeli-American relationship for MIND Israel, a Tel Aviv think tank. “When my grandfather came here, he only wanted a safe haven for the Jews,” Mr. Golov added. “He never dreamt that Israeli technology would be able to play a significant role in shaping the world order and preserving U.S. superiority over its adversaries.” It is less clear, however, that the two countries, which long shared similar aspirations — to be a promised land for the persecuted, to be a gleaming city on a hill and an example for other nations — can count on those ideals as a basis for continued close ties. Mr. Halevi, a fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, said such aims were now up for debate in both countries, riven as they are by political polarization. On one side, he said, is the liberal Israeli story of the post-Holocaust creation of a Jewish state that “struggled for liberal values under constant pressure.” That story, “which is my story,” Mr. Halevi said, appeals to Democrats. Then there is the Israeli government’s story, of Israel as America’s “bulwark against the Muslim world,” Mr. Halevi said, “which resonates for the American right.” “It’s hard to base a relationship between the two countries on shared values,” he said, “when neither country can agree within itself on its own values.” Elections in Israel in the coming year could change things, experts say — not only if Mr. Netanyahu is voted out, but also if a new government reflects the country’s broad middle ground. Mr. Golov said that the polls portended a rejection of political extremes. He also suggested that Israel’s democracy had much to commend it, even in comparison with America’s at the moment, given the way that popular protests in Israel had pressured Mr. Netanyahu and encouraged Mr. Trump to end the war. “It’s a success story of an Israeli public that on one hand is sending its children to Gaza, and on the other hand is protesting every week,” he said. “And nobody shot anyone,” he noted pointedly. “If these protests will succeed, and I think they will,” Mr. Golov added, “nobody will be able to say that Israeli society lost its liberal nature. I think it regained it.” However difficult it may be to repair the relationship and to win over Americans who have turned against Israel over the war, experts agree that Israel will have little choice but to try, because of the degree to which Mr. Netanyahu has allowed Israel to become isolated internationally. “Israel has no hedging strategy,” said Ted Sasson, a professor at Middlebury College and a fellow at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. “It absolutely needs the U.S. It has nowhere else to turn. It’s firmly committed to that alliance, and it’s going to have to work harder to persuade Congress and a future American president to provide the kind of support that Biden and Trump have provided.” Eventually, an end to the war should mean an end to the worldwide focus on Israel’s conduct of it, said Ted Deutch, president of the American Jewish Committee. He said he eagerly awaited a point at which “the humanitarian situation gets better and the hostages are released, and Arab countries are investing in the future of Gaza.” Then, he said, “the conversation can be about what’s next, about what the region can look like, what Gaza can look like.” “I’m more hopeful today than I have been for hundreds of days,” said William Daroff, chief executive of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, an umbrella lobbying group. Others are less optimistic. Mort Klein, who leads the right-wing Zionist Organization of America, said he feared that the war had poisoned attitudes toward Israel almost irretrievably. “It’s become Jew-hatred,” he said. “I don’t know how that is resolved.” What seems indisputable is that the stakes for Israel, and for its advocates in the United States, are enormously high. Mr. Telhami, the University of Maryland professor, said that Israel’s dependence on U.S. support had become so glaring over the course of the war — in political, military and economic terms — that Israel would be motivated to treat its possible defeat in the court of American public opinion as an “existential threat.” “The game for maintaining the support for Israel is priority No. 1,” he said, adding, “Because the battle in America for Israel is perceived as part of the battle for Israel itself.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/middleeast/israel-us-polls-support.html,World,BBC,By David M.

Mr. Orban’s strength, reinforced by a sprawling propaganda machine geared to the destruction of his opponents, has seen off would-be rivals on both the left and the right in four consecutive elections. Now for the first time, however, he is struggling to land a knockout blow on his enemies. His most potent current rival, Peter Magyar, a former loyalist who heads a surging opposition movement , has in recent months been savaged by media controlled by Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party as an abusive husband, a traitor, a crook and a sex pest. The nonstop vilification — described by Mr. Magyar as a “tsunami of lies” — has been surprising in only one respect: It has not worked. “Until now, these campaigns are not a success. That is clear,” said Agoston Mraz, a Fidesz supporter whose Nezöpont Institute does polling for the government. Most opinion polls , though not Nezöpont’s, give Mr. Magyar’s upstart party, Tisza, a wide lead over Fidesz before a general election in the spring.

a2a9fb25e728,Overnight Violence Between Afghanistan and Pakistan Threatens a Wider Conflict,"international relations, war;armed conflicts, taliban, pakistani taliban, shehbaz sharif, afghanistan, pakistan, internal-open-access-from-nl","Tensions along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan surged on Sunday after a deadly overnight clash between the countries’ militaries, with both sides exchanging heavy fire in one of the sharpest escalations of violence between the neighbors in years. Afghan officials said on Sunday that their security forces had targeted Pakistani military outposts along the border in what they described as “retaliatory operations,” following what Kabul said were Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan last week. At least 23 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 29 others were injured on Saturday, according to Pakistan’s military. The Taliban government said nine Afghan soldiers had died and at least 16 others had been injured. The overnight fighting raised concerns that the violence could spill into a broader conflict between the two countries, whose governments have gradually grown hostile to each other since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan in 2021. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman, told reporters on Sunday that the fighting had stopped at midnight after Qatar and Saudi Arabia urged restraint. He warned Pakistan that any violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty would prompt retaliation. The Afghan attack overnight included heavy fire and raids within Pakistan, the Pakistani military said in a statement on Sunday. It said it responded with heavy artillery, airstrikes and raids within Afghanistan. Both sides also claimed dozens of victims, but none of their claims could be independently verified because access to the border region remains severely restricted. The Afghan offensive was a response to attacks on Wednesday in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and at a market near the border, which the Taliban government blamed on Pakistan. Pakistan said on Friday that it had conducted “a series of retribution operations” against Pakistani militants, but it did not mention Afghanistan directly. Nor did Pakistan claim responsibility for the explosions on Thursday in Kabul and at the border market. Without addressing the specifics of the most recent violence, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan on Sunday praised his country’s armed forces for what he described as a “strong and effective response” to recent Afghan provocations along the border, saying the military had “destroyed several of their border posts, forcing a retreat.” The militaries of both nations have frequently clashed along their shared border, a nearly 1,600-mile-long line that snakes along mountainous areas. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Taliban government of providing a haven to the banned group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the T.T.P. or Pakistani Taliban , whose attacks have killed hundreds of Pakistani security forces in recent years. It has also accused its archnemesis, India, of supporting the T.T.P. The T.T.P. leadership has received financial support from the Afghan government, and its militants have trained freely in Afghanistan, according to Pakistani military officials and independent and United Nations experts. The Taliban in Afghanistan deny backing the Pakistani group. The Afghan and Pakistani governments have tried to mend the relationship in recent years, despite sporadic clashes and ongoing points of diplomatic tension. The countries’ top diplomats met in August with their Chinese counterpart, but Pakistan has not recognized the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate authority. Still, there are close ties between both nations. Pakistan is Afghanistan’s top export partner, and it hosts millions of Afghans who fled insecurity and unemployment over the past decades. Major border crossings between the two countries have been closed since the overnight clashes, according to Pakistani and Afghan officials. In recent months, tens of thousands of Afghans living in Pakistan have crossed back into Afghanistan amid a wave of expulsions ordered by the Pakistani government. The clash on Saturday only lasted for a few hours, possibly because both countries may be wary of escalating tensions further, said Adam Weinstein, a Afghanistan and Pakistan analyst at the Quincy Institute, a research center in Washington. “Pakistan doesn’t yet want to engage in some kind of regime change, but the Taliban know that they would be outgunned by the Pakistanis if they pushed the fighting further,” Mr. Weinstein said. Pakistan can carry out airstrikes across most of Afghanistan, but the Taliban are more limited to cross-border artillery and the potential use of the T.T.P. militants to add pressure inside Pakistan, he added. On Saturday, the T.T.P. claimed responsibility for a series of attacks across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a Pakistani province bordering Afghanistan, that killed several security personnel and civilians, including in a bombing near a police training facility. Residents in border districts on both sides said in telephone interviews that they witnessed intense overnight clashes that raged for several hours. “The fighting went on for hours without pause,” said Shabbir Khan, a resident of Kurram, a Pakistani border district, describing the sound of heavy weapons echoing through the mountains. Aziz Sayar, a resident of the Sawkai district in Afghanistan’s Kunar Province, near the border of Pakistan, said the gunfire began around 9 p.m. and continued for over three hours. “Our children screamed in fear as bullets echoed through the night,” he said.

As the national teams from Norway and Israel prepared to take the field on Saturday night, Norwegian fans raised a Palestinian tricolor flag and a banner that read “Let Children Live.” Moments later, as Israel’s players lined up and their national anthem played, some in the home crowd booed and whistled. The scene and a pregame protest march by about 1,500 people were examples of how the world’s most popular sport has become a venue for demonstrations against Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza. They are likely to persist even after a cease-fire took hold that mediators hoped would lead to the end of the two-year war. Israeli soccer officials expected more protests at the team’s next World Cup qualifier in Udine, in northern Italy, on Tuesday. “It is our reality today,” Israel’s goalkeeper Daniel Peretz said after conceding all the goals in a chastening 5-0 defeat for his team. From a soccer standpoint, the match was high-profile.

93b95d54ab0c,"Israel and Hamas Were Not Ready for a Comprehensive Peace Deal, Mediator Says","international relations, israel gaza war, us foreign policy, peace process, kidnapping and hostages, arms control, prisoner of war, palestinians, hamas, emmanuel macron, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, gaza strip, israel, qatar, paris france","The mediators who helped reach the Gaza cease-fire deal decided to delay talks on more difficult issues, such as Hamas’s arsenal, because the warring parties were not ready for a comprehensive agreement, Qatar’s prime minister said in an interview. The prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, was one of the central mediators in efforts to end the war in Gaza, and the Qataris have maintained close contacts with Hamas’s leadership for years. He spoke to The New York Times soon after Israel and Hamas agreed to halt hostilities in Gaza and exchange all the remaining hostages in the territory for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The deal left some of the thorniest issues in the conflict for a later stage, including the future of Hamas’s weapons and how Gaza would be governed after the end of the war. “If we went for full-package negotiations, we wouldn’t have reached these results,” Sheikh Mohammed said on Friday in Paris. He spoke after a meeting there with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Arab and European foreign ministers about postwar Gaza. Sheikh Mohammed said Hamas had expressed a willingness to talk about a different kind of relationship with Israel. “Hamas are actually open to have a discussion about how they won’t pose a threat for Israel,” the prime minister said. Hamas officials, the Israeli prime minister’s office and the Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hamas has said in the past that it was willing to agree to a long-term truce with Israel. In March, Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas’s chief negotiator, told American officials in Qatar that the group was open to a five- to 10-year truce, in which the group would lay down its weapons. More recently, Hamas has maintained publicly that it is opposed to disarmament. It has suggested convening a Palestinian national dialogue about the future of Gaza, including on the fate of its arms. Hamas has been significantly weakened by the war with Israel, and there are splits within the group on important questions about its future direction. Some leaders and members want Hamas to refuse to give up its weapons, even if that comes at the price of renewed war and the deaths of more Palestinians. Others say the group needs to be more pragmatic on weapons and other matters. By giving up the remaining hostages in Gaza, Hamas traded away significant leverage with Israel with no certainty that it would achieve all its goals in return. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has consistently said Hamas must be disarmed before the Gaza war can permanently end. Hamas has long regarded that demand as tantamount to surrender and views armed struggle as a legitimate form of resistance against Israeli control over Palestinian lands. Mr. Netanyahu vowed this month that Hamas would be disarmed and Gaza would be demilitarized, either through diplomacy or by force. “Either it will be achieved the easy way, or it will be achieved the hard way,” he said. “But it will be achieved.” Some Arab mediators have said they believe that they can persuade Hamas to partially disarm as long as President Trump guarantees Israel will not restart the war. Sheikh Mohammed said one question that needed to be addressed was who Hamas would hand over its weapons to. He said there was a marked difference between Hamas giving its weapons to a Palestinian authority and the group giving them to another entity. It is still not clear when negotiations about the outstanding disputes between Israel and Hamas will begin. President Trump’s road map for ending the war in Gaza calls for the establishment of a temporary international stabilization force. Sheikh Mohammed said the next step should be to talk about the formation of such a force, which he views as connected to Hamas’s disarmament and further withdrawals of Israeli troops from Gaza. As the force takes control, the Israeli military should withdraw based on agreed-upon “standards, milestones and time frames linked to demilitarization,” the U.S. plan says. The stabilization force should also train Palestinian police officers and help secure border zones, according to the plan.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-peace-deal.html,World,BBC,By Adam Rasgon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12israel-hamas-top-tjqp/12israel-hamas-top-tjqp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T16:15:32+00:00,4e051034e544ef89b65bf57847eceff2cb6c35b6
f317785f7103,Bangladesh Detains Army Officers Accused of Crimes Under Previous Regime,"bangladesh, hasina wazed;sheikh hasina, human rights, military, appointments and executive changes, police brutality;police misconduct;police shootings, internal-open-access-from-nl","Bangladesh’s army said it had taken into custody more than a dozen of its officers accused of serious crimes committed under Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year rule ended last year amid widespread protests . The move, announced by the military on Saturday, is a rare instance of large-scale detentions of military officers since Ms. Hasina’s ouster and flight. The detentions came days after the country’s International Crimes Tribunal, an expedited civilian court set up to prosecute major crimes, issued arrest warrants for 32 people, including Ms. Hasina; her military secretary, Maj. Gen. Kabir Ahmed; and current and former security officers. The charges against them include abduction, torture and enforced disappearances, as well as unleashing brutal force against protesters that left more than 1,400 dead. It is the latest of several arrest warrants issued against Ms. Hasina since she was forced out in August 2024, fleeing the country as angry crowds converged on her residence . But she is unlikely to face trial anytime soon. India, where she is now, has not responded to calls for her extradition. Bangladesh, led by the interim leader Muhammad Yunus , has struggled with its transition from authoritarian rule, as divisive political jockeying heats up ahead of elections scheduled for February 2026. Members of Ms. Hasina’s political party have accused the interim government of political score-settling. The tribunal issuing the warrants, which despite its name is a domestic court, also has a troubled past, having been used by Ms. Hasina to target opponents. Maj. Gen. Md Hakimuzzaman, a spokesman for the military, said at a news conference on Saturday that at least 14 serving officers and one who was starting retirement were in army custody as part of the “legal process.” Many of the others named in the arrest warrants have either fled the country or gone into hiding. Those detained are expected to face hearings at the tribunal on Oct. 22, which will determine whether they are freed on bail or face police arrest. Some analysts interpreted the army’s announcement that the officers were in its “custody” as a way of protecting its turf, or of evading the usual process of arrest by the police. Comments by Mohammad Tajul Islam, the special court’s chief, added to the uncertainty about the detentions. He told reporters on Sunday that the legal process requires a person who is arrested to be produced before a court within 24 hours. “Since no one has officially informed us through documentary procedure that the person has been detained, we are not taking into account what has appeared in the media,” he said. General Hakimuzzaman said the officers with arrest warrants were not on army duty at the time of the crimes they were charged with, but had been dispatched to other forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, which served more directly under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. “Despite this fact, they are now in our custody because they are members of the army,” General Hakimuzzaman said. During Ms. Hasina’s increasingly authoritarian rule, the police and military were accused of killing, torturing and disappearing political opponents and other dissenters. The military intelligence, in which General Ahmed served, and many units of police and counterterrorism forces ran detention centers that became known as Aynaghar, or “the House of Mirrors.” There, hundreds of people were shut out of sight in underground military detention centers, often for years on end. Pushed to the edge of insanity and death, some have spoken out since Ms. Hasina’s ouster to tell of the horrors they endured. “Those who committed the crimes must face trial,” Mr. Islam, the chief of the special court, said on Thursday, when the warrants were issued. “They stood against the law, the Constitution and the uniform while holding the position of responsibility and drawing salaries from the taxpayers’ money.” Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/asia/bangladesh-arrests-hasina-crimes.html,World,BBC,By Saif Hasnat,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12int-bangladesh-arrests-01-mgwk/12int-bangladesh-arrests-01-mgwk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T15:38:40+00:00,ea28ab2704382cbe927251c944b2cebe66ed2ba2

Could Mexico’s Cartels Be Next?,"us foreign policy, mexico, drug cartel, military, drug abuse, claudia sheinbaum, donald trump, marco rubio, caribbean, latin america, venezuela, sinaloa cartel","As President Trump has blown up one boat after another off Venezuela’s coast and declared an “ armed conflict ” against drug cartels, a question with stark consequences has arisen much closer to the United States. Could Mexico, where far more drugs are made by some of the world’s most powerful criminal groups, be next? “I would be honored to go in and do it,” Mr. Trump said in May , about using U.S. forces to hunt cartel members. “The cartels are trying to destroy our country. They’re evil.” Yet three senior Mexican officials said in interviews that, although they are watching the U.S. military action with caution, Mexico is not worried — for now. That is because, they said, the cooperation between the countries has become simply too robust and yielded too many results on migration and drugs for them to imagine the Trump administration jeopardizing it by conducting unilateral military strikes. Their assessments were reinforced by two Trump administration officials who emphasized collaboration between the countries. But perhaps more surprisingly, these views were shared by several members of a top cartel who said they were unafraid of American intervention. They were more focused on an ongoing conflict within their ranks, they said. So far, the U.S. government says it has targeted only boats leaving Venezuela, a country ruled by an autocratic government that Washington has long wanted gone. Mexico, the largest U.S. trading partner, presents a far different case. Any U.S. intervention would have major diplomatic, economic and political consequences, given Mexico’s red line over impeding on its sovereignty. The Mexican officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomacy, have top jobs in areas spanning foreign affairs and security. They said that they have gotten little sense from their U.S. counterparts that Mexico is in the cross hairs. Still, that experts are asking the question at all says much about how far the Trump administration has shifted U.S. relations with Latin America. And many American and Mexican political and security analysts cautioned that Mexico was hardly out of the woods, given Mr. Trump’s approach to the cartels as targets of war and the reality that the biggest and most powerful cartels are just south of the border. One of the Mexican officials stressed that while the government did not see unilateral American strikes inside Mexico as an immediate threat, the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean posed a long-term concern. In Washington, American officials have sounded similar notes about prioritizing collaboration. Two Trump administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said that because of the two nations’ increased cooperation, the United States is focused on working with Mexico rather than making unilateral strikes on criminals. The Trump administration believes its threats against Mexico have caused it to step up against cartels, one official said, eliminating the need for U.S. forces to get involved, at least for now. Another official said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Mexico last month reaffirmed the sense that the countries were aligned on security. Mr. Rubio met with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico on Sept. 3, the day after Mr. Trump first announced that U.S. forces had struck a boat in the Caribbean. In comments to reporters, Mr. Rubio had harsh words about smugglers from Venezuela. “We’re not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise ship,” he said. Stopping boats and seizing cargo does not stop smugglers, he added. “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” But on Mexico, he mostly offered praise. “It is the closest security cooperation we have ever had,” he said. After the meeting, the two nations put out a joint statement about security cooperation , noting it was based on “respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,” as well as “mutual trust.” At the top of the Mexican government, Ms. Sheinbaum has repeatedly drawn a line in the sand over U.S. military intervention. “Under no circumstances will the people of Mexico accept interventions that violate our territory,” she said at a rally in Mexico City on Sunday. “Whether by land, water, sea or air.” Strikingly, Ms. Sheinbaum’s firm public stance against U.S. interventions has reassured one of the very criminal networks she and Mr. Trump have vowed to dismantle: the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the world’s most notorious criminal organizations and potentially a larger supplier of drugs than all Venezuelan smugglers combined. In interviews, five cartel operatives dismissed the idea that the U.S. military could strike within Mexico next. Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, they said their more pressing concern was the relentless fighting among rival criminal factions. Most were only vaguely aware of the recent American attacks in the Caribbean. One cartel member, a 39-year-old midlevel operative who oversees security operations in Culiacán, the group’s stronghold, said that he had little fear of U.S. intervention because he believed Ms. Sheinbaum would not allow it. “It will never happen,” he said. “He can’t do that,” he added of Mr. Trump. Even if the United States did strike their smugglers at sea, he said, disruption would be minimal. “We don’t only have maritime routes, we have land and air as well,” he said. “There is always a way.” In addition to fighting each other, Mexico’s criminal groups are also under heightened pressure from the Mexican government. In Ms. Sheinbaum’s first year in office, which ended Sept. 30, Mexican authorities said they arrested nearly 35,000 people for high-impact crimes and destroyed nearly 1,600 drug labs. Under her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, there were an average of 8,900 such arrests annually and 380 destroyed labs, they said. Mexican authorities also say they have seized 3.8 million fentanyl pills, a statistic not tracked consistently under Mr. López Obrador. As a result, the Mexican government said, homicides have dropped by almost a third, to their lowest level in a decade, and fewer drugs are being seized at the border. The Mexican government has also increased efforts on migration, helping to bring illegal border crossings to their lowest level in years. One of the senior Mexican officials said that there is daily cooperation between U.S. and Mexican authorities on cartels, including regular U.S. surveillance flights over Mexican territory. But U.S. authorities do not — and will not — use force in Mexico, in part because the Mexican Constitution bans it, the official said. There is another, nearly $1 trillion reason why many believe the United States will not strike Mexico: The nations are deeply interdependent, with about $950 billion in goods and services flowing between them each year. Disrupting such trade could potentially cause economic devastation in border states of both countries, and drive migrants to seek work inside the United States. At the same time, analysts warned that Mexico may be placing too much faith in diplomacy with a notoriously mercurial U.S. president. “Sheinbaum acts, delivers and gives, but it’s never enough for the U.S.,” said David Mora, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. “The problem is the volatility and unpredictability of the Trump administration.” On the ground, attitudes are more complex. At least three national surveys this year have found that more than 60 percent of Mexicans opposed the idea of the U.S. conducting military operations in Mexico. One poll also showed that 31 percent of Mexicans welcomed the idea. In parts of Sinaloa, where bloodshed has become part of daily life, some conservative and business groups would embrace U.S. strikes, said Adrián López, editor of El Noroeste, the state’s largest newspaper. Businesses there have suffered enormous losses because of the cartel wars, and many Mexicans perceive the United States as more effective in combating organized crime, he said, making “the logic of U.S. intervention is appealing.” “People here say, ‘If that makes the violence stop,’” he said. “‘Where do I sign?’” “But,” he added, “we should be careful what we wish for.” Annie Correal, Miriam Castillo and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.

22d2fbba49ca,Social Media Restrictions and 2-Day Internet Shutdown Rattle Afghanistan,"social media, communications and media blackouts, women and girls, computers and the internet, tech industry, censorship, taliban, afghanistan","Airports and banks were forced to shut down. Government employees idled aimlessly in the corridors of their ministries. Teenage girls, barred from attending school, lost much of their access to the outside world. In shutting down the internet and cellphone services across Afghanistan last month, the Taliban government turned the clock back decades, in a move reminiscent of their first time in power from 1996 to 2001. Connectivity came back after two days, but this week, the Afghan government blocked certain types of content on social media apps like Instagram and Facebook, signaling that it would only tolerate tightly controlled access to the internet. Over the four years since they returned to power, the Taliban have gradually strengthened their grip on Afghan society, at times prohibiting content creators from posting on YouTube in one province, or forbidding television channels from broadcasting images of living beings in another. But the internet blackout and the suspension of cellphone services hit the entire country at the same time last month, leaving many Afghans worried that it could go on indefinitely, or happen again even after service was restored. “We are always at home, so the internet was our only way to tell other people that we are alive,” said Mahsa, 19, who was in the middle of a math lesson with a U.S.-sponsored online education program when the blackout began. (The New York Times agreed to identify her by only her first name because she feared backlash by the government.) Because the Taliban have banned education for girls after sixth grade, online education has been the only avenue for female students like Mahsa to pursue their studies. Afghan officials have not communicated publicly about the shutdown, and spokesmen from multiple government agencies have not responded to requests for comment. But officials outside the country and analysts have said the internet shutdown was the result of an order by Afghanistan’s leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has sought to restrict internet access to prevent “immoral acts.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Evidence Suggests Otherwise.,"arson, nepal, politics, forensic science, civil unrest, nepali congress party, unified communist party of nepal maoist","Many of Nepal’s trappings of state went up in smoke in a single afternoon. On Sept. 9, coordinated arson attacks across the Himalayan nation destroyed hundreds of government buildings, from a storied palace and top courts to grand ministries and humble ward offices. Hundreds of other properties were targeted, too, including businesses and schools connected to the political elite, as well as homes of current and retired politicians. The widespread arson followed the fatal shootings the day before of 19 anti-corruption protesters by security forces in Kathmandu, the capital. The prevailing narrative is that mobs of young protesters sought retribution, setting fires as their outrage over the killings flared. But a New York Times investigation — based on dozens of interviews with witnesses, participants and arson experts; a review of photos and videos from the havoc; and visits by The Times to the wreckage sites — reveals new details that cast doubt on the idea that such a tightly coordinated nationwide campaign of destruction could have been an entirely spontaneous response to the deaths the day before. A few hours after the shootings on Sept. 8, “ready-to-use lists” began surfacing online with the private details of members of society accused of being part of Nepal’s graft and patronage network. The next afternoon, most of these people’s residences began to burn. Nepal’s executive, legislative and judicial branches were also consumed by fire.

Calls to the Beihai police rang unanswered on Sunday. Ms. Jin said her family had not been able to reach her father but that they had heard from other church members, some of whom were released after their initial detentions, that he was being accused of illegal dissemination of religious information.

8a6748c2c07a,Bolivia Pushes to Reclaim the Coca Leaf From the Stigma of Cocaine,"bolivia, coca, regulation and deregulation, indigenous peoples, agriculture, drug abuse, cocaine and crack, evo morales","For decades, coca has been treated as contraband, the raw material for cocaine. The police rip out plants across the Andes, and Washington has poured billions into eradication campaigns. And yet here in Bolivia, where growing, selling and consuming coca is legal, a government communications officer steadied a tripod in the tiny Andean town of San José de Pery one afternoon, filming a farmer as he prepared the soil for coca. “I’m going to explain how to use this tool called a wallhua,” said the farmer, Jaime Mamani, 64, lifting a three-pronged rake. “There — you’ve just planted the seedling.” To many, coca exists solely as the basis of cocaine, a plant harvested, mixed with chemicals, altered in covert labs and trafficked across the globe. But in its natural form it is something else entirely: a mild stimulant chewed, brewed and revered in Andean communities for millennia. In fact, coca is such an integral part of the small, landlocked South American nation of Bolivia that its government is leading a campaign to press the United Nations to remove the leaf from the world’s list of most dangerous drugs. The U.N. classifies coca alongside fentanyl and heroin as “highly addictive and liable to abuse.” The United States has long opposed any changes, warning it would make it easier to expand cocaine production. In Colombia, the world’s largest cocaine producer, Washington has spent billions on eradication and counternarcotics operations — even as output continues rising. The results of a formal U.N. review are expected by March. Removing the coca leaf from the dangerous-drug list would free countries that have signed a U.N. convention on drugs from their requirement to criminalize coca. (Bolivia has been exempted from that rule.) Downgrading coca to a less restrictive category could still open the way for legal trade, scientific research and industrial development. But it is far from certain the United Nations will make any changes at all. Proponents argue that the leaf itself is not inherently harmful, and that equating it with cocaine criminalizes a cornerstone of Andean Indigenous heritage. A draft report by the World Health Organization, the U.N.’s public health agency, concluded that coca had very low potential for dependence and posed no major health risks. Still, some vendors in Bolivia sell coca leaves mixed with stimulants like caffeine called “reloaded coca,” and local journalists have documented potential health risks of these unregistered products. Bolivia’s efforts to change the coca leaf’s legal status may be affected by the runoff presidential election on Oct. 19. That contest is between two conservative candidates, and it is unclear whether either would champion coca as strongly as the leftist governments that have ruled for two decades. Farmers in designated zones cultivate coca in Bolivia to sell in state-run markets. Cocaine is produced in Bolivia, but its output ranks behind Colombia and Peru; much of the country’s coca is grown for traditional, legal use. And coca is everywhere in Bolivia: slipped into tea bags in upscale hotels, sold from street kiosks in flavors like orange and watermelon, chewed by drivers on long hauls, even placed in bowls on government officials’ desks. That ubiquity is relatively recent. The push to rip up crops that had sustained Indigenous communities for centuries as part of the U.S.-led war on drugs bred resentment and political mobilization, helping to propel the rise of Evo Morales, a coca growers’ union leader who in 2006 became Bolivia’s first Indigenous president. Mr. Morales made the plant central to his agenda. Under the banner of “ Coca Yes, Cocaine No, ” his government promoted traditional and modern uses, including coca tea, flour, toothpaste and other products, while still pledging to combat cocaine trafficking. His government enshrined coca as part of the nation’s cultural heritage in the 2009 Constitution, underscoring Indigenous identity and resistance to foreign drug policies. In 2012, Bolivia withdrew from the United Nations’ agreement on drugs, but it rejoined the following year after the U.N. granted an exemption allowing coca use within Bolivia’s borders. Bolivia passed a law in 2017 regulating cultivation, trade and consumption, formalizing a legal domestic market. “When I was a child, it was very frowned upon,” said Omar Pintones, 36, a coordinator for the government agency that oversees the coca industry. “Coca leaf consumption was for lower-class people. So there was often that element of shame.” Today, he added, “many professionals, lawyers, doctors, people at universities, people in all walks of life,” use coca leaves. In San José de Pery, a five-hour drive from the capital of La Paz, residents are proud of their coca work. Farmers rise as early as 3 a.m., tending plants that take three to four months to mature. Harvested leaves are dried, bundled and sold to distributors who supply retailers across Bolivia. The government sets a limit of roughly 54,000 acres nationwide for the legal cultivation of coca to help keep prices high for local farmers. The industry generates direct and indirect employment for tens of thousands of families. Luis Arce, who succeeded Mr. Morales as president in 2020, has taken Bolivia’s case to remove coca from the list of the most perilous drugs to the World Health Organization. An agency spokesman said its assessment would balance “the harms versus potential benefits” of the coca leaf, while also determining how easily it can be turned into cocaine. The Vice Ministry of Coca and Integral Development, a uniquely Bolivian institution, oversees the country’s coca industry. Bolivians in traditional Indigenous clothing routinely fill its hallways to renew their coca licenses. Mr. Pintones, who works for the ministry, said he and many of its employees come from coca-growing families and pushed to legalize coca. “I have eaten, grown, dressed, studied, and supported my family thanks to the coca leaf,” he said. “I consume coca leaves daily here at work and in my daily life. And I have never gone crazy or lost consciousness.” The ministry is collaborating with companies experimenting with new products — coca soda, ice cream, ointments, syrups and soaps — as well as with universities to study the leaf. Studies suggest coca may help increase alertness and lower blood pressure. Research has also pointed to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that could help fight infection. If the United Nations decides to loosen restrictions on the coca leaf, and other nations move to decriminalize, that could open a market for global trade in coca products. “Coca leaves have generated many jobs in Bolivia,” Mateo Mamani, Bolivia’s vice minister of coca, said in an interview, and being able to export the coca leaf would “generate good income for the state.” Researchers in Bolivia are conducting more studies on coca derivatives and their potential health benefits. “That’s what we want the world to understand,” Mr. Mamani said. “Yes it is used for illicit purposes, but if we look at the coca leaf in a positive light, we can get a lot out of it.” In Colombia and Peru, traditional coca use is also constitutionally protected, but it is not as ubiquitous as in Bolivia. Supporters of removing coca leaf from the U.N.’s list say separating traditional use from cocaine trafficking is feasible because tightly regulated legal markets could be closely monitored. U.S. officials argue that even if the leaf itself is relatively harmless, it is still the raw material for cocaine, and recognizing or legalizing coca internationally could weaken efforts to suppress cultivation and make enforcement harder. The Trump administration has cited cocaine trafficking to justify its attacks on boats officials say leave Venezuela bound for the United States. But even if an international coca market were to open, some critics said they worry that the greatest profits would be reaped by large corporations, and the windfall would not trickle down to Indigenous communities. Sdenka Silva, a Bolivian sociologist who has worked with coca farmers, founded the Museum of Coca, a small building nestled among backpacker hostels in central La Paz that educates visitors about the plant’s 8,000-year history among Indigenous communities. When cocaine was legal in many countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, she said, colonial powers like the Dutch cultivated coca in what is now Indonesia at a lower cost than elsewhere, undercutting the industries in Peru and Bolivia. “I’m afraid that something like that will happen with big companies,” she said. But coca’s champions are hopeful. “This should not be political,” Mr. Arce, the outgoing president, who is not seeking re-election, said in an interview. “The coca leaf is not a narcotic.’’",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/americas/bolivia-coca-plant-leaf-cocaine.html,World,BBC,By Genevieve Glatsky and Sara Wayra,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/world/11int-bolivia-coca-promo/11int-bolivia-coca-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T07:00:20+00:00,ec4a0035fafb7cb789443e02e34502007f25be3c

The men died in a “painful traffic accident” in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Qatar’s embassy in Cairo said in a statement early Sunday morning, without specifying when the crash occurred. The three were staff members in the Qatari royal court and died “while performing their work,” the embassy said. It named the men as Saud bin Thamer Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family; Abdullah Ghanem al-Khiyarain; and Hassan Jaber al-Jaber. Two other men were injured, the embassy added. Qatar has been a key mediator in efforts to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, the militant group in Gaza. Last week, negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh led to a breakthrough , with the two sides agreeing to the first phase of Mr. Trump’s peace proposal to end the two-year-old war in Gaza. On Monday, a summit in support of Mr. Trump’s peace proposal is to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh. Mr. Trump and Mr. el-Sisi will preside over the gathering, according to a statement from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other world leaders also are expected to attend, including President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/middleeast/qatar-egypt-crash-sharm-el-sheikh.html,World,BBC,By Vivian Nereim,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12int-qatar-crash-1-tplw/12int-qatar-crash-1-tplw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:10:23+00:00,9c3fd694122248673edd513b745c5fa4f190da02
0c482d499a3b,China’s High Ambitions for Clean Energy,"tibet, energy industry, renewable energy, wind power, solar energy, electric power, israel, kidnapping and hostages","High energy This summer, I got a good look at China’s clean-energy future, more than 3,000 meters above sea level in Tibet. Solar panels stretch to the horizon and cover an area seven times the size of Manhattan. (They soak up sunlight that is much brighter than at sea level because the air is so thin.) Wind turbines dot nearby ridgelines, capturing night breezes. Hydropower dams sit where rivers spill down long chasms at the edges of the plateau. And high-voltage power lines carry this electricity to businesses and homes more than 1,500 kilometers away. The intention is to harness the region’s bright sunshine, cold temperatures and sky-touching altitude to power the plateau and beyond, including data centers used in China’s A.I. development. While China still burns as much coal as the rest of the world combined, last month President Xi Jinping promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and expand renewable energy by sixfold in the coming years. A big part of that effort is in sparsely inhabited Qinghai, a province in western China in a region known among the Tibetans as Amdo. I came as part of a government-organized media tour of clean-energy sites in Qinghai, which usually bars foreign journalists to hide dissent by its large ethnic Tibetan population. (The Times paid for my travel.) Today, I’ll tell you what I saw. China is not the first country to experiment with high-altitude clean energy. But other places — in Switzerland and Chile, for instance — are mountainous and steep. Qinghai, slightly bigger than France, is mostly flat. That’s perfect for solar panels and the roads needed to bring them in. And the cold air improves the panels’ efficiency. The ones in Qinghai could run every household in Chicago. And China is building more, including panels at 5,000 meters. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Qantas said in a statement that cybercriminals stole 5.7 million of its customer records by targeting a call center that used a third-party customer service platform. Qantas said it was one of a number of companies around the world that were targeted in the attack. Qantas did not say how many of the records had been released. It also did not name the third-party platform or say which other companies had been targeted. The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the stolen records were limited to names, email addresses and frequent-flyer details, Qantas said in the statement. A smaller portion covered customers’ business or home addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, genders or meal preferences. Qantas said no further intrusions had occurred and that it was cooperating with Australian security agencies. The company also said it had obtained a court injunction to prevent the stolen data from being “accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published.” Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert in Australia, said that the leak appeared to be the first stemming from the July attack. The authorities investigating that attack have not disclosed which other firms were affected or how extensive the campaign may have been. Mr. Hunt said the court injunction was unlikely to have much impact, noting similar orders that had been issued and ignored in Australia and Britain. He said such orders essentially just ask criminals not to publish stolen data. “It’s completely useless,” Mr. Hunt said in an interview. Cyberattackers have exposed the personal data of millions of Australians by striking companies in telecommunications, health care and aviation. In 2022, the telecommunications company Optus disclosed a breach that compromised information for nearly 9.8 million customers, including names, birth dates, and identification numbers, the company said at the time. At the time, the breach was the largest in Australian history. The same year, Medibank Private reported that hacker s had accessed data from about 9.7 million policyholders, including medical claim details. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has begun civil penalty proceedings against Medibank. In 2024, the federal government announced that MediSecure, a provider of electronic prescription services, had sustained a cyberattack that affected about 13 million people, according to Australia’s Department of Home Affairs. Businesses and government agencies in Australia reported 1,113 data breaches in 2024, the highest since mandatory reporting began in 2018, according to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. That marked an about 25 percent increase from 893 breaches reported the previous year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/australia/australia-qantas-airlines-cyber-attack.html,World,BBC,By Mark Walker,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13xp-Qantas-1-bcqh/13xp-Qantas-1-bcqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T10:30:02+00:00,32b42acb261f412343eaf5a4f9dae46b49de7400
0b68de7d612f,Will the World’s Oldest President Win Another Term?,"paul biya, cameroon, president of the united states, election, voter fraud;electoral fraud, generation z;gen z, internal-open-access-from-nl","Paul Biya, the world’s oldest president, is seeking to extend his 42-year rule of Cameroon. Voters in Cameroon, in Central Africa, will go to the polls on Sunday. Absent from the ballot is Maurice Kamto, Mr. Biya’s main opponent, who was barred from running by the country’s electoral board. Analysts said the vote would be the most consequential in the country’s recent history. Living conditions have plummeted as the prices of fuel and other basic goods have increased. Mr. Biya, 92, promised that if re-elected, he would fix the economy, take on youth unemployment and address poverty. “I will never resign myself to the current situation,” he said at a rally on Tuesday. “Certainly, much has already been done. But I can assure you that the best is still to come.” But his tight grip on power may be waning. An unexpectedly spirited opposition led by former allies and young voters has taken root in recent months, inspired by a wave of Gen Z uprisings in Africa and around the world. What’s the state of the race? Mr. Kamto was barred from the ballot after the electoral commission controversially delayed a parliamentary election until next year. That decision left Mr. Kamto’s party with no seats, making him ineligible to run for president. He tried to run under a different party, but the commission rejected him. Mr. Biya appeared to be on course for another easy victory until Issa Tchiroma Bakary, his former spokesman and minister of employment, resigned from the government in June and began his own campaign. Mr. Bakary comes from the north, a traditional stronghold for Mr. Biya that represents a huge segment of the electorate. Bello Bouba Maigari, who was in charge of tourism until recently, is also running for president. Mr. Biya is still widely seen as the favorite. His supporters say his age is not an issue, though he would be 99 years old by the end of his next seven-year term. Chuo Walters, a lawyer and professor at the University of Bertoua who favors Mr. Biya, said the president “can think a thousand times faster than a 25- or 30-year-old.” Most analysts say elections in Cameroon are rigged in favor of keeping Mr. Biya in power. “The institutions are designed to ensure he wins,” said Hubert Kinkoh, a political and security analyst. Opponents accuse Mr. Biya of using his authority to intimidate the opposition and to control the courts and electoral commission. The youth vote Critics say Mr. Biya’s age and lack of a clear succession plan have created a leadership vacuum, gutted the economy and galvanized young people into political activism. “Young people here see Gen Z revolutions in countries like Kenya,” said Ngala Desmond Ngala, a Cameroonian youth activist. “They’re looking at what’s happening in these countries and looking at theirs and are saying, ‘Why can’t we even lead something like that in Cameroon?’” Last month, the president’s 27-year-old daughter, Brenda Biya, told young people on social media, “Don’t vote for my dad,” accusing him of making “too many people suffer.” She has since walked back her statement and apologized. “The average Cameroonian sits between the ages of around 17 to almost 40,” Mr. Ngala said. “The president has been in power for 40-plus years. So there’s a generational disconnect between the president and the young people.” “You could feel that, for the first time, change of government is possible through the ballots,” Mr. Kinkoh said, “because there is a whole new generation of voters who are more critical and are not swayed by party affiliations.” What’s at stake? Roughly one in every four Cameroonians is at risk of slipping into extreme poverty in the next 15 months, according to the World Bank. In several parts of the country, attacks by separatists and insurgents are frequent. Cameroon has two official languages, French and English, but the English-speaking western regions along the border with Nigeria have been trapped in a decade-old separatist conflict. When Mr. Bakary held a campaign rally in the town of Bamenda in Cameroon’s northwest region, he promised to release separatist fighters if elected. In the far north, where Mr. Biya had his only political rally during the campaign, violence has also ramped up as Boko Haram, a jihadist group with origins in Nigeria, kills and kidnaps civilians. Election details Polls will open at 8 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 12, and close at 6 p.m. It can take up to 15 days to declare a winner.

723aa09b8df6,Fears of a Coup Rise in Madagascar as Army Unit Joins Protesters,"politics, civil unrest, military, coups d'etat, madagascar, andry rajoelina, internal-open-access-from-nl","A unit in the Madagascar military broke from the government on Saturday and joined protesters who have been calling for the president’s resignation, raising fears of a coup attempt on the island nation off the coast of southern Africa. The developments represented a major escalation in tensions after weeks of chaotic, youth-led demonstrations that have threatened President Andry Rajoelina’s grip on power. After rumors spread that Mr. Rajoelina may have left the country, he sought to quell any suggestion that he would be forced from power. Mr. Rajoelina’s whereabouts is not publicly known, but his office released a statement Saturday night saying that he and the prime minister were “fully in control of the nation’s affairs.” In an address, the prime minister, who was appointed less than a week ago, called for calm and dialogue. “It is unthinkable for the armed forces to shoot at each other,” said the prime minister, Gen. Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, after reports that the breakaway army unit had been fired upon by law enforcement. The protests, which began over the government’s failure to provide reliable electricity and water, have exploded into an uprising over broader grievances, including corruption, bad governance and poor quality of life. Local media and videos circulating on social media showed violent clashes between protesters and security forces in the capital, Antananarivo, on Saturday. Security forces have frequently fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators over the past two weeks. Nearly two dozen people have lost their lives, according to the United Nations, a figure that Madagascar’s government disputes. In response to the demonstrations, Mr. Rajoelina fired his prime minister and entire cabinet, saying that he had heard the suffering of his people and that he would build a better government. But that move did little to pacify the demonstrators, who said that the president was the one who needed to go. Mr. Rajoelina has since said that if he is not able to improve his country’s fortunes in a year, he will resign. Saturday’s unrest began after members of an army administrative unit known as CAPSAT posted an address online, in which they called for all security forces to “refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers, our sisters.” They said that the country’s leaders were using them and other police and army members to inflict violence on citizens in order to protect those in power. They called on all security forces to leave their posts and disobey their superiors. “We, as military personnel, are no longer fulfilling our role,” a member of the unit said in the address, surrounded by his comrades. “We have become bootlickers. We have chosen to submit and execute orders, even illegal ones, instead of protecting the population and their property.” Members of the unit rolled into Antananarivo on Saturday to join the protesters at a symbolically significant square in the middle of town. This same unit was instrumental in helping Mr. Rajoelina come to power when he executed a coup in 2009. Even though he first attained power by overthrowing the government, Mr. Rajoelina is now warning against a similar move, saying the country cannot afford to be destabilized. About three-fourths of the Madagascar’s 32 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank . Extreme weather has strained agricultural production, one of the country’s main economic drivers. And there are fears that President Trump’s tariffs could hurt exports of vanilla and other commodities that the island is heavily reliant on.

The paramilitary group, called the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., has for months tightened its siege of El Fasher, a city in the western region of Darfur that has become one of the worst battlegrounds of a two-year civil war between the R.S.F. and Sudan’s military. About 260,000 civilians are trapped in an ever-smaller space within the city, struggling with hunger, disease and mass displacement. In addition to the dozens killed at the shelter, around 43 were wounded, according to Suleman, a senior doctor at the nearby Al Saudi hospital, who asked to be identified by one name to protect his family from reprisals. He visited the site of the attack early on Saturday. Footage from the scene of the shelter, collected by locals and shared by Suleman, showed bloodied bodies, rubble and buildings with caved-in roofs. The shelter, called the Dar al-Arqam displacement center, is on the grounds of a university campus. It was struck as people were asleep in classrooms that had been converted into temporary shelters, while others were in underground bunkers, Suleman said.

Thank you, Trump!” the crowds filling the Tel Aviv plaza known as Hostages Square chanted in English as Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy, spoke from the podium, flanked by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s daughter and son-in-law. Mr. Witkoff spoke emotionally about the families of the hostages, saying their courage had affected him in ways he had never been before. “I dreamed of this night,” he said, alluding to the cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that he and Mr. Kushner helped negotiate , and that provides for the release of the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners by Monday. “I only wish the president was here,” Mr. Witkoff added in his address, which was broadcast live on Israeli television. “He would love this.” Israelis have rallied in the thousands on Saturday nights for most of the past two years, demanding that all the captives still held in Gaza be brought back “Now!” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

4b790e21f4b3,‘Over the Clouds’: Families of Palestinian Prisoners Await Their Release,"amnesties commutations and pardons, israel gaza war, palestinians, prison, terrorism, kidnapping and hostages, peace process, hamas, gaza strip, west bank, israel","Fuad Kamamji described the moment he saw his son’s name on a list of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel as one of “rare happiness.” “We have been accepting God’s fate in the worst conditions,” Mr. Kamamji said. “We were content with all the difficult things that came our way. But now, we are feeling a joy we haven’t known in a long time.” His son, Eham Kamamji, 39, was arrested in 2006 and has been serving a life sentence since his conviction for the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli settler, Eliyahu Asheri. He has been in solitary confinement since 2021, when he was among six Palestinians who temporarily escaped from Israel’s Gilboa Prison in what Israeli officials said was the largest Palestinian jailbreak in more than two decades . On Friday, Israel released a list of prisoners to be freed as part of the cease-fire deal that it reached with Hamas. Under the agreement, the Palestinian militant group will free the remaining 48 hostages it holds, of which Israel believes 20 are still alive. Israel will release about 250 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom are serving life sentences, and 1,700 Gazans who were detained during the war and were not involved in the attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, according to a government resolution released on Friday. Most of those who are serving life sentences did not deny the accusations when they were convicted, and said they were acting as resistance fighters. While Eham Kamamji was on the list of prisoners set to be freed, it indicated that he would be sent into exile, rather than being permitted to return home to Jenin, in the West Bank. Fuad Kamamji said he was holding off from celebrating because his son had been mentioned in prior swap deals that never materialized. “But what I’m feeling now is a strong sense of relief and peace,” he said. “I believe my son will be out, whether among us or in exile. The important thing is that he’ll be free.” Across the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians with imprisoned relatives have been absorbing the news of who would be released, who would be exiled, and who would remain behind bars — namely, prisoners whose release Israel sees as intolerable. One of those Israel has refused to free is Hassan Salama, 54, a senior Hamas figure. He was sentenced to more than 40 life terms in prison for orchestrating suicide bombings in 1996 that killed dozens of Israelis and wounded hundreds, after Israel’s assassination of the militant group’s well-known bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash. Ghufran Zamel, 42, became engaged to Mr. Salama 16 years ago, when he was already behind bars. Last year, she emigrated to Turkey. Ms. Zamel said she feared that Hamas’s release of all the Israeli hostages, ending any leverage it holds, “would mean a death sentence” to any Palestinian prisoner not on Israel’s release list. For many of the families of the Israeli victims of the attacks, however, the news that the perpetrators would be freed stirred complicated emotions. Renana Meir, whose mother, Dafna, was stabbed to death outside her home in the West Bank settlement of Otniel in 2016, wrote in an Israeli newspaper on Friday that the imminent release of her mother’s killer would pose a threat to Israelis everywhere. Still, she believed that her mother would have been in favor of their release in exchange for the return of Israeli hostages. “I know you would have done this without thinking twice, if it were up to you,” she wrote. More than half of the prisoners to be released by Israel are to be sent into exile, according to the list, but it was unclear where they would be sent. That includes Basem Khandaqji, a Palestinian writer who was sentenced to three life terms for his involvement in the Carmel Market suicide bombing in 2004, which killed three Israelis and wounded dozens more. While in prison, Mr. Khandaqji has published poetry collections and several novels, including the acclaimed “ A Mask, the Color of the Sky,” which won the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2024 . His sister, Amani Khandaqji, said she felt “over the clouds” about his possible release. “He could be deported,” she said, “but at least he will be free.” Sara Salem, a resident of Jericho, in the West Bank, was waiting for the release of her husband, Ahmad Kaabnah, a veteran Fatah member, who has been behind bars for 28 of his 54 years, after being convicted of killing two Israeli settlers. She said she had barely slept since the deal was announced. “I couldn’t even open the TV to see if the cease-fire had come into effect or not because it was all eating me up inside,” she said. Ms. Salem was pregnant with their second child when Mr. Kaabnah was arrested. They had a third later through in vitro fertilization, with sperm smuggled out of prison. Today, Mr. Kaabnah has five grandchildren, with a sixth on the way. He has not been allowed to meet with anyone, including his family, since before the war in Gaza, Ms. Salem said. She said she hoped Mr. Kaabnah “would return to us,” but he, too, is slated for exile once he is freed. Still, his potential release has her racked with tension, Ms. Salem said. “We are sitting like on fire,” she said, “and waiting for the news to tell us our Ahmad will be free.” Johnatan Reiss contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/palestinian-prisoners-release-families.html,World,BBC,By Fatima AbdulKarim,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/world/11int-palestinian-prisoners-01-afif/11int-palestinian-prisoners-01-afif-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T12:30:36+00:00,8d53f7d78cf5171550bc72e0fa72884631d1cb1f

There, they found a computer unconnected to a network — and much harder to access by Israeli operations spying on Hamas communications. The computer held an image of a six-page memo, handwritten in Arabic, that the Israeli intelligence community believes was by his brother Yahya Sinwar, who as the powerful leader of Hamas in Gaza helped plot the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Dated Aug. 24, 2022, it appears to be a directive from Mr. Sinwar with instructions for the assault, according to seven Israeli officials. The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, calls for fighters to target soldiers and civilian communities — as well as to broadcast the violent acts so as to evoke fear in Israelis and destabilize the country. Commanders then issued similar instructions on Oct. 7, according to hours of previously unreported communications between commanders and subordinates intercepted by Israel during the assault and shared with The Times. The Israeli officials say the memo shows that Mr. Sinwar wanted his fighters to target civilians from the outset, contradicting what the group’s leadership has publicly claimed. Although the memo does not explicitly mention plans to kidnap or kill civilians, it lays out orders for fighters to enter residential neighborhoods and set them on fire “with gasoline or diesel from a tanker.” “Two or three operations, in which an entire neighborhood, kibbutz, or something similar will be burned, must be prepared,” the memo said. In an echo to the memo, just before 10 a.m. on Oct. 7, a commander from a Gaza City battalion referred to as Abu Muhammed told subordinates: “Start setting homes on fire.” “Burn, burn,” he said, according to the intercepts. “I want the whole kibbutz to be in flames.” “Set fire to anything,” a commander in the northern Gaza city of Jabaliya referred to as Abu al-Abed said around the same time. The memo and the intercepts broaden the understanding of Hamas’s planning and execution of the Oct. 7 attack, much of which is based on other documents and recordings collected by Israel during the war. Israel and Hamas have now agreed to a cease-fire, with the militant group’s future in Gaza uncertain. Sima Ankona, who formerly served as a document examination expert in the Israeli police, said the handwriting in the memo matches other examples from Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024. Ms. Ankona, at the request of The Times, compared the document with samples that Israeli authorities had collected, including those captured by the military in Gaza, a note Mr. Sinwar wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018, and his signature on a statement to the Israeli police in 1989. (He was convicted later that year of killing four Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.) The Times translated the memo. Several words and phrases in it appear in other Hamas documents previously reviewed by The Times. Izzat al-Rishq, the Qatar-based director of Hamas’s media office, did not respond to a list of detailed questions, including whether Hamas’s leadership outside Gaza was aware of the memo and the orders that commanders gave militants on Oct. 7. Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian analyst close to Hamas, cast doubt on the authenticity of the memo, asserting that most of the acts described in the document did not occur in the Oct. 7 assault, such as the burning of entire neighborhoods. (Many homes were set on fire in the course of the attacks.) He added that the memo did not represent the culture of Hamas’s military wing. The intercepts were collected on the day of the attack by 8200, the Israeli military’s signals intelligence unit, according to three Israeli security officials, who shared them with The Times. The Times reviewed and translated hours of the intercepted recordings, which included communications in Arabic among commanders and eight groups of fighters. The memo and the intercepts, said several Israeli officials, have been studied by Israel to deepen their understanding of Hamas’s attack. The Gazit Institute, a think tank affiliated with the Israeli military intelligence directorate, prepared a confidential report on the materials, saying that the “Hamas leadership planned and carried out an attack that featured acts of ‘extraordinary brutality.’” “Its aim was to cause great turmoil in the country and the military,” said the report, which was reviewed by The Times. The security lapses revealed in the Oct. 7 attack, including Israel’s failure to find such documents ahead of time and its disregard of other warnings, have prompted a broad examination by the Israeli intelligence community. The attack, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, shattered Israeli’s sense of security. The Israeli officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. During the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas and its allies killed some 1,200 people and abducted about 250 others to Gaza. Israel, in response, unleashed its full military might in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of its residents, and reduced cities to rubble. Israel has been condemned internationally for its conduct in the war and faced accusations of war crimes from human rights groups. It has been accused by a United Nations commission of committing genocide, which the Israeli government has denied. In May 2024, Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, accused Yahya Sinwar and two other senior Hamas officials of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including “extermination” and “murder.” The crimes were committed as a part of “a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Israel by Hamas and other armed groups,” Mr. Khan said when he announced the charges. Under international law, armies and armed groups must not deliberately target civilians or inflict disproportionate harm on them to achieve military goals. In particular, killing and taking as hostages those who are uninvolved in hostilities are serious violations of the Geneva Conventions. The handwritten memo and intercepts offer a more granular look at the group’s thinking and its actions in real time. The memo outlined a plan for a surprise attack on Israel, calling for bulldozers to make openings in the fence separating Gaza and Israel, and multiple waves of attackers. It expressed hope that the acts would have high shock value. “Stomp on the heads of soldiers,” it said. It listed “opening fire on soldiers at point-blank range, slaughtering some of them with knives, blowing up tanks.” Commanders echoed similar instructions on the day of the attack, according to the intercepts. “Slit their throats,” a commander from a battalion in northern Gaza told his team. “Slit them as you are trained.” Roughly 300 soldiers were killed in the Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli authorities. The intercepts captured Hamas combatants broadly calling for violence and taking captives. When a militant asked if he should confront people on the road, a commander from a Jabaliya battalion referred to as Abu Muath responded in the affirmative: “Kill everyone on the road,” he said. “Kill everyone you encounter.” “Now we are at the beginning of the kibbutz,” said one combatant. “We have wiped out those in it. There are settlers whom we killed.” “Guys, take a lot of hostages,” said the commander, Abu Muath, according to the intercepts. “Take a lot of hostages.” The group’s actions, the memo said, should be broadcast to the Arab world to mobilize people outside Gaza to join the fight. The plan envisioned that Palestinians in the West Bank, Arabs in Israel and “our nation” — either a reference to Arabs or Muslims or both — would “respond positively to calls for them to join the revolution.” “It needs to be affirmed to the unit commanders to undertake these actions intentionally, film them and broadcast images of them as fast as possible,” the memo said. The minutes of Hamas’s secret meetings in the run-up to the Oct. 7 attack also show how Mr. Sinwar was determined to persuade Hamas’s allies, Iran and Hezbollah, to join in the assault, or commit to a broader fight with Israel. In the Oct. 7 intercepts, Hamas commanders can be heard urging combatants to film their actions to likewise encourage others to join the fight. “Document the scenes of horror, now, and broadcast them on TV channels to the whole world,” a commander from Gaza City called Abu al-Baraa told operatives in the area of Kibbutz Sa’ad. “Slaughter them. End the children of Israel.” Abu Muath, the commander, said, “It is essential that you bring the drone in so it films for the entire Islamic world.” Hamas officials also made public statements on the day of the attack, encouraging people outside Gaza to participate in the battle, though they ultimately failed to incite a popular uprising. The Israeli military “won’t be able to attend to confrontations on other fronts,” Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of Hamas’s political office said in a recorded message broadcast on Al Jazeera on Oct 7. “After today, no one can hold back his rifle, bullet, pistol, knife, car, or Molotov cocktail.” Israel assassinated Mr. al-Arouri in January 2024.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-plans.html,World,BBC,By Ronen Bergman and Adam Rasgon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/09int-sinwar-doc-1-phtb/08int-sinwar-doc-1-phtb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T11:27:08+00:00,ce31256284441793ca9c511d2755cbe6c2205044

But it’s the subtext that I’ll focus on today, using a book coming out next week as a springboard. Since moving to Canada last year, I have been captivated by the intense debate about the nation’s identity, and how it is shaped by Canada’s relationship to the United States. I was born and raised in Greece, where identity is heavily defined by reverence for a glorious past. So one of the things that have struck me about Canada’s identity conversation in the era of President Trump’s “51st state” talk is how much it is focused on the future. “Elbows Up! Canadian Voices of Resilience and Resistance” (McClelland & Stewart, out Oct. 14), tackles the newly urgent question, What is Canada? The book also explores how the country can reassert its independence and step out of the leaden shadow of American cultural hegemony. A collection of 30 essays edited by Elamin Abdelmahmoud, an author and critic who hosts the CBC program “Commotion,” the book includes powerful Indigenous and immigrant Canadian voices, Québécois authors, and sports and culture experts.

2187cc310c9f,"Thousands Return to Northern Gaza, Hopeful, but Faced With Devastation","israel gaza war, peace process, palestinians, humanitarian aid, us foreign policy, un, gaza city, gaza strip, israel, hamas, donald trump","Thousands of people traveled by foot toward Gaza City on Saturday as a cease-fire held overnight, but early accounts described devastation across the area. “The scale of destruction is really staggering,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokeswoman for the United Nations’ humanitarian office, who visited the city this week. “We have a lot of people moving north to Gaza City and arriving to find the ruins where their homes used to be, so there is a lot of conflicted emotion.” Mediators hope the cease-fire, which began at noon Friday, will lead to the end of two years of war as the first phase of a 20-point peace plan presented in September by President Trump. A summit in support of the peace proposal will be held on Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, and chaired by Mr. Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, according to a statement from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain will also attend the summit, according to statements from their respective governments. Mr. Trump was also expected to visit Israel’s Parliament in Jerusalem on Monday, according to a spokesman for the chamber. In Gaza, joy at the pause in fighting has been tempered by the scale of destruction that many face as they return to the north. Hundreds of thousands of people fled Gaza City last month as Israel began a ground offensive there. “We’re back in our city, but it doesn’t feel like it,” said Manal Muftah, 33. “We lost everything.” She said she was a baker before the war and hoped to rebuild her business if the cease-fire turned into lasting peace. But the day when things would return to how they were before the conflict “still feels far away,” she said. “Maybe our grandchildren will see Gaza rebuilt,” Ms. Muftah said. “Whoever lives long enough will see it — the Gaza we remember.” Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defense emergency rescue service, said on Saturday that 63 bodies had been recovered in the streets of Gaza City since the cease-fire began. He said he believed dozens more were probably under the rubble. The director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said the health care system would face “severe shortages” and “immense” challenges as people returned to the city. “We’ve finished one war and entered another,” he said. Gaza is in a deep humanitarian crisis, with widespread hunger, vast destruction of property and most of its two million people displaced repeatedly in two years of war. The territory was impoverished before the war, and food supplies and other aid have been sharply curtailed since the conflict began, making circumstances much worse. The agreement reached on Thursday between Israel and Hamas contains stipulations for an increase of aid into the enclave. Israel will allow the United Nations to deliver larger amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza starting on Sunday, according to a senior U.N. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. The United Nations has said about 170,000 metric tons of food, medicine and other supplies are staged and ready to be transported. The truce reached this week describes an exchange of hostages and prisoners, and says Israeli troops would partly withdraw to new deployment lines inside the territory. But it does not address some of the key stipulations in the plan presented by Mr. Trump in September, including whether Hamas will agree to disarm. Mr. Trump nevertheless told reporters on Friday that he believed there was “consensus on most” of the plan and that the hostages would be released on Monday. “They’re getting them now,” he said. “They’re in some pretty rough places. Only a few people know where they are in some cases.” On Saturday, the Israeli military said its chief of staff had taken U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and former adviser on the region, on a field tour of Gaza. For many of those walking the coastal road from southern to northern Gaza, the pause in fighting offered a chance to return home and to learn what remained of their lives there. For some, the experience was sobering. “Today I feel nothing,” said Maisoun Wadi, 36, as she sat on the side of the road among a heap of bags, household items and a scrap of tarp. “Not sadness, not joy — just emptiness.” She was shocked to see how much the city had changed since she and her family fled weeks ago. “It was already destroyed, but what I see now is worse,” she said. “We have no house. I’ll tie this tarp to any standing wall and hang a blanket for a roof.” The most pressing question for her was how to survive. “I don’t care what’s agreed on in Egypt,” she said. “I care about a tent, about water.” Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/return-gaza-city-ceasefire.html,World,BBC,"By Liam Stack, Bilal Shbair and Saher Alghorra",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-gaza-return-promo-ptvh/11int-gaza-return-promo-ptvh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:43:55+00:00,b6f3b60f22d5d71ff606042c3a576d82850e416e
6e08d7a46c2e,"Did LeBron James Write for a Communist Paper? No, but China Said He Did.","international relations, basketball, newspaper, clippers, stephen curry, lebron james, james harden, adam mendelsohn, daryl morey, adam silver, xi jinping, china, macau, nba, houston rockets, golden state warriors, brooklyn nets, us","Last month, People’s Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, published what looked like a rare opinion column by a foreigner, the basketball star LeBron James. In it, he praised basketball as a cultural bridge between countries. The problem: Mr. James never wrote it. Mr. James had been talking to Chinese reporters while on a trip there, and the newspaper turned those comments into an essay with his name on it. Being depicted as the author of a piece in People’s Daily, the voice of the ruling party, is no small matter; it suggested that Mr. James was endorsing Beijing’s message at a time of deep tensions with Washington. For Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., that crossed a line. “Taking words somebody said and then making it seem as a first-person Op-Ed,” Mr. Silver told The New York Times, in his first comments about the incident, “would not be appropriate .” The backlash in America to what people thought was an opinion piece was swift. Conservative commentators said Mr. James was letting Beijing use his fame to whitewash the image of the authoritarian government. One website said the N.B.A. was “groveling to the communists.” The incident was only the latest reminder of the potential political minefield the league faces as it resumes play in China after a six-year absence. The Brooklyn Nets will play the Phoenix Suns in Macau on Sunday night, the second of two preseason games. The games are the result of a yearslong effort by the league — and by Patrick Dumont, a casino mogul turned team owner — to regain its footing in China, a hugely important market. China has its own reasons for welcoming back the N.B.A. The Chinese government has been struggling to breathe life into an economy where people have been holding back on spending. Beijing wants to use sports and international events to “boost overall consumption,” said Crystal Wang, an expert on Chinese sports with the consultancy Deloitte in Shanghai. “That is from the top.” According to state media, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping has a soft spot for basketball, having played pickup games while working as a local official in Hebei Province. Beijing hopes the league can showcase China as open and welcoming. The government has turned to athletes, scholars and influencers to promote “people to people” ties aimed at countering hostility from both sides of the political aisle in the United States. Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, for instance, cited what he described as Mr. James’s Op-Ed for People’s Daily, saying on X : “It’s heartening to see sports are bringing our people closer.” Basketball is wildly popular in China. That is what makes N.B.A. stars so valuable there — but it also forces the players to walk a razor-thin line between sports and politics. It is a line the league has stumbled over before. In 2019, Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests. That and the league’s refusal to punish Mr. Morey shut the N.B.A. out of China for years, costing the league more than $300 million in revenue. But N.B.A. athletes who have traveled to China after the incident have found a lucrative market. The Los Angeles Clippers star James Harden, who has criticized Mr. Morey, praised China and even hinted at moving there, has been rewarded by Chinese fans. In 2023, he sold 10,000 bottles of wine from his personal label on a Chinese livestream in seconds. When Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors toured western China in August, he was greeted by an enormous drone show, sponsored by a local tourism board, that depicted him high-fiving a panda. Players know to steer clear of politics, said Terry Rhoads, a Shanghai-based sports consultant who helped build a market for the N.B.A. in China while working for Nike. “Every single N.B.A. player that comes out to China is being briefed on, ‘Hey, we’re out there to have fun. We’re out there to get the kids loving basketball.’” Mr. Silver said that China put no conditions on speech ahead of the N.B.A. resuming play. But the stakes of offending China are clear. And they cut both ways: Players also face criticism in the United States if they seem too cozy with Beijing — as the LeBron James episode with People’s Daily showed. Adam Mendelsohn, an adviser to Mr. James, sought to downplay that incident, saying that the media had “incorrectly characterized” the piece as an Op-Ed that he had written. But People’s Daily had described the player as the author of the essay, and promoted it on its official social media account with a post titled: “LeBron James Writes in People’s Daily.” Mr. James had also been accused of pandering to China in 2019 when he criticized Mr. Morey over the tweet. “So many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually,” he said at the time. “Yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.” Joy Dong contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/asia/china-nba-lebron.html,World,BBC,By Mara Hvistendahl and Tania Ganguli,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/00int-china-nba-risks-02-kgqj/00int-china-nba-risks-02-kgqj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:01:41+00:00,b8697503b9456d1d223d5d96d060cda36218ed7f
451456983214,How a Las Vegas Casino Mogul Helped Bring N.B.A. Games Back to China,"basketball, gambling, casino, freedom of speech, nba, xi jinping, daryl morey, lebron james, adam silver, las vegas sands","In 2021, the casino mogul Patrick Dumont approached the N.B.A. commissioner with a brazen idea: Bring American professional basketball back to China. The N.B.A.’s relationship with Beijing had been in tatters for two years, after a team executive’s tweet in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The resulting controversy cost the league hundreds of millions of dollars. Partners pulled their sponsorships. China’s state broadcaster CCTV stopped airing games. Western companies that clash so publicly with Beijing rarely get second chances. But Mr. Dumont, an executive with one of the world’s most profitable casino operators, believed that the National Basketball Association could get back into China through Macau, the semiautonomous city where his company ran several highly lucrative casinos. Mr. Dumont and his family had billions at stake. Las Vegas Sands, which is owned by his mother-in-law, Miriam Adelson, and other family members, was selling its Nevada properties to focus on Asia. The Covid-19 pandemic had devastated profits. And Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, was tightening control of Macau and insisting that casinos diversify beyond gambling. That last demand meant that Sands needed to spend big on outside entertainment or risk its license. The league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, was intrigued by a Sands partnership. What followed was years of diplomacy by Sands, whose owner, Ms. Adelson, is among President Trump’s top donors. Sands executives met repeatedly with Chinese and Macau officials and hosted events celebrating “one country two systems,” Beijing’s term for its governance of Hong Kong and Macau. The Adelson family, with Mr. Dumont at the helm, even bought a majority stake in an N.B.A. team, the Dallas Mavericks. (He said that the purchase had no connection to his efforts to bring the N.B.A. to Macau.) All of it culminates in Macau this weekend in two preseason games between the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns at the Venetian Arena , a Sands property. The games are part of a five-year agreement for the N.B.A. to return to China. “It’s certainly a belief of ours that the two world’s largest economies should have continued dialogue,” said Ron Reese, a Sands spokesman. “It’s in everybody’s best interest.” The story of how the deal came together is an example of how casino profits, connections and quiet diplomacy healed a political wound. It is a win for the N.B.A., which lost more than $300 million in its rift with Beijing. It is also a win for Chinese leaders, who have sought to burnish China’s global image through influencers, sports figures and other celebrities. “Sports exchanges between China and the United States reflect public sentiment and serve both sides’ interests,” the Chinese Embassy in Washington said. The N.B.A. never abandoned its Chinese ambitions. It kept its China offices open. Teams hired experts to put content on Chinese social media. Executives from the Brooklyn Nets, which is owned by Joe Tsai, the chairman of the Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group, met with Chinese officials and diplomats. The league donated to China during the pandemic and installed the son of a former CCTV executive at the helm of N.B.A. China. Mr. Silver said that the league made no promises to China to curtail speech, and that the N.B.A. would defend the rights of players and team officials to speak freely. But league and team officials said they were keenly aware of the consequences of another controversy. “In our job, we have to talk about what’s the most important thing, which is to speak through the game,” Jordi Fernández, the Nets coach, said in Macau this past week. Things have changed since the 2019 controversy. Many players are muting or eliminating their activism, and the N.B.A., like other leagues, now mostly avoids taking political positions. And while human rights groups and politicians criticized the N.B.A. for not taking a tougher stance against Beijing back then, the return to China has sparked little uproar. “We’re not looking to go over and poke anyone in the eye,” Mr. Silver said. “We’re not setting out to create a diplomatic incident.” Chaos in a Crucial Market The October 2019 preseason trip to Shanghai and Shenzhen should have been an easy moneymaker. The N.B.A. sent its marquee franchise, the Los Angeles Lakers, to play the Brooklyn Nets. Two of the stars, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, were to face off in a country that loved American basketball. At peak viewership, more people watched the N.B.A. finals in China than in the United States, according to estimates in the Chinese news media. The trip came amid pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Millions of people were taking to the streets, some of them clashing with the police, in a high-profile challenge to Mr. Xi’s power over the city. Days before the games, Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted an image on Twitter that said, “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” Derek Chang, then the chief executive of N.B.A. China, recalled what happened next: “Everything started to explode.” With Chinese officials irate, the N.B.A. released two statements — the Chinese version much more contrite than the English. That angered just about everyone. Mr. Silver gave interviews defending Mr. Morey’s right to free speech. The broadcaster CCTV announced it would cease airing N.B.A. games. The Lakers and Nets watched from their Shanghai hotel as workers removed ads for the game, peeling their faces off the building across the street. Mr. James, in an interview with The New York Times last year, remembered wondering, “How fast can we get out of here?” Mr. Chang said he spent the next few months “trying to look for the avenue back” to China. He did not see one. A Big Bet on Basketball Macau is the world’s casino capital, with gambling returns dwarfing those of Las Vegas. In 2021, when Mr. Dumont broached the idea of N.B.A. games, Macau accounted for nearly 70 percent of his company’s revenue. A former Portuguese colony, Macau was reclaimed by China a quarter-century ago and declared a special administrative zone. Like Hong Kong, it faces increasing pressure from Beijing as Mr. Xi strips away some of its independence. One pressure point was gambling. Foreign casinos need licenses, called concessions, to operate. And as it negotiated the 2022 renewals, the Macau government was demanding: higher taxes, the right to cancel concessions in the name of national security and, crucially, more spending on events unrelated to gambling. Like sports. High rollers had long used casino junkets to evade China’s restrictions on moving cash internationally. The city had a reputation as a haven for bribery. Las Vegas Sands even paid an S.E.C. fine in 2016 to settle accusations of foreign corruption (the company admitted no wrongdoing). Mr. Xi was cracking down on junkets and corruption. Leaders wanted to rebrand Macau as family friendly — with casinos footing the bill. “It’s like the government of France going to every restaurant in France and saying, ‘We want to be less reliant on the cuisine industry,’” said Andrew W. Scott, the chief executive of Inside Asian Gaming, an industry publication based in Macau. For Sands and the other foreign casino operators, remaining in Macau was essential. “They didn’t have a lot of leverage,” Mr. Scott said. “You never resist the government.” Sands suddenly needed to spend billions on outside entertainment to guarantee its license. The arena at the Venetian had hosted mostly concerts and would need to be modernized. But a big-ticket event like the N.B.A. could help publicize the Venetian on the mainland, where casinos are banned from advertising. “We started thinking about our next phase of investment, which is part of our concession renewal. How can we invest more and innovate in both tourism and hospitality?” Mr. Dumont said. “We felt like the N.B.A. would be a good way to do that. We had the arena. We had the obviously very strong fan base in China.” When other sports leagues have repaired rifts with China, they have done so on Beijing’s terms. The English Premier League team Arsenal distanced itself from one of its players in 2020 after he criticized China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, who have faced human rights abuses . And the Women’s Tennis Association suspended play in China in 2021 and demanded an investigation into a Chinese player’s accusations of sexual assault by a government official. Two years later , the association returned to China, acknowledging it did not expect its demands to be met. Mr. Silver is adamant that the N.B.A. made no concessions. Tiptoeing Toward Reconciliation There were signs that Beijing was open to reconciliation. In February 2020, the N.B.A. sent $2.65 million in medical supplies to Hubei Province, the center of the Covid-19 outbreak, earning it accolades in the Chinese state press. That year, the league named Michael Ma, the son of a well-regarded former CCTV executive, as the new head of its China operations. The network aired two N.B.A. finals games that year and resumed broadcasting a regular slate of N.B.A. games in 2022. That “sent a signal to the rest of the community, other current business partners or potential business partners, that we were no longer being punished,” Mr. Silver said. The following year, Mr. Dumont and his family bought the Mavericks. The N.B.A. had no qualms about being in business with a casino operator. The league hosts a tournament each summer in Las Vegas, where Tilman Fertitta, the Rockets owner, owns the Golden Nugget. Mr. Silver has long supported legalized sports betting. The China deal was not a factor in the N.B.A. approving the Mavericks sale, Mr. Silver said. But it had advantages. As an owner, Mr. Dumont would have a stake in the league’s success in China. Additionally, the Venetian Arena was controlled by a private company, rather than the state. “It reduces the number of variables that could go wrong,” Mr. Silver said. Sands, like other casino companies in Macau, has hosted events in recent years celebrating China’s rubber-stamp legislature and its policy on Macau and Hong Kong. Sands executives also marked Beijing’s National Security Education Day, an annual day of activities to inculcate people with a duty to the state and an awareness of foreign spies. And Sands executives cultivated relationships with officials, a review of Chinese government meetings shows. The Adelson family has long played informal diplomatic roles. In the 2024 election, Ms. Adelson was the third-largest donor to Mr. Trump. She and her husband, Sheldon Adelson , repeatedly spoke with Mr. Trump about foreign policy, including, in Mr. Adelson’s case, trade policy toward China . Just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration this year, Sands’s chief executive met with a Chinese vice minister to discuss trade and “the company’s growth in China,” according to Xinhua, China’s state news agency. Mr. Dumont did not say when the N.B.A. came up in discussions. But he said his pitch to the government focused on making Macau a broader tourism destination, just as Mr. Xi wants. “When we explain the context about using the N.B.A. to come to Macau and have it be a very prominent feature of tourism for the city, everyone was really excited,” he said. Mr. Dumont said that Mr. Tsai, the Nets owner and Alibaba chairman, was “very supportive, and he’s been super helpful.” Nets executives also met with Chinese officials in recent years. The Nets declined to comment, but Sunshine Rogers, the Nets’ vice president of global partnerships, told a Chinese news outlet in May that it was the N.B.A. team that “prioritizes the Chinese market the most.” In December, three years after Mr. Dumont raised the idea, the league announced a deal to play preseason games in Macau. Mr. Silver returned to China in March for the first time since 2019. He said the N.B.A. and the Chinese government would need to be flexible in their renewed relationship. “If this is about ideological purity on either side,” he said in an interview, “it will never be achieved.” Joy Dong contributed reporting from Hong Kong and Macau, Kevin Draper from Lawrence, Kan., and Tariq Panja from London.

The facial gymnastics — known as “gurning” — are the focus of the World Gurning Championships, a reverse beauty pageant of sorts and an ancient tradition in the town of Egremont, in northern England’s Lake District. The rules are simple, if odd. Competitors must make their face through a horse collar, known locally as a “baffin.” They are not allowed to use their hands, artificial aids or excessive makeup. They may, however, heighten the dramatic effect of their gurning “by thrashing around onstage and making wild, animal-like noises,” according to the official rules. Here’s what it looks like: Contestants are judged on “the grotesqueness of the grimace and on the extent to which their facial features change,” according to the rules. The best gurners, competitor say, are creative people, with flexible face muscles and a lack of self-consciousness. The championships, which were held on Sept. 20 this year, take place every fall at the Egremont Crab Fair, which was established in 1267 by King Henry III. According to local lore, gurning dates to the Middle Ages, rooted in the faces people make as they bite into the sour crab apples for which the festival is named. Here are some of the competition’s best gurns, and the stories behind them. The Defending Champion Claire Lister, who works in waste operations at a nuclear site, has been competing since she was a child. But like many local competitors, she took a break during her teen years to avoid looking uncool. “Being a female, it gets to a point where — it’s not quite embarrassing — but as you grow older you don’t want to start competing in a sport like that,” she said. Ms. Lister, now 38, returned to the competition in 2013 after her sister entered her as a joke. She won the women’s event, and has placed first nine times since then, including last year. “I never, ever prepare,” she said. “We have fun, and that’s what we say it’s all about.” The Veteran Mr. Zivelonghi, from Coventry, England, got into gurning more than 20 years ago in an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records. It wasn’t his first choice for a world title; he initially wanted to compete for the world’s longest ear hair . “But when you look at the man who has got the longest ear hair, it’s like, ‘Forget it, I’m not going to walk around like that,’” he said. “So yeah, I went to gurning instead.” Having some teeth missing, as Mr. Zivelonghi does, can be a bonus, he said, by enabling more extreme gurns. Stephanie Nguedia moved to the Lake District two years ago from France and was dragged to this year’s competition by her husband, Barry Morgan. At first, she had no idea what was going on. “I didn’t understand, it was ridiculous for me,” she said. But the 36-year-old health care worker was soon drawn in by the welcoming atmosphere. “The whole thing was fantastic,” she said, breathless and smiling after getting offstage. “I love it. I’m happy.” The Wunderkind Kendall Lister, 11, Ms. Lister’s daughter, is a champion in her own right. She took the top spot in this year’s junior event, adding to several past prizes. The worst part? “It can be scary,” she said. “What if I mess up?” And the best? “Winning,” she said. The Last-Minute Entrant As with many competitors, Robbie Carr’s participation began with a few drinks. “It was quite a spontaneous thing really,” he said. Before getting onstage, the 30-year-old electrical worker from Egremont jokingly asked his wife, “If I get in the top three, is that an ‘ick’?’” Her response? “Just you entering is an ‘ick.’” He said his gurn was inspired by his little sister, who used to make a face when teasing him. Ryan Barton, a junior champion in the late 1990s, got his uncle into gurning. “One night when he was drunk, I said, ‘Go on, do it,’” Mr. Barton said. “And he’d done it, and he won it, and he loved it.” His uncle, Peter Jackman, would become a gurning legend, winning the championship multiple times. Mr. Barton, 42, gave up gurning after he went into the British Army and his uncle died. But he brought his two daughters — Sadie, 7, and Aimee, 9, — to the competition this year. They pushed him to compete, just as he had with his uncle. Mr. Barton took first place among the men, and brought his daughters up onstage with him to pose for photos. “Two happy girls, that’s what it’s about,” he said after winning. “My uncle would love listening to that.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/in-this-pageant-the-ugliest-face-wins.html,World,BBC,By Jonathan Wolfe and Tom Jamieson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/00xp-gurning-promo-wflj/00xp-gurning-promo-wflj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:58+00:00,2bb85fe284afd80e8f6d54be7e637ddcb4ff2704
5a29f1a190c1,She Studies the Russian ‘Red Man’ Whose Bloody War Evokes Soviet Tyranny,"svetlana alexievich, russian invasion of ukraine (2022), books, writer, swedish academy, belarus, soviet union, berlin","While writing the book that helped propel her to the Nobel Prize in Literature, the writer Svetlana Alexievich was certain she was chronicling the swan song of the violent, authoritarian ideologues at the heart of the Soviet system. Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, only two years after her native Belarus, still a Kremlin satellite, brutally crushed its democracy movement. The mind-set she believed was headed toward extinction had been revived, she said in a recent interview in her apartment in Berlin, where she has lived in exile since 2020. “I want to understand how that happened.” Her last book before the Nobel, “Secondhand Time,” was her fifth work about the unraveling of the utopian Communist experiment. Told in the voices of ordinary men and women narrating their experiences, the books address landmark events including the invasion of Afghanistan and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster . Ms. Alexievich used an intensive interviewing technique to write each one and, after “Secondhand Time,” intended to turn to other topics, like love and aging. But after the protests in Belarus and the Ukraine invasion, she shelved those plans. She is now writing a sixth book on the enduring existence of what she calls the “Red man,” who, she said, is stoking a bloody war in the heart of Europe. Examining his motivations, she said, is one way to try to douse the flames. “I don’t know where to find the right words to describe these things, yet we have to find the right words,” she told a news conference in late September at the United Nations in Geneva focused on growing repression in Russia. The global drift toward right-wing populism must also be confronted, she said, otherwise “the world itself and people will become even more terrifying, even more monstrous.” “The people who hold power today are trying to shut us up,” she added. In awarding Ms. Alexievich the literature prize in 2015, the Nobel Committee took the rare step of honoring an author of nonfiction, citing “her polyphonic work — a monument to suffering and courage in our time.” Sara Danius, the Swedish Academy permanent secretary at the time, described her books as “a history of emotions — a history of the soul, if you wish.” Ms. Alexievich, 77, grew up in the Soviet Union, born in western Ukraine but raised in a village in Belarus. Both of her parents were schoolteachers. As a child, she said, she listened spellbound to stories traded among the village women, often widows, about World War II and Stalin’s concentration camps. The overall Soviet death toll from the war and later is estimated at 27 million people. “They spoke about harsh things, very scary things, which of course were never written about in books,” Ms. Alexievich said. She studied journalism at Minsk University, eventually becoming a cultural correspondent for a Belarus newspaper. But the voices of those women never left her. She completed her first book, “The Unwomanly Face of War,” in 1983, after interviewing hundreds of female World War II veterans — pilots and snipers and cooks. The book languished for several years because the government censor said anyone who read it would never volunteer to fight. An unexpurgated English translation emerged in 2017. The author said that when she was first introduced to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, by then the former leader of the Soviet Union, he exclaimed, “You are so small and yet you wrote such a big book!” Ms. Alexievich said she responded, “Well, you are no giant yourself, but you toppled an empire.” The quest for empire feeds the desire of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to seize Ukraine, she said in the interview. He has promulgated a mythic Russian Empire that never really existed, the writer said, but that mythology resonates in Russia, especially outside Moscow and St. Petersburg. Ideology alone is not fueling the war, she said. She described the experience of a journalist friend who was interviewing a woman about her dead son. The woman suddenly clammed up, fearing being denied the death benefits she needed to buy her daughter an apartment. “Putin bought Russia,” Ms. Alexievich said, and has committed a “moral crime” by trying to depict the invasion as a continuation of the fight against Nazi Germany. Ms. Alexievich’s books take up to five years to write. She interviews her subjects repeatedly, using fragments of conversations like a jigsaw puzzle to construct a portrait of events. The repetition from one witness to the next forms a dense, compelling narrative. She lives for the revealing, human detail, she said. She elaborated on her technique in her Nobel lecture , saying that listening to people talk is her greatest passion. “I would say that I am a human ear,” she said. “When I walk down the street and catch words, phrases and exclamations, I always think — how many novels disappear without a trace!” “Voices From Chernobyl,” which recounted the harrowing experiences of those caught up in the nuclear meltdown in 1986, provided the basis for a haunting HBO series . In examining extreme human behavior, Ms. Alexievich said, she has long turned to Dostoyevsky for inspiration about its inexplicable nature. She rarely inserts herself in her books, and offers little information about her subjects beyond what they say. Some critics find the lack of background material disorienting. Her writing also provokes debate about whether it is literature, although she rejects calling it journalism. Given her emphasis on the violence thrumming through Russian society, her books are considered highly relevant amid the current war. “The Soviet soldier is the cheapest soldier there is,” said a prescient combat medic in “Boys in Zinc,” her Afghan war book . “Unequipped and unprotected. Expendable. The same way it was in 1941.” He added, “It’ll still be the same in 50 years.” After the publication of that book, Ms. Alexievich was accused in court of defaming the Soviet Army. She was acquitted, but in 2000, she moved to Europe and lived there for over a decade. In 2020, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the autocrat who has run Belarus since 1994, won another term in an election widely considered fraudulent. Scores of protesters were tortured, and hundreds of opposition activists given lengthy prison terms. Ms. Alexievich was the only member of the Coordination Council, a group created to unite the actions of the opposition, not to be arrested. She was interrogated, though, and after that, European diplomats and human rights activists camped in her apartment to safeguard her. But she decided to leave the country. Her home in a pre-World War II building on a leafy Berlin side street has a bohemian, somewhat temporary air. Nothing hangs on the pale yellow living room walls, the flowery ceiling molding overhead providing the only décor. A companion served Turkish coffee from a long-handled pot. Ms. Alexievich has one adult daughter, adopted from her late sister, and a granddaughter. She sometimes feels guilty that she joined the millions who have left Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Still, a striking number of prominent Russian cultural figures now inhabit Berlin, she noted, much like the intelligentsia who decamped after the 1917 revolution. They can help to preserve Russian culture, she said. During the September news conference in Geneva, she quoted the late, Soviet-born artist Ilya Kabakov: “When communism existed as an ideology, as a country, we knew what to do, we liked ourselves, we looked great in that struggle, and then we won. At the cost of huge losses, we defeated this monster and when we looked back, several years on, we found ourselves living among rats. How do you fight rats?” That is the essence of the current struggle, Ms. Alexievich said. Democracy is in retreat partly because individuals have convinced themselves that they are too small to effect change, to confront evil. “I think that we have to convince ourselves of the contrary,” she said. “Each of us has to find this strength, this ability to resist. ”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/russia-svetlana-alexievich.html,World,BBC,By Neil MacFarquhar and Milana Mazaeva,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09russia-profile-alexievich-01-gklt/09russia-profile-alexievich-01-gklt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:55+00:00,a1701550cb6e2cd65487ce4335aceb427e4b74cd
1d25d54c51dc,"What Things Left Behind Say About a Home’s Past, and the Times We Live In","pennsylvania, archaeology;anthropology, buildings, waste management, ceramics and pottery, plastic","We live in an old log house with big square beams, twisted staircases and a double stone fireplace. The floor boards creak, dust falls through the ceilings and the house is drafty, despite having been built at the bottom of three hills out of the wind. It sits on a county road, now abandoned, and, since 1941, has been occupied by only two families. It is a type of house few live in anymore, built by hardworking women and men who came to this western Pennsylvania outpost in much harder times, many years before we arrived here in 1988. I am grateful they did. But who built this house, and when? We’ve assumed it’s from roughly 1860. But we’ve never been sure, and finding out has not been easy. Our county recorder of deeds got me as far back as 1913. A 1964 tax assessment read, “old, remodeled house.” I’ve spoken to a log house expert, a local historian, and dated our apple trees to the mid-19th century, but still I’ve come up short. Then I found my answer by means I didn’t expect. I invited two archaeologists, Tom and Pat Baker, a husband and wife team, to the barn one night to help me identify the random objects I’ve found scattered across the fields and forests over 37 years: pottery shards, bits of glass, iron tools, farm equipment, shotgun shells, oyster shells, animal bones. And, of course, plastic. I gathered up these artifacts to clean up the land, but also to give me clues about those who came before us: how they lived and farmed, what they ate and drank, the utensils they used, the area’s industrial past. Mine is a commonplace collection; despite living in a town on the Pennsylvania frontier where the French and Indian War was fought, I’ve never found a musket ball or an arrowhead. And while I may use a fancy word and call these items artifacts, the truth is, much of what I have found was probably trash. Settlers in rural America had no garbage collection, so they threw rubbish into pits outside summer kitchens. Or into privies or bottle dumps. They burned trash or tossed it into a pigsty. “People put waste products into a manure spreader and spread it over the fields,” Tom said. Out in the field, I’ve picked up a ceramic smoking pipe, quite likely from 1895, the mangled wood and metal heel of a shoe, and, turning the compost pile, I found a white, opaque piece of milk glass. “I rarely see that,” Pat said. It turned out that a couple of towns over, a manufacturer of milk glass, the Westmoreland Glass Company, was founded in 1889. Last year on a hike, I found a pitted, brown rock in the middle of a path. I thought it might be a meteorite. It turned out to be a piece of slag. Had an iron furnace been on the property, Tom asked? Iron furnaces are abundant in this valley, but not here, at least to my knowledge. I know from an 1876 map that a tannery and a blacksmith shop were close by, but the slag, according to Pat, wouldn’t have originated in either of those places. “That piece of slag is indicative of iron smelting and would have come from nearby coke ovens or an iron furnace,” she said. Nondescript pieces of glass suddenly come alive when archaeologists look at them. A clear shard with raised numbers and letters turned out to be a bottle embossed with a drugstore’s name and address. A seam running along the neck of a pale blue bottle indicated it was handblown into a mold in the mid-to-late 1800s. A piece of brown glass was part of an old Clorox bottle from the 1930s. Brown glass, I learned, kept light from altering the chemicals and indicated that the contents were poisonous. I found an abundance of redware and stoneware, the everyday pottery used in this old house. Most of the stoneware was glazed brown and white, but one piece had a blue sponge pattern, probably from the early 1900s. A fragment of flow-blue refined earthenware, from about 1840 to 1900, had split into three from being burned. Pat put the plate back together like a puzzle. And then came the revelation: Pat was able to date this property according to the pottery we didn’t have. “Your collection is completely missing delftware, creamware and pearlware,” she said, listing pottery types that were common in North America from colonial times until the middle of the 1800s. “This tells me that your property was not occupied until the mid-1850s.” I still don’t know who built the house, but that is the closest I’ve come to accurately dating the place. Wire nails backed up her assertion. I’ve found a lot of metal: half a set of tongs for grabbing hay bales or ice, a double bit ax, what might be an ox shoe, a vise and assorted hooks, screws, nuts, bolts and wire nails. Wire nails were not manufactured until 1857, so that also suggested the house had not been lived in until then. Not all the items I collected were trash, however. Some were lost, misplaced or dropped. “They didn’t see it fall off a saddle if they were on horseback,” Tom said. We, too, are guilty of inadvertently leaving items out in the environment. I’ve dropped plant tags, terra cotta shards and rubber bands. Tools fall off our ATV or out of our pockets. Machinery breaks in the field. I’ve come home from hikes with electric fence insulators, lawn mower wheels, chain from a manure spreader and bungee cords. Sometimes, I get lucky and it’s exactly the piece we were looking for and machinery can be fixed or a horseshoe put back on. But we don’t purposely toss trash into the woods. “Today, people find a ravine and dump it,” Tom said, which is exactly what someone is doing at a deserted corner of the farm. They’re throwing garbage from their car over a guardrail into a ravine. Not only common household trash, but hundreds of beer cans stuffed into red, plastic bags. One now hangs from a maple sapling like a giant red Christmas ornament. Our county has no plastic bag ban and convenience stores, gas stations and grocery stores hand them out for free. I seldom drive that road, but noticed the garbage when biking there, seven miles up steep hills with hairpin turns in the Allegheny Mountains, then down onto the flat by fields of cut hay and a sheep farm, where I often see a leucistic hawk. My ride borders woods where I pick morels and black raspberries and an enormous snapping turtle suns itself by a pond. One day, I collected about a hundred items of trash, including soda, water and liquor bottles, French fry boxes, supersize cups, lottery tickets, straws, plastic tubs, power drink cans and two containers of hypodermic needles. I saw a diaper down a different ravine, but couldn’t reach it. I try to be understanding because this small township still has no municipal trash collection. It costs money to collect garbage. But I feel less kindly toward the appearance of the synthetic innards of an entire couch, packaging from morning-after pills, and, halfway down the ravine, an air purifier. All this, despite dumping being illegal, with hefty fines and possible community service. But why pay someone to haul it away if there are no consequences. I shudder to think of black bears, opossums, raccoons and coyotes drinking from a stream riddled with broken glass and walking steep hillsides covered in rusty, jagged metal. Of birds picking through fast food wrappers and chipmunks nibbling on plastic containers. How the trash contaminates the air, water and soil, and affects the growth of native plants. And all the plastic running downstream. And I can’t help but wonder: Is this the archaeology of the future, the things we are leaving the next generation to study? What will those artifacts tell them about us? About us all?

965f33312862,Wave of Criticism Greets Macron’s Repeat Pick for Prime Minister: ‘Bad Joke’,"sébastien lecornu, emmanuel macron, france, politics, jordan bardella, marine le pen, budget, legislature, national rally;national front, internal-open-access-from-nl","Having led a government that lasted 836 minutes, Sébastien Lecornu has now become prime minister of France for the second time in a week, without it being clear why his chances of success might be greater this time. After delaying the appointment until deep into the evening on Friday, President Emmanuel Macron again asked Mr. Lecornu, a close centrist ally, to form a government, in what appeared to be an admission that he had run out of options. “One has the impression that the more he is alone, the more rigid he grows in his initial position,” Marine Tondelier, the leader of the Green Party, said after she attended a meeting on Friday between Mr. Macron and the leaders of several parties. France, a nuclear power and one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, has a certain idea of itself. It is not that of a country whose last government survived for less than a day. The descent of the nation into tragicomic turmoil has caused widespread alarm and allowed Mr. Macron’s chief rival, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, to deplore a “desperate, pathetic spectacle.” She wasn’t alone in her censure, as a torrent of criticism met Mr. Macron’s choice. Mr. Lecornu will restart his efforts to form a government in a country in a state of severe institutional crisis, tethered to a president who after more than eight years in power has never been so isolated or scorned. “Lecornu II is a bad joke, a democratic ignominy and a humiliation for the French people,” said Jordan Bardella, the popular president of Ms. Le Pen’s anti-immigrant National Rally party. She wants Mr. Macron to dissolve a deadlocked Parliament and call legislative elections in which her party could well gain enough seats to form a government. Mr. Macron’s conduct this year in selecting, from a weak position, three prime ministers from his own centrist or center-right camp — the third of them for a second time on Friday — has appeared increasingly incomprehensible, culminating in calls from exasperated former allies for him to explain his stubbornness or resign. Worried that his economic reforms, including raising the retirement age or cutting the corporate tax rate, might be reversed, Mr. Macron has refused to reach out to the center left, despite the fact that a now frayed alliance of left and far-left parties won more seats than any other group in the 2024 legislative elections. Rather, with fewer votes he has attempted to exercise more power. This stance has been widely viewed as showing contempt for the people’s will, never a comfortable position in France. When Gabriel Attal, once Mr. Macron’s protégé and his choice for prime minister in early 2024 , declared this week, “I no longer understand the decisions of the president,” and said that these choices betrayed a “kind of furious pursuit of the maintenance of his power,” he expressed the dismay of many French people. “We are clinging on perilously between a political crisis and a crisis of the regime, where either we have a government so fragile it could fall any day, or parliamentary elections that will certainly hand victory to Ms. Le Pen,” said Alain Duhamel, a prominent author and political analyst. As president, Mr. Macron has certain powers, including those of selecting a prime minister and dissolving Parliament to call a legislative election. But he does not have a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house. He no longer has a loyal centrist party of his own. His ideology, known as Macronism, a mélange of shifting ideas once intended to overcome a left-right cleavage, has collapsed. A poll by Elabe, published this week in the business daily Les Echos, showed his support collapsing to 14 percent of the electorate, the most unpopular he has been and one of the lowest approval ratings ever for a French president. Yet Mr. Macron’s decisions have offered no concessions or readiness to change methods, as was further illustrated in his decision to reappoint Mr. Lecornu. With the far-right National Rally and far-left France Unbowed parties implacably opposed to him, and the center-left Socialists and conservative Republicans also unhappy with Mr. Macron’s choice, it was unclear how any second Lecornu government could last long. Mr. Macron “needs a parliamentary majority to support him,” Denis Baranger and Olivier Beaud, two professors of public law, wrote on Friday in the daily Le Monde. “Because he has not understood this reality, Mr. Macron is now totally isolated and has thrown the country into an unprecedented institutional impasse.” It appeared to be Mr. Macron’s insistence that Bruno Le Maire, a former finance minister now being blamed for the rise in French debt to $4 trillion, become the defense minister in the ephemeral first government of Sébastien Lecornu that caused it to blow apart in less than a day this week. Mr. Le Maire is close to the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, a relationship that Mr. Macron viewed as important given the need to integrate European military power at a time of war on the continent. But the surprise choice proved intolerable to Bruno Retailleau, the right-wing interior minister, who had been blindsided and promptly sounded the death knell of a government Mr. Lecornu had spent almost a month assembling. It was another example of the repetitive fiascos now afflicting France. These have followed Mr. Macron’s still unexplained decision to call parliamentary elections in June 2024. He was under no obligation to do so. Since then, the National Assembly has been split three ways among the nationalist far right, the left and the far left, and an enfeebled center whose loyalty to Mr. Macron is fading. This Parliament is dysfunctional; that much is proven. But France needs a budget to confront its mounting deficit and debt. In theory, Mr. Lecornu must present the budget next week if it is to be approved by the end of the year. With the current parliamentary configuration, it is difficult to see how he will get the budget passed — or, if he somehow does, how his government will survive much beyond that. Yet Mr. Macron does not want to dissolve Parliament and perhaps finish his presidency with Mr. Bardella as his prime minister. For 80 years, since the end of World War II, France has prided itself on keeping the far right from power after the shame and humiliation of the Vichy Government that collaborated with the Nazis. “This is not going to end well,” Ms. Tondelier, the Green Party leader, said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/france-macron-lecornu-prime-minister.html,World,BBC,By Roger Cohen,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-France-Macron-Analysis-wlbg/11int-France-Macron-Analysis-wlbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T08:49:09+00:00,e75af7a1c2d9d8c3a7c1ffa420854a8c2dd0d224

So Much for the Thaw.,"international relations, us foreign policy, international trade, tariff, us economy, global times, stimson center, hu xijin, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us, internal-open-access-from-nl","As the trade war between the United States and China kicked back into high gear after a period of tentative détente, it was clear just how vast the gulf of misunderstanding between the two superpowers had become. President Trump said that he had been blindsided by China’s new controls on rare earth metals and products made from them, announced earlier in the week , amid what he had called a “very good” relationship in recent months. Chinese commentators insisted that Beijing was only responding to new attacks from the United States, and that Washington was the provocateur, because it had ramped up technological restrictions on China while professing good will. Both sides also seemed convinced that they had the advantage and that the other side had overplayed its hand. The blame game continued on Saturday, as China woke up to Mr. Trump’s announcement that he would impose new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese imports from Nov. 1. The Chinese government on Sunday accused the United States of double standards, saying its rare earth export controls were normal, and that it was America that had long abused such controls and adopted discriminatory practices against China in the name of national security. On the threat of more tariffs, the Commerce Ministry said the two sides should resolve issues through talks, but China would take measures in response if the United States “insists on its own course.” “China’s position on a tariff war is consistent: We do not want one, but we are not afraid of one either,” the ministry said in a statement.

Mr. Kim organized the enormous military parade at the main square of the capital, Pyongyang, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of his ruling Workers’ Party. He used the spectacle to show off his country’s growing geopolitical value as a partner to China and Russia in pushing back against the United States. Joining Mr. Kim on the viewing platform were Premier Li Qiang​, China’s second-highest-ranking official; Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin; and To Lam, Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, according to images carried by North Korean state media on Saturday. The parade was also an opportunity for Mr. Kim to ​highlight the deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers who fought for Russia ​in its war against Ukraine joined the parade on Friday, carrying the flags of both nations. North Korea has provided ​Russia with 15,000 troops, according to South Korean officials, and large shipments of artillery shells, rockets and missiles.​ ​The North Koreans will continue to “fulfill their responsibilities in the joint struggle of the progressive mankind for opposing injustice and hegemony and defending justice and peace,” Mr. Kim said in a speech ​before the military parade, a veiled show of defiance against the American-led West. North Korea has long used military parades for domestic propaganda. They have become more frequent and bigger under Mr. Kim, who has also used them as a venue for brandishing ​new weapons to gain leverage against his enemies, like the United States. The weapons shown off on Friday included military drones, tanks with modern electronic warfare equipment and ​various missiles, including hypersonic ballistic missiles and Hwasong-20s, North Korea’s newest intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The authorities linked the rain to Post-Tropical Cyclone Priscilla , formerly a hurricane, and to Tropical Storm Raymond , both off western Mexico in the Pacific Ocean. Forecasters expect the rain to continue this weekend. By Saturday, the rainfall and landslides had killed at least 41 people across four states, Mexico’s civil protection agency said in a statement . Sixteen of the deaths were in the state of Hidalgo, north of Mexico City; nine were in the state of Puebla, east of Mexico City; 15 were in the state of Veracruz and one was in Querétaro, the statement said. The authorities were searching for another 27 missing people, it added. Between Monday and Thursday, intense rainfall was recorded across the states, with the highest being recorded in Veracruz, which received over 21 inches, the statement said. President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said on social media that the government was working to “support the population, open roads and restore electricity.” More than 320,000 users were affected by power outages caused by the heavy rains and winds, the Mexican government said. The torrential rains have damaged at least two bridges and affected more than 600 miles of federal highways across five states, Ms. Sheinbaum said. Thousands of soldiers were carrying out rescues and clearing roads on Friday. The Navy, which deployed 3,300 troops, said that it had carried out more than 900 evacuations. The Mexican authorities said that they had activated more than 5,400 troops from the Army, Air Force and National Guard. The Mexican government said in an earlier statement that the greatest impacts had been reported in the states of Veracruz, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Puebla and Hidalgo. It added that municipalities in Veracruz had been hit particularly hard, with 16,000 homes damaged, landslides on roads and flooded streams. Julio Menchaca, the governor of Hidalgo, said on social media on Thursday that all classes had been suspended because of the heavy rains. Mr. Reyna, the state’s interior secretary, said that at least 1,000 homes, 308 schools and 59 hospitals had been damaged. The storm in Hidalgo also cut off power to 17 municipalities and left 90 communities without communication. Hidalgo’s infrastructure officials posted photos of landslides covering roads and workers trying to clear rocks and branches that had fallen. The same storms were expected to bring the risk of heavy rain and flash flooding across desert areas of the American Southwest this weekend.

Meeting on the United States,"international relations, us foreign policy, us military, targeted killings, smuggling, drug cartel, drug abuse, un security council, nicolas maduro, donald trump, venezuela, us","The United Nations Security Council convened a rare meeting focused on the United States on Friday to discuss the Trump administration’s recent military strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, and the risks these actions posed to regional stability. Though the meeting itself was noteworthy — the council seldom holds meetings on the conduct of the United States, a permanent member — the 15 members of the council were hardly unanimous in support for Venezuela’s government or in open condemnation of the United States. Tensions between the United States and Venezuela have escalated in recent months. The Trump administration has conducted at least four strikes on boats off the waters of Venezuela, killing at least 21 people, alleging that they were smuggling drugs. President Trump recently told Congress that his administration had determined the United States is in a war with drug cartels and that, therefore, people crewing boats suspected of drug smuggling are “unlawful combatants.” That idea that has been sharply contested by a range of legal specialists in laws governing the use of military force. Russia and China sharply criticized the United States on Friday, saying its actions violated international law and violated the sovereignty of Venezuela. Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the U.N., said the military actions and killing of civilians without trial reflected a U.S. “cowboy principle of shoot first.” He said the attacks were an example of “American exceptionalism” in which, he said, Washington does what it wants and expects other countries to fall in line.

ec4eab6aa899,"Clark Olofsson, 78, Dies; Bank Robber Helped Inspire ‘Stockholm Syndrome’","clark olofsson, bank robberies, kidnapping and hostages, psychology, mental health, jan-erik olsson, obituary","Nothing about the holdup of a Stockholm bank in 1973 followed any expected story line. Firing shots into the ceiling and shouting in English, “The party starts!,” an ex-convict named Jan-Erik Olsson seized three bank employees, all women, as hostages. The police swarmed in and the media descended, broadcasting the standoff live. Mr. Olsson hadn’t come just to rob the bank; he was demanding that a former cellmate of his, Clark Olofsson, be sprung from prison and brought to join him. Sweden’s minister of justice went along. Even more unexpected, over six days of captivity, the hostages — the women were joined by a man found hiding in the bank’s vault — began defending their captors and turning hostile toward their would-be police rescuers. One hostage, Kristin Enmark, 23, speaking by phone to Sweden’s prime minister, Olof Palme , begged to be allowed to leave the bank in a getaway car with her abductors. “I fully trust Clark and the robber,” she told Mr. Palme. “They haven’t done a thing to us.” She added, “Believe it or not, but we’ve had a really nice time here.” The police finally broke through the roof and subdued the robbers with tear gas. At trial, the hostages refused to testify against their captors. Their ordeal gave rise to a new term in pop psychology, Stockholm syndrome, to explain how victims supposedly identify and empathize with their captors rather than the authorities trying to help them. Mr. Olofsson, who in Swedish media and in popular culture was portrayed as a charismatic figure, and whose lifetime of escapades on the wrong side of the law made him one of his country’s most famous criminals, died on June 24 at 78. His death, at a hospital in Arvika, Sweden, west of Stockholm, was not widely reported at the time. The Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC reported that Mr. Olofsson’s family confirmed the death without specifying the cause, saying only that he had been treated for “a long illness.” He had spent more than half his life behind bars for robberies, prison breaks and drug smuggling. He was set free for the final time in 2018. Whether Stockholm syndrome is a veritable psychological phenomenon has been debated since its namesake drama, which took place at Kreditbanken in Stockholm’s Norrmalmstorg Square in August 1973. (It was first called Norrmalmstorg syndrome.) The term was coined by a Swedish police psychologist, Nils Bejerot , after he was asked to assess the hostages’ curious behavior during the robbery. But Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the handbook of mental illness in the United States. Some psychologists have explained the behavior as a coping mechanism, seen in victims of kidnappings and among hostages seized by Middle East terrorists, and in victims of domestic abuse. The captives, psychologists say, find a way to self-preservation by siding with their all-powerful captors. The term gained popular currency after the kidnapping of the heiress Patty Hearst by radical leftists in 1974, when Ms. Hearst, after months in captivity, denounced her rich family and participated in a bank robbery with her abductors, self-styled revolutionaries calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army. (A year later, the phenomenon was highlighted in Sidney Lumet’s movie “Dog Day Afternoon,” starring Al Pacino, in which hostages during a bank holdup develop a bond with their captors — an event inspired by a real-life attempted heist in Brooklyn.) Ms. Enmark, the Stockholm hostage, spent years denying that she had ever empathized with Mr. Olsson and Mr. Olofsson. She accused the police who laid siege to the bank of incompetency. She called Stockholm syndrome a myth, saying she had done what was necessary to stay alive. “It’s a way of blaming the victim,” she told a BBC podcast in 2021. “I did what I could to survive.” Clark Oderth Olofsson was born on Feb. 1, 1947, in Trollhattan, Sweden. His parents had a chaotic relationship, and he was placed in foster care at 8 years old, according to accounts in the Swedish media . He grew up to become a repeat offender. At the time of the 1973 hostage drama, he was serving a sentence on robbery and weapons charges. Convicted for his role in the botched robbery of Kreditbanken, Mr. Olofsson was handed another sentence of six and a half years, but the conviction was overturned on appeal: Mr. Olofsson had argued that he had acted to protect the hostages. In 1975, while serving out his prior sentence, he escaped from prison in Norrkoping, Sweden. During a year on the lam, he sailed the Mediterranean Sea, met a teenager on a train whom he would later marry, and robbed a bank in Gothenburg, Sweden, before being caught the same day. The 930,000 kronor (about $230,000) reportedly stolen was never recovered, and it set off a treasure hunt by both the police and civilians. Sentenced to nine years for that robbery, Mr. Olofsson studied journalism behind bars and was released in 1983. The next year, he was convicted on drug charges and sent back to prison until 1991. He cycled in and out of prisons in Sweden and Denmark on drug smuggling convictions for decades, with many of his cases covered in the tabloid media. He married the young woman he had met on the train, Marijke Demuynck, in 1976 and had three sons with her. Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Olofsson’s history of bank robberies, prison escapes and shootouts with the authorities was fodder for a 2003 Swedish television film, “Norrmalmstorg,” and a 2022 Netflix series, “Clark,” with Mr. Oloffson played by Bill Skarsgard. Although mental health experts have theorized about Stockholm syndrome for half a century, almost none thought to speak to Ms. Enmark, the bank employee central to the drama and the diagnosis. One psychologist who did was Allan Wade, a Canadian therapist specializing in interpersonal violence, who, after meeting Ms. Enmark, called Stockholm syndrome a made-up concept meant to shift focus from the stumbles of the Swedish police. “The whole notion was an accusation,” he told the BBC in 2021. “It was a way to dismiss what an incredibly heroic woman had been doing for six and a half days to resist, preserve her dignity and look after the other hostages.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/europe/clark-olofsson-dead.html,World,BBC,By Trip Gabriel,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Olofsson--fctj/10Olofsson--fctj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T23:11:42+00:00,dc55ab413285ddd7db626228875297fb7e870ac0
2c75b48bbb3f,Macron Reappoints Lecornu as France’s Prime Minister,"france, emmanuel macron, sébastien lecornu, appointments and executive changes, politics, legislature","President Emmanuel Macron of France reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as the country’s prime minister on Friday, less than a week after Mr. Lecornu resigned — a risky, whiplash-inducing move that could backfire as Mr. Macron tries to steady a roiling political crisis . The president’s office said in a statement that Mr. Lecornu, a centrist and a close ally of Mr. Macron, had been tasked with forming a government, just days after his previous cabinet of centrists and conservatives imploded . A new government formed by Mr. Lecornu would be France’s fourth in less than a year, a degree of governmental instability not seen since the founding of the country’s Fifth Republic in 1958. And it was far from clear that Mr. Lecornu’s reappointment would do much to help the situation. Political opponents — outraged that Mr. Macron had once again appointed an ally — were already vowing on Friday to topple Mr. Lecornu with a no-confidence motion in the lower house of Parliament, known as the National Assembly. Several left-wing parties and a far-right party declared immediately after the appointment was announced that they would support such a motion, bringing Mr. Lecornu dangerously close to the number of votes required to oust him. Even some of the president’s allies had said that reverting back to Mr. Lecornu was a mistake that did not address the French people’s intense frustration with Mr. Macron, whose approval rating has reached new lows . France has endured months of partisan gridlock in the National Assembly, leaving the country without stable governance, rattling financial markets, unsettling consumers and businesses, and jeopardizing the country’s ability to pass a budget by the end of the year, even as it faces a looming financial crisis . “I accept — out of a sense of duty — the mission entrusted to me by the President of the Republic to do everything possible to give France a budget by the end of the year and to respond to the everyday problems faced by our fellow citizens,” Mr. Lecornu said on X . He added: “We must put an end to this political crisis, which is exasperating the French people, and to this instability, which is damaging to France’s image and interests.” Legally, nothing prevents Mr. Macron from reappointing Mr. Lecornu, who has been a member of every government since Mr. Macron was first elected in 2017. Politically, however, the decision infuriated many of Mr. Macron’s opponents, who blame him for repeatedly refusing to appoint an opposition prime minister, even though his centrist alliance lost badly in snap elections over a year ago. Since those elections, the National Assembly has been deadlocked among three main political blocs, none of which has a majority: a collection of left-wing parties; a mix of conservatives and centrists; and a nationalist, anti-immigrant far right led by the National Rally party. Mr. Macron, who met with party leaders on Friday, has relied on a succession of unstable center-right minority governments, not heeding calls from left-wing parties who say they should have their chance at governing. Jordan Bardella, the head of the far-right National Rally party, said on X that Mr. Macron was “more isolated and disconnected than ever.” “The National Rally will, of course, immediately censure this futile alliance, whose sole raison d’être is fear of dissolution, i.e., of the people,” he added, referring to Mr. Macron’s ability to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections. Mr. Lecornu’s departure, on Monday, had immediately increased the pressure on Mr. Macron. Some of his opponents argued that the only way to break the deadlock was to call new parliamentary elections — or even for Mr. Macron to resign. But Mr. Macron quickly ruled out those options. Mr. Lecornu, after holding last-ditch talks with political parties at the president’s request, said on Wednesday that a majority of parties in the lower house did not want new elections and wanted to pass a budget before year’s end. Mr. Macron appeared to be gambling that most parties, even those who said Mr. Lecornu’s appointment was a provocation, would compromise on a budget bill because they were too afraid of new elections, which polls predict would be dominated by the far right. But that is a risky bet, and there remain major budget disagreements on what spending to cut and what taxes to raise. Mr. Macron’s 2023 pension overhaul, which raised the legal age of retirement to 64 from 62 and is still widely unpopular, is one of the biggest sticking points. Left-wing parties were hoping that Mr. Macron would be open to suspending the measure, despite his extreme reluctance to see any part of his pro-business agenda rolled back. But the parties said after their meeting with Mr. Macron that he had suggested only that the overhaul’s full implementation could be delayed until after 2027, when France’s next presidential election will be held. Mr. Lecornu said on Friday that “all the issues raised during the consultations held in recent days will be open to parliamentary debate,” although he did not specifically mention the pension overhaul.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/europe/france-prime-minister-lecornu-macron.html,World,BBC,By Aurelien Breeden,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10int-france-prime-minister-jphg/10int-france-prime-minister-jphg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T20:16:08+00:00,4b60c61b09527ea160ba2dce1b930a16a6a8ef42

A conservative former member of the national assembly, Ms. Machado has been a driving force in opposing a quarter century of socialist rule that has grown increasingly repressive under President Nicolás Maduro. She has been living in hiding since last year, when Mr. Maduro cracked down on the opposition after claiming victory in an election that was widely seen by independent analysts as fraudulent. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Ms. Machado for her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Ms. Machado has largely avoided commenting on whether Mr. Maduro’s removal should involve U.S. military intervention in Venezuela. But she has been a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, where American forces have destroyed several suspected drug boats in international waters, killing at least 21 people. “I totally support the international deployment and coalition that’s working in the Caribbean to stop the flow of illegal drug income to the regime,” Ms. Machado told the BBC last week. The Norwegian Nobel Institute was able to reach Ms. Machado by telephone a few moments before the prize was announced to tell her she had been selected. “Oh my God,” she said in a video posted by the committee on social media. “Well, I have no words.” In her campaigns opposing the Venezuelan government, she has spent more than two decades building relationships in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans alike. In 2005, she was received in the White House by President George W. Bush, and she has been praised extensively by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and former Florida senator. She argues, like Mr. Trump, that Mr. Maduro poses an enormous security threat to the region. “This is about saving lives,” she told Fox News last month, “not only Venezuelan lives, but also lives of American people, because as you have said, and we have heard, Maduro is the head of a narco-terrorist structure of cooperation.” Yet the announcement of Ms. Machado’s selection for the peace prize seemed to have been greeted with disappointment by the White House, after President Trump talked openly for months about his desire for the prize himself. The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, said the Nobel committee had “proved they place politics over peace.” At an Oval Office news conference on Friday evening, Mr. Trump said: “The person who actually got the Nobel Prize actually called today, called me and said ‘I’m accepting this in honor of you because you really deserved it.’ A very nice thing to do. I didn’t say ‘Then give it to me’ though. I think she might have. She was very nice. I’ve been helping her along the way.” A mother of three adult children, all of whom live abroad, Ms. Machado, 58, hails from a wealthy and staunchly Catholic family. She attended an elite Catholic girls’ school in Caracas and a boarding school in Wellesley, Mass. She studied engineering at Andrés Bello Catholic University, and then took a position in her family’s steel business, Sivensa, parts of which were expropriated in 2010 by President Hugo Chávez, who sent soldiers to take over seven of the company’s plants as part of his socialist nationalization program. Ms. Machado had already become a political activist by then, running a voter rights group, Súmate, that led a failed effort to recall Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. An emblematic moment came in 2012, when Ms. Machado was a legislator and she clashed with Mr. Chávez in a televised debate, accusing him of robbing everyday Venezuelans through expropriation. Mr. Chávez mocked her as being beneath his concern. “Eagles don’t hunt flies,” he told her. Venezuela’s opposition struggled through years of repression and division under Mr. Chávez and then his ally and successor, Mr. Maduro, when the government crushed protests and arrested dissidents, and the economy collapsed, all contributing to an enormous exodus from the country. But last year, Ms. Machado corralled the fractious opposition, playing a galvanizing role in the campaign for the July presidential election. After a court ruled in January 2024 that she was barred from the ballot, she campaigned behind a little-known diplomat named Edmundo González . With rosaries swinging from her neck, Ms. Machado was greeted by adoring crowds as she traveled across the country, visiting small towns and slums that had once provided the core of support for the country’s socialist takeover. In the city of Guanare, in western Venezuela, one voter said she believed that this time around “the fly is going to trap the eagle.” Ms. Machado has championed free markets and vowed to “bury socialism forever.” And she has said that the politician she most admired was Margaret Thatcher. But on the campaign trail last year, she mostly tempered partisan economic talk and focused on what united most Venezuelans: the pain of family separations and the loss of political freedoms. Ms. Machado and her allies sought to show the election had been fraudulent by gathering a physical printout of the voting tally from the majority of voting machines after the polls closed. By the opposition’s count, Mr. González defeated Mr. Maduro by more than 2 to 1 . Unable to celebrate her Nobel win openly, Ms. Machado’s supporters greeted her winning the peace prize with private joy and hope on Friday. A brutal crackdown instituted by Mr. Maduro last year to remain in power forced many in the opposition into hiding. Hundreds of her supporters remain in jail. Top Trump administration officials have in recent weeks stepped up efforts to remove Mr. Maduro from power, with officials discussing a broad campaign that would escalate military pressure to try to force him out. The efforts are being led by Mr. Rubio , who in addition to his role as secretary of state is national security adviser. Mr. Rubio has argued that Mr. Maduro is an illegitimate leader who oversees the export of drugs to the United States, which he says poses an “ imminent threat .” An adviser to Ms. Machado told The New York Times last month that leaders of the Venezuela opposition have been speaking to the Trump administration about how to counter Mr. Maduro. Pedro Urruchurtu, the adviser, said that the opposition had developed a plan for the first 100 hours after Mr. Maduro’s ouster that would involve a transfer of power to Mr. González. “What we’re talking about is an operation to dismantle a criminal structure,” Mr. Urruchurtu said. Along with diplomatic, financial and other tools, he said, “it has to be done with the use of force, because otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to defeat a regime like the one we’re facing.” Reporting was contributed by Anatoly Kurmanaev, Edward Wong and Erin Mendell.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize.html,World,BBC,"By Julie Turkewitz, Jonathan Wolfe and Thomas Fuller",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10nobel-leadall-cwjq/10nobel-leadall-cwjq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T20:05:31+00:00,51d73281cb647059d8e161bc2c66efcf79b8ad80
c7dc5cfd6eb4,Nobel Organizers Look Into Surge of Bets for Winner Ahead of Announcement,"maria corina machado, donald trump, us, polymarket, norwegian nobel committee, nobel prize","The committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize was looking into online bets that suggested advance knowledge that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado had won — and perhaps efforts to profit off the information. The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Ms. Machado had won at about 10 a.m. local time on Friday. But starting late Thursday, wagers that she was the winner began appearing on Polymarket , the popular online prediction market. The bets pushed up the odds on Ms. Machado to more than 73 percent shortly after midnight. Then they fell for about 45 minutes as the odds of a win by Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, rose somewhat, but increased again after 3 a.m. and stayed elevated until the award was officially announced. “Espionage directed against the Norwegian Nobel Committee is unfortunately well known — both politically and economically motivated,” Erik Aasheim, a spokesman for the Norwegian Nobel Institute, said in a statement, adding, “Ahead of this year’s announcement, we have noticed that some have made significant financial gains by placing bets on this year’s prize. We will investigate whether this indicates that someone has unlawfully obtained information from us.” Prediction markets like Polymarket shot to prominence during the United States presidential campaign last year, particularly after bets on the election’s outcome appeared to correctly forecast President Trump’s victory. Proponents of such platforms say that the collective wisdom of speculators who back their predictions with money — and their ability to quickly incorporate a vast array of information — makes the predictions highly accurate. Polymarket drew extra attention after one pseudonymous trader , based in France, was identified as having bet heavily on a Trump victory, though the company said that the wagers did not appear to be an attempt to manipulate its market. A representative for Polymarket was not immediately available.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/nobel-prize-bets-machado-investigation.html,World,BBC,By Michael J. de la Merced,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Nobel-vwpk/10Nobel-vwpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T18:16:10+00:00,8e8ec5ee356cfdd8f910460dab79a35da50ca890

b056c9bc3801,"Holding Back Tears, Prince William Shows a New Side of a Future King","william, prince of wales, eugene levy, king charles iii, britain, london, apple tv","At a time when the British royal family has been convulsed by drama, infighting and a tendency by some royals to over-share, Prince William has remained largely aloof — loath to reveal the kinds of details found in “Spare,” the memoir by his estranged brother, Prince Harry. Yet William, too, has lifted the veil in recent weeks, in his own carefully managed way. Appearing with the Canadian comic actor Eugene Levy on an episode of his travel series, and later with a woman who lost her husband to suicide, William has shown a more personal side, speaking about his desire to change the monarchy after he becomes king and tearing up over another family’s tragedy. The two glimpses of William, 43, have hardly remade the public image of the eldest son of King Charles III. But they have filled in some blanks in the portrait of a man who has carefully cultivated the profile of a middle-aged husband and father, determined to shield himself and his family from undue scrutiny. The exercise in image making has taken on more urgency since his father was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. While Buckingham Palace insists that Charles, 76, is on the mend, the prospect of William having to step up to the throne no longer seems so distant. “He’s on fast forward,” said Tina Brown, the British American journalist who has written two books about the royal family. “His father had 50 years to tell the world who he was before becoming king. It’s essential for William to show the human side of himself before his image gets set in stone as the stoic foil to Harry.” In a video released Friday to coincide with World Mental Health Day, William met with Rhian Mannings, who lost a baby to illness and her husband to suicide. As the two sat at Ms. Mannings’s kitchen table in Cardiff, Wales, William asked her what she would say to her husband, if she could. “I would just like to sit him down like this and say, ‘Why didn’t you come to me?’” she replied. “Because he’s missed out on just so much joy.” William looked away, his eyes brimming with tears. “Are you OK?” Ms. Mannings asked. Struggling to compose himself, William said, “I’m sorry; it’s hard to ask you the questions.” It was a startling display of emotion — not least in contrast to the stiff-upper-lip stoicism of older-generation royals like Queen Elizabeth II — though it recalled the emotional encounters his mother, Princess Diana, had with people with AIDS in the 1990s. William’s focus on suicide prevention echoed his mother’s desire to destigmatize AIDS. In the appearance with Mr. Levy on his Apple TV+ series, “The Reluctant Traveler,” William offered a tour of Windsor Castle and offered some intriguing hints about how he might shake up the monarchy. “It’s safe to say that change is on my agenda,” William said to Mr. Levy, as the two sat over pints at a pub in Windsor. “Not overly radical change,” he added, “but changes that I think need to happen.” William arrived for the meeting on a motorized scooter. He hopped off and greeted Mr. Levy by telling him he loved “ American Pie,” the 1999 sex comedy in which Mr. Levy played a befuddled dad. That drew an obliging laugh from Mr. Levy, an actor whose deadpan delivery has spiced up movies like “Best in Show” and the TV series “Schitt’s Creek.” He told the prince that spending a day with him was a “bucket list” item, as the two set off on a walk around Windsor’s sprawling grounds. “Was getting drunk with Prince William on your bucket list?” the prince said with a mischievous smile (the two appeared to nurse their drinks — a Guinness for Mr. Levy, a cider for William). For Britain’s royals-obsessed press, William’s encounter with Mr. Levy was both tantalizing and threatening. By working with an American streaming service, William served notice that he could shape his narrative while bypassing the tabloids, which have long wielded power in shaping the image of the royals. When William’s wife, Catherine, announced that she had completed her chemotherapy in September 2024, she did so in a gauzy, three-minute video made by Will Warr, a London videographer who specializes in wedding videos. She and William have also posted videos of themselves with their three children on Instagram. The London papers noted, somewhat sniffily, that Mr. Levy did not broach a sensitive issue: William’s feud with Harry. Mr. Levy said he was not instructed by the prince’s staff to avoid it. But he told ITV News, “I had no interest in asking him about that, because it was, you know, a very delicate issue and certainly not up to me to get into it.” Pub visits aside, William left no doubt that he intended to preserve a zone of privacy around his family. “Those who overstep it, I’ll fight against,” he said to Mr. Levy. “It’s about knowing where the line is.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.

87ebeb23d31e,María Corina Machado of Venezuela Is Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,,"María Corina Machado, the winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has emerged as a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, arguing, like Mr. Trump, that Venezuela’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, poses an enormous security threat to the region. Ms. Machado, in statements to the press in recent weeks, has said that, should Mr. Maduro fall, her movement was prepared to take territorial and administrative control of Venezuela, and that they have a plan for the first 100 hours and the first 100 days of a transition. She has also touted an economic plan to American and other investors, saying that a democratic Venezuela under her movement's control has the potential to generate $1.7 trillion in wealth in 15 years. Since September, the Trump administration has been targeting what it calls drug boats in the Caribbean. But the size of the military buildup in the region, and Mr. Trump’s increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro, have led many people in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal — possibly by force. Ms. Machado has largely avoided commenting on whether Mr. Maduro’s removal should involve U.S. military intervention inside Venezuela. In an interview last month, her adviser for international affairs, Pedro Urruchurtu, said that her team was communicating with the Trump administration about plans for Mr. Maduro’s removal. The opposition’s strategy, he said, includes persuading other governments, including the United States, to take diplomatic, financial, intelligence and law enforcement actions against Mr. Maduro. But, he added: “It has to be done with the use of force, because otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to defeat a regime like the one we’re facing.” Ms. Machado’s party, Vente Venezuela, has been sharing online the threats made by Trump officials against alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers. “If you’re in the Caribbean, if you’re north of Venezuela,” the party wrote on X, echoing a statement from the U.S. Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, “and you’re trying to traffic drugs to the US, you’re a legitimate target for the US.” Over the last decade, as Venezuela’s economy crumbled, Mr. Maduro’s security forces hunted political enemies and the opposition weakened. Many in the country lost hope for any kind of political change. Then came Ms. Machado, who managed to unite voters around the common goals of restoring democracy and reuniting families torn apart by migration. A conservative former lawmaker who had been a political foil to the socialist ruling party, on the campaign trail Ms. Machado mostly tempered any partisan economic talk and focused on what united most Venezuelans: the pain of family separations and the loss of political freedoms. When the government banned her from running in the July 2024 election, she managed got a surrogate, Edmundo González , on the ballot. Despite constant harassment on the campaign trail, and the detention of many supporters, Ms. Machado crisscrossed her nation and inspired millions to come out on Election Day. Then, after Mr. Maduro declared victory, her movement collected and counted thousands of paper vote tallies from polling stations, uploading them online. Her movement said the tallies showed the opposition had won overwhelmingly. An independent vote monitor, the Carter Center, found that count to be accurate . It was the most resounding rejection of the regime created by Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, in its 25-year existence. But Ms. Machado had no way to enforce the results. The military stood by Mr. Maduro. Thousands of her supporters took to the streets. A government crackdown led to at least two dozen deaths and the capture of more than 2,000 political prisoners, ending the protests quickly. Ms. Machado went into hiding in Venezuela, and Mr. González fled to Spain. The election of Mr. Trump, who had tried to oust Mr. Maduro in his first term, was a turning point. As soon as his win was announced last year, Ms. Machado began trying to convince his allies that the U.S. president could successfully remove Mr. Maduro this time around. In a series of interviews with The New York Times late last year, Ms. Machado said that for Mr. Trump, Venezuela offered “an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.” Mr. Maduro was very weak, she claimed, and through a pressure campaign, Mr. Trump could force him to recognize the result of the 2024 Venezuelan vote — and leave. Ms. Machado has ties in Washington that go back more than 20 years. The U.S. government provided financial aid to a voters’ rights group she founded in the early 2000s, and she met President George W. Bush at the White House in 2005. She has known Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, for more than a decade, she said. But for a time, it was unclear if Mr. Trump would pay attention to Venezuela, or Ms. Machado’s call for help. In the early months of his administration, it seemed the United States was headed toward a semi-normalization of the relationship with Mr. Maduro’s government. A special envoy appointed by Mr. Trump, Richard Grenell, made an uncommon visit to Caracas, shaking hands with the autocrat, and began to negotiate economic and diplomatic deals. But something changed in August. The Trump administration began sending warships into the Caribbean, declared Mr. Maduro the head of terrorist organization flooding the United States with drugs — though only about 8 percent of the cocaine reaching the United States, and virtually none of the fentanyl, passes through Venezuela. Mr. Trump ordered the attacks on boats in the Caribbean, and directed Mr. Grenell to cut off diplomatic talks with Venezuela. On Fox News just after the U.S. began bombing boats near Venezuela, Ms. Machado said that Mr. Maduro “is understanding finally that the time of impunity is over and it is in his best interest to accept the will of the people that voted against him. It’s time to go .”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/10/world/nobel-peace-prize,World,BBC,By Pranav Baskar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/blogs/10NobelPromo/mosaic-2022-06-23t135435z2066240319rc2pxu9m2s1wrtrmadp3advertising-cannes02-787-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:25:03+00:00,e99d68ea8d106d5ede13521e82baa68e3a672e34
a45652b36219,Mount Everest Just Recorded Some of Its Most Intense Snowfall Ever,"weather, snow snowstorms, cold spells;polar vortex, mountain, himalayas, mount everest","The storm that came spinning out of the Bay of Bengal in the north of the Indian Ocean last weekend was already notable. It pounded the Himalayas — the tallest mountains in the world — and unleashed a torrent of snow that closed roads, buried tents and stranded hundreds of people on Mount Everest. Now, data from a weather station at an Everest base camp suggests that the rate at which the snow fell during part of the storm may have broken records or, at the very least, was one of the most significant ever recorded. Baker Perry, an expert in high mountain extremes and a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, called one measurement of the snow that fell “off the charts.” “No wonder tents were collapsing,” he said. The Record at Stake It wasn’t that long ago that a team of ambitious meteorologists trekked to Mount Everest, not to summit the mountain but to install weather stations at the highest points on Earth. They wanted to better understand the atmosphere and how it affects the water that is stored in the world’s highest mountain chains. The weather stations transmit real-time information about temperature, humidity and precipitation from five locations around the mountain. Three of the stations transmit information in real time . Two others are offline, including one — the highest weather station in the world — near Everest’s summit. The other, down the mountain at a place called South Col, has data about last weekend’s snowstorm that Dr. Perry is eager to collect in person. Based on what he had seen so far, though, Dr. Perry called last weekend’s storm “far and away the biggest” he had observed since he helped install the stations in 2019. It all has to do with what meteorologists call “water equivalent precipitation,” or the amount of water that is left when a pile of snow is melted. Water equivalent measurements are especially useful in comparing places that experience intense periods of precipitation, as with lake-effect snow around the Great Lakes or atmospheric rivers in the Pacific Northwest. It’s a scientific way to answer the question of how much rain or snow actually fell, and is often measured in 12-hour and 24-hour increments. One of the highest water equivalent measurements ever recorded occurred in 1921 during a snowstorm in Silver Lake, Colo., when 142 millimeters, or about 5.6 inches, of precipitation fell as snow over 27 and a half hours. That amount has stood as the U.S. record and, though it is disputed, is considered by some to be a world record for snowfall. On Everest, the highest measurements recorded before this storm were 38 millimeters in a 24-hour period in July 2021 and just over 26 millimeters in a 12-hour period in October that same year. On Saturday, Dr. Perry said, the Everest base camp reported 122 millimeters in 24 hours, 92 millimeters of which came in just 12 hours. Both are more than three times as high as the totals from the 2021 storms. This week, Dr. Perry has been feverishly checking with other scientists across the world to compare data. For now, he said, “I am certainly not comfortable claiming that this is a world record, but I can say that the 12-hour and 24-hour liquid equivalent totals are amongst the highest ever recorded.” The Scientific Debate As the storm swept into the region, it brought along with it water vapor from the Bay of Bengal, said Jay Cordeira, an assistant director for precipitation science at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. He compared it to what happened last year when Hurricane Helene’s circulation passed from the Gulf of Mexico through the Southern Appalachians: The mountains caused the clouds to be squeezed and wrung dry, creating flooding as all that rain fell to the ground. Because of the higher elevation of the Himalayas, the precipitation fell as snow. There’s disagreement over how significant the snowfall was. Dinkar Kayastha, with the Nepal Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, said it was “part of the regular monsoon process and not considered unusual or extreme.” The region’s annual monsoon season is caused by the changing of winds and frequently features heavy rainfall. But Arbindra Khadka, an expert in meteorology at Tribhuvan University in Nepal, said the “large-scale continuous precipitation and snowfall” set this storm apart, as did the amount of snow that fell over such a short period of time on Everest. He called it “a rare event in October,” the kind of snowstorm that happens only every 25 to 50 years. This is where the water equivalent becomes more important than the snow depth. Snow depth, which is how most records are kept in the United States, is not an apples-to-apples comparison, Dr. Baker said, because the air can change the density of snow. So, scientifically, the only way to compare snow amounts is to melt it down and get the water equivalent. Several factors can influence a record, including the fact that someone from Dr. Perry’s team has to get back to base camp to retrieve the physical log of the data and calibrate it. That involves accounting for powerful wind speeds that can make it difficult for snow to fall into the bucket that collects the measurement. These wind readings can allow scientists to make adjustments that can add up to an accurate water equivalent reading. Dr. Baker noted that accurate readings of precipitation from extreme locations like Everest have become possible only in recent years and that there are many remote places where very little data has been collected. “These types of events may be more common under the right circumstances, especially in high mountain Asia, than we know,” he said. “We just happen to have these gauges at Everest base camp, and we’re seeing this.” Just as snow in the Sierra Nevada in the United States is beneficial for the water supply in California, the snow in this region is valuable for Nepal and India. As the planet heats up, the mountains in the region have grown warmer in recent years. That can be a problem, as more of the precipitation that once fell as snow falls instead as rain. Dr. Perry said the change could have “huge hydrological implications” and could cause more of the moisture to run off at once, potentially setting off floods as the landscape is unable to absorb so much moisture at one time.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/weather/mount-everest-record-snow.html,World,BBC,By Judson Jones,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06int-china-everest-vjzb/06int-china-everest-vjzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:20:27+00:00,e5b7d01b0da8d5d9c215b8c27a26b3ca63827259
7c4efe71a4c1,"In Retaliatory Move, Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on Chinese Goods","us politics, us foreign policy, international trade, tariff, rare earths, regulation and deregulation, donald trump, xi jinping, china","President Trump on Friday said he would impose a 100 percent tariff on all products from China in response to curbs Beijing announced this week on rare-earth minerals, a rapid escalation of tensions between the world's largest economies. On Truth Social, Mr. Trump wrote that the tariffs would take effect on Nov. 1 and be imposed “over and above” other tariffs on Chinese exports, which are already 30 percent and in some cases much higher. The United States would also put export controls on critical software, he said. In an earlier post on Friday, the president threatened to retaliate and cancel a planned meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump called the curbs that China put out this week on its exports of rare-earth minerals “sinister and hostile” and said they would “make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World.” He added that he had planned to meet Mr. Xi in two weeks at an international economic conference in South Korea, “but now there seems to be no reason to do so.” “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” he wrote. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” Markets shuddered at the developments — the S&P 500 index sliding more than 2 percent on Friday. Speaking Friday evening, the president suggested that the tariffs could be walked back before the Nov. 1 deadline and that he would not necessarily cancel his planned meeting with Mr. Xi. “We’ll see what happens,” Mr. Trump said. He called China’s move “very, very bad.” Rare-earth minerals, which are vital for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets, have been at the center of tensions between the United States and China this year. Mr. Trump has also placed extreme tariffs on Chinese exports before, only to walk them back after they restricted trade and hurt companies in both countries. In April, the Chinese government responded to the stiff tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese goods by clamping down on mineral exports destined for U.S. automakers and defense manufacturers. The Trump administration tried to encourage China to back down by imposing its own restrictions on exports of chip design software, airplane engines and other products. U.S. tariffs on Chinese products rose to a minimum of 145 percent, bringing much trade between the countries to a halt and raising concerns about empty American store shelves. China’s mineral curbs threatened to close U.S. factories and forced the United States, which depends on Chinese supplies, to pull back . Ultimately, officials from both countries reached a fragile truce in meetings this spring that led to Mr. Trump’s reducing his tariffs and Beijing’s approving more mineral exports. On Thursday, Beijing again escalated its controls , asserting broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology. The Chinese government said it would require companies anywhere in the world to obtain licenses if they are exporting products containing even a minimal amount of Chinese-produced rare earths, including for chip manufacturing. Those exports would also be controlled if the minerals were produced using Chinese mining, processing or magnet-making technologies. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be denied those licenses, it said. The Chinese government also put new controls on equipment needed to manufacture batteries for electric cars. The global nature of the Chinese restrictions mirror those that the United States has put on semiconductors, which dictate that any company using American chip technology anywhere in the world must follow United States guidelines. China has responded to those restrictions by developing its own framework to regulate industries that it dominates. China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths and performs the chemical processing for roughly 90 percent of the global supply of the minerals. The new restrictions have caused significant anxiety among U.S. companies. Analysts said the new limits could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple. Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent. On Friday, China also announced an antimonopoly investigation into the American chipmaker Qualcomm and new fees for U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports. Analysts had speculated that China’s mineral restrictions could be an effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. If so, it could backfire. In addition to the president’s calls for retaliation, other critics of China said the measures highlighted the need for the United States to reduce its exposure to the Chinese economy. The Chinese government has set out ambitious plans in recent decades to dominate various industries, including steel, shipbuilding, robotics, rare earths and biomedicine. John Moolenaar, the Republican chairman of the House Select Committee on China, called Beijing’s action “an economic declaration of war against the United States and a slap in the face to President Trump amid his efforts to fight for a level playing field.” Mr. Moolenaar said the United States should immediately pass legislation to end preferential trade treatment for China, build the U.S. supply of minerals and “strangle China’s technology sector with export controls instead of selling it advanced chips.” Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the think tank Asia Society Policy Institute, said the president’s statements showed “how fragile the emerging détente between the two countries really is.” “Beijing has become increasingly assertive, believing it has the upper hand in the bilateral relationship,” she said. But Mr. Trump’s counter threats showed that “two can play this game.” With the planned summit between the leaders in just over two weeks, it was unclear whether the two sides would be willing to de-escalate to hold the meeting, Ms. Cutler added. In his social media post, Mr. Trump said that China’s policies “came out of nowhere.” The United States’ relationship with China over the past six months had been a very good one, he said. The president said that although China had a monopoly on rare-earth minerals, the United States had other monopolies that were “stronger and more far reaching.” He added, “I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW!” The White House has been planning for President Trump to travel to Asia later this month, where he would meet Mr. Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea. The plans had generated speculation about whether the meeting could lead to an economic deal between the countries, potentially including Chinese purchases of American products or Chinese investment in the United States. Beijing has also been interested in having the United States roll back the global controls it has put on China’s access to advanced A.I. chips. American farmers have asked the administration to push China to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybean exports that have had a crippling impact this year . Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky soybean farmer who is the president of the American Soybean Association, said that his group was “extremely disappointed” that the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would be canceled. “Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis,” Mr. Ragland said.

247db6628f89,Machado’s Peace Prize Is Latest Nobel for Female Democracy Campaigners,"nobel prize, nobel foundation, aung san suu kyi, narges mohammadi, venezuela, democracy, ellen johnson sirleaf","The Norwegian Nobel Committee’s decision to award the Peace Prize to María Corina Machado is the latest honor given to a female democracy campaigner in recent years. In 2023, Narges Mohammadi of Iran was recognized for her crusade for women’s rights , which the committee said “made her a symbol of freedom and standard-bearer in the struggle against the Iranian theocracy.” In 1991, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar was awarded the prize for “her nonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights.” Ms. Mohammadi, 53, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 80, were in prison when they were honored by the Nobel committee — and they are in prison today. Both are reported to be in ill health. Ms. Mohammadi was a leader at the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an organization that promotes democracy and women’s rights. A founder of the organization, Shirin Ebadi , a human rights lawyer and mentor to Ms. Mohammadi, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. Ms. Mohammadi’s campaigning began at a young age. The Iranian morality police arrested her when she was 19 for having dared to wear an orange coat, according to the speech she wrote to accept the Peace Prize. (As with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, her children accepted the honor in her stead.) After that incident, Ms. Mohammadi was arrested on more than a dozen occasions, and she is now serving a 10-year sentence for “spreading anti-state propaganda.” When she was briefly released from prison to recover from surgery last year, she was recorded on video chanting a slogan that animated a female-led uprising against the Islamic Republic: “Women, life, freedom!” She was not, as required under Iranian law, wearing a hijab. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father was considered modern Myanmar’s founding father, was thrust into the political spotlight in 1988 when the ruling junta brutally suppressed pro-democracy rallies. She became the leader of the National League for Democracy party, which won elections in 1990 that the top brass ignored. She spent most of the next two decades under house arrest before being released in 2010. When a new clutch of generals began to loosen the political reins, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was elected a member of Parliament and later became the nation’s de facto leader. But after her party won another landslide election in 2020, the military staged a coup. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned again, along with hundreds of other pro-democracy politicians. Myanmar is now engulfed by civil war. Other women who have been awarded the Peace Prize for their campaigns for democracy and women’s rights include Tawakkol Karman of Yemen and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia, who were joint honorees in 2011.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/nobel-peace-prize-women-democracy.html,World,BBC,By Hannah Beech,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10nobel-dissidents-hjvt/10nobel-dissidents-hjvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T12:04:16.509000+00:00,3b377af51e5ae3f9bdb28ccaf80c1ac0af114214
3b9adea5fdb4,France’s Domestic Instability Has Weakened Its Diplomatic Clout,"politics, international relations, legislature, european commission, eu, national rally;national front, marine le pen, emmanuel macron, europe, france, russian invasion of ukraine (2022)","No matter how elegant the performance of a country’s leader on the world stage, domestic instability still diminishes its global influence. President Emmanuel Macron of France has shown he is one of Europe’s most decisive and vibrant leaders, but his inability to find a government that can deal with spiraling debt and political division is undercutting his credibility as an international actor of consequence. Mr. Macron, deeply unpopular at home, is seeking to form a sixth government in the past 21 months, still hoping to find a prime minister who can cobble together support in a Parliament split at least three ways, with no faction able to command a stable majority. After a long day of negotiations on Friday with party leaders, Mr. Macron announced that he had asked Sébastian Lecornu , who had resigned on Monday, to try yet again. “Domestic instability undermines credibility even if foreign-policy competence lies with the president,” said Daniela Schwarzer, an expert in Franco-German relations and a member of the executive board of the Bertelsmann Foundation, a nonprofit institute. “Because as soon as it’s about money, it depends on the Parliament and on the budget,” over which Mr. Macron has no direct control, she said. A paralyzed Paris erodes Europe’s strategic weight and ability to make decisions, especially on rearmament. Mr. Macron may promise more money for the military in any new French budget, as he did this summer, but it is France’s Parliament that controls the funds, making his efforts to respond to a newly aggressive Russia seem hollow.

A conservative former lawmaker, Ms. Machado has long been a foil to Venezuela’s socialist ruling party. She has been in hiding since the summer of 2024, when President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory in a vote that was widely seen as rigged . The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize, said that it chose Ms. Machado primarily for her efforts to advance democracy “in the face of ever-expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela.” In its statement , the committee praised Ms. Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Ms. Machado supports President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, which he says is meant to stop drug smuggling to the United States from Latin America. In a series of interviews with The New York Times late last year, Ms. Machado said that, for Mr. Trump, Venezuela offered “an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.” Here’s what to know about Ms. Machado, the movement she leads and what this honor means for Venezuela. Who is María Corina Machado? Ms. Machado, 58, is the eldest daughter of a prominent family in Caracas. She attended an elite Catholic girls’ school in Caracas and a boarding school in Wellesley, Mass. She studied engineering and finance and later worked for the family company, Sivensa, a large steel producer. Parts of the company were expropriated in 2010 by President Hugo Chávez, the founder of the country’s modern socialist movement, who took control of dozens of privately owned companies as part of his nationalization program. In the early 2000s, she became a political activist and a founder of Súmate, a voter rights group that led a failed effort to recall Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. Mr. Maduro has held power since. Ms. Machado joined the National Assembly in 2010, winning a record number of votes. She leads the Vente Venezuela opposition party, and in 2023 she announced a bid for the presidency. But she was blocked from running in the 2024 election over what the government said were financial irregularities when she was a national legislator. She called this a politically motivated maneuver meant to keep her from power and backed a surrogate, a little-known former diplomat named Edmundo González . Mr. González ran against Mr. Maduro, who claimed victory in the election. The opposition, however, collected evidence that it said showed Mr. González won by a wide margin and alleged that Mr. Maduro had stolen the vote. The Carter Center, an independent vote monitoring organization, has called the opposition’s count accurate . Why was she awarded the Nobel Peace Prize? Jorgen Watne Frydnes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told reporters after the announcement that the judges weighed the security implications of giving the prize to Ms. Machado. “This is the discussion we have every year for all candidates, particularly when the person who receives the prize is, in fact, in hiding because of serious threats to her life,” he said, adding that the committee believed the award would support her cause. Mr. Frydnes said he hoped that she would be able to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in December, but that it would depend on the security situation. The Nobel committee, in giving the prize to Ms. Machado, warned of pressure on democracy across the globe. “Democracy is also in retreat internationally,” the committee wrote. “Democracy — understood as the right to freely express one’s opinion, to cast one’s vote and to be represented in elective government — is the foundation of peace both within countries and between countries.” What does she think about Mr. Trump’s moves toward Venezuela? Ms. Machado has emerged as a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, arguing, like Mr. Trump, that Mr. Maduro poses a national security threat to the region. After the United States began bombing suspected drug boats in the Caribbean last month, she said in an interview to Fox News : “This is about saving lives, not only Venezuelan lives, but also lives of American people, because as you have said, and we have heard, Maduro is the head of a narco-terrorist structure of cooperation.” Ms. Machado, in statements to the press in recent weeks, has said that, should Mr. Maduro fall, her movement was prepared to take territorial and administrative control of Venezuela. She has also promoted an economic plan to U.S. and other investors, saying that a democratic Venezuela under her movement’s control has the potential to generate $1.7 trillion in wealth in 15 years, in part by privatizing the oil industry. Since September, the Trump administration has been targeting what it calls drug boats in the Caribbean. But the size of the military buildup in the region, and Mr. Trump’s increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro, have led many in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-venezuela.html,World,BBC,By Jonathan Wolfe and Julie Turkewitz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/24/multimedia/10nobel-prize-machado-anlakeng/10nobel-prize-machado-anlakeng-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T10:32:21+00:00,ac61931fca80efa334803675daf523dc9e36f0fc

Men carried bags, women carried young children, and older children held hands as they made their way up the dusty seaside road toward the ruins of Gaza City, which they were ordered to flee weeks ago. Some said they were heading north for the first time since the war began. Though the surroundings were bleak, the mood was jubilant. “The crowds are unbelievable,” said Shamekh al-Dibs, who fled south with his family last month. “People are so happy, even if what they’re going back to is destruction.” Israel agreed early Friday morning to a cease-fire deal with Hamas, which the military said came into effect at noon. As part of the agreement, Hamas would release the remaining hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, while Israeli troops would partially withdraw. The deal was based on a proposal presented by President Trump last week. On Friday, a spokesman for Israel’s Parliament said Mr. Trump was expected to visit the chamber in Jerusalem on Monday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-israel-hamas.html,World,BBC,"By Liam Stack, Aaron Boxerman and Bilal Shbair",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10vid-gaza-cease-fire-gjlv/10vid-gaza-cease-fire-gjlv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:46:57+00:00,3b75ab16776e5d549b503c7712971b0f2db4e38a
e6ca81562cac,Venezuela’s Maduro Offered the U.S. His Nation’s Riches to Avoid Conflict,"us foreign policy, embargoes sanctions, oil and gasoline, energy industry, chevron, conocophillips, shell, state department, maria corina machado, marco rubio, donald trump, venezuela, us, international relations","Venezuelan officials, hoping to end their country’s clash with the United States, offered the Trump administration a dominant stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in discussions that lasted for months, according to multiple people close to the talks. The far-reaching offer remained on the table as the Trump administration called the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela a “narco-terror cartel,” amassed warships in the Caribbean and began blowing up boats that American officials say were carrying drugs from Venezuela. Under a deal discussed between a senior U.S. official and Mr. Maduro’s top aides, the Venezuelan strongman offered to open up all existing and future oil and gold projects to American companies, give preferential contracts to American businesses, reverse the flow of Venezuelan oil exports from China to the United States, and slash his country’s energy and mining contracts with Chinese, Iranian and Russian firms. The Trump administration ended up rebuffing Mr. Maduro’s economic concessions and cut off diplomacy with Venezuela last week. The move effectively killed the deal, at least for now, the people close to the discussion said. Though the United States has been targeting what it calls drug boats, the cutoff of diplomacy, the military buildup near Venezuela and the increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro by Trump administration officials have led many in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal . Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state and national security adviser, has been the leading voice in the administration’s push to oust Mr. Maduro. He has called Mr. Maduro an illegitimate leader who is a “fugitive from American justice” and has been skeptical of the diplomatic approach conducted by a special U.S. envoy, Richard Grenell. Proponents of diplomacy acknowledge that Mr. Rubio’s hard line approach has prevailed for now. But they believe their efforts could eventually bear fruit, pointing to Mr. Trump’s sudden reversals on other major foreign policy issues, such as the war in Ukraine , trade with China or Iran’s nuclear program . This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen American and Venezuelan representatives of disparate factions calling for diplomacy with Mr. Maduro. They described their discussions on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Publicly, the Venezuelan government has responded to Mr. Trump’s military escalation with defiance and vows to defend what it calls a socialist revolution started in the 1990s by Mr. Maduro’s late predecessor and mentor Hugo Chávez. At the same time, Mr. Maduro has said he remains open to negotiations and his government continues accepting deportation flights from the United States. Behind the scenes, however, Venezuela’s senior officials, with Mr. Maduro’s blessing, have offered Washington far-reaching concessions that would essentially eliminate the vestiges of resource nationalism at the core of Mr. Chávez’s movement. While Mr. Grenell and Venezuelan officials made progress on economic issues, they failed to agree on Mr. Maduro’s political future, according to the people close to the negotiations. Venezuela’s foreign minister, Yván Gil, said in an interview last month that Mr. Maduro would not negotiate his exit. Mr. Maduro has repeatedly repressed democratic challenges to his rule after assuming the presidency in 2013. He held on to power last year after losing a presidential election by rigging the results and brutally suppressing protests . Mr. Grenell declined to comment for this article. The State Department, the White House and Venezuela’s government did not respond to requests for comment. In Washington, American officials offer differing assessments of the talks. One U.S. official said the reports of negotiations over the lifting of sanctions and access to the Venezuelan market was “not an accurate assessment of what took place.” But other American officials said U.S. and Venezuelan officials held repeated talks over what economic normalization would look like, including access to Venezuelan energy markets by American companies and a lifting of U.S. sanctions. As Mr. Grenell and Mr. Maduro’s envoys negotiated a deal, the leader of Venezuela’s main opposition movement, María Corina Machado, pitched her own economic proposal in New York. She argued that even greater economic wealth — $1.7 trillion in 15 years — awaited U.S. companies in Venezuela if her movement launched a political transition. (Ms. Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for what the Norwegian Nobel Committee described as “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.”) Ms. Machado’s economic adviser, Sary Levy, said the investment deals offered by Mr. Maduro would never materialize without democracy, rule of law and individual freedoms. “What Maduro offers investors is not stability, it's control — control maintained through terror,” said Ms. Levy. “The Trump Administration has shown a clear intention to not fall for these offers of easy solutions.” Venezuela currently produces about one million barrels of oil a day, down from about three million when Mr. Chávez took power. The bulk of Venezuela’s oil exports go to China, except for about 100,000 barrels per day that the U.S. energy giant Chevron sells to the United States. Most experts agree that Venezuela could quickly ramp up oil output with a major injection of foreign capital, though they differ on whether this is achievable under the current government. “Our message to the oil companies is: We want you here, certainly,” Ms. Machado told American corporate representatives in June. “We want you here not producing crumbs of a couple hundred thousand barrels a day. We want you here producing millions of barrels a day.” Ms. Machado declined to comment for this article. In the past, the United States framed its support for a new government in Venezuela as a human rights imperative. In contrast, the economic points discussed by Mr. Maduro’s envoys with Mr. Grenell echoed a mercantilist worldview that Mr. Trump has promoted elsewhere. Mr. Trump has demanded access to Ukrainian minerals as payment for U.S. support for Kyiv’s war effort. He has frequently lamented that the United States did not get Iraqi oil after the 2003 invasion. He agreed to keep U.S. troops in Syria in 2019 on the condition that America would “keep the oil.” The deal discussed between Mr. Grenell and Venezuelan officials was especially sweeping, representing arguably the most ambitious attempt at resource diplomacy during the president’s second term. Normalizing trade and allowing American companies back into Venezuela could be tempting to some U.S. officials because of the country’s oil reserves, the world’s largest, as well as significant deposits of natural gas, gold, iron, bauxite and coltan, a mineral mix used in electric batteries. Mr. Maduro’s economic outreach to the United States has also extended to the private sector, in an attempt to strengthen his hand in Washington. Venezuela’s state oil company has given Chevron, the largest American company working in Venezuela, full control of their joint oil projects and the two entities have discussed giving Chevron a stake in another major oil field. Venezuelan officials have worked to repair relations with another U.S. oil giant, ConocoPhillips, which left Venezuela in 2007 after the government seized its operations. Mr. Maduro’s government and Conoco have been negotiating an oil trading deal as recently as this year, according to two people familiar with the talks. Chevron said its business dealings in Venezuela comply with all applicable Venezuelan and U.S. laws. Conoco did not respond to a request for comment. The outreach by Venezuelan officials and business leaders came closest to achieving a diplomatic breakthrough in May, according to the people briefed on the talks. As a sign of good will, Mr. Grenell that month orchestrated the return of a Venezuelan toddler stranded in the United States after her parents were deported , giving Mr. Maduro a domestic political win. Venezuela’s government reciprocated shortly afterward by releasing a U.S. Air Force veteran jailed in the country and delivering him to Mr. Grenell . Mr. Maduro came to support most of the economic terms in the proposal discussed with Mr. Grenell. A person familiar with the negotiations said Mr. Maduro initially wavered on the American demand to limit Venezuela’s economic ties with China, Russia and Iran. But he eventually saw that loosening those alliances was an inevitable price for avoiding American military intervention, the person said. To maximize income in the face of U.S. pressure, Venezuela has also stopped sending oil to Cuba, worsening acute electricity shortages in the allied nation. Mr. Grenell’s economic negotiations with Mr. Maduro’s envoys faced strong opposition from Mr. Rubio, a Cuban American and former senator who has long viewed Mr. Maduro’s downfall as a crucial step to ending the Communist dictatorship on the island. The proponents of economic engagement with Mr. Maduro have managed to score minor victories. Chevron got its U.S. Treasury license to operate in Venezuela reinstated in July, according to the Venezuelan government . The company succeeded in overturning the ban imposed by Mr. Trump months earlier after a concerted lobbying push in Washington, according to people familiar with the deal. The Treasury Department on Wednesday issued another license that in effect allows Shell, Europe’s largest energy company, to restart work in Venezuela. Under a new permit, Shell could begin producing gas from a massive offshore Venezuelan field as soon as next year, according to a person familiar with the deal. The gas from the field, known as Dragon, will be processed and sold from neighboring Trinidad. Shell directed questions to the license holder, the government of Trinidad & Tobago, whose officials did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Rubio said last month that the United States would ensure that the Dragon project would “not provide significant benefit to the Maduro regime.” Mr. Maduro has signed off on a stipulation that would have Shell invest in social projects in Venezuela instead of paying his government. For the Maduro government, the key benefit is showing that Venezuela remains open for business.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-us-oil.html,World,BBC,"By Anatoly Kurmanaev, Julian E.

2a9e95a0a16c,"Every Artist Has a Favorite Subject. For Some, That’s Math.","mathematics, sculpture, art, design academy eindhoven, henry segerman, eindhoven netherlands","It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that the Dutch sculptor Rinus Roelofs organizes his life around the annual Bridges conference, an international event celebrating synergies between math and art. In July, the conference drew more than 400 artistically minded mathematicians and mathematically minded artists to the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Dr. Roelofs’s main contribution to the program was a half-ton, eight-foot-tall metal sculpture called “Dancing Cubes.” “I do not call my art ‘mathematical art,’” Dr. Roelofs said in a video interview about a week later. “It’s art about mathematics. Every artist has a favorite subject, things you want to talk about. For me, that’s math.” “Dancing Cubes” is a riff on the geometric notion of duality: a relationship by which one form emerges, or can be constructed, from another. “If you have one object, you can make another object, the dual of the first object, and if you put the two together you have a new construction,” Dr. Roelofs said. Duality played a part in Dr. Roelofs’s dual Ph.D. in architecture and mathematics, which he obtained in 2020 at age 66. His artistic practice had always been research-driven, and in 2012, while creating a sculpture with equilateral triangles, he made a number of mathematical discoveries. For instance, he found a new series of uniform polyhedra based on helical rods. “ They look like spiky, twisted cylinders ,” said Doris Schattschneider, a mathematician and professor emerita at Moravian University who was on Dr. Roelofs’s thesis committee. Dr. Schattschneider, an expert on math-art intersections, noted that an elegant example of duality involves the cube and the regular octahedron, a three-dimensional geometric solid with eight faces, each an equilateral triangle. These two polyhedra, she said, “are called geometric duals because both have 12 edges, but the cube has six faces and eight vertexes while the octahedron has eight faces and six vertexes.” “Rinus doesn’t just do this classic display of duality, growing one construction inside the other,” Dr. Schattschneider said. “He rounds the edges and sometimes does a twist, so the end result is an intriguing sculpture.” For “Dancing Cubes,” Dr. Roelofs used a technique of his own devising — called an extrusion transformation — to extend his creation from classical geometry to innovative art. The sculpture is composed of only two elements: a right-angled triangle (30 copies) and a rounded triangular variation (12 copies). “One needs the other to exist,” Dr. Roelofs said. “If you take away one, the sculpture will fall apart.” The artwork earned its name because when it is assembled small cubes emerge along the central axis. “It’s a little surprise,” Dr. Roelofs said. A larger art exhibition of similar wonders is the centerpiece of every Bridges conference. This year, the exhibition drew 184 submissions. “This is the biggest and best Bridges ever,” Dr. Schattschneider said in an email from Eindhoven. Here is a sampling of a few of the other pieces from the exhibition: “Gradient of Grain” was created by Edmund Harriss, a mathematician and artist at the University of Arkansas, using a computer-controlled router. The radial carvings run along the so-called gradient, perpendicular to the tree’s growth rings. The growth rings serve as inputs that direct the carving algorithm. “When using digital manufacturing to render geometry, the mathematics is often imposed on the material,” Dr. Harriss noted in his artist’s statement. “As a material, however, wood talks back, revealing patterning of grain, whatever the geometry does.” Kanata Warisaya, a doctoral student in architecture and engineering at the University of Tokyo, said in an interview that “the fun of geometry” motivated him to create “ Spherical Hinged Tessellation feat. TMK122 .” Nevertheless, he envisioned this squeezable sphere as a stress toy: “I find it relaxing.” He made it in an art-science class led by Tomohiro Tachi, a professor of computational origami at the University of Tokyo, and Asao Tokolo, an artist. “Scissor Tessellation” is by Seri Nishimoto, also a doctoral student at the University of Tokyo. The piece is constructed from a repeating pattern of 48 scissorlike units (four rows by 12 columns), each scissor with an arm-to-length ratio of four centimeters to seven centimeters. “The repetition of the same unit creates an interesting, nontrivial transformation into a curved surface,” Ms. Nishimoto said. Jill Borcherds, a retired secondary school math teacher in Stevenage, England, created a colorful “Fabric Hexaflexagon.” A flexagon is a flat, folded geometric structure; when flexed along the folds, its various faces emerge. “I tried to bring out the connections between art and maths as a way of engaging students,” Ms. Borcherds said. “Those who struggled were motivated when careful measuring, calculating and constructing produced a beautiful design or 3-D object. So often I have witnessed the sense of wonder appearing when the third face of a hexaflexagon appears.” And then the fourth, fifth and sixth. “Doo-dah” is a digital creature discovered by John Winston Garth, a computer scientist in Athens, Ala. His artist’s statement explains: “The term ‘computerrarium’ describes it well. Conway’s Game of Life is just that — an environment with rules that mimic life’s, boiled down to their simplest form: birth, death and survival. This discovery, ‘Doo-dah,’ is an example of a precise combination of cells generated by software tailored for the job. Hidden creatures exist in this environment, finding a balance within the typical randomness.” This video shows two copies of the same gizmo, one white and one green, made by Henry Segerman, a mathematician at Oklahoma State University. Called “Expanding (3, 4, 5) Triangle,” the mechanisms are constructed from expanding racks , a system of circular gears (pinions) meshing with linear gears (racks). The white version is fully-contracted, and the green version is fully expanded. “When any part of the triangle is pulled or pushed, the entire structure gets bigger or smaller,” Dr. Segerman said. Generally, the ultimate dream with expanding mechanisms is to have a solid block of material when the racks are contracted, and then, when the racks are expanded, for all the material to be optimally deployed in a strong and stable structure. David Reimann, a mathematician and computer scientist at Albion College in Michigan, described “Square Root of Two” as a sort of algorithmic topiary. The digits of the square root of two are outlined — in the root system’s negative space — along the diagonal of a square, conveying the relationship between a unit square and the length of its diagonal.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/science/mathematics-art-roelofs.html,World,BBC,By Siobhan Roberts,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/00SCI-MATH-ART1-01-bhcz/00SCI-MATH-ART1-01-bhcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:01:22+00:00,9b524136384cec4df851f96d8c0eca81bfe3d625
465b8dfe4801,Mexico’s President Is Popular. So Is Her Professional Lookalike.,"claudia sheinbaum, tamara henaine, impersonators;impressionists, politics, social media, mexico, mexico city, actor, personal profile;people story","People craned their necks or did double-takes, shocked at the woman walking by. Some asked for selfies, others for government help. One woman offered a blessing, one man burst into song. Everyone had the same question. “Are you the president?” asked Manuel H. Garza, 66, a Mexican retiree, amazed to see her strolling around the streets of Mexico City. It was not President Claudia Sheinbaum , as many thought, but an actress who has tied her fortunes to the country’s first female head of state and who has vaulted into national fame by dint of their uncanny resemblance . Ms. Sheinbaum and the actress, Tamara Henaine, are the same height. They have similarly dark eyes and hair. Even their smiles look alike. (Granted, Ms. Henaine has been practicing.) In Ms. Henaine’s mind, she was born for this role. “I swear it feels like it,” she said, adding, “I believe in destiny.” For now, through Ms. Sheinbaum’s first year in office, destiny has been good for Ms. Henaine’s career. As the real president has delicately managed threats from President Trump and crises at home , Ms. Sheinbaum’s recent approval ratings reached as high as 79 percent . Ms. Henaine, 33, has seen her popularity explode, too. She is frequently mistaken on the street for the president. Millions have watched her social media videos impersonating Ms. Sheinbaum, and she recently launched a theatrical comedy about the president and Mr. Trump. Ms. Henaine calls her character Claudita, or Little Claudia. Describing herself an independent actress, she said she is not trying to provide a political boost to the president, though she said she admires her composure, intelligence and other attributes. Nor has Ms. Sheinbaum’s team or party ever paid her, she said, adding that she has also turned down requests to hawk products or brands as Claudita. Sometimes, people confusing her for the president lodge their civic complaints with Ms. Henaine, airing grievances about broken sidewalks or government funding. To differentiate herself from Ms. Sheinbaum in her private life, Ms. Henaine sometimes dyes her hair a little blond. Ms. Henaine also worries that, after so many years playing one person, she will be pigeonholed as an actress. Even though she was confident in her skills, she has been studying psychology as a backup career. “Also it’s part of the process of playing such a powerful, strong character, people blend you into the character,” she said. Ms. Henaine is much younger than Ms. Sheinbaum, 63, and the two aren’t related. But she looks so much like the president that she has teased her own mother about it. “I’m going to take a DNA test,” she said, “or I’m going to send Claudia my adoption letter.” Ms. Henaine’s career has progressed alongside that of Ms. Sheinbaum, who was a climate scientist before entering politics. Ms. Sheinbaum’s initial stint in government was as the environment minister of Mexico City, a role she was named to after her mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, became mayor in 2000. When he became president in 2018, she ran for election as Mexico City’s mayor and won. Ms. Henaine had long dreamed of becoming an actress. She attended the acting school of the Mexican television giant Televisa, and mostly performed in telenovelas, melodramas and theater. Until Ms. Sheinbaum’s mayoral campaign. It was then that producers of a well-known TV show, a political satire, spotted her and cast her as the rising politician. Ms. Henaine said it was the first time anyone had told her she bore a resemblance to Ms. Sheinbaum. Back then, Ms. Sheinbaum had curly hair, so Ms. Henaine wore a wig on the show, said Dulce López, one of the producers who tapped Ms. Henaine for the part. But in recent years, Ms. Sheinbaum has worn her hair straight, creating an “identical” resemblance, Ms. López said. Ms. Henaine played Ms. Sheinbaum for two years before the show ended, and it was then she started studying psychology. But the role came calling again in 2024, when Ms. Sheinbaum was running for president and Ms. Henaine was cast in a theater show spoofing the presidential debates. “I have something pending with this character,” she said. “I wanted to humanize her and the character that I created is that side of Claudia that maybe people don’t see.” To promote the show, Ms. Henaine posted comedic videos of herself meeting voters on a mock campaign trail , riding Mexico City’s public transportation and hanging out with an impersonator of Ms. Sheinbaum’s main competitor. Some videos garnered several million views. To sharpen her performance, Ms. Henaine studied countless videos of Ms. Sheinbaum. She said that Ms. Sheinbaum was more relaxed when she spoke as mayor but became more formal as a presidential candidate. She has met Ms. Sheinbaum three times, including during a real campaign event in which the two recited a campaign slogan, smiled and hugged. Video of that encounter has over 24 million views combined between TikTok and Instagram. Other prominent officials have met Ms. Henaine, too, including Mexico’s security minister and the head of Ms. Sheinbaum’s political party, Morena.. Both were surprised by the resemblance and recorded short videos with Claudita for her social media accounts. A spokesman for Ms. Sheinbaum did not respond to requests for comment about her professional look-alike. After Ms. Sheinbaum won the 2024 presidential election and a six-year term in a landslide, Ms. Henaine said she saw years’ ahead of work. Her new show is a riff on the president’s daily morning news conference — it’s called “The Morning Laughter” — and her relationship with Mr. Trump. Ms Henaine said her act is less about taking comedic jabs at Ms. Sheinbaum than an effort to laugh about politics more generally. “She’s the first woman to reach the presidency, and it’s a historic moment,” Ms. Henaine said. “There are going to be failures, there are going to be successes, and the system is what is criticized.” Ms. Sheinbaum has been invited to the show but has not attended. A few federal lawmakers from her political party have. But recently, with a few lines of makeup, her hair in a ponytail and wearing a traditional Mexican blouse, Ms. Henaine looked enough like Ms. Sheinbaum to confuse many during Mexico’s Independence Day celebrations. The main ceremony last month, attended by an announced 280,000 people, was the first led by a woman president in 215 years of Mexican history. Even when Ms. Henaine told people she was not the president, many snapped a photo with her anyway. Diana Puente, 32, had made a six-hour journey from her home state, San Luis Potosí, with her godmother and a friend to see Ms. Sheinbaum that night. She could not manage a photo with Ms. Sheinbaum, who presided over the event from the balcony of the national palace, so Ms. Henaine would have to do for now. “It’s the time for women,” Ms. Puente said. Mostly, Ms. Henaine said, she received positive reactions from Mexicans — a benefit of Ms. Sheinbaum’s popularity, especially when people mistake her identity. Hours before the Independence Day event, a man walked up to Ms. Henaine in the city’s main square and started an impassioned address to her. He lamented the verbal attacks she had received from her political opponents. He urged her to continue standing strong. And before he walked away, he added, “I’ll watch you later.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/mexico-president-sheinbaum-impersonator.html,World,BBC,By James Wagner and Luis Antonio Rojas,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/world/XXint-mexico-claudita-promo/XXint-mexico-claudita-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:00:38+00:00,ad698b9035a524572cd0afa1b2f3b1cdb41d37a9
f7c0434aad3e,Iran Lures Transgender Foreigners for Surgery but Forces Operations on Locals,"transgender, gay and lesbian;lgbt;lgbtq;gay;lesbian, surgery, gender, disesases;health;illness;medicine, islam, ruhollah khomeini, iran, tehran","For 40 years Iran has performed more gender transition surgeries than many other nations, largely a result of pressuring gay and gender-nonconforming citizens to undergo unwanted operations or risk the death penalty. Now, faced with an economy crippled by war and sanctions, the Islamic republic is promoting its expertise to a global audience, hoping to attract transgender foreigners with the promise of inexpensive surgeries packaged with luxury hotel stays and sightseeing tours. Desperate for foreign investment, Iran’s theocratic government has set a goal of generating more than $7 billion from medical tourism annually, according to Iranian state news media , about seven times as much as it earned last year. That objective has resulted in the proliferation of medical tourism companies, marketing not just nose jobs and hair transplants, but vaginoplasties, mastectomies and penis constructions through glossy English-language websites. “We handle everything from start to finish, providing the best medical services to ensure a stress-free experience,” said Farideh Najafi, the manager of two medical tourism companies, MabnaTrip and MedPalTrip. “This includes booking hotels, hospitals, transportation and more,” she said. Iran is one of the few places in the Muslim world that allows transgender people to seek gender-affirming care, and even subsidizes it. For many foreigners traveling to Iran for transition surgery, and indeed for many transgender Iranians, these operations can feel lifesaving. But the country’s reputation as a pioneer in the field belies the abusive history of the operations and the grim reality for most L.G.B.T.Q. people there. In Iran, gay men and lesbians can be punished by public flogging and the death penalty . As a result, the United Nations Human Rights Council found, many gay and lesbian Iranians who are not trans are “pressured into undergoing gender reassignment surgery without their free consent.” Still, the country’s cut-rate prices are drawing transgender individuals from as far away as Australia, the United States, Britain and Europe, according to medical tour operators and surgeons. Many more patients, they say, come from neighboring countries, like Iraq, where such treatments are strictly forbidden. “In the United States, the cost of surgery is around $45,000, and in Thailand, it’s approximately $30,000,” according to the website of one operator, IranMedTour. “However, the cost of gender confirmation surgery in Iran is lower, with prices less than $12,000.” Other companies advertise procedures at government hospitals for as low as $4,500. Sam, 32, a trans man from Orange County, Calif., is currently in Tehran to pursue a hysterectomy and metoidioplasty, a kind of penis-construction surgery. Requesting anonymity to discuss a sensitive medical procedure, he said he was drawn to Iran because he believed the doctors there were “more confident” than those in the United States. “The goal of these medical tours is probably to portray Iran as a paradise for trans people, which it isn’t,” said Saman Arastu, a transgender Iranian man and actor who chose to undergo so-called top and bottom surgeries. “In my opinion, these are nothing but a show. The situation for trans people is dire.” While precise figures are unknown, a report by the Home Office of Britain from 2022 found that roughly 4,000 people underwent transition surgery each year in Iran, a figure higher than the combined annual totals in Britain and France. Experts say a vast majority of patients come from inside Iran. Iran’s experience with transition surgery stems from a fatwa issued in the 1980s by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding supreme leader of the Islamic republic, who declared that transgender individuals could gain legal recognition of the gender with which they identified, but only on the condition that they underwent transition surgery. On the surface that policy inverts what many in the West expect from Iran, where gender norms are so strictly enforced that until recently women were punished for not wearing hijabs in public. But transgender Iranians and experts say the government’s embrace of surgery in no way correlates to advocacy for trans people. Iranians who do not adhere to traditional norms of masculinity and femininity — including trans people who do not want surgery — are subject to violence, extortion or are pressured into operations. “For the Islamic republic, being trans means you have to go through this surgery — from male to female, female to male,” said Zara Saeidzadeh of Orebro University in Sweden, a gender scholar who has spent a decade researching trans identity, with a focus on Iran. “If you identify as trans but don’t want to do any form of body modification, then you’re breaking the rules and you are going to be stigmatized and your life is threatened.” Raha Ajoudani, a 20-year-old trans woman and activist, made the opposite journey that many foreign tourists are making. She fled to Germany from Iran in 2024 to avoid a forced transition surgery and to escape state persecution for her activism. Ms. Ajoudani said that she was detained twice by the authorities in 2022, after an ex-boyfriend collaborated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, to facilitate her arrest. Her family, she added, is routinely hounded to get her to stop her activism. “I never wanted to undergo gender reassignment surgery,” Ms. Ajoudani said. “I’ve defined myself outside of this binary. I didn’t want to live according to the governmental definition of cultural expectations of being a woman or a man, nor did I submit to Khomeini’s fatwa.” Surgery is not a guarantee of acceptance or safety. Transgender people in Iran face murder and other forms of violence and harassment. The tour companies include language to assuage foreigners of those fears in their advertising materials. Amid glossy before-and-after photo illustrations of idealized pectorals and breasts, and copy that promises “budget-friendly” procedures, rapid visa approvals and help achieving “ a strong feeling of happiness and relief ,” the tour companies are also selling patients on what one calls Iran’s “ relatively progressive stance on transgender rights .” Ms. Najafi, the tour manager, conceded that some foreigners feared running afoul of the authorities or the locals, but said that patients traveling with her company had “never had any security issues.” Transition surgeries are complex operations with a questionable record of safety in Iran. Some activists have likened the country’s gender clinics to “ butcher ” shops. Saghi Ghahraman, who led the Iranian Queer Organization, said that while they believed treatment standards had improved, the change had come at a cost, as many gay people felt forced into operations that were like “experiments.” A U.N. report on transition surgeries in Iran from 2015 described botched procedures that led to complications like “severe bleeding, severe infection, scarring, chronic pain and abnormally shaped or located sexual organs.” Adding to the risks are some tour companies’ promises of rapid procedures, which experts said should involve months of planning. Some market stay timelines as short as one week. Dr. Shahryar Cohanzad, a urologist in Tehran who has performed around 300 transition surgeries, said the companies’ aim to perform as many procedures as quickly as possible was unsafe. “From what I know after 35 years of performing surgeries, it’s critical for the surgeon to spend as much time as possible with the patient,” he said. Eric, a 45-year-old trans man living in Canada who requested anonymity to protect himself and his family from reprisals, said he had sought treatment in Iran because it was cheap. But he acknowledged the tension in seeking treatment in a place where others have it forced on them. “I have heard a lot, especially among trans women, that because they are gay, and they cannot be gay in Iran, they try to do the surgery,” said Eric. “I’m really sad that gays and lesbians are not recognized in Iran, but on the other hand I’m happy for trans people because they can do what they’re willing to do.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/middleeast/iran-transgender-surgery.html,World,BBC,By Pranav Baskar and Leily Nikounazar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/world/00int-iran-transgender-surgery-05/00int-iran-transgender-surgery-05-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:00:27+00:00,9803fafa5061572f93640d5e2a3b93c2c08d3ebd
3775edf392d1,Cars to Fighter Jets: China’s New Export Curbs May Level a Heavy Blow Worldwide,"rare earths, ministry of commerce, international trade, cars, manufacturing, magnet, computer chip, china, us, europe","From cars and computer chips to tanks and fighter jets, China’s new export restrictions represent a sweeping effort to control global commerce and have set off a renewed trade fight that pits Beijing against not only the United States but also Europe. The new regulations, which take effect in stages on Nov. 8 and Dec. 1, apply to the entire world, sharply escalating China’s sway over critical manufacturing at a time of increased international fractures over trade. The restrictions led President Trump on Friday to threaten to impose new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese imports starting Nov. 1. The rules go far beyond China’s limits since April on the export of rare earth metals, which are mined and processed mainly in China , as well as magnets made from those metals. In a series of announcements on Thursday, China extended its restrictions to worldwide shipments of electric motors, computer chips and other devices that have become central to modern life and are now manufactured mainly in China. The regulations prohibit exports from China to any country of materials or components for use in military equipment. Among the items banned are the small yet powerful electric motors in missiles and fighter jets and the materials for crucial range finders in tanks and artillery that are used to zero in on distant targets. These rules have drawn particular concern in the West because of their potential to debilitate Europe’s efforts to supply arms to Ukraine and to rebuild Europe’s own militaries to counter Russian aggression. “We’ve entered into a new phase of the economic conflict,” said Jay Truesdale, who worked in the administration of President Barack Obama on critical mineral policies. He is now the chief executive of TD International, a global strategic advisory firm. Beijing’s decision to put a total ban on exports of materials for military use has geopolitical resonance in Europe. Countries there are racing to strengthen their military defenses from an increasingly aggressive Russia. Many armaments require rare earths and commodities from China. Chinese officials have vigorously opposed European Union tariffs on electric vehicles from China, and some experts saw the export controls as a fresh expression of Beijing’s pique. The raft of regulations means that companies not involved in arms manufacturing must obtain export licenses from China’s Ministry of Commerce to move products with Chinese content across any national borders around the world. The rules broaden the use of elaborate procedures requiring exporters to submit technical drawings of every product their customers want to manufacture with Chinese rare earths and describe how these products will move through global supply chains. After arms manufacturers, the global auto industry appears to be the second-most vulnerable sector, rare-earth industry specialists said. The thousands of companies that produce parts were already the hardest hit by China’s requirement in April that many kinds of rare earth magnets cannot leave the country without licenses. A single gasoline-powered car can have more than 40 different rare earth magnets inside electric motors that power the brakes, seats, steering, power windows and other systems. Electric cars have even more rare earth magnets, which are used to turn the wheels. American and European auto parts producers have encountered months of delays in obtaining these export licenses. China has started to issue licenses but the process has been slow and cumbersome, industry officials say. China has modeled its rare earth regulations on American rules for trade in a few of the world’s most powerful computer chips. But rare earths are more widely used. Many parts manufacturers have stopped assembling electric motors outside China with rare earth magnets from China, and now bypass Beijing’s rules by buying entire electric motors from China. But the latest regulations published by China’s Ministry of Commerce could prevent this workaround. The rules encompass almost any product in which rare earths make up 0.1 percent or more of the value. That means they cover not just magnets but also electric motors and even much bigger systems that have electric motors with rare earth magnets inside. The costliest components of car seats, for example, are the motors that adjust them. And the most expensive pieces in these motors are the rare earth magnets. The new rules apply to any shipments across national borders, not just in or out of China. European automakers, in particular, face a daunting task of seeking Chinese export licenses to move car parts within Europe. Many companies have recently tried to limit their dependence on China by buying rare earths and rare earth magnets from the few producers outside China. But Beijing’s latest regulations assert jurisdiction over much of this production as well. The rules also say that any rare earth-related products made outside of China but using Chinese technology are also covered by China’s export control rules. Rare earth refineries and magnet factories all over the world have been buying Chinese equipment for the past 20 years. Many equipment vendors in North America and Europe closed when most of the world’s rare earth mining shifted to China in the late 1990s.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/business/china-rare-earth-export-controls.html,Business,BBC,By Keith Bradsher,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/biz-china-export-controls-vmbg/biz-china-export-controls-vmbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T17:23:38.060000+00:00,02852daf2479b02897065c8c15000890cf04dad7
9cb68d9c730d,Black Unemployment Is Surging Again. This Time Is Different.,"minorities, black people;african american;african-american, income inequality, layoffs;furloughs, us politics, race and ethnicity, center on budget and policy priorities, economic policy institute, federal reserve, jerome powell, donald trump, us economy, financial planner, los angeles black worker center","Joblessness for Black workers is rising again, two years after reaching a record low. It’s a troubling indicator: Joblessness often spikes higher for historically marginalized groups during economic downturns, and takes longer to fall. This time, the Trump administration’s assault on diversity programs and cuts to the federal work force could make it even more difficult for Black workers to recover when conditions improve. The African American unemployment rate has surged over the past four months, from 6 to 7.5 percent, while the rate for white people ticked down slightly to 3.7 percent. On top of a slowing economy , the White House’s actions have disproportionately harmed Black workers , economists said. “I think the speed at which things have changed, in such a dramatic fashion, is out of the ordinary,” said Valerie Wilson, who directs the program on race, ethnicity and the economy at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. “There’s been such a rapid shift in policy, rather than something cyclical or structural about the economy.” At least since the 1970s, when the federal government started tracking unemployment by race, the rate for Black people has run about twice the rate for white people. Because of inferior educational opportunities, the legacy of mass incarceration and discrimination over generations, Black people confront greater challenges in the job market. A strong economy during President Trump’s first term created more jobs for Black workers , but many of them were lost when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in-person employment particularly hard. Generous public subsidies, though, cushioned the blow, and hiring rebounded quickly. “I was hoping that the commitment to investing in America, so that a broader set of Americans were actually receiving benefits in terms of low unemployment and higher wages, would continue,” said Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank focused on issues affecting Black Americans. He said he was particularly disappointed in large businesses that said they would support Black workers in response to protests for racial justice in 2020, only to pull back . Job losses are concentrated among Black women working in professional services such as human resources, according to Ms. Wilson’s analysis of federal data. A hiring freeze and mass layoffs in the federal work force, which have continued during the government shutdown and now exceed 200,000 , have also fallen disproportionately on Black workers. The hiring freeze is an impediment to young workers trying to get their foot in the door, too. “The federal government is one of those places people are able to get an entry-level job,” said Gbenga Ajilore, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which researches the social safety net. “That’s a whole industry that’s closed to new hires.” State and local governments have picked up some of the slack from federal agencies. But competition for those jobs has gotten tougher with more laid-off public-sector workers looking for positions. Sherri Marshall, 26, who graduated from the University of California, Davis, a few years ago with a degree in psychology, has worked in Los Angeles for a rental car company and a homeless shelter. But both let her go, and she is still looking for a position that would put her education to use. “It’s always like high-labor, low-paying jobs, nothing sustainable,” said Ms. Marshall, who works at a farmers’ market on the weekends and is building up a freelance social media marketing portfolio between filling out applications. “It’s harder for me to get more technical and higher-skilled jobs, despite being qualified.” Ms. Marshall recited her qualifications in a 30-second pitch during a job fair with city agencies last week at the Los Angeles Black Worker Center, where she also volunteers. The nonprofit has pushed local governments to hire more Black workers because unionized public-sector jobs have historically provided an on-ramp to stable employment. The federal backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion practices may be making it more difficult for Black workers to get hired in the private sector, too. Some of the strongest evidence for the efficacy of these practices, such as making sure to interview nonwhite candidates or reaching out to Black and Hispanic students, comes from federal contractors. In one of its first actions , the Trump administration ordered that group not to pursue racial equity anymore. Janel Belovette Jenkins, co-executive director of the Los Angeles Black Worker Center, tries to build relationships with employers who say they are swamped with applicants. “A lot of people get their jobs through networking,” Mx. Jenkins said. “Part of our role is to create the programs that will create the network that connects highly skilled, qualified workers to employers who might not have initially seen them.” Lower interest rates could offer some relief. Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote to Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, in early September demanding that the central bank take stronger action to support full employment for Black workers. Fed officials lowered rates later in the month for the first time this year and suggested that more cuts were likely. But Trump administration actions beyond work-force cuts and anti-D.E.I. policies could create additional hurdles for Black workers. The Department of Labor’s proposed rollback of minimum-wage and overtime protections for domestic workers, for example, would hurt their incomes. Home care aides for the elderly are overwhelmingly Black and Hispanic women. And despite Mr. Trump’s claim on the campaign trail that immigrants take jobs from Black people, rising joblessness among Black workers suggests that mass deportations of migrants haven’t arrested the trend. Brittany Alston, director of the Philly Black Worker Project, said expelling immigrants harmed the local economy in ways that hurt Black workers, too. “We know that an injury to one deeply is an injury to all,” Ms. Alston said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/business/economy/black-unemployment-federal-layoffs-diversity-initiatives.html,Business,BBC,By Lydia DePillis,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/00biz-black-unemployment-01-fkhv/00biz-black-unemployment-01-fkhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:01:00+00:00,dd474c72d5fd6060becb11fcd8f9579d4d2306f4
90d89ec422d5,What’s the Deal With All Those FanDuel Ads?,"gambling, advertising;marketing, personal profile;people story, regulation and deregulation, sports, management, consumer behaviour, computers and the internet, tech industry, customer service, black market, fanduel.com, flutter entertainment","It’s football season. Even if you don’t watch any of the games, you are probably aware because of all the sports betting ads blanketing television, podcasts, billboards and other aspects of daily life. Since sports betting became legal in America on a state-by-state basis in 2018, a crop of online sportsbooks have fought aggressively for attention. FanDuel, whose parent company is Flutter Entertainment, is the largest, with more than 40 percent of the market. Flutter, named after British slang for a small bet, is also the biggest online gambling company in the world, with brands like Britain’s Betfair, Ireland’s Paddy Power and Australia’s Sportsbet. It recorded 16 million average monthly users in its latest quarter. Last year, Flutter brought in $14 billion in revenue, a 19 percent jump from 2023. It expects double-digit growth to continue this year. Peter Jackson, Flutter’s chief executive since 2018, still sees room to grow in America, where big states like California and Texas bar online gambling. As more people become aware of the ease of betting on their phones, on any number of moments within games , there is a push by regulators and public health officials to rein in the industry. “People have and will always gamble,” Mr. Jackson, 49, said. “What we do is we offer a safe environment for people to do it.” And as for all those ads? They are not letting up, he said. This interview has been edited and condensed. How important is the N.F.L. season to FanDuel? The whole of September through to the end of the year is really big for us. It’s not just here in the U.S. where football starts. We get the N.B.A. tipoff in the middle of October as well. In our European businesses, you’ve got the soccer season going. Then in Australia, you’ve also got the big horse-racing festivals. People are seeing a lot of ads about sports betting. What differentiates FanDuel from the rest? With the FanDuel brand, we spend a billion dollars on advertising and promotions. Historically, a lot was focused on bringing to life the sports betting concept into the U.S., because it was relatively new. We’re not that many years into people being able to legally bet on sports, and still only half of Americans can do it today. But this year, we’ve slightly changed our tone. It’s really important that we start to distinguish our brand so people recognize how much better we are, and do a little bit less heavy lifting for the category and get a little more selfish. How many FanDuel commercials is too many Fan Duel commercials? This is the conundrum that we have around the world. At least we’re not advertising auto insurance. But those ads can be fun, with the skits. Our ads are fun. When we started out in the U.S., we were quite careful working with the leagues to try and make sure that we limited the amount of advertising slots for gaming businesses. There are some markets where you don’t have those constraints and it can be literally wall-to-wall gambling advertising. I don’t think that’s healthy. The equilibrium we’ve got here in the U.S. works well. Until more states open up to gambling, how else are you trying to grow? Remember that the state that we’ve been operating in the longest, New Jersey, started in 2018. There are many states that we have only been in for a year or two. In comparison with the U.K. or Australia, where we’ve been doing this for 20 years, the penetration rates are very low in America. Is it just a matter of time, or do you need to be proactive? People who are turning 25 this year and betting for the first time, or turning 21, depending on what the rules are in different places, are a whole new cohort that will become available to us. They’re more likely to have their phone in their hand while watching TV. You’ve got that natural tailwind of people who are digital-first consumers that will see natural growth. Tell me about the technology that sets odds, which I imagine you spend a lot of time thinking about. We have to get it right because, otherwise, people spot our weaknesses and they bet and it will cost us a lot of money. We have 650 people around the world who are proper, supersmart data scientists who build these models for us. We’ve got millions and millions of bets coming into the system, which we then are tracking and monitoring to help us determine whether our prices are accurate or not. We’re really a complex data business. Do you see more restrictions or regulations on betting on the horizon? We have to make sure that we work with regulators to improve the quality of regulation so it achieves the right outcomes, which is that people are safe and having enjoyment on the platform. One of the real challenges for us is how to deal with the black market. How do you stop people being two clicks away from the Wild West where no one cares how much they’re spending, how much time they’re on the platform? There is a growing body of research showing the harms of legal gambling, especially among young men. New Jersey recently moved to ban sports betting partnerships on college campuses. I can see how lawmakers will try and prevent that, because if you’ve got an unscrupulous business doing it, it causes problems for all of us . That’s why it is important we can advertise through digital channels and on TV, because I think that’s fair game. I don’t think people should be going to college campuses to sign up people. FanDuel recently announced a partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a prediction market platform . What’s the thinking there? The opportunity is to let our customers think about prediction markets in gold and what the S&P is going to do, or what the weather will be like in New York tomorrow. In other markets around the world, people will have a bet on who’s going to win “Survivor” or “The Masked Singer.” Lots of crazy things. Do you ever feel conflicted about being in a business that is associated with addiction? I’m really comfortable with what we do. We spend a lot of time and money making sure that our customers are betting for fun. We switch customers off our platform. We restrict the amount we let them deposit. We encourage them to have tools that manage their behavior. There are very, very few other categories that do any of those things. I’ve never seen a social media platform limit the amount of time I can spend on it. You’ve said that the market for sports betting in Britain is 20 years ahead of the United States. In Britain, more regulations have been introduced as awareness of gambling addiction has increased. Would you want to apply the same standards in the U.S.? You’ve got to remember the context of the country. There’d be uproar in America, the land of the free, if you brought in some of the “nanny state” rules and regulations that people in the U.K. have to put up with. Speaking of the U.K, you grew up in Yorkshire. Tell me about your upbringing. My dad was a car salesman, and my mom looked after my sister and I. How did your childhood shape your career path? If you sell cars to people, you have work on a Saturday. My dad was always very customer-focused because if you’re not you’re never going to sell a car. That’s definitely had a bearing on how I think about business. Looking back at that time, what else might relate to what you do now? My dad had a successful business selling cars, but he struggled to grow his business to multiple locations. He didn’t know how to leverage or change his management style, and he couldn’t ever let go. Let go in what way? When he opened a site down the road, it felt like he spent his entire time driving from one to the other because he had a fear of missing out on what was going on elsewhere. After graduation, you worked as a consultant. What was a pivotal moment during that time? One of the real “Sliding Doors” moments came when I met a guy called Adam Morgan, who wrote a book called “Eating the Big Fish.” Adam has a thesis about challenger brands, which are focused on delivering what customers want and will often attack the soft underbelly of incumbents who have forgotten what made them successful. It struck me when Adam was talking that I’d never want to work in an incumbent. OK, it’s time for the lightning round. What was the last bet you made? The last bet I made was for Grimsby Town, a team that is in the lowest league of soccer, who played Manchester United, one of the biggest teams in the world, to win, which was a huge upset. They won. Congrats. What tips do you have for this N.F.L. season? I’d like to tell people to bet against the Lions. Detroit won’t be happy about that. They cost us some money last season. Tell me about your “as good as it gets” moment in business. Ringing the New York Stock Exchange bell was pretty cool. It’s actually not a bell. It’s a buzzer, like a little doorbell. What’s your biggest pet peeve as a C.E.O.? I don’t like bureaucracy. How many direct reports is too many? I’ve probably got about eight. That’s a good number. How many hours do you sleep, and which hours do you sleep? I probably sleep six or seven hours a night. Get to bed at 11. Sleep till 5 or 6. How do you sign off to your emails? If I tell you this, then everyone will be able to copy me. Do you think they’re going to be phishing you? Yeah, people will phish. I normally just write “P.” I don’t think anyone’s going to phish you, or I hope no one phishes you. Well, they do try a lot. Really? My voice is in the public domain. People leave voice mails using an A.I. version of me. You and Taylor Swift are both dealing with deepfakes.

In recent weeks, the president has attacked the N.F.L. for choosing Bad Bunny , a rapper critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as its headlining performer at the Super Bowl in February, and criticized changes to the kickoff rules designed to reduce injuries. This summer, he threatened to delay a stadium deal for the Washington Commanders if they didn’t revert to their former name, which was considered offensive to many Native Americans. While no sports league wants to be caught in the president’s cross hairs, the league has learned from its past run-ins with Mr. Trump, like when he urged the owners to fire players who protested during the national anthem in 2017. This time around, the N.F.L. has tried as best it can to insulate itself from his attacks. In February, the Saints owner Gayle Benson invited the president to the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where he schmoozed with Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Commanders owner Josh Harris joined Mr. Goodell in the Oval Office, where they announced that the 2027 draft would be held in Washington, D.C. (Mr. Harris gave the president a team jersey, saying he was “the ultimate Commander. ”) Management of the president, in other words, has become one of their headaches. More than most sports leagues, the N.F.L. is a business driven by its owners, a group of almost entirely older white men, many of whom made billions in finance, oil and gas, and real estate before buying their teams and agreeing to share the league’s revenue as if they were members of a socialist commune. As a collective, they have a hand in most major decisions of consequence, decisions that are often made at the league’s quarterly meetings, which are held at exclusive hotels around the country like the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., or the Biltmore in Phoenix. Though the president won’t be on any official agenda when they gather at InterContinental Hotel in Midtown Manhattan a few blocks from the league’s headquarters, the owners may be briefed on the Super Bowl halftime show and other issues that involve the Trump administration, including the expansive alliance the league entered into with ESPN that requires regulatory approval. In any season, the league meetings reveal how the N.F.L. has become the country’s pre-eminent sports league: No matter how big the crisis, the league and its owners try to minimize distractions and keep the focus on the games that help the N.F.L. rake in more than $23 billion a year from media companies, sponsors and fans eager to be associated with it. And yet, for all the business imperatives, when they make their decisions inside their meetings, those owners are driven in part by their own highly personal alliances, friendships and beliefs about the league’s mission. This account is based on conversations with dozens of owners, team executives and N.F.L. officials, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal league business. The High School Cafeteria Many of the owners are creatures of habit and like to sit in the same place each time they meet. “The league meetings in the room were very much like a high school cafeteria,” said a former league lawyer, Frank Hawkins. The seating chart in effect serves as a proxy for their status and their beefs. Putting a small plaque with each owner’s name at their seats would have been simple. But until about a decade ago, no one did. So underlings raced to meeting rooms hours in advance to make sure their boss had his or her regular spot. Amy Trask was hired by the Los Angeles Raiders as a lawyer in 1987 — “a man’s job” in a man’s league — and she had her hands full dealing with the lawsuits her boss, the Raiders’ colorful owner, Al Davis, was involved in. But one task that she sweated more than most was ensuring that he got his favorite spot at owners meetings: the last seat at the table to the commissioner’s right so he could swing his chair around to the head of the table and get a full view of the meeting in front of him. It also made it easier to grab a cup of coffee. “I would get there at 5 in the morning and sneak through the kitchen to put our names on chairs,” Ms. Trask said. These days, John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers — two third-generation owners whose families are close — sit near each other. For years, Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys sat next to his close ally, Dan Snyder, until Mr. Snyder sold the Washington Commanders in 2023. They led the bloc of owners that pushed for faster revenue growth. The owners who inherited their franchises — the Rooneys in Pittsburgh, the Maras in New York, among others — tend to view their job as that of a trustee. Newer, wealthier owners — Stephen Ross of the Miami Dolphins (a real estate fortune), David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers (hedge fund money) — are often focused more on maximizing their investments. The newer owners are often methodical in their decisions, made after significant research by the league staff and internal deliberation. In years past, the league had more maverick owners, like Mr. Davis or Hugh Culverhouse of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were far less wealthy and took more outlandish positions. Several newer owners who paid billions, not millions, for their clubs pushed the league to loosen its rules to allow private equity firms to buy minority stakes in N.F.L. teams. They have been eager to reopen negotiations with the league’s network partners to secure even more lucrative rights deals that could also drive up the cost for fans wanting to watch N.F.L. games. When new owners join the league, where they will sit — literally and metaphorically — is a matter of importance. Mr. Snyder approached Shahid Khan soon after Mr. Khan used the fortune he had made in the car bumper and headlight business to buy the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011. Mr. Snyder, who had visited Mr. Khan’s yacht in the South of France years before, wanted Mr. Khan to sit with him and Mr. Jones. “You need to hang with us or otherwise they’re going to screw you,” Mr. Snyder said, without specifying how Mr. Khan might get screwed. Mr. Khan instead followed the only advice Wayne Weaver, the Jaguars’ previous owner, gave him: Continue to sit in the front row of the middle table. Mr. Weaver didn’t say why, but Mr. Khan learned over time that the seat was near the New England Patriots and Cowboys, which gave him access to the two most powerful owners in the room. The Power Centers Robert Kraft of the Patriots is among the most connected owners in the league, leading the powerful media committee, which helps negotiate broadcasting rights deals, the N.F.L.’s largest source of revenue. He has a chameleon-like ability to work with all sides. He talks with Mr. Goodell so frequently that he has been dubbed the “shadow commissioner,” and has known Mr. Trump for decades. In March, he contacted the president to help Brad Karp, chairman of the law firm Paul Weiss, reach a settlement with the White House after the president targeted high-profile firms with punitive executive orders. These days, Mr. Kraft goes in and out of the meetings, mostly attending discussions of topics he cares about. Jonathan Kraft, the oldest of Mr. Kraft’s four sons, often represents the team. When the elder Mr. Kraft is there, he plucks away at his iPad, surfing the web, but “there’s no question who’s No. 1 — it’s Robert,” Mr. Khan said. Mr. Jones speaks — and sometimes shouts — more than anyone else. Though he can take time making his point, as the ultimate alpha male with the most valuable team, he is given a wide berth. “Where he’s going to go and how long he is going to ramble, no one knows,” Mr. Khan said. “I mean, he definitely has a hall pass.” Mr. Jones, though, has also pushed his fellow owners to the limit. On one conference call with the six owners on the compensation committee who were trying to give Mr. Goodell a big pay raise, Mr. Jones said he had hired David Boies , the famous antitrust lawyer, because he was thinking of suing everyone on the committee. According to an owner on the call, within an instant, the only sound on the line was the click-click-click of the other owners hanging up. The Los Angeles Move Meetings can get intense. The 2016 special meeting to vote on whether the St. Louis Rams or the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers would be allowed to move to Los Angeles was so critical that the Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who was rarely seen in N.F.L. circles, attended. Initially, there appeared to be more votes in favor of the Chargers-Raiders bid, but not the 24 needed to pass. However, the Rams’ presentation, made by the team’s top executive, Kevin Demoff, with lobbying by Mr. Jones, persuaded some owners to switch their votes. Mr. Allen, who had an oracle-like reputation, also backed the Rams proposal. But the Rams didn’t have 24, either, so Mr. Jones persuaded the commissioner to switch to secret ballots so owners could set aside their loyalties and vote more freely. (He also asked for a drinks cart to help lubricate the discussion.) The gambit worked. Not long after, the owners voted 30 to 2 to grant the Rams the right to move to Los Angeles. The choice was seismic. The Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, who led the stadium committee and favored the Chargers-Raiders stadium proposal, felt betrayed by his friends and stopped going to league meetings. He sold his team two years later. The Chargers owner Dean Spanos limped back to San Diego to beg for taxpayer funding, but since he had shown a willingness to leave once, voters rejected a ballot measure to pay for a new stadium. He exercised his option to move in with the Rams in Los Angeles, where the Chargers are overshadowed by many other teams. The owners abandoned longtime fans in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego, where lawmakers had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on stadiums and improvements for the teams. The City and County of St. Louis sued the N.F.L., claiming it had abandoned its own relocation guidelines to help the Rams owner E. Stanley Kroenke move to Los Angeles. They won a $790 million settlement . But the owners got what they wanted: a return to Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest media market, where the Rams built a $5 billion stadium that could host Super Bowls. (And did, in 2022.) Exit Snyder Sometimes, the owners make news just before they enter the room. In 2022, they were wrestling with how to get Mr. Snyder to sell his scandal-plagued Commanders. Mr. Goodell had fined the team $10 million after an investigation uncovered sexual harassment in the front office. During his more than two decades in the league, Mr. Snyder was abrasive and his teams performed poorly. But the owners were wary of forcing him to sell, because that might trigger lawsuits and set a precedent for other owners. The Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay wasn’t intimidated. In October that year, he arrived 45 minutes late to the meeting in New York. He stopped at the rope where reporters were standing. With little prompting, he launched into a speech on why Mr. Snyder should be out of the league, a sentiment the owners shared but would not say on the record. The other owners read Mr. Irsay’s comments on Twitter while they were in the meeting. This was the beginning of the end for Mr. Snyder. Two weeks later, he announced he had hired bankers to find a potential buyer. Less than a year later, Mr. Snyder sold his team for a record $6 billion to a group led by Mr. Harris, a private equity billionaire, who now sits near Mr. Jones at the quarterly meetings.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/business/nfl-owners-trump.html,Business,BBC,By Ken Belson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/business/05NFL-excerpt-illo/05NFL-excerpt-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:10.572000+00:00,fe3268e92c6ba6e6c3957355589137134965294b
d7b2bccc689e,Searching for Meaning in the Gold Rally,"stocks;bonds, gold","Gold prices are behaving like we’re on the brink of a financial crisis. The safe haven asset hit $4,000 an ounce for the first time this week, recording its largest rally since the late 1970s. Investors from retail to pension funds spent $9.3 billion on exchange traded funds linked to gold last month, according to Morningstar Direct. But the investor anxiety that often fuels a gold rush seems to be missing from the rest of the market. Often when gold soars, stocks drop. For example, as the price of gold soared more than 600 percent from 1970 to 1979, when adjusted for inflation, the S&P 500 sank 11 percent. A similar pattern appeared during the Great Recession, when gold rose 37 percent from January 2008 to December 2009 while the S&P 500 nose-dived 23 percent. By contrast, as gold was taking off this week, the S&P 500 recorded a high on Wednesday. Signs of crisis were also absent from bond markets and the U.S. dollar: Long-term U.S. bond yields have been relatively flat and the dollar’s value has been stable the past few months after a dip following President Trump’s tariffs announcement in April. Joe Davis, the global chief economist of Vanguard, told DealBook the discrepancy between the stock market and gold is “almost unprecedented.” So what’s going on? Davis said investors seem to be reading the economy in “dramatically different” ways. The pessimists For a big bet on gold to pay off, Davis said, more than one big thing would have to go very wrong: A.I., which has fueled the stock market’s growth, would prove a dud; the equity markets wouldn’t find other growth avenues to offset that A.I. dip; there would be a flight from U.S. Treasury assets, creating pressure on the dollar; and the Federal Reserve would abandon its fight against inflation, perhaps because of a loss of independence. Holding gold can be expensive, as Warren Buffett once warned , because it doesn’t produce any income. (“If you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end,” is how he put it.) Some mainstream investors are betting on the asset nonetheless. Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, said at a conference on Tuesday that gold is safer than the U.S. dollar. He recommended that investors allocate up to 15 percent of their financial portfolios to gold (a significant change from the 60/40 stock and bond portfolio split traditional financial advisers provide). Morgan Stanley recently suggested a 60/20/20 portfolio split, with bonds and gold equally weighted. “Gold is now the anti-fragile asset to own rather than Treasuries,” Mike Wilson, chief investment officer at the bank, said at the Reuters Global Markets Forum. Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel Securities, summed up the pessimistic view at another conference on Monday : He said many gold buyers think, “I now view gold as a safe harbor asset in a way that the dollar used to be viewed.” The optimists Another investor perspective is that, despite economic risks like the ballooning debt of the U.S. and E.U., advances in A.I. will keep the economy hot, offsetting any threats. “A lot of people, including a lot of big money, are confident in that more optimistic scenario,” said Ryan Chahrour, an economics professor at Cornell. Also, Fear of Missing Out “Financial markets are like fashion,” said Robin Brooks, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It’s like bell-bottom jeans are back.” Whether investors and money managers are primarily pessimistic, optimistic or just afraid of missing out, it’s hard to tell how much of the gold rally is about their sentiment at all: Central banks around the world have been stocking up on bullion for years to protect themselves against the possibility of Western sanctions and political uncertainty. For now, economists and investors alike are in a game of wait and see. “Somebody’s going to be right eventually,” said Chahrour. “So either the financial markets are slow to adapt to the new circumstances, or the run-up in gold will be temporary.” IN CASE YOU MISSED IT The White House said layoffs of federal workers have begun. After weeks of threats to cull the federal work force during the government shutdown, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that the “RIFs have begun.” As of Friday, Republicans and Democrats did not appear to be closer to a resolution that could reopen the government. Unions representing federal workers pre-emptively challenged the legality of mass firings during a shutdown. Trump threatened a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports. Stocks sank on Friday after Trump threatened to cancel a meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and to raise levies in retaliation for new export restrictions China put on its rare earth minerals this week. The Trump administration moved forward with its bailout of Argentina. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that the U.S. had directly bought Argentine pesos and completed the terms of a $20 billion lifeline . The move came as a big relief for investors and money managers who have made big bets on the country, like BlackRock, but drew political blowback for the Trump administration. María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader , who built a movement to challenge the country’s authoritarian president, has been in hiding since last year. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” The founder with $0 of venture capital — and $1 billion in annual revenue A.I. giants are spending billions to build and deploy their large language models, and a significant portion of that cash is going to companies that help train them by annotating data and providing human feedback. Meta valued one of those services, Scale AI, at $29 billion when it made a deal to acquire a 49 percent stake in June, according to the start-up. Surge AI, a competitor, has kept a quieter profile. The company says it’s generating more than a billion dollars of annual revenue — before taking any outside capital. DealBook’s Niko Gallogly talked with the founder of Surge AI, Edwin Chen, about the role humans play in building artificial intelligence and staying lean in Silicon Valley. The interview was edited and condensed for clarity. You hire people to help train A.I. models. What are they doing on a typical day? One of the newer paradigms for training A.I. is what we call reinforcement learning environments. Think of it like a Sims game, where you have a simulation of the real world. Let’s say you are a doctor whom we’ve hired to help train A.I. models. In the Sims game, there might be a patient with a history of complications who needs a diagnosis. The A.I. “doctor” simulates all the tools needed to find a diagnosis, and then the real world doctor is basically measuring whether the A.I. model is right or not. If it gets it right, there’s nothing for the A.I. to learn. If it gets it wrong, the real world doctor is going to teach the A.I. the right answer. We are seeing start-ups like Surge driving high revenue with few employees, in part by outsourcing work to A.I. You have around 100 full-time employees, although you also rely on a large pool of independent contractors. Sam Altman predicted that we’ll soon see a company make $1 billion in revenue with just a founder. Do you believe that? Yeah, absolutely. I just see how much the A.I. models are getting better and better, and we play a very critical role in that. Some of the work that we are doing involves training an A.I. model to basically be a C.E.O., to be a lead software engineer who not just takes tasks and completes them but is correctly coming up with the right problems to solve. In a very real sense, it’s something that we are helping produce. How will that affect venture capital? Will start-ups rely less on venture funding? Even today, companies raise way more venture capital than they should. There’s a Silicon Valley mind-set where it becomes the default. People will see more and more companies like us, which can succeed over other V.C.-backed companies that have raised billions of dollars Do you expect more companies will wait to raise at a later stage through private financing or debt? I think it will be a much more serious consideration whether it’s even worth spending all this time raising at all. A lot of founders say, “My entire job is fund-raising.” In what world does that make sense? Your job as a founder should be using your actual product, seeing if you actually like it, seeing if it’s good or bad, talking to your user to see how you could improve it. Surge’s mission is to build A.G.I., or artificial general intelligence. How are you thinking about mitigating the risks ? We really care about making sure that A.I. is aligned with human values and making sure that A.I. is trained with the right objectives. A.I. models today, they’re really smart. But we want to make sure they have street smarts. The way you get that is by training your models on the right objectives. You’re not spending all your time optimizing for leader boards and hacking benchmarks. Instead, you’re optimizing for the messiness of the real world. Quiz: The sales of a showgirl Taylor Swift’s 12th album of new material, “The Life of a Showgirl,” set a record this week for opening week sales numbers, surpassing the equivalent of 3.5 million copies sold in just five days, according to the tracking firm Luminate. Ben Sisario, who reports on the music industry for The Times, wrote that the album’s huge commercial success “shows how physical media formats like CDs and vinyl LPs remain key to the success of top albums even now, when streaming accounts for about 82 percent of revenues from recorded music sales in the United States.” About 1.2 million copies of Swift’s album were sold on vinyl. Physical copies were sold in at least 27 configurations that included vinyl, CDs, cassettes — and in one case, a sweater. The album release began with a “release party” with the premiere of a music video and other behind-the-scenes segments in movie theaters and drew $33 million in box office sales. Which album previously held the record for opening week sales? A. Whitney Houston’s “The Bodyguard” (1992) B. ‘N Sync’s “No Strings Attached” (2000) C. Adelle’s “25” (2015) D.

Matthew Palm’s side hustle is signing up for credit cards. Every few months, Mr. Palm, a 57-year-old freelance television producer who lives in Illinois, goes online and applies for a new credit card. He opens only cards that come with a sign-up bonus: a reward of a few hundred dollars in points for new customers who reach a modest spending target. “The highest point of anxiety is when you click the submit button for your latest card application,” he said. “And then, as soon as it’s approved, there’s that adrenaline hit.” Each sign-up bonus is small, so to make a decent income, Mr. Palm keeps applying. During the seven years he has been into this side hustle, he estimates, he and his wife have opened more than 50 cards. The promotional bonuses have netted his family more than $40,000, he said. Mr. Palm is a member of what is known as the churning community — people who regularly open credit cards to harvest lucrative promotional rewards. The churning logic is simple: Hundreds of credit cards come with sign-up bonuses. So why not apply for as many cards as possible? Mr. Palm doesn’t consider himself an extreme churner. While he has opened more than 50 cards over seven years, he knows of others who open 20 cards annually. Some people have been at it for decades. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

In Macau, New York Times business reporter Tania Ganguli reveals the behind-the-scenes stakeholders who orchestrated the league’s return. I’m in Macau, the gambling capital of the world. I’m here for the NBA’s return to China for the last six years, there haven’t been any NBA games here. looking at these big banners that are draped over buildings. Reminds me of being back here in 2019. the players were sitting in their hotel and they could see workers tearing those same types of banners down, peeling their faces off the building. A few days before, the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, had sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong. Well, this made the Chinese government very upset. The NBA backed him. We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression. And then chaos enveloped. That whole week. Sponsors pulled out. And a lot of the players were worried about if they would even be allowed to go home if things got worse. It was it was that surreal. they lost about $400 million. Just from that one situation The Chinese market is huge for the NBA. There are a lot of basketball fans here…. and the league has been working on cultivating them for decades. And so coming here to Macao and playing a game in China again is a very big deal for the league. when you ask anybody with the league how did these games come together? The name that they mentioned is Patrick Dumont. He’s a top executive with the Sands Casino. And owner of the Dallas Mavericks. in 2021, the Chinese government was renegotiating what’s called concessions with the casinos here in Macau. In those concession agreements, the government required that the casinos spend a certain amount on non-gaming activities like entertainment, like sports. And Sands had this arena at the Venetian, so Dumont saw bringing the NBA here as an opportunity to satisfy that requirement. One of the other main players here was Joe Sy, the owner of the Brooklyn Nets. Joe tsai is the chairman of Alibaba Group, which is a Chinese tech giant. he has a lot of deep ties to the Chinese government, the nets, and spent a lot of time over the last few years meeting with Chinese officials, having events that celebrate Chinese culture. they have spoken to Chinese media outlets and said, this market is so important to us. We care about this market more than any other NBA team. They even launched a reality show. That’s a dance team competition to choose dancers for their games here in Macao Sound up: “The brooklyn nets will find the best dancers in china” There’s a tremendous amount at stake for these teams because. The league saw what happened when something went wrong and they lost this market even briefly. there is a feeling that this has to go right, and that this is a big opportunity to get back something that they lost.

c03b461e2023,How China Powers Its Electric Cars and High-Speed Trains,"china, national energy administration, electric power, solar energy, wind power, renewable energy, electric cars and hybrids, climate change;global warming, guquan","Power ⚡︎ Moves How China Powers Its Electric Cars and High-Speed Trains By Keith Bradsher Photographs by Gilles Sabrié Reporting from Guquan, China 阅读简体中文版 閱讀繁體中文版 In China, the longest ultrahigh-voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City. The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui Province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers. That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines cause small electric shocks that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole. “As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air-conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a six-inch fish he had just caught. China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about. But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions , far from most of its people and factories. More than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid. Beijing’s central planners, having underestimated the country’s swift adoption of solar and wind energy, are building the world’s first nationwide grid of ultrahigh-voltage power transmission lines. Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Trump’s “ Drill, baby, drill ” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy. In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers. Even before Mr. Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles. Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries. China’s more efficient power lines have broad consequences for the global race against climate change. They will help determine how quickly China can reduce its world-leading use of coal, a stain on the country’s clean energy track record. China uses as much coal as the entire rest of the world, and emits more greenhouse gases than the United States and the European Union combined. The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule. The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared. “State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai. In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated. “To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year. China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes. The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than seven million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households. To put the scale of China’s power grid build out in perspective, consider that the United States has a handful of 765-kilovolt lines and a few running at 500 kilovolts or less, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research group. The 765-kilovolt lines together total about 2,000 miles — the length of a single line across China. The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades. The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time. In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas. Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41 percent since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy. Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away. China’s ultrahigh-voltage network has helped the country limit its dependence on imported oil and natural gas, but it has also created new vulnerabilities. Much of northwestern China, where many of the lines are being built, is mountainous. As a result, lines had to be closely bunched as they hug a single, flood-prone tributary of the Yellow River that passes between earthquake-prone mountain ranges from Dunhuang to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines. China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information and intolerance for public dissent. Some villagers in Anhui Province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction. The line carries mostly solar and wind energy, as well as some coal-fired power, from the Gurbantünggüt Desert in Xinjiang. It helps supply electricity to big eastern Chinese cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing. Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, expressed concern. “When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.” The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Mr. Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by. Mr. Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.” Li You contributed research.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/business/china-electric-grid.html,Business,BBC,By Keith Bradsher and Gilles Sabrié,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index-facebookJumbo-v6.jpg,2025-10-11T04:00:08+00:00,0b1cfe8fc945c7f8fa799a62ab6cea8405a9952d
4c625aae47cd,Stocks Fall Sharply on Trump’s Renewed Threat of China Tariffs,"sp 500, stocks;bonds, tariff, international trade, donald trump, china","The stock market slumped to its worst one-day showing since tariffs roiled markets in April, as the specter of the trade war returned between Beijing and Washington. The S&P 500 dipped 2.7 percent for the first time in six months, and the Nasdaq Composite also fell by the most it has since April, when President Trump’s tariff plans for dozens of countries spooked markets. Mr. Trump on Friday threatened to impose more tariffs on Chinese imports after its government put curbs on the export of rare earth materials, vital to a host of industries, including the production of valuable chips used in artificial intelligence. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” Friday’s decline was the first time in two months that the S&P 500 had fallen more than one percent. Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent. U.S. oil prices fell more than 4 percent on Friday to less than $59 a barrel, their lowest level since May. Drilling activity could slow further if prices remain at that level for long because most domestic producers need oil prices to be above $60 a barrel to drill new wells profitably. The stock market was already on edge this month, after five straight months of gains had lifted prices to record levels, prompting some investors to warn of the potential for a pullback. The drop on Friday remained fairly modest, with the S&P 500 still less than 3 percent from its record high. After trading had ended for the day, Mr. Trump ratcheted up tensions further, threatening a 100 percent tariff on all goods from China. “Is this the start of a Liberation Day Two?” asked Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, in an emailed note to clients on Friday afternoon.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/stock-market-trump-tariffs.html,Business,BBC,By Joe Rennison and Rebecca F.

d85c596bf5d8,Student Loan Cancellation Is Restarting for Some Federal Borrowers,"personal finance, student loan, us department of education, donald trump","Thousands of federal student loan borrowers have received some welcome news: Now that they’ve made payments for at least 20 years, their remaining balances will be erased. After a halt this year, the Trump administration has resumed loan forgiveness for borrowers enrolled in a program known as Income-Based Repayment , an income-driven repayment plan that ties borrowers’ monthly payment amount to their income and household size. After they make payments for 20 to 25 years, any remaining balances are forgiven. “This is really significant because for months they have not canceled any loans under any income-driven repayment plan,” said Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group. Borrowers who have reached the payment threshold don’t have to do anything, but should receive a notice with more information about when the loan discharge will be processed. (They can opt out before Oct. 21, though it’s unlikely many will.) In one recent email notice, the Education Department said that it would notify servicers after Oct. 21 about the borrowers’ status and that most remaining balances would disappear within two weeks, though processing could take longer for others. Many borrowers had been anxiously hoping to hear something before the end of the year. This is because canceled student debt is usually taxed as income, but a temporary tax break made loan discharges from 2021 to 2025 exempt from federal taxation (though some states may apply their own taxes). Still, loan experts have said they would expect borrowers who have reached the number of qualifying payments in 2025 to be eligible for the tax break, even if the cancellation was processed later. If a borrower hasn’t yet received a notification, it may still be coming. The discharge notices are expected to roll out in batches, though it’s unclear how many have already gone out, or how long it will take for all qualifying borrowers to be notified. The Education Department did not respond to requests seeking comment given the government shutdown. I.B.R., which first became available in July 2009, has more than two million borrowers enrolled, according to recent data from the Federal Student Aid office, but not all of them will have crossed the payment count threshold. Enrolled borrowers with loans made after July 1, 2014, must make 240 payments, while those with loans taken before that must make 300 payments. “If you’ve hit 300 and haven’t heard anything yet, that doesn’t mean you’ve been skipped — just that you’re not in the first wave,” Stanley Tate, a consumer lawyer who specializes in student loans, said in a newsletter to borrowers. The Student Loan Servicing Alliance, the trade group for the companies that administer the loans and collect payments, confirmed the effort was underway. It was unclear if the temporary shutdown of the federal government would cause delays. While the loan servicers are still working, they can process discharges only after they receive instructions from the Education Department. Millions of other borrowers enrolled in other income-driven plans are still blocked from cancellation, a development that can be traced back to Republican-led legal challenges filed last year against the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment program. A related court ruling this year temporarily barred forgiveness in the SAVE program, which the Education Department has interpreted to also block loan discharges in other longstanding income-driven plans that are based on the same legal authority, including Income Contingent Repayment (I.C.R.) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE). I.B.R. wasn’t subject to the same treatment because it was created by Congress. But I.B.R. loan cancellation had been temporarily halted while the Education Department updated its systems to accurately count payments not affected by the court’s order, the department said. Last month , the American Federation for Teachers asked the courts to compel the Education Department to process loan discharges for borrowers who had made enough qualifying requirements. Individuals in blocked plans — SAVE, PAYE and I.C.R. — who have made the requisite payments under I.B.R. rules (240 or 300, depending on which version of I.B.R. they are eligible for) may want to consider transferring to that plan soon. That may help them avoid the so-called tax-bomb that’s coming back next year. But some borrowers may hit yet another obstacle. “While Congress made all borrowers eligible for I.B.R. this summer, the Education Department has not yet implemented this legal change, meaning at least some borrowers who should be eligible for I.B.R. now are being denied when they try to switch in,” said Abby Shafroth, the director of Student Loan Borrower Assistance at the National Consumer Law Center. If you are still receiving monthly bills even though you believe you have made enough payments to receive a loan discharge, it’s probably wise to continue making them for now — the Education Department had said it would reimburse those who overpaid. But if the monthly payments are causing financial distress, borrowers can call their loan servicer and ask for a forbearance, which will pause payments but keep your account in good standing while you wait for your discharge notice.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/student-loan-forgiveness-ibr.html,Business,BBC,By Tara Siegel Bernard,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Biz-IBR-Forgiveness-zgtq/10Biz-IBR-Forgiveness-zgtq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T18:49:57+00:00,78f8d39ebdd9a9d2c0c524c24900d56d59dbab0f
e578c050f959,Trump Announces a Deal on Drug Prices With AstraZeneca,"price, pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, us politics, health insurance, medicaid, tariff, international trade, us foreign policy, astrazeneca, pfizer, donald trump, pascal soriot, britain, eu","President Trump on Friday announced a deal with the British drugmaker AstraZeneca to lower drug prices, his second pact with a major pharmaceutical company in an effort to make prescription drugs more affordable. Under the deal, AstraZeneca agreed to sell its drugs to Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income Americans, at about the same prices that it offers to wealthy countries in Europe. The agreement, along with one with Pfizer last week , is the product of a Trumpian brand of horse-trading. For months, the president has threatened to impose tariffs on imported medicines , demanding that drug companies lower prices and bring manufacturing back to the United States. Drugmakers have been eager to find ways to dodge much more aggressive action that could cut deeply into their profits. The nation’s top health officials publicly acknowledged on Friday that Mr. Trump’s tariff threats were the leverage needed to persuade powerful drug companies to expand and build new U.S. plants as well. “Now, I’m not sure that Pascal would like to say — but behind the scenes, he did say, tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Mr. Trump said, referring to AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, who stood beside him at Friday’s announcement in the Oval Office. AstraZeneca and Pfizer both revealed that their new pricing arrangements with the White House guaranteed them a three-year reprieve from any tariffs the Trump administration would impose on the products they produced overseas. The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent on brand-name drugs from the European Union and 100 percent from other parts of the world, but it has delayed those from a deadline of Oct. 1. Still, it is unclear whether Mr. Trump’s deals would significantly lower Medicaid’s drug prices. In many cases, the prices that Medicaid pays are already similar to those in Europe, experts said. And the AstraZeneca agreement involves only a small share of the company’s U.S. sales. At his Oval Office news briefing, Mr. Trump promised, without evidence, “We’re going to bring drug prices down at numbers that nobody ever thought possible.” He spoke of delivering seemingly impossible price reductions, such as a “654 percent discount” on Bevespi Aerosphere, an AstraZeneca inhaler for patients with respiratory problems. “For too long, America has shouldered a disproportionate portion of the world’s R.&D. costs,” Mr. Soriot said, referring to research and development. “That imbalance is not sustainable. It had to change.” The two deals so far do not affect the bulk of prescription drug coverage. AstraZeneca made no commitment to lower prices for drugs it currently sells for U.S. employers, insurers and other government programs like Medicare, which shoulder most of the costs of drugs in the United States. Brand-name drug prices in the United States are three times as high , on average, as those in peer nations. But the disparities vary across types of insurance. Drugmakers already give Medicaid lower prices than other payers in the United States because of discounts that are required under federal law. People on Medicaid already pay almost nothing in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes. In some states, people with Medicaid have no out-of-pocket costs. The voluntary approach stands in contrast with Mr. Trump’s first term, when he tried to mandate lower drug prices through regulation and other forms of formal public policy. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. secured legislation to regulate drug prices in Medicare. The new deals are occurring while Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have been wrangling with Democrats over whether to extend Obamacare subsidies that help cover the costs of health insurance for more than 20 million Americans. Democrats have seized on the issue as a way of criticizing the Trump administration for raising Americans’ health care costs. Mr. Trump has argued that his deals over drug prices will help more consumers. At Friday’s event, officials touted a website, TrumpRx.gov , which would help patients use their own money to buy drugs, sidestepping insurance. The online drugstore would act as a landing page to send American patients to direct-sales websites offered by various drugmakers. Officials put up a promotional version of the website on Friday and said it would be up and running next year. Mr. Trump said the TrumpRx name had not been his idea. AstraZeneca recently set up a website that will be part of TrumpRx where patients can use their own money to buy several of the company’s drugs. It include Farxiga, for diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure; Airsupra, an asthma inhaler; and FluMist, a nasal flu vaccine recently authorized for home use . The company plans to expand the website to include other primary care drugs. That website may be helpful in certain circumstances , but most insured patients pay less in out-of-pocket costs than they would pay for the drugs directly. For example, some patients can buy a month’s supply of Farxiga for $182 on AstraZeneca’s site, while their co-payment may be only $25 if they use insurance. In both the United States and Europe, drug prices are determined through negotiations. The talks between drug companies and representatives for payers result in confidential discounts that lower the final price that European countries and American employers and government programs pay for a medicine. Administration officials have been floating the idea that for newly introduced drugs, drugmakers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca would match their U.S. and European prices even after those confidential discounts were taken into account. The Trump administration did not explain how that would work. As a practical matter, it is nearly impossible for a drugmaker to commit to doing that. A key reason that European governments receive bigger discounts is that they are more willing to walk away from negotiations if a price is too high, denying their citizens coverage of that medication. In July, Mr. Trump sent letters to 17 of the largest drugmakers , including AstraZeneca, asking them to lower some of their prices. Like other large multinational drugmakers, AstraZeneca has long had a presence in the United States, its most important market . The company has moved recently to strengthen those ties. AstraZeneca already makes most of the products it sells in the American market in the United States. In July, AstraZeneca said it planned to spend $50 billion over the next five years building and expanding factories and research facilities in the United States. On Thursday, the company held a groundbreaking ceremony for one of those manufacturing investments, at a site in Virginia that it said would help manufacture drugs for cancer, weight loss and blood pressure. AstraZeneca said last week that it planned to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange next year, though it will remain headquartered in Britain and listed in London and Stockholm. Legislation passed during the Biden administration has allowed Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over the prices of a small number of prescription drugs each year. The companies challenged the law in court, but lost, and the first round of discounts will go into effect next year. In the Oval Office event, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the health secretary, said the savings from the program had been disappointing. In an event on Monday at the Aspen Institute, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he expected a series of similar announcements from drug companies in the coming weeks. He praised the voluntary nature of these deals over more official forms of policymaking that would have most likely prompted legal challenges from the industry. “All these are opportunities for us to re-envision the way the government normally works, not based on litigation, slowing everything down, but by leapfrogging litigation, if possible, to get people to do what they probably want to do,” he said. At the event, he also suggested that the TrumpRx website may be useful to Americans who become uninsured under work requirements for Medicaid that were passed into law this summer. “We should have some mechanism to give you access to pharmaceuticals at the best prices possible,” he said of that group. “TrumpRx and other tools may be helpful.” The Trump administration may not have foreclosed the possibility of more aggressive regulatory approaches to lowering drug prices, too. Two notices have recently appeared on government websites indicating that rules linking U.S. drug prices to overseas targets may be forthcoming.

de71403c9ad9,Shein Chose Paris for Its First Boutique. Paris Isn’t Pleased.,"retail, fashion, civil unrest, e commerce, shein, anne hidalgo, paris france","The sixth floor of Paris’s iconic BHV Marais department store, with its sweeping rooftop views toward the Eiffel Tower, is one of the most coveted retail spots in the city. It is also now the focus of an uproar over the Chinese e-commerce giant Shein, which is setting up its first physical boutique atop the fashion capital of the world. The news that Shein’s ultracheap knockoffs, from pink miniskirts to black berets, would be moving beyond online retail and into brick-and-mortar stores has unified politicians and fashionistas in anger and given steam to an effort by French lawmakers to halt its continued online expansion as well. The Paris boutique is set to open on Nov. 1, and Shein is planning to open stores in five other French cities, a move that it promotes as an “homage” to France and its role in fashion. But the company’s charm offensive has worn thin. On Friday, employees at BHV Marais quit their cash registers for a few hours and gathered outside to protest the opening of a 1,000-square-meter space for Shein. Many denounced what they said was the incursion into France of a low-cost Chinese competitor that used cheap labor and violated environmental and human rights standards in making its clothes. “Shein goes against our beliefs,” said one employee, who, like others in the crowd, declined to give her name, citing privacy concerns. “We have always been a beautiful store with beautiful brands, and we try to promote corporate social responsibility.” Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, did not hold back. “Paris denounces the establishment of Shein, a symbol of fast fashion, at BHV Marais,” she declared in a LinkedIn post this week. The historic department store, known as the Bazar de l’Hôtel de Ville, was built as a bustling market hall in 1856. An online petition calling for Shein to be barred from opening at BHV Marais gained nearly 100,000 signatures in a week. Shein did not respond to requests for comment. In France, as elsewhere, Shein has seduced consumers by offering a head-spinning variety of cheap-chic clothing with free shipping direct from factories in China. At a time when France is facing economic austerity , political upheaval and stubborn inflation, the label has positioned itself as an affordable alternative to expensive French brands. But as Shein has grown, so have questions about its practices . The company has been accused of working with suppliers that violate labor laws and of failing to make full disclosures about factory conditions. Shein has repeatedly said that it conducts regular internal audits and that it has a strict compliance code for its suppliers. The Trump administration recently cracked down on Shein’s mail-in model in the United States by closing a loophole that allowed low-value goods to be shipped duty-free. European capitals are also moving to charge Shein and Temu, another Chinese fast-fashion retailer, for small packages until aEuropean Union-wide tax goes into effect in a year. France, home to Chanel, Dior and other high-fashion brands, has gone further. Just before Paris Fashion Week opened in September, the French Senate passed a so-called anti-Shein measure that would add taxes of up to 10 euros per garment purchased from Chinese online platforms like Temu and Shein and require the companies to report the environmental effect of their clothing. The legislation, which still needs final approval, would also ban the companies’ ads in France and penalize influencers who promoted them. France’s antitrust watchdog fined Shein €40 million for “unfair commercial practices” in July, accusing it after a yearlong investigation of promoting misleading advertising discounts. Shein has been pushing back. To stoke visibility, Shein opened its first pop-up store in the Marais district of central Paris during Fashion Week, drawing throngs. A French influencer, Magali Berdah, collaborated with Shein on a series of TikTok videos in which she interviewed young French shoppers gushing over Shein’s affordable fashion, while warning that new fees would put such goodies out of reach. “This tax will not make fashion more responsible,” Ms. Berdah says in one video, referring to the Senate bill. “It will simply make it less accessible.” “By choosing France as the place to trial physical retail, we are honoring its position as a key fashion capital and embracing its spirit of creativity and excellence,” Donald Tang, the executive chairman of Shein, said in a statement. French bureaucrats, bankers and fashion brands are maintaining a united front. This week they continued to move with startling swiftness to curb the incursion, which French officials say has been made possible by a wealthy French family-owned real estate empire, the Société des Grands Magasins, or SGM. That group operates BHV Marais and Galeries Lafayette, an iconic French department store with locations in numerous French cities. Recently, it struck a deal allowing Shein to operate out of stores bearing the Galeries Lafayette name in Paris, Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges. SGM has been trying to buy the BHV Marais building outright. But this week, France’s state-owned bank, which had been negotiating with SGM to finance a joint purchase of the property, pulled out over the Shein partnership. A spokesman for SGM said Shein was “committed to complying with all European standards, just like any other supplier.” “Shein wants to take advantage of this transaction to adapt its current production model to European requirements,” he added. Inside BHV Marais, French specialty brands are leaving the department store in protest, including the Aime and Talm organic skin care lines, Culture Vintage and Le Slip Francais, a lingerie brand. “Our collective choices are building the future of our industry,” Mathilde Lacombe, the president of Aime, said on LinkedIn . “Who is joining us?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/shein-retail-store-paris-backlash.html,Business,BBC,By Liz Alderman and Ségolène Le Stradic,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10biz-paris-shein-vlgw/10biz-paris-shein-vlgw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T18:06:58+00:00,fe610591d3371558c95b88eb6921d22fb49f9935
b08ab21033b0,An Immense Solar Project Just Got Canceled Under Trump,"nextera energy, solar energy, climate change;global warming, land use, blm, interior department, invenergy, nevada","An enormous solar power project in the Nevada desert that would have been one of the world’s largest has been canceled, according to the Interior Department. The reason for the cancellation was not immediately clear. But the project appeared to be the latest casualty of the Trump administration’s efforts to thwart the construction of solar and wind energy projects on millions of acres of public lands, predominantly in the American West. The project, known as Esmeralda 7, would have comprised a sprawling network of solar panels and batteries across 118,000 acres of federally owned land in the Nevada desert northwest of Las Vegas. It was expected to produce up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power nearly two million homes. The developers of the project included NextEra Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, and Invenergy, a company that builds solar and wind farms as well as natural gas plants and battery storage systems. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management quietly updated its webpage on the project’s permitting process late Thursday to reflect the cancellation. The webpage did not provide additional information. Alyse Sharpe, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in a Friday email that Esmeralda 7 consisted of seven separate solar projects and that the developers could still seek permits for each individual project. But restarting the permitting process, which was already in its late stages, could lead to significant delays. Neil Nissan, a spokesman for NextEra, said in an email that the utility was “committed” to its portion of the project and would work with the Interior Department. The cancellation caused concern on Capitol Hill, where Nevada lawmakers and clean energy lobbyists said they were scrambling to find out details. “The Trump Administration’s lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement, adding that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum should “clarify the administration’s actions soon.” The move comes as the Trump administration has taken a rapid-fire series of steps to slow or stop the construction of renewable energy projects on public and private lands across the country. The Interior Department is now requiring dozens of formerly routine approvals for wind and solar projects to undergo new layers of political review by the interior secretary’s office, a policy that is causing significant permitting delays. The agency is also opening investigations into bird deaths caused by wind farms and withdrawing millions of acres of federal waters previously available for leasing by offshore wind companies. In addition, the Interior Department has ordered work to stop on several wind farms off the coast of New England. Last month, however, a federal judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could restart work on one of these projects, a $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is 80 percent complete. At the same time, the Trump administration has continued to approve permits for new oil and gas drilling and to encourage coal mining. The burning of fossil fuels is a main driver of climate change. During the ongoing government shutdown, the Interior Department has designated employees who process oil drilling permits as essential, enabling them to keep working while other workers are furloughed. Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada, a Republican, sent a letter to Mr. Burgum in August expressing concern about the new layers of political review for solar and wind projects. He wrote that the additional scrutiny could “prevent or unnecessarily delay energy development in the state that is poised to help meet the growing energy demands of the mining industry and data centers.” Representatives for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Esmeralda 7 had advanced through the permitting process under the Biden administration, which prioritized clean energy development as part of its ambitious climate agenda. But after President Trump took office, the Bureau of Land Management declined to release a final environmental impact statement, the next step in the process to approve the project. NextEra was among the companies that donated at least $5 million to fund the construction of Mr. Trump’s $200 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, CBS News reported . Another one of the utility’s large solar projects in Nevada, known as Dodge Flat II, was still listed as “in progress” on the Bureau of Land Management website on Friday. Rebecca F.

fd9dce4e6989,Trump Says Federal Layoffs Have Begun During Government Shutdown,"layoffs;furloughs, civil service, closings, federal budget, us politics, donald trump, russell t. vought","President Trump said on Friday that his administration had started a new round of federal layoffs, as he seized on the government shutdown to cull the civil work force and pressure Democrats into accepting his fiscal demands. The layoffs appeared to target more than 4,000 employees across seven major federal departments, according to the administration, which revealed its plans in a filing to a federal court that is considering the legality of the cuts. That filing also hinted at the possibility of additional dismissals if the closure in Washington continues. The Trump administration said it had targeted more than 1,400 employees at the Treasury Department, and nearly 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, where notices started to reach some workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by late Friday. The administration also proceeded with layoffs at the Commerce Department, the Education Department, the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the court filing, which indicated that the cuts at many of those agencies would range into the hundreds. By seeking to oust civil servants during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Speaking in the Oval Office on Friday, the president blamed Democrats, as he estimated that “a lot” of workers would be affected and asserted the layoffs would be “Democrat-oriented.” The comments illustrated anew the ways in which Mr. Trump has come to embrace the shutdown as a political opportunity, one that may allow him to rearrange the federal budget and exact revenge on his enemies. He has also halted tens of billions of dollars in federal aid to cities and states run by Democrats, while party leaders in Washington refuse to fund the government absent a deal to extend a set of expiring health insurance subsidies. Unions representing federal workers quickly denounced the attempted firings as illegal and blasted the Trump administration for trying to use the government’s work force as a bargaining chip in a political feud. The labor groups, which had sued to block the layoffs before the shutdown began, urged a federal judge on Friday to render a decision swiftly. “It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions suing the administration. Under its published guidelines , the government typically must give workers 60 days’ notice before a layoff, though the timeline may be reduced to 30 days in certain exceptions. In some cases, though, it was not clear whether federal agencies had sent layoff notices on Friday to specific employees, or whether they had rather identified programs and offices that they would look to cut soon. Many Democrats and even one Republican — Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chamber’s lead appropriator — condemned the administration for the timing and scope of its attempted firings. In a statement, Ms. Collins blamed Democrats for the shutdown but said that laying off federal workers could “cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.” “Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,” she said. The administration’s renewed threats capped a day of confusion and fear for many federal workers, hundreds of thousands of whom are already furloughed and still others who must continue to work without pay. Mr. Trump’s planned layoffs could further decimate that civilian work force, which is already expected to employ 300,000 fewer people by the end of December compared with January, officials have said. The staggering decline is a direct result of Mr. Trump, who has presided over an aggressive and legally contested effort to shrink the bureaucracy, including through mass layoffs and induced retirements. Throughout the day, the White House repeatedly declined to answer questions about the strategy, scope and timing of any planned cuts. Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said only in a social media post that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to the reduction-in-force notices to federal employees about pending dismissals. That left federal workers to piece together the fate of their own jobs when many may not even have access to their government email. At the Environmental Protection Agency, employees received notice that a round of layoffs would soon arrive. A message reviewed by The New York Times from Steven Cook, the principal deputy assistant administrator of the E.P.A.’s Office of Land and Emergency Management, said employees there and in two other offices would learn within 60 days whether they would lose their jobs. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that terminations would fall on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect against threats to the country’s election system, power grids and water utilities. And the Education Department — a major target of Mr. Trump’s cuts to date — appeared poised to shed workers at its Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, according to union leaders. The planned layoffs there, like many on Friday, appeared to mirror the sort of changes that Mr. Trump had envisioned as part of his 2026 budget submission to Congress. The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began on Oct. 1. In a memo last month, the president’s budget aides essentially argued that a lapse in funding would mean that the government no longer needed to retain some of its workers. The Trump administration even appeared to issue guidance that allowed officials producing termination notices to work throughout the federal stoppage, a status typically reserved for the most vital employees, including military service members. Union officials later contested those actions in federal court, arguing they were a violation of federal law, which restricts the government during a shutdown to select activities meant to protect life and national security. This week, a judge in that case ordered the Trump administration to respond by Friday evening, at which point the government unfurled the additional details about its layoff plans. An initial hearing is scheduled on Wednesday. In their reply, lawyers for the Trump administration defended the president’s power to conduct the mass federal terminations. But they also issued a veiled threat, noting that these and other agencies are “considering whether to conduct” additional layoffs in the coming days. Unions responded hours later, telling the court that they had evidence to believe that the Trump administration had misled the court over the timing and scope of its layoffs. Labor groups said they had evidence showing that the Department of Health and Human Services, in particular, “is requiring its employees to work over the weekend” to send layoff notices at the C.D.C. Mr. Trump’s pursuit of mass layoffs seemed only to widen the political chasm between the White House and congressional Democrats, possibly prolonging a shutdown with lawmakers having left Washington for the weekend. “Let’s be blunt: Nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a statement. “They don’t have to do it; they want to. They’re callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.” Democrats continue to reject a Republican plan to reopen federal agencies into next month as they seek to extend a set of expiring subsidies that help millions of Americans afford health insurance. Many Democrats have also expressed fear that Mr. Trump would not honor any spending deal that they struck, given the myriad ways that the president has tried to circumvent Congress to rearrange the budget. “I think to their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, told reporters earlier on Friday. But, he added, that could soon change. “That’s what a shutdown does,” Mr. Thune said. “You put the administration and this presidency in a position where you have to make some hard decisions.” Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Madeleine Ngo, Sarah Mervosh, Eileen Sullivan, Lisa Friedman and Alan Rappeport.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/federal-layoffs-government-shutdown.html,Business,BBC,By Tony Romm,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10dc-layoffs-tfpb/10dc-layoffs-tfpb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:49:19+00:00,c24dd5d63aeb6a41e67882a97c95ab8b8a347400
7bba591af947,Billions of Dollars ‘Vanished’: Low-Profile Bankruptcy Rings Alarms on Wall Street,"debt, bankruptcy, banking and finance, private equity, cars, first brands, blackrock, jefferies group, ubs","When First Brands, an auto-parts maker, filed for bankruptcy late last month, it was not the sort of event that would typically draw attention in the world’s financial capitals. A midsize manufacturer of pumps, filters and other under-the-hood products sold at retailers like AutoZone and Walmart, the company had expanded in recent years and had, it would appear, simply grown too quickly. But now, the company is at the center of swirling milieu on Wall Street and beyond over the loans that fueled its rise and the questionable accounting, some of its creditors say, that preceded the fall. Some well-known firms in international finance have been swept up in the fallout from company’s collapse, in some combination of losses, finger-pointing and embarrassment at having missed the signs of danger. That group includes Jefferies, the New York investment bank that arranged much of First Brands’ financing; UBS, the Swiss bank that provided a big chunk of the money; and BlackRock, which funneled money to an intermediary that lent it to the company. The total losses are expected to tally into the billions of dollars, according to Texas bankruptcy court filings and people involved in the negotiations over what comes next. This week, a representative of one of the company’s creditors said in a court filing that as much as $2.3 billion of assets had “simply vanished.” But it is not solely the sum of the potential losses that has so many financiers on edge. Many of the loans to First Brands originated from the booming, loosely regulated world of “ private credit .” Unlike traditional banks, private credit lenders say, they have the ability to lend quickly because they understand complicated, risky businesses and do not need to worry about repaying ordinary depositors or reporting public earnings. Trillions of dollars have been plowed into private credit over the past decade, principally from pension funds, endowments and other groups that rely on such investments to fulfill obligations to retirees and the like. The Trump administration made moves this summer to allow 401(k) plans to invest savings into the private equity funds that extend private credit to companies, raising the stakes even further. The First Brands bankruptcy could amount to something of an I-told-you-so moment for the traditional bankers and private-credit skeptics who have long maintained that these upstart lenders deserve more scrutiny. Before its unraveling, First Brands was seen as a success story. Founded by Patrick James, a Malaysian-born businessman, the Cleveland company expanded rapidly over the past decade by buying 15 competitors, including brands such as FRAM (air and oil filters) and Autolite (spark plugs). First Brands sells most of its products directly to the public on five continents and the rest to carmakers, which sell them under their own names. It says that it employs 26,000 people and that its sales totaled $5 billion last year. A First Brands spokesman wouldn’t name the cars that include its components, but one hint in its bankruptcy filing is that the credit arms of Ford Motor and General Motors are among the companies it owes money. A General Motors spokeswoman said the company was monitoring the situation but did not anticipate any “material interruption to our operations.” To pay for its acquisitions and inventory, First Brands borrowed heavily. It did so both in the open and in harder-to-trace ways, filings show, or both “on” and “off” its balance sheet of financial accounting. On First Brands’ balance sheet was $6 billion of junk-rated debt, or loans the company took out at high interest rates in traditional fashion. This is neither unusual nor noteworthy on Wall Street. Nor did it raise many immediate concerns when the company this summer hired Jefferies, the investment bank, to help it renegotiate the debt’s terms for more time to pay back the loans. During that process, however, First Brands’ lenders began asking for more information on the company’s finances — and discovered that the auto-parts maker had a few billion dollars in “off balance sheet” debt. The lenders now say in court filings that those hadn’t been fully disclosed and involved a complicated loop of legal entities and overlapping promises of repayment to various private-credit firms, including several part-owned by Jefferies itself. Already, creditors say, they have uncovered trouble with First Brands’ use of invoices to borrow money. In this form of financing, which is not uncommon, lenders provide money that is meant to be repaid when specific retailers send in checks for First Brand products. The idea is that this is a short-term, relatively low-risk arrangement so long as the retailer pays the invoice in a timely fashion. The problem was that First Brands had pledged money from the same invoices to multiple lenders, essentially double or triple counting what it expected its customers to be paying, according to the bankruptcy filings. Because these arrangements were held off the company’s balance sheet, creditors say they were not aware that the same invoices were pledged more than once. Last month, with questions mounting, First Brands’ efforts to refinance its debt fell apart, and the company filed for bankruptcy not long after. The company said that it had less than $30 million left in its coffers and that there was nothing left in the accounts that were supposed to hold the collateral for the off balance sheet loans. “There’s just a lot that we don’t know, to put it bluntly,” a lawyer for some of the firm’s creditors told the bankruptcy court this month. The same lawyer called First Brands’ financial structure a “black box.” The interest in the company’s issues, which were earlier reported by The Financial Times, has been intense. During the first bankruptcy hearing, held remotely from Houston, the judge said there were 500 people listening in and asked that callers combine into single lines so that the court’s software could fit them all in. During that hearing, a lawyer for the company and Mr. James blamed, among other factors, President Trump’s tariffs for First Brands’ woes, saying they “caused additional landing costs for goods.” The lawyer said her clients generally denied any wrongdoing and attributed the company’s demise to “macroeconomic factors and headwinds that were outside of management’s control.” Dozens of private credit lenders and hedge funds say they are out money. Private funds run by UBS say they are owed more than $500 million. BlackRock is also owed a sum that it hasn’t yet specified. Other lesser-known investors in private credit such as CarVal and Ellington Management Group are also in the queue. Hardest hit for now is Jefferies. One of its asset management subsidiaries, Point Bonita Capital, had lent $715 million to First Brands to supply inventory to retailers like Walmart and Advance Auto Parts. The bank said in a statement that it hadn’t been paid for those loans since Sept. 15, and First Brands’ representatives have told the bankruptcy court that they are investigating whether that money was already sent to a different lender to satisfy another loan. Jefferies’ stock has dropped 17 percent this week. A spokesman, Joseph Ziemer, said the bank’s potential exposure had been “dramatically overstated by many.” Questions now turn to whether other auto-parts companies may also face troubles. First Brands’ trouble “leads me to believe there are other suppliers that may also be at risk,” Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, said Friday.

8537361f7aaa,The Fiscal Gambit at the Center of the Shutdown,"federal budget, closings, tax cuts and jobs act, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, obamacare;affordable care act;aca, health insurance, us economy, us politics, democrats, republicans, house of representatives, congress, senate, congress","A political party with total control of Washington wants to put more money back in the pockets of Americans. Doing so is expensive, and so the lawmakers vote to put a new policy in place for only a few years to hold down the cost. The hope is that once it is actually set to end, even lawmakers who initially opposed the policy will want it to continue, fearful of taking a benefit away from voters. Sound familiar? This is the strategy at the heart of the government shutdown. Democrats used it when they passed expanded health insurance subsidies three years ago, scheduling the benefits to expire this year so they had to pay for them only temporarily. Now they want the subsidies continued as part of a deal to reopen the government. It is a tactic with a long history. Republicans have repeatedly used it to transform what were initially temporary tax cuts into permanent reductions in government revenue. Indeed, much of the nation’s current fiscal predicament is a result of lawmakers’ hesitation to let policies expire as scheduled. “This has been going on steadily,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a former Republican budget aide. “You back the expiration up against an election, and if you’re not in power, you force the other party to deal with it or suffer negative consequences.” “This is designed for games of chicken and a standoff,” he added, “and we’re living through that now.” Republicans pioneered the modern approach under President George W. Bush, when the party passed sweeping tax cuts and scheduled them to expire a few years later. When the tax cuts were set to end during the Obama administration, Democrats, nervous about letting taxes go up, struck a deal to permanently continue them. The next time Republicans had full control of Washington, in 2017, they again cut taxes only temporarily so that the cost estimates at the time would be lower. Taxes for many Americans would have returned to higher rates at the end of this year if Republicans had not passed a sweeping law this summer making many of the 2017 cuts permanent. “As a tactic, it’s been immensely successful,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that seeks lower deficits. “This game of limping along and pretending in fake expirations with the expectation that they will get extended anyway has been utilized in numerous ways.” With the health insurance subsidies now at issue, Democrats are trying to put the tactic toward their own purposes. The subsidies — an expansion of tax credits available to people who buy their own health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act — were enacted in 2021. At the time, Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, and the party approved the subsidies for only one year at first before extending them through 2025. Many Democrats would have supported passing the health insurance subsidies for the longer term, but the party was also trying to reduce the recorded cost of the overall piece of legislation. So the 2022 law, the Inflation Reduction Act, created the cliff that lawmakers are now facing, which threatens to raise insurance premiums by more than 100 percent for the average consumer in the Affordable Care Act market. “What the Democrats did on the Affordable Care Act subsidies is a smaller-scale version of what Republicans have done both in 2017 and 2001, 2003,” said Aviva Aron-Dine, who worked on tax policy for the Biden administration. Republicans have blasted Democrats for insisting that they will support government funding only if it includes extending the health care subsidies. Yet some G.O.P. lawmakers also seem wary of letting health care costs skyrocket in a midterm election year. Republicans in the House and Senate have signaled support for extending the insurance subsidies. But it is not inevitable that lawmakers will extend an expiring policy, even if failing to do so raises costs or claws back a benefit for many Americans. Under the Biden administration, for example, Democrats had also approved a temporary, one-year expansion of the child tax credit . The policy sent monthly checks to many American families with children, helping to significantly reduce child poverty in the United States. But continuing the larger child tax credit was expensive, and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a pivotal vote, opposed continuing such a huge outlay. The benefit ended after one year without any visible political backlash. Given that history, Ms. Aron-Dine said it was still unclear whether the current attempt on health care would pan out. “If the theory was that you could run this play on policies targeting health care for moderate and middle-income people, the jury is still out on whether it’s going to work,” she said. It is this risk that prompted Republicans to make many of the 2017 tax cuts permanent this year, rather than extending them only temporarily. Achieving that meant bypassing a decades-old rule in Washington that barred lawmakers from increasing the deficit over the long term without bipartisan support. To do so, Republicans argued that extending the existing tax cuts should not be counted as a new cost to the budget, even if the tax cuts had been scheduled to end. Republicans used this accounting gimmick to wipe away the $3.8 trillion cost of keeping the tax cuts over 10 years, roughly 10 times the $350 billion cost of extending the health insurance subsidies over a decade. At the same time, they also piled on a set of new tax cuts, including Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime. But the new cuts are temporary, with several of them set to end in 2028, setting up another political fight over expiring policies that could raise costs for many Americans in just a few more years. “This is a damaging way to make policy,” said Doug Elmendorf, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the former dean of the Harvard Kennedy School. “It makes the true costs somewhat hidden when policies are being discussed, and it makes projections of the federal budget misleading in important ways. And so we would be better off if our elected leaders would honestly face and discuss the cost of the policies they are proposing.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/shutdown-government-funding-health-insurance.html,Business,BBC,By Andrew Duehren,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10dc-fiscalgame-01-tjbl/10dc-fiscalgame-01-tjbl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T14:01:16+00:00,fc0be988ab330f892c7129bbc27689f1fad7f095
2f449b79a498,Fintech Start-Ups and Investment Firms Are Battling Over Your 401(k),"pensions and retirement plans, asset allocation, 401k, financial planner, service content, retirement, personal finance, consumer protection, fidelity investments","For years, employees with workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s were largely expected to choose investments from a menu provided by the investment companies hired by their employer and then manage the investments on their own. But now, upstart financial technology firms are connecting outside financial advisers to employer-sponsored plans, allowing the advisers to take steps like rebalancing accounts on behalf of their clients. At least one investment company is resisting the financial tech firms’ moves. And both employees and the outside advisers are finding themselves caught in a tug of war over who can manage these retirement accounts and how they do it. Fidelity Investments, the country’s biggest 401(k) administrator, has been warning investors in these plans that they may lose online access to their accounts, and that it could even void certain customer protections, if they share their online credentials with firms offering such tools. One investor who was temporarily locked out of his account at Fidelity was Kelly Havins, 63, a grocery brand consultant in Phoenix. Mr. Havins said he had hired a financial adviser who offers 401(k) management through a service provided by a technology firm called Pontera. “I don’t have the time or the understanding” to manage investments, he said. In late August, Mr. Havins received a letter from Fidelity, saying that because he had shared his login with an outside provider, he had to contact the company to reset his credentials — or risk being barred from online access to his 401(k). “I was surprised,” Mr. Havins said. “I thought it was a scam.” On Sept. 4, with a deadline for losing access approaching, he called Fidelity. “They said, ‘We have to make sure it’s you,’” he recalled, and asked him to email a copy of his driver’s license. He declined. “I said: ‘I’m not comfortable with that. You know who I am,’” Mr. Havins said. “And they said, ‘Consider yourself locked out.’” The next day, he said, he was unable to log into his account. He was eventually able to reset his credentials and regain access with the help of his financial adviser. But his account could be flagged again. Many affected plan participants who contacted Fidelity to reset their credentials said they were unaware they had shared them, Fidelity said. What’s different about the new 401(k) digital access tools? Some earlier digital tools, like Fidelity’s eMoney financial planning software, gave advisers “read only” access to workplace plans, allowing them to simply view data. Pontera and a handful of competitors go further, providing digital tools that allow advisers to take action within the 401(k), like rebalancing accounts to make sure investments reflect the client’s goals and comfort with risk. Investment advisers say the access is significant because it allows them to better coordinate holdings in workplace plans with a client’s other investments when deciding how to allocate funds. That helps make sure the client does not have too much invested in stocks, for instance. Pontera promotes its service to advisers, who invite their clients to connect their accounts to Pontera’s platform via a screen at the office or an email. The advisers can’t see or gain access to the credentials, which are held by Pontera; its system taps into Fidelity to carry out the adviser’s instructions. Pontera charges the advisers a fee on the assets managed through its platform “Pontera has been a game changer,” said Carl Szasz, founder of Verde Capital Management in Clarkston, Mich. Because he is a fiduciary — meaning he must act in his clients’ best interests — he wants to include his clients’ workplace accounts in their financial management plan, he said. “I want to be able to act and do my job.” The employer-based retirement market is vast. Americans held $13 trillion in all employer-based plans, including $9.3 trillion in 401(k) plans, according to midyear data from the Investment Company Institute. What do workplace retirement plan administrators think of the tools? Fidelity, with more than 24 million plan participants in some 25,000 corporate plans, is wary of some of the new tools. The retirement giant had been warning for nearly a year that it would move to bar certain fintech firms from its employer-sponsored accounts because the firms tap into the accounts with user names and passwords shared with them by investors working with their clients. “Credential sharing presents security risks to our customers,” Fidelity said in September 2024, “particularly when it enables third parties to take high-risk actions, such as executing trades within the account.” Fidelity recently began making good on that warning, cutting off online access to savers if they shared their credentials with digital tools that gave their advisers access to their accounts. Mr. Szasz said about 190 of his firm’s clients with accounts at Fidelity were disconnected. Some have been able to reconnect, but others have not. “They’re stopping people from accessing their own accounts,” he said. “We’re stuck in the middle.” He noted that Fidelity offered financial advisement through its own network, so it might have an incentive to limit access by outside advisers. Fidelity said in an email that its efforts to require participants to update their credentials weren’t focusing on whether third-party advisers should have access to a participant’s account. “We are focused on how some advisers are gaining such access by using customer credentials,” it said. Other 401(k) administrators seem comfortable with Pontera. The firm, for instance, recently announced a “collaboration” with Manulife John Hancock Retirement. “We’ve done our due diligence,” said Wayne Park, the retirement firm’s chief executive, adding that “their security is up to our standards.” Having a secure digital connection, he said, is superior to old-school alternatives, like having clients deliver stacks of paper statements to their advisers. Do the new tools comply with financial regulations? Pontera says its model, in which investors authorize it to act as their agent, fits into various regulatory frameworks, including Securities and Exchange Commission guidance on how financial advisers may gain access to workplace accounts. Advisers working with Pontera don’t have access to a client’s login credentials — that is managed by Pontera — and they can’t withdraw or transfer funds or change beneficiaries, steps that would signal they had taken “custody” of the account. “Consumers have rights to ask that an agent perform an action for them,” Zachary Pardes, a Pontera spokesman, said in an email. “This is not a gray area.” Yoav Zurel, Pontera’s chief executive, said, “This is what customers want, and it’s their money.” Asked for comment, the S.E.C. press office sent an email on Wednesday saying it was unable to respond because of the government shutdown. Competing firms provide similar services but operate differently. Absolute Capital of Pittsburgh also helps financial advisers manage their clients’ workplace retirement plans. But it has formal agreements with retirement plan custodians so when it taps into a customer’s 401(k), the plan knows it is Absolute Capital. (With Pontera’s model, the firm is logging in as the client.) “We come in through the front door,” said Brenden Gebben, the company’s chief executive. “We’re recognized as the authorized agent.” Some state regulators, who generally oversee smaller advisory firms, have raised concerns, including those in Colorado . Some other states, like Rhode Island, have said using the tools is acceptable as long as advisers discuss them with clients and act in keeping with their fiduciary duties. Pontera acknowledged that it did not have a formal data-sharing agreement with Fidelity, but maintained that it wasn’t required to have one, in part because plan participants grant the firm access to their information. Pontera says client credentials are stored in a digital “vault” and protected by multiple layers of encryption. Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said Fidelity’s concerns about cybersecurity were “legitimate” because Pontera had access to its accounts without a software gateway, known as an API connection. So it’s possible Pontera could gain access to information beyond what the client intends. Pontera said that a year ago, it offered to create an API and customize its access to Fidelity accounts, but that Fidelity had not responded to its request. Why would someone want an outside adviser to manage a 401(k)? Traditionally, 401(k) and similar defined contribution plans were largely off limits to financial advisers until the employee left the company or retired. The plans first became widely available in the 1980s, and early versions generally offered a limited menu of mutual funds. The addition of target-date funds, intended to automatically become less risky as an investor’s retirement approaches, further simplified options. But in recent years, 401(k) plan offerings have become more complex, and some investors need more help to stay on track for retirement, advisers argue. Some plans now offer the option to invest in riskier alternative investments , like cryptocurrency and gold. And menus have expanded. Some plans offer brokerage windows, which let more savvy investors place trades themselves in a much broader selection of investments. Could advisers get access to workplace plans in the past? If people with an employer-based retirement account wanted professional advice from an independent adviser, they would typically send account statements to their advisers. Or they could visit the adviser’s office, log into the accounts in person and view the investments together. (Fidelity says it supports that approach.) Advisers would make recommendations to their clients, who would then have to enact the changes themselves. The problem is that clients often fail to enact the changes, said Kyle Louvar, chief executive of Guided Capital Wealth Management in Houston, where Mr. Havins is a client. “We’d agree on a plan, but they would oftentimes forget,” he said. What should savers know about having an adviser manage a 401(k)? Having your adviser manage your 401(k) directly may be more expensive than doing it yourself. Pontera charges advisers fees of 20 to 30 basis points — 0.2 to 0.3 percent — on assets managed through its platform. Mr. Frayer said firms probably passed those costs on to their clients. Mr. Frayer said clients should consider whether it was realistic to expect that their adviser would help them beat the market, if they were also paying higher fees. Even if cybersecurity concerns are resolved, he said, “I see the fees passed on as a core issue.” Some retirement plans offer automatic rebalancing, said Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner who writes for Kitces.com , and savers invested in target-date funds don’t generally need to rebalance because the funds’ investment mix adjusts as they age.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/your-money/401-k-fintech-advisers-fidelity.html,Business,BBC,By Ann Carrns,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/pageoneplus/10biz-adviser/10biz-adviser-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-10T13:00:12.621000+00:00,b3fc819fc3c186b3777cc991b391a57c11886fe4

That’s Not Always a Good Thing.,"basketball, discrimination, cyberharassment;online harassment;cyberbullies;online trolls, social media, rumors and misinformation, right-wing extremism and alt-right, artificial intelligence, race and ethnicity, women and girls, wnba, caitlin clark, cathy engelbert, angel reese","About a week and a half after the first cryptocurrency tout threw a bright green sex toy onto the Atlanta Dream’s court midgame, and was arrested a few days later because of the prank, a well-known basketball satire account chimed in. On Aug. 9, the basketball parody account TheNBACentel posted a joke to social media: “All 13 WNBA teams are now required to install safety nets to protect against dildo-throwing incidents, per league officials.” It included an obviously doctored photo that showed a large net surrounding the court as players warmed up. The British media personality Piers Morgan missed the joke and credulously shared the post with his nearly nine million followers. When he realized it was a prank, Mr. Morgan corrected the record, but by then it was too late: The misinformation machine was already churning. Soon, a string of unconnected Facebook accounts that focus on sports, pop culture and politics began parroting TheNBACentel’s post, according to McKenzie Sadeghi, a researcher for NewsGuard, a company that analyzes the reliability of information online. With each iteration, the posts picked up more steam, with thousands of people sharing them. Many commenters took the posts as fact, accusing the Women’s National Basketball Association of being humorless. Others took it further, adding sexism, racism and anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment to the mix. Some of the content, which quickly spread across all major social media platforms, echoed talking points about the league that are popular with right-leaning pundits, like the idea that the players don’t deserve to be paid more or mocking the quality of the game. “I think we should begin throwing green Dildos at everything useless in America,” the right-wing commenter Kevin Smith wrote on X in a post that racked up nearly 350,000 views. It was a case study in the kind of discourse that has plagued the W.N.B.A. of late. As the league continues to grow in popularity, netting record attendance over the past two years thanks in significant part to the arrival of superstars like Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever and Angel Reese of the Chicago Sky, what had been an occasional issue with targeted abuse has spiraled into a pervasive, leaguewide problem. Hate speech and misinformation, much of it boosted by right-wing media and perpetuated by profit-driven content farms, have joined forces to spin demeaning or harmful narratives about players. And while all professional sports leagues receive some degree of hostile attention from passionate fans, the W.N.B.A.’s demographics mean attacks can be particularly nasty and very difficult to quell. “The W.N.B.A. is a soft target because there’s been so many conversations along racial and gender lines about the league,” said Jemele Hill, a former ESPN pundit who now has a podcast blending sports and politics. She added, “When you have a league that is 70 percent Black, where a third of the women are queer and when you have all these combustible elements, then it makes it really easy for people to use that and weaponize that.” Bethany Donaphin, a former player and the head of W.N.B.A. operations, said in an interview that the league began noticing “an uptick in vitriolic language and activity” on social media last year, coinciding with the arrival of Ms. Clark and Ms. Reese. In response, the W.N.B.A. this season started a campaign it calls “No Space for Hate,” aimed at reducing noxious language. Now, before games, spectators see a message from Commissioner Cathy Engelbert asking for civility and respect. The league also improved its mental health offerings. And before the 2025 season started, it offered players, their families and league personnel access to a tool called Social Protect, which uses artificial intelligence to delete hateful or abusive comments on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms. The app, which can be installed on mobile phones, is also used by the sporting body governing rugby in Australia. In interviews, players said that, if anything, toxic and abusive content — not to mention impersonations using A.I. and even death threats — had only increased this year despite the league’s anti-hate campaign. “I don’t think the league has done enough,” said Sami Whitcomb, a veteran guard for the Phoenix Mercury, who face elimination from the W.N.B.A. finals on Friday night in their game against the Las Vegas Aces. She said she had elected not to use Social Protect, claiming she had heard from teammates that it wasn’t as effective as they had hoped. Ms. Donaphin acknowledged that many players had not taken advantage of the A.I. tool, but declined to state how many. “There’s a lot more we have to learn,” she said. According to Shane Britten, the founder and chief executive of Social Protect, the company has deleted more than 350,000 comments from social media accounts belonging to the league, its teams and players this season. “When you look at the level of hatred and personal attacks and everything that’s contained in that, it’s really staggering,” said Mr. Britten, noting that 11 of 13 teams in the W.N.B.A. used the app for their official accounts this year and he expects far more players to try out the technology next season. (Ninety percent of the league’s rookies used the service this year, according to Mr. Britten.) DeWanna Bonner, a teammate of Ms. Whitcomb, said her inbox and direct messages were often filled with “awful, awful things.” “We’re here to play basketball,” she said. “And it sucks that it gets taken away by all these narratives that have been created.” Kate Starbird, who played two seasons in the league before getting a doctorate, now studies misinformation at the University of Washington. She said many of those narratives were promulgated — if not created — through profit-driven content factories. She hasn’t studied W.N.B.A. content specifically, but what she has seen on her own social media platforms fits a familiar pattern. “They are trying to take advantage of this attention that they can gain from this moment the W.N.B.A. is having,” she said. “Some people care about it for the politics of it. Some people care about it because they know that political angle gets more attention and can be leveraged for more clickbait.” Much of the content has revolved around Ms. Reese and Ms. Clark, whose on-court battles in college helped drive the 2024 women’s N.C.A.A. tournament to higher ratings than the men’s tourney for the first time. When they got to the W.N.B.A., the league seized this built-in story for marketing purposes, but the narrative quickly got out of hand, with fans directing racist remarks toward Ms. Reese and other Black players who were perceived as bullying or targeting Ms. Clark. (Ms. Reese and Ms. Clark did not respond to requests for comment.) Yet when asked about the simmering issue in a cable television interview late last season, Ms. Engelbert, the league’s commissioner, appeared to double down, stating that “you need rivalry, that’s what makes people watch,” and celebrating the fact that “there’s no more apathy” in the W.N.B.A. Her comments, which she later apologized for, led some to believe that she thought the hateful remarks directed at many players were a minor price to pay for the league’s increased visibility. Marisa Parham, a professor of digital studies at the University of Maryland, noticed the rise in toxic content after attending a Los Angeles Sparks game last season. Her Facebook feed was flooded with what appeared to be A.I.-generated fake news about the W.N.B.A., often originating in foreign countries. Much of the content revolved around the two rising stars. “The primary thing that was most noticeable was sort of this notion of Clark having been wronged,” Ms. Parham said. “That whenever she was not in the spotlight, this was evidence of wokeness, it was evidence of bias .” Much of that content appeared to springboard off viewpoints that had been steadily gaining traction in right-wing circles. Over the past two seasons, the W.N.B.A. — long ignored by right-leaning pundits except when they took time to ridicule women’s sports entirely — has become a favorite topic of discussion. And even though both Ms. Clark and Ms. Reese missed large portions of the current season because of injuries, podcasters and pundits including Matt Walsh, Ben Shapiro and Dave Portnoy continue to talk about them, framing many discussions around race, either subtly or much less so. “The WNBA investigates anti-black racism even as some of its players engage in anti-white racism against Caitlin Clark,” Mr. Shapiro posted in May, referring to a league investigation into racist comments that Ms. Reese said had been directed at her during a game in Indiana. The league could not substantiate her allegation. Ms. Clark has tried to downplay the dynamic, stating last season that “people should not be using my name to push those agendas.” “It’s disappointing,” she added. “It’s not acceptable.” Ms. Reese has, in interviews, blamed the discourse on racism and described being targeted with death threats, strangers coming to her home and family members receiving A.I.-generated nude photos of her. Clay Travis, the Trump-supporting founder and host of “OutKick,” a right-leaning daily podcast that mixes sports and politics, said the league had created some of its problems by trying too hard to satisfy its longtime, mostly female fan base and ignoring the much broader audience watching the game today. Mr. Travis and others point to the league’s pro-L.G.B.T.Q. stance, its strong support for the Black Lives Matter movement and the players’ union’s strong support of undocumented immigrants during recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles as proof that the W.N.B.A. is hostile to conservatives. “I think the W.N.B.A. is without a doubt the most political of the sports leagues right now, and I think that’s by design,” Mr. Travis said. “I’ve joked that the only place Trump would get booed at is the W.N.B.A. all-star game.” Click farmers are generally agnostic to politics, but their drive for profits often pushes their content into rage-bait and other divisive posts, Dr. Starbird said. Rather than originating new topics, they often try to piggyback off themes that are already resonating online, amplifying them considerably as they chase monetizable engagement. For instance, two days before the first fake post about dildo-proof nets, Donald Trump Jr. shared a meme showing President Trump throwing a sex toy from the White House onto a W.N.B.A. court. Ms. Sadeghi’s analysis of the flurry of posts around the dildo-proof nets indicated that they had originated from many unrelated accounts. “They posted the claim at different times, are run from different countries, have distinct followings and cover varied topics,” she said in an email. “It’s likely that many of them picked up the post organically by monitoring similar pages, a dynamic we frequently observe among pages that track and mimic trending content.” Brittney Griner is another case in point. When the star center was released in a prisoner swap after a 10-month detention in Russia in 2022, she dominated the political news cycle for days. But amid the legitimate coverage, NewsGuard found 40 accounts publishing false claims and other misinformation about Ms. Griner’s newfound freedom. Much of it incorporated A.I. right-wing voices, claiming that the government had negotiated her release only because she is Black and gay, while leaving other, white, Americans in Russian prison. That swirl of conversation helped generate more insidious content about Ms. Griner that attacked her sexuality and appearance using homophobic tropes as well as fabricated content claiming she is transgender. The unwieldy world of fake news is something the league office has yet to tackle. “It’s an important issue that I think it takes more than just one technology solution to address,” Ms. Donaphin said. Jackie Young, an all-star guard for the Aces, said that she increasingly tried to stay off social media to avoid the onslaught of negativity, which she characterized as a distraction from playing as well as she can. “At the end of the day, we’re human beings,” she said. “It’s crazy the things that people say behind the phone.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/wnba-misinformation-hate-speech.html,Business,BBC,By Tania Ganguli and Ken Bensinger,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10BIZ-wnba-online-lede-fzlp/10BIZ-wnba-online-lede-fzlp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T13:00:09+00:00,9bbb25036b5fd727168f8318785507e90241853f

Until Now, the Markets Said All Was Well.","sp 500, stocks;bonds, etf, asset allocation, mutual fund, personal finance, service content, financial planner","For example, in the three months through September, the S&P 500 stock index returned 8.1 percent and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller stocks, returned 12.4 percent, including dividends, according to FactSet. The Vanguard Total Stock Market E.T.F., which tracks a broad index but is heavily weighted toward the S&P 500, rose 8.3 percent for the quarter. These plain index returns beat the average stock fund in relevant categories. Over 12 months, the index fund outperformance also held. In that period, the S&P 500 gained 17.6 percent and the Russell 2000 gained 10.8 percent, including reinvested dividends, according to FactSet. The Vanguard fund rose 17.4 percent, again much better than the average general domestic stock fund. And the Vanguard Total International Stock Market E.T.F., which is a simple index tracker, rose 6.9 percent for the quarter and 17.2 percent over 12 months, beating the average international fund. Bond fund returns were positive but unexceptional. The average taxable fund returned 2.2 percent for the quarter and 5 percent over 12 months, Morningstar said. For municipal bond funds, the parallel returns were 2.7 percent and 1.2 percent. The Highlights Here is a sampling of how stock funds available in the United States fared in various domestic and international categories over three months and 12 months through September, according to Morningstar: Technology stock funds: 13.2 percent for the quarter and 30.6 percent for 12 months. Balanced funds with 50 to 70 percent stock and the rest bonds: 4.9 percent for the quarter and 10.5 percent for 12 months. Target-date 2030 funds, which contain a mix of stocks and bonds and are aimed at people who plan to retire in five years: 4.6 percent for the quarter and 11.3 percent for the year. China region funds: 22.2 percent for the quarter and 29.7 percent for 12 months. India funds: -7 percent for the quarter and -11.2 percent for the year. The tariff feud between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India hurt the Indian stock market more than many others. Precious metal stock funds, which have been buoyed by the soaring price of gold : 41 percent for the quarter and 92.6 percent for 12 months. Some individual funds beat the category averages. (Some funds always do, though vanishingly few do so consistently.) The steep increase in gold prices was responsible for the performance of three top funds this time: Profunds Precious Metals UltraSector, which tracks the Dow Jones Precious Metals gold-mining stock index and magnifies it with leverage, which is essentially borrowed money: 75 percent for the quarter and 150 percent for 12 months. U.S. Global Investors Gold & Precious Metals, which invests mainly in mining and gold-producing stocks: 46.3 percent for the quarter and 96 percent for 12 months. Franklin Gold and Precious Metals , which also invests in mining and gold-producing stocks: 45.7 percent for the quarter and 111.9 percent for 12 months. Funds that track the prices of cryptocurrency, mainly Bitcoin, had a great run, too. The biggest of them, the iShares Bitcoin Trust E.T.F., returned just 6.2 percent for the quarter but 80 percent for 12 months, according to FactSet.

5deb8f2c7117,Who Gained From U.S. Aid to Argentina?,"internal tag to designate no storyline, foreign aid, us politics, scott bessent, argentina, javier milei, robert citrone, stanley f druckenmiller, fidelity investments","Andrew here. Keep your eyes on a corner of the market that hasn’t gotten enough attention: private credit. The bankruptcy of the auto parts maker First Brands Group is now hitting firms like Jefferies and UBS, which were among those that had lent money to the company. We’ve got more details about the dominoes that are now falling. We’re also taking a look at the U.S. government’s multibillion-dollar bailout of Argentina — and questions it is raising. Pushback against a U.S. lifeline for Buenos Aires America has finally come to Argentina’s rescue , as the Trump administration aims to stabilize the embattled South American country’s economy and help out Javier Milei, the Argentine leader and an ally of President Trump. But critics of the move note ties between investors in Argentinian assets and Trump officials, and they have raised concerns that the administration is extending the aid during the U.S. government shutdown. The details: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the U.S. directly purchased Argentine pesos amid a run on the currency that forced Buenos Aires to spend billions of dollars to counteract it. Bessent added that the U.S. had also “finalized a $20 billion currency swap framework” with the Argentine central bank, though more information hasn’t been released. Bessent said that the move was in the U.S.’s strategic interest by creating a strong, stable Argentina to help “anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere.” Others point out that the country has significant supplies of minerals like lithium and copper that are crucial for U.S. and global manufacturing. The package comes as relief for big global investors who have made bets on Argentina, many of whom bought up government debt on the cheap in hopes that it will be repaid or renegotiated, The Times notes. Among them: Funds at money managers including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco . One Fidelity vehicle this summer credited returns from its Argentine bet with helping compensate for losses in other emerging-market countries. Stan Druckenmiller , who mentored Bessent at Soros Fund Management. A government filing in June of this year indicated that the Duquesne family office, which Druckenmiller runs, was the second-largest investor in Argentina’s principal exchange-traded fund, a pool of Argentine stocks. Robert Citrone, who founded Discovery Capital Management and who has claimed credit for persuading George Soros and Bessent to bet against the Japanese yen in 2013, a hugely profitable investment . Citrone had been in touch with Bessent in the lead-up to Bessent’s announcement last month that the U.S. would help Argentina, arguing that a peso crash would hurt Milei politically, The Times reports. The move has drawn political blowback for the Trump administration. While Bessent has argued that the U.S. wouldn’t bail out Argentina, skeptics said the move is exactly that. “It’s a country in crisis, it’s running out of dollars, and the U.S. is giving the country dollars,” Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told The Times. “That’s a bailout by definition.” A group of Democratic senators on Thursday introduced legislation meant to prevent the Treasury Department from using a special fund to help Argentina. (It’s unlikely to pass.) “It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who helped draft the legislation. “Trump promised ‘America First,’ but he’s putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill.” And as we’ve written before, American soybean farmers have grumbled about aid for Argentina, which has sold more than 2.5 metric tons of soybeans to China as Beijing halts its purchases from the U.S. (The Trump administration has said it will offer help to American farmers .) HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Consumer Price Index report for September is coming out — at some point. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has called back some workers to help release the data, despite the government shutdown, The Times reports. The move was tied to the annual process of adjusting Social Security benefits to account for cost-of-living changes; the report’s release date isn’t known but is likely before Fed policymakers meet to vote on interest rate changes at the end of the month. Letitia James is the latest Trump foe to face federal charges. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on accusations of bank fraud and making a false statement, by the same handpicked federal prosecutor who is leading a similar case against James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. Critics of the move said it represented the further weaponization of the Justice Department by President Trump against his adversaries, a list the president has said includes the investors George Soros and Reid Hoffman. Zohran Mamdani maintains a big lead over Andrew Cuomo in the New York mayoral race. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, is ahead of Cuomo by 13 points with a month before the election, according to a new poll by Quinnipiac University. It’s unclear how the findings will affect the plans of the city’s business donors . The fallout from a costly auto supplier’s bankruptcy First Brands Group isn’t exactly a household name. But the auto parts maker’s bankruptcy filing late last month has led to a rapidly widening shock across the global financial community. Lenders and investors are tallying up what now looks like billions in losses, while federal prosecutors are said to be getting involved as well. What happened: First Brands, which makes oil filters and windshield wipers, sought Chapter 11 protection last month after discovering accounting irregularities. What is emerging is a complicated web of off-balance-sheet debt — on top of $6 billion in balance-sheet debt — as the company repledged assets multiple times to different lenders. Raistone, a lender that worked extensively with First Brands and is calling for an independent court examiner, said that as much as $2.3 billion “ simply vanished ” from First Brands’s books. An array of financial firms has been hit. Jefferies disclosed that one of its asset-management units is owed $715 million from customers that bought First Brands products. A UBS fund disclosed to investors that about 30 percent of its portfolio was linked to the bankrupt manufacturer. Raistone said it is owed at least $172 million. (One sign of how complicated this all is: Raistone is partly owned by a UBS fund.) And insurers including Allianz and AIG are preparing for a potential flood of claims related to First Brands, according to The Financial Times. A big question: Does First Brands’s failure underscore just how frothy and complacent the credit markets have become, especially amid the boom in so-called private credit? “I suspect we’re going to see more of these things, like First Brands and others, when the cycle ultimately reverses,” Jim Chanos , the prominent short seller, told The FT. Exclusive: Kalshi’s big new fund-raising round It’s been an eventful week for prediction markets, the digital platforms where users can bet on nearly anything: political elections, N.F.L. games, the next pope and more. The latest news comes from Kalshi, a big player in the field, which will announce on Friday that it has raised more than $300 million in new funding and will open to international bettors, Michael de la Merced is first to report. The new round values Kalshi at $5 billion, up from a $2 billion valuation set in June, according to the data provider PitchBook. The round was led by Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz; other investors included Paradigm, CapitalG, Coinbase Ventures, General Catalyst and Spark Capital. The company and its industry have grown by leaps and bounds since last year, when prediction markets started to gain mainstream popularity after they correctly called the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Kalshi’s growth was supercharged by its allowing of sports bets on its platform — and especially after it began offering the complex wagers known as parlays that had previously been reserved for sports books. (That move battered the stock prices of more traditional gambling sites like DraftKings.) Kalshi has also benefited from a series of deals that allow customers of brokerages like Robinhood and Webull to bet on contracts directly from those sites, just as easily as they can buy stocks. Meanwhile, a chief rival, Polymarket, said this week that it would receive up to $2 billion in investment from the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the N.Y.S.E. Kalshi had more than $1 billion worth of trading volume this week. That puts it on track for $50 billion in volume on an annualized basis — and a huge jump from the roughly $300 million in annualized volume it had last year before it opened its election market. It also overtook Polymarket late last month as the market leader, with a share of more than 60 percent by the end of September, according to the data provider Dune. “We have not expected this level of growth,” Tarek Mansour, a Kalshi co-founder and its C.E.O., told DealBook. Kalshi is growing internationally, too. Until now, the company operated only in the U.S., where it was the first platform to offer election-related contracts after a federal court took its side in a fight with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi will now operate in more than 140 countries, though only via its website and not also through online brokerages. But Kalshi still faces challenges. Among them: Several states have sued the company , arguing that it is essentially skirting their rules around sports gambling (and depriving them of taxes that sports books pay). Fierce competition, both from sports books and other prediction markets. Chart of the day Speaking of prediction markets, the Polymarket betting contract on who would win the Nobel Peace Prize showed a surge of wagers on María Corina Machado, hours before the Venezuelan opposition leader was named the winner. The odds for President Trump winning — something he has campaigned strongly for — were consistently in single digits. A golden debate Gold hit $4,000 for the first time on Tuesday after climbing more than 50 percent this year, setting off speculation about what is driving the rally. Here are some of the latest theories: It’s a debasement trade . “Investors worried about the future of the dollar and other major currencies are piling into gold, bitcoin and other alternative assets,” David Uberti and Jack Pitcher reported in The Wall Street Journal . Gold’s strength isn’t a comment on the dollar, according to Jonathan Levin of Bloomberg Opinion : “The last few months have shown that the dollar continues to be as indispensable as ever. So while gold’s rally is noteworthy in its own right, there’s very little risk that the metal somehow portends a fading of the dollar’s dominance in the world.” The debasement trade hasn’t shown up in bond markets , which remain confident that inflation won’t run out of control, points out James Mackintosh in The Journal. “Gold is booming because central bank reserve managers worry about relying on an unpredictable U.S. in a crisis, plus its natural rise when rates fall, boosted by buyers trying to jump on to rising prices,” he writes.

ff0e1f8205d6,"Kalshi, a Prediction Market, Raises Funds and Expands Overseas","gambling, venture capital, regulation and deregulation, kalshi, andreessen horowitz, sequoia capital","Online prediction markets have jumped into the mainstream, as users flock to sites to bet on politics, sports, the next pope and more. That growth has drawn interest from investors. Kalshi, one of the most prominent prediction markets, plans to announce on Friday that it has raised more than $300 million in a new round of financing at a valuation of $5 billion. The company also plans to disclose that it will start letting customers in more than 140 countries place bets on its website. The fund-raising announcement, in the same week that Polymarket , Kalshi’s chief rival, said the parent of the New York Stock Exchange would invest up to $2 billion , underscores how big a business prediction markets have become. Kalshi is on track for $50 billion in trading volume on an annualized basis, a big jump from the roughly $300 million it recorded last year. Last month, Kalshi overtook Polymarket to become the biggest player in the prediction-market industry, with a global market share of prediction-market activity of more than 60 percent , according to the data provider Dune. “We have not expected this level of growth,” Tarek Mansour, a Kalshi co-founder and its chief executive, said in an interview. That rapid expansion drew the attention of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital — which first backed the company in 2020 — and Andreessen Horowitz, a new investor. Despite closing its previous investment round in June, Kalshi negotiated the new fund-raising effort, which more than doubled its valuation, in August. Other investors in the round include Paradigm, CapitalG and Coinbase Ventures. Kalshi’s recent growth has been powered by sports, especially after it began offering the kind of complex wagers known as parlays. Its push into sports has rattled the traditional sportsbooks, with the shares of DraftKings and the parent of FanDuel falling by double-digit percentages over the past month. Kalshi has also benefited from a series of deals that allow customers of brokerages like Robinhood and Webull to bet on contracts directly from those sites, as easily as they can buy stocks. Until now, Kalshi operated only in the United States. Polymarket, on the other hand, was barred from letting Americans participate on its platform in 2022 and only recently resumed doing business in the country. Donald Trump Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, is an adviser to both companies, joining Kalshi in January and Polymarket in August. In May, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission dropped a legal challenge to Kalshi’s election-related betting business. But the company is now facing pushback from U.S. state regulators over sports betting. Several states have sued the company, arguing that it is essentially skirting their rules around online sports gambling, which remains illegal in 20 states, by offering financial products tied to the outcome of sporting events. “Every time there’s a new type of financial innovation, there’s always a series of questions around regulation,” Mr. Mansour said.

61fadb79a70c,Have You Hugged Your Job Today?,"jobs, us economy, hugging, financial planner","Hugging conjures friendship, intimacy, support. But lately, it has cropped up in a less warm and fuzzy context: to refer to people clinging anxiously to their jobs in a murky market. Workers are quitting at much lower rates than they were a few years ago, and are instead “job hugging.” In August, the consulting firm Korn Ferry used the term in an article to describe the way workers have been “holding on to their jobs for dear life.” A spokesman wrote in an email that the firm might have coined the phrase but that he couldn’t say for sure. Since then, it has popped up in several news articles and even on “ The Daily Show .” The term is striking a nerve partly because it represents a sharp reversal from the “ great resignation ” period of 2021 and 2022, when tens of millions of Americans quit their jobs. At the time, the labor market was hot, after a steep decline in employment at the start of the pandemic. How it’s pronounced /jäb həg-iŋ/ But the market has again cooled significantly. Employers added a measly 22,000 jobs in August, according to the latest federal data . In June, the U.S. economy lost 13,000 jobs, its first dip since December 2020, according to revised data. Hiring is down in many industries. Unemployment, though low overall, is hitting recent college graduates hard. The job market is filled with distressing signals and uncertainty. Tariffs are hobbling companies. Immigration raids are decimating the work forces of some industries and igniting fear in communities. Artificial intelligence is spooking everyone (though Yale researchers found that so far, few workers have been displaced by A.I.). Quits reflect workers’ confidence — and at the moment, they do not seem particularly confident. “Unless you have a better option, quitting a job in risky times is a huge gamble,” Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, said in an email. When they can’t quit, employees may end up feeling stuck in place, which can stunt their career development, said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The situation can also hurt their financial health because job hoppers tend to get higher raises . For the most part, workers leave jobs once they have secured a better opportunity. “Almost nobody quits and then pouts and goes home and then thinks, ‘Gee, what am I going to do next?’” Dr. Cappelli said. But when workers don’t leave, other people can’t fill those roles, stalling movement in the job market. Though worker turnover is expensive for employers, having a team of stressed employees who don’t want to be there isn’t ideal, either. “Churn” is a bad word among bosses, but some amount of it can be healthy. On paper, this job market is more “normal” than the overheated one of the early 2020s. Still, many of the dynamics today — the Trump administration’s immigration offensive, the hyped-up A.I. market, the psychic scars of the early pandemic shutdowns and the years of scarce labor that followed — make for an uneasy time. Stressed-out workers may find comfort in embracing a loved one amid the uncertainty. A job, for all the stability it provides, cannot hug you back.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/job-hugging-labor-market.html,Business,BBC,By Lora Kelley,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/business/12biz-shoptalk-job-hugging-ILLO_01/10biz-shoptalk-job-hugging-ILLO_01-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:02:11.100000+00:00,14c798d8f6fa79df9dd9276337520b1f197a9ea9

What to Know Before You Fly.,"airlines;airplanes, airport security, batteries, travel;tourism;vacations, lithium mental, plane crash, regulation and deregulation, service content, faa, tsa, us","Over the last few months, airlines and security agencies worldwide began rolling out new rules about where electronic devices should be stored on planes, whether it’s in the cargo hold, the overhead bins or in a personal item. The main issue is lithium batteries, which, according to the Federal Aviation Administration , can spontaneously catch fire if they are damaged or short circuit. These batteries are now largely banned from checked baggage in the United States unless they are completely turned off. This can be confusing for travelers who may not know if their device is powered by a lithium battery. A better way to think about it is whether or not that device is rechargeable, said Jeff Marootian, the chief executive of UL Standards & Engagement, a safety standards organization. Those items include, but are not limited to, cellphones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, toothbrushes, portable chargers and vapes. Separately, certain cordless hair dryers and curling irons have been banned from checked luggage because they use butane cartridges for power. Here’s what to know. A Rare But Growing Issue John Cox, a former pilot and airline safety expert, said the issue is something called “thermal runaway,” where a device’s battery overheats, breaks down and can catch fire. Not all of these incidents involve open flame, he noted, but overheated batteries are at risk of explosion. A fire destroyed an Air Busan plane on the tarmac in South Korea in January, and investigators said it was possible a power bank had started the blaze . According to the F.A.A., there have been almost 700 incidents with lithium batteries involving smoke, fire or extreme heat since March 2006. The vast majority of those incidents, according to the agency’s data , involved battery packs, with vapes or e-cigarettes the second leading cause. Last year, there were 89 incidents, compared to 45 in 2019, according to the F.A.A. So far this year, there have been 62 incidents. That comes out to about two per week, Mr. Marootian said. “While they’re increasing, they still remain very isolated, and we want to keep them that way,” he added. The uptick largely has to do with the increasing number of rechargeable devices that passengers are carrying, Mr. Cox said. Understand What You’re Carrying Mr. Marootian said that he finds airport signage regarding batteries to be confusing, as it refers to things like battery type and wattage that a regular traveler might not know. “The average person doesn’t necessarily think about the devices they’re carrying with them in terms of what type of battery,” he said. “But if you were to say ‘rechargeable device,’ that’s more transparent.” Mr. Marootian said that any given traveler was likely to find that they were carrying four rechargeable devices, and possibly even more. “Passenger awareness is really the key,” he said. Keep Your Devices Close Under the F.A.A.’s new rules, anything containing a lithium metal or lithium-ion battery should be kept in carry-on baggage. The devices may be checked, but only if they are “completely turned off, protected from accidental activation and packed so that they won’t get damaged,” the agency has said. Individual carriers may have their own restrictions. Spare lithium batteries, portable chargers, electronic cigarettes and vaping devices need to be with the passenger carrying them in the plane cabin. If a passenger’s bags are gate checked, they should remember to remove the batteries before losing custody of their bag. A lithium battery that has been damaged or recalled is especially prone to overheating and potentially causing fire. For example, Mr. Cox said, if an iPhone or iPad has a cracked screen, the device has experienced a high degree of force that could have damaged its battery, putting it at risk for thermal runaway. “Don’t bring damaged devices on the airplanes,” he said. One of the easiest solutions, Mr. Marootian said, is keeping devices within arm’s reach. Should they smoke or spark, the issue can be dealt with immediately, he said. Think Before You Pack According to UL Standards, 38 percent of travelers admit to packing lithium batteries in their checked luggage and 30 percent who were asked to gate check their carry-ons were not asked to remove lithium-powered devices. Mr. Marootian said his company is working on a public service campaign to better inform passengers of their battery risks and also pushing for increased training for flight staff. Before packing a carry-on, passengers should check devices for signs of battery problems, including swelling, overheating and obvious damage, according to UL Standards. “We see this as a very solvable issue,”Mr. Marootian said. If the T.S.A. finds a lithium battery device in checked luggage, they will likely not remove the device, but they will likely inspect it for damage, Mr. Cox said. Butane-powered devices In-flight fires can also be caused by butane-powered devices, such as cordless hair curlers, according to a social media post by the T.S.A. in August. Only one butane-powered device is permitted onboard per person, the post said, and must be packed in carry-on luggage. If a cordless curling iron with a butane cartridge is discovered by the T.S.A. in checked luggage, the agency said it will turn the device over to the airline. “Having butane in an airplane is not a good idea,” Mr. Cox said, adding that the gas is highly flammable.

f7f429333728,"If an Energy Drink Drank an Energy Drink, You’d Get a Celsius","energy and sports drinks, caffeine, advertising;marketing, celsius, red bull, pepsi, monster beverage","“I think it’s important that Celsius comes in a 12-ounce sleek can that kind of resembles White Claw,” said Sean McGowan, a Managing Director at Roth Capital Partners. “Celsius didn’t just convince Red Bull or Monster drinkers to switch to their brand; they enticed new people into the category. Why had those people been reluctant to get into the category? Maybe because they perceived energy drinks in relation to gaming or partying instead of fitness. Maybe because 16 ounces is a lot of caffeinated liquid.” McGowan’s White Claw comparison is apt. Like Celsius, White Claw laundered an ancient intoxicant into a healthy-seeming choice through visual and sensory cues. The two drinks even have flavors in common. The cans could be siblings. Celsius reads so clean, in fact, that it has become the energy drink of choice for swaths of the sober community. Jack Mintz, a therapist in New York, discovered Celsius in recovery, where it was immensely popular among people wary of what he called the “cultural stigma” around Red Bull and Monster. Mintz, who exercises often and avoids processed sugar, noticed that his gym carried Celsius. “There’s something very powerful about that coding,” he said. “Also, Celsius flavors are really, really good.” It is true that in a blind test, a person might plausibly identify the referents behind Celsius flavors like Fuji Apple Pear and Orange. That’s not the case with Monster, whose flavors include Nitro and Assault, or Red Bull, whose primary formula tastes enigmatically of bubble gum and cough syrup. But striving for realism has risks, too. The pleasure potential of an energy drink flavor tends to be constrained by the bitterness of the ingredients — caffeine, taurine — that make it work. Celsius’ Orange tastes obviously inferior to an actual orange, whereas Monster’s Assault is technically incomparable. Whatever the degree of flavor abstraction, I’ve yet to find an energy drink that doesn’t taste a bit like expertly masked poison. Which is fine. These drinks are not delicacies. As long as they achieve a basic level of palatability, consumers grade them on functionality. Some consumers desire a subtle pick-me-up while others crave full-body electrification. Whatever bonus ingredients an energy drink contains, it is primarily a vehicle for caffeine. And here we stumble upon the secret, or one of them, to the success of Celsius: a 12-ounce can contains 200 milligrams of caffeine. By comparison, a 16-ounce can of Monster has 160 milligrams of caffeine, while the traditional 8.4-ounce can of Red Bull has only 80 milligrams. The brand may position itself as a fitness supplement, but its rise suggests a broader use case. As with Monster and Red Bull before it, many consumers drink Celsius for an extremely non-aspirational reason: to get through the workday. The U.S. military, a longtime advocate of strategic caffeine use, prizes the substance especially when it comes to tedious tasks that require unwavering alertness, like sentry duty. For health-conscious American civilians enduring the equivalent of sentry duty — unbelievably boring jobs that demand (but don’t encourage) sustained attention — Celsius is an effective propellant. Negligible calories, no high-fructose corn syrup, no genetically modified ingredients.

5484c2586034,Inside Hegseth’s Effort to Limit Press Access at the Pentagon,"us military, cnn, pentagon, fox news, pete hegseth, donald trump","As the Senate weighed whether to confirm Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, NBC News dug up information about his past, including an affidavit from his former sister-in-law accusing him of abusive behavior toward his second wife. Courtney Kube, a Pentagon correspondent for the network, assisted with the coverage. The reporting did not upend the confirmation of Mr. Hegseth, a Fox News host before his nomination. But it did leave an impression on him. Shortly after taking office, Mr. Hegseth told his team to bar Ms. Kube from the Pentagon, according to three people with knowledge of his order. The team did not follow through, because Pentagon lawyers said the Defense Department could not single out one news outlet for removal, two of the people said. Mr. Hegseth’s request did, however, foreshadow his adversarial approach to the press while in the job — both toward specific reporters and toward the industry more broadly. Under his leadership, the department has removed national news outlets from a shared media workspace and made it available to conservative outlets instead; has scaled back reporters’ ability to roam Pentagon corridors; and, in the most recent salvo, is imposing a set of restrictions outlining causes for the revocation of correspondents’ press passes. The Defense Department is falling in line with a policy of hostility toward news organizations that spans the Trump administration. President Trump himself has sued ABC and CBS over their coverage, with both lawsuits ending in settlements, and has accused The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times of defamation. (The case against The Times was dismissed, though Mr. Trump has the right to file a new complaint.) The White House ejected The Associated Press from the White House press pool and seized control of coverage assignments formerly administered by the White House Correspondents’ Association.

When David Yaffe-Bellany first learned about the complicated world of cryptocurrency from a tech-savvy high school friend, his reaction was one of polite interest. That changed in 2021, when an editor at The New York Times — where Mr. Yaffe-Bellany had previously worked as a reporting fellow on the Business desk — reached out about a new opportunity to cover cryptocurrency for the paper. “In 10 minutes of research, it immediately became clear that it was a great beat with a colorful cast of characters involved in the crypto world, and risks that had gone underexplored in some of the coverage,” said Mr. Yaffe-Bellany, 28, a technology reporter for The Times who has covered the crypto industry since 2022. Three years and more than 300 bylines later, Mr. Yaffe-Bellany has chronicled the peaks and valleys of the nascent industry, including the collapse of the cryptocurrency founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s company FTX . Last month, he collaborated on a multicountry investigation into two giant crypto and artificial intelligence deals involving President Trump. “I strongly believe the best stories come from being somewhere in person,” said Mr. Yaffe-Bellany, whose reporting has taken him to Singapore, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. “Often, at a crypto conference, you can just walk up and have a conversation with somebody who it might take weeks to get on the phone, because they have three layers of P.R. people around them.” In an interview, Mr. Yaffe-Bellany, who is based in New York, shared how he navigates covering a beat that is constantly evolving and the lessons he has learned in three years of reporting on the industry.

b51981872ffc,Germany’s Top Economist Charts a Path Out of Europe’s Crisis,"international relations, politics, regulation and deregulation, international trade, economics, tariff, economy, interest rate, inflation, joachim nagel, europe, germany","Central bank chiefs are cautious by nature, mindful that their words can move markets and influence politics. But Joachim Nagel, the president of the Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, has recently become more outspoken about the challenges facing Europe’s largest economy, the policies he thinks lawmakers should adopt and the importance of defending institutions like his from criticism. “When you are in a hurricane, you have this quiet in the eye of the storm,” he said in an interview in London with The New York Times. This may describe the European economy today, he added. President Trump’s tariffs and wavering commitment to Ukraine in its war with Russia have shaken Europe’s capitals. They appeared to galvanize leaders to bolster economic ties within the continent and spend more on defense. Some also saw a chance for the euro to establish itself as a haven for investors backed by a market of 350 million people. Even as the European Union and the United States have agreed on the outline of a trade deal , taking the sting out of some of the tariffs, a sense of urgency should be maintained, Mr. Nagel said. Europe faces daunting debts, pressure on government budgets and “uncertain political situations,” he said. The German economy shrank in 2023 and 2024, with exports no longer serving as a reliable growth engine. At the same time, France, the European Union’s second-largest economy, is stuck in a political quagmire , struggling to manage its fragile finances. “Complacency is definitely not the right attitude,” Mr. Nagel said. The answer, for him, is greater European integration, and he warned against underestimating the region’s ability to adapt to its challenges. On Slow Growth and Threats to Democracy As unelected officials, central bankers tend to be very careful about wading into policy debates. Mr. Nagel said he had become more forthright, and the turning point was in early 2024 when he attended a demonstration for the first time. Around that time, pro-democracy demonstrations attracted tens of thousands of people, after news spread that the far-right party Alternative for Germany had held a secret meeting to discuss plans for the mass deportation of immigrants and some German citizens with immigrant backgrounds. “I was really embarrassed during that time,” Mr. Nagel said. Even as an independent central banker who is meant to stay out of politics, he said, he felt a “responsibility” to stand up for democracy, freedom of speech and the institutions that had been developed since the end of the Second World War. In recent speeches, Mr. Nagel has pushed for the policies he says Germany needs to urgently adopt, including cutting red tape , increasing the supply of workers , investing in technology and lowering energy prices . Germany’s government unveiled a plan this summer to borrow more than 100 billion euros ($116 billion) this year to spend, including on the military and infrastructure. The economy ministry said this week that it expected economic growth of just 0.2 percent this year, with government spending helping to spur more growth starting next year. But citizens are impatient for results, and “we have to speed up,” Mr. Nagel said. On Interest Rates and Central Bank Independence It helps that Mr. Nagel’s primary mandate as a central banker — ensuring price stability — appears to have been achieved. Inflation in the eurozone is close to the European Central Bank’s 2 percent target, and many policymakers, including Mr. Nagel, seem relaxed about forecasts that inflation could drift below this target in the next two years. “The bar is rather high,” he said, to alter his assessment that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate. The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 nations that use the euro and is based in Frankfurt, has held its key rate at 2 percent since June. Before that, it cut rates at eight consecutive meetings. Mr. Nagel said he was not concerned about the strength in the euro , which makes imports cheaper and could pull inflation lower. Near recent levels, at $1.17, “I will not say it’s not relevant,” he said. “We have to look at it. But this is not a big issue.” The big issue among central bankers around the world is unfolding in Washington, where the Trump administration has assailed the independence of the Federal Reserve in an attempt to pressure officials into cutting rates. Mr. Nagel credits the Bundesbank’s predecessor, which was created in 1948 by the United States and other Western powers then occupying Germany, with kick-starting the country’s rapid growth and reconstruction after the Second World War. “We are so grateful to the United States that they had this brilliant idea to have an independent central bank,” he said. “This is a reason why we are so nervous when it comes to what we saw over the past 10 months,” he added, describing the recent attacks on the Fed as “unfair.” On China and Trade While Germany’s economy has been hurt by U.S. tariffs, problems for German exporters also stem from China. In recent years, China has become a fierce competitor, selling many of the goods, including cars and high-tech machinery, that countries used to buy from German firms, often at a lower cost. German companies also face a threat closer to home, as the Chinese companies that have been shut out of U.S. markets look for places to redirect their products. Chinese car brands nearly doubled their sales in Europe in the first half of the year, selling almost as many vehicles there as Mercedes-Benz did, according to JATO Dynamics . Intensifying competition with China should be “an eye-opener for all European companies,” Mr. Nagel said. But Europe is in a strong position to negotiate on trade with China because “they need us more than we need China,” he added. “Our most important market is Europe. It’s not China.” Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/nagel-bundesbank-germany-europe-economy.html,Business,BBC,By Eshe Nelson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/00biz-germany-econ-01-gmtj/00biz-germany-econ-01-gmtj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T04:00:33+00:00,81b920c5be31a5d453bb39910a54527af4922283
511e4d9966d3,Why China Built 162 Square Miles of Solar Panels on the World’s Highest Plateau,"tibet, renewable energy, china, solar energy, wind power, electric power, data center, hydroelectric power, internal-open-access-from-nl","Power ⚡︎ Moves Why China Built 162 Square Miles of Solar Panels on the World’s Highest Plateau 阅读简体中文版 閱讀繁體中文版 On the Tibetan Plateau, nearly 10,000 feet high, solar panels stretch to the horizon and cover an area seven times the size of Manhattan. They soak up sunlight that is much brighter than at sea level because the air is so thin. Wind turbines dot nearby ridgelines and stand in long rows across arid, empty plains above the occasional sheep herder with his flock. They capture night breezes, balancing the daytime power from the solar panels. Hydropower dams sit where rivers spill down long chasms at the edges of the plateau. And high-voltage power lines carry all this electricity to businesses and homes more than 1,000 miles away. China is building an enormous network of clean energy industries on the Tibetan Plateau, the world’s highest. The intention is to harness the region’s bright sunshine, cold temperatures and sky-touching altitude to provide low-cost, renewable energy. The result is enough renewable energy to provide the plateau with nearly all of the power it needs, including for data centers used in China’s artificial intelligence development. While China still burns as much coal as the rest of the world combined, last month President Xi Jinping made a stunning pledge. Speaking before the United Nations, he said for the first time that the country would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its economy and would expand renewable energy sixfold in coming years. It was a moment of global significance for the nation that is currently the world’s biggest polluter. China’s clean energy efforts contrast with the ambitions of the United States under the Trump administration, which is using its diplomatic and economic muscle to pressure other countries to buy more American gas, oil and coal. China is investing in cheaper solar and wind technology, along with batteries and electric vehicles, with the aim of becoming the world’s supplier of renewable energy and the products that rely on it. The main group of solar farms, known as the Talatan Solar Park, dwarfs every other cluster of solar farms in the world. It covers 162 square miles in Gonghe County, an alpine desert in sparsely inhabited Qinghai, a province in western China. No other country on the planet is using high altitudes for solar, wind and hydropower on a scale as great as China’s on the Tibetan Plateau. The effort is a case study of how China has come to dominate the future of clean energy. With the help of substantial government-directed investment and planning, electricity companies are weaning the country off imported oil, natural gas and coal — a national priority. Renewable energy helps China power 30,000 miles of high-speed train routes and its growing fleet of electric cars . At the same time, cheap electricity enables China to manufacture even more solar panels, which dominate global markets and power artificial intelligence data centers. Electricity from solar and wind power in Qinghai, which occupies the northern third of the Tibetan Plateau, costs about 40 percent less than coal-fired power. Qinghai encompasses most of a region known among Tibetans as Amdo and includes the birthplace of the current Dalai Lama , now in exile. In July, China’s premier, Li Qiang, oversaw the groundbreaking of five additional dams on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in southern Tibet, a region of China that is tightly restricted by the Communist Party and not open to Western journalists. The Chinese government has released little information about the construction of the dams, but they are expected to take years to complete and would most likely constitute the world’s largest hydropower project. Its construction has alarmed India, which fears that China could use it to cut off water supplies to downstream areas of eastern India. China is not the first country to experiment with high-altitude clean energy. But other places as high as the Tibetan Plateau are mountainous and steep. Qinghai, slightly bigger than Texas, is mostly flat — optimal for solar panels and the roads needed to bring them in. And the cold air improves the efficiency of solar panels. Switzerland has experimented with small solar power installations at the top of cable railways. It opened a solar power farm at an altitude of 5,940 feet, but it can generate only about 0.5 megawatts, enough to power about 80 American households. The state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China completed a 480-megawatt solar project last year at an altitude of 4,000 feet on the plateau of the Atacama Desert in Chile, which is the world’s driest nonpolar desert, but much lower than the Tibetan Plateau. Qinghai’s Talatan solar project dwarfs these. It has a capacity of 16,930 megawatts of power, which could run every household in Chicago. It is still expanding, adding panels with a target of growing to 10 times the area of Manhattan in three years. Another 4,700 megawatts of wind energy and 7,380 megawatts of hydroelectric dams are nearby. China is now building at even higher elevations in mountain valleys on the Tibetan Plateau, although with smaller solar farms. Near Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, a Chinese power company recently installed 150 megawatts of solar panels at 17,000 feet. As an incentive to building solar farms, many western Chinese provinces initially offered free land to companies. The central government has recently ordered the provinces to begin charging nominal annual fees to encourage efficient use of the land. The Talatan solar project is on sandy soil with sparse vegetation used as grazing lands by ethnic Tibetan herders. The first panels installed at the site in 2012 were so low to the ground that sheep had trouble grazing under and around them. Now all panels are installed on higher mountings, said Liu Ta, the project’s manager. Dislocating people for power projects is politically sensitive all over the world. But high-altitude projects affect relatively few people in sparsely populated settlements. China pushed more than one million people out of their homes in west-central China a quarter-century ago and flooded a vast area for the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam. This year, China has been installing enough solar panels every three weeks to match the power generation capacity of that dam. Generating wind power on the plateau is trickier. At high altitudes, the winds blow fast, but the thin air doesn’t push wind turbine blades as effectively as thicker air closer to sea level. Still, the region has many wind turbines. Operators of the electricity grid try to balance the generation of solar power by day with wind power by night to maintain steady voltage and avoid blackouts. Qinghai Province sends excess solar power to Shaanxi Province in west-central China. In exchange, Qinghai tops off the wind power generated locally at night with small amounts of electricity generated by Shaanxi coal plants. In addition, Qinghai is increasingly turning to hydropower to balance the plateau’s solar power, in the hopes of using less coal-fired power. More than a decade ago, eight dams were built on the Yellow River as it drops 3,300 feet, flowing off the eastern side of the plateau and down into eastern China. More are under construction to balance and supplement the solar energy being generated in Qinghai Province. “When photovoltaic power is insufficient, I can use hydropower to make up for it,” said Zhu Yuanqing, power division director of the Qinghai Provincial Energy Bureau. Two additional hydropower projects are being built in high mountain valleys near the Talatan Solar Park. The plan for both, Qinghai officials said, is to use excess solar power generated during the day to pump water up into the projects’ reservoirs several miles up. The water will be allowed to drop down through mountain tubes to the plateau at night, spinning giant turbines to generate immense amounts of electricity. Several electricity-intensive industries are moving to the region to tap its inexpensive power. One is the task of turning quartzite from mines into polysilicon to make solar panels. Data centers for artificial intelligence are also drawn to the area. Qinghai plans to increase its data center capacity more than five times by 2030. The facilities are in Xining, the provincial capital, at an altitude of 7,500 feet, and in Yushu and Guoluo, two chilly towns at an altitude over 12,000 feet. The data centers consume 40 percent less electricity, their main operating cost, than similar ones at sea level because air-conditioning is barely needed, said Zhang Jingang, the executive vice governor of Qinghai. Air warmed by the data centers’ computer servers is circulated through underground pipes to heat other buildings in Yushu and Guoluo, replacing coal-fired boilers. Mr. Zhang spoke at a news conference in Xining as part of a government-organized media tour this summer of clean energy sites in Qinghai, which usually restricts foreign media access to hide dissent by its large ethnic Tibetan population. The New York Times paid for its own travel costs. To connect the data centers’ computing power to many of China’s technology companies, data is transferred from Shanghai to Qinghai on China’s national fiber-optic grid. The artificial intelligence programming of dancing humanoid robots for a televised gala during Lunar New Year in January was done at data centers in Qinghai. But even fiber-optic cables do not provide quick enough communications for one of the fastest-growing computation needs in China: self-driving cars. The data centers for these cars are still in eastern China, where most of the population lives and drives. “That kind of data center must not be placed in Qinghai,” Mr. Zhu said. “An accident may occur if you are not careful.” Li You contributed research from Gonghe County.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/china-solar-tibetan-plateau.html,Business,BBC,By Keith Bradsher,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/09/climate/00cli-china-solar-poster/00cli-china-solar-poster-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T04:00:10+00:00,00ecd44b5f0712a84e5bd53bc8e4183ba847164d
ab5e55d588bf,Los Angeles Times Moves Closer to a Public Stock Offering,"los angeles times, newspaper, ipo, patrick soon-shiong, stocks;bonds","The Los Angeles Times will begin selling shares to certain investors as it moves closer to an initial public offering, its owner, the billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, said on Thursday. The company announced a so-called private placement seeking to raise up to $500 million for the newly created Los Angeles Times Media Group, which includes the newspaper as well as LA Times Studios and two of Dr. Soon-Shiong’s other businesses: the virtual production company NantStudios and the gaming and esports studio NantGames. According to its investor website, the company is offering investors and funds preferred stock at $5,000 a share that would pay a 7 percent annual dividend and a 25 percent discount for conversion to common stock. The company plans to do a public listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the fall of 2026, with the ticker symbol LAT. In an email to staff members on Thursday, which was viewed by The New York Times, Dr. Soon-Shiong said the foundation of The Los Angeles Times would remain “a steadfast commitment to rigorous, independent journalism and to the diversity of voices that reflect and strengthen the communities we serve.” Dr. Soon-Shiong, who bought The Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million, first indicated that he planned to take the newspaper public in a July interview with Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show,” saying an I.P.O. would “democratize” the paper. Under Dr. Soon-Shiong, who has plowed more than $750 million into the paper, The Los Angeles Times has struggled to become profitable and has had multiple rounds of layoffs and buyouts in its newsroom. Dr. Soon-Shiong has also become more involved in the publication’s content. He blocked its editorial pages from endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. He also voiced his concern that its opinion section had become an “ echo chamber and not a trusted source” and needed more conservative writers. Earlier on Thursday, a majority of the Los Angeles Times Guild voted to authorize a strike over protracted contract negotiations. Matt Hamilton, an investigative reporter at the newspaper and chair of the guild, said in a statement, “These negotiations have dragged on for far too long, and today’s vote results show that our members are fed up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/media/la-times-ipo.html,Business,BBC,By Katie Robertson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Biz-LATimes-hkcm/10Biz-LATimes-hkcm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T03:56:54+00:00,06dd7a15530f53fb324cd695e0170b8eaeaf4021
50abffc93495,Inflation Report Will Be Released Despite Shutdown,"us economy, consumer price index, us politics, inflation, closings, social security, bls, labor department, donald trump, william wiatrowski","The Bureau of Labor Statistics is calling back a limited number of workers to help release consumer price data for September, despite the federal government shutdown, according to administration sources familiar with the plan. It isn’t clear when the Consumer Price Index report, originally scheduled for Oct. 15, will be released. But it will almost certainly be in time for the Federal Reserve’s next meeting at the end of the month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has stopped all operations during the lapse in funding, leaving economists and policymakers without key data at a critical moment for the economy. The shutdown already delayed the release of the closely watched monthly jobs report last week. The inflation report was expected to be the next casualty before the statistical agency began calling back some employees back to work to produce the report. The decision to release the data is tied to the annual process of adjusting Social Security benefits to account for changes in the cost of living . Under federal law, the Social Security Administration must publish the planned adjustment by Nov. 1. That adjustment is based on inflation data from the third quarter, however. As a result, a significant delay in the September consumer price data could make it impossible for the Social Security Administration to meet the deadline. An administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the cost-of-living adjustment would be severely affected if the Consumer Price Index data was not collected and released by Nov. 1. The raw price data used in the report has already been collected but must still be processed and analyzed. Employees called back to work include economists and information technology specialists, according to an administration source familiar with the plan. Data collection will remain suspended, which could lead to a delay in the next month’s C.P.I. report. Federal agencies have designated tens of thousands of workers as “essential,” meaning they must continue to work during the shutdown — although they will not be paid until funding is restored. In a contingency plan published last month, the Department of Labor indicated that the Bureau of Labor Statistics would suspend all operations — including regularly scheduled data releases — during the lapse in funding and would not release economic data. Only one bureau employee, the acting commissioner, was initially expected to continue working. Social Security payments continue during the shutdown, however. Publishing the September C.P.I. data is necessary to allow the administration to continue to pay benefits accurately, according to a second administration official. The recalled B.L.S. employees will work only on the September inflation release, the official said. The statistical agency is currently led by William J. Wiatrowski, the deputy commissioner, who took over on an acting basis after President Trump fired its Senate-confirmed commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, in August. Mr. Trump initially selected E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist, to take over the agency, but withdrew the nomination last month after it faced bipartisan criticism.

6cccdab017ff,"Customers May Openly Carry Firearms in Florida’s Publix Stores, Company Says","gun control, decisions and verdicts, supermarkets, legislation, publix super markets, james uthmeier, florida","Floridians buying groceries and other household items will be able to openly carry firearms while walking the aisles at Publix, the largest supermarket chain in the state, the company said on Thursday. The news came about two weeks after a state appeals court ruled that a Florida ban on people openly carrying firearms was unconstitutional. The Sept. 10 decision from the First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee overturned restrictions in effect since 1987. In response to an inquiry about the ruling, Publix said in a statement on Thursday that the company complies with state law, including the open-carry decision that took effect last month . “As of Sept. 25, 2025, Florida law allows the open carry of firearms,” according to the statement. “Publix follows all federal, state and local laws.” “Treating customers with dignity and respect is a founding belief at Publix,” it continued. “In any instance where a customer creates a threatening, erratic or dangerous shopping experience, whether they are openly carrying a firearm or not, we will engage local law enforcement to protect our customers and associates.” A spokeswoman for Publix did not elaborate beyond the statement. In a social media post after the ruling last month, James Uthmeier, the state’s new attorney general, cited the court ruling in saying that open carry was now “the law of the state.” The ruling related to a 2022 case in which a man looking to challenge the ban was in a livestream visibly carrying a holstered pistol and a copy of the U.S. Constitution in downtown Pensacola. The law applies only to people who are legally allowed to buy or own a firearm. Under the law , businesses and private property owners also have the option whether to allow people to openly carry firearms on their premises, according to a guidance memorandum issued by Mr. Uthmeier . In it, he said that “private property owners” would “maintain the long-standing legal prerogative to compel individuals carrying firearms to leave their premises.” The Florida statute also carves out exceptions , saying people are not authorized to openly carry a handgun in police, sheriff and other law enforcement facilities, courthouses, polling places and schools as well as businesses that “dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises,” among others. In 1987, Florida passed the open-carry prohibition that made it illegal to visibly display firearms elsewhere. Publix, one of the largest supermarket chains in the country, operates 1,421 stores in eight states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, according to the company . More than 800 of its green and white-hued stores are in Florida, where most customers can easily recall the brand’s longtime slogan, “Where Shopping is a Pleasure.” The company’s new policy on carrying firearms was first reported by The South Florida Sun Sentinel and The Orlando Sentinel newspapers in Florida. Customers at one small bustling Publix store in Miami Beach had mixed reactions to the company’s news on Thursday. As she loaded her car with groceries around midday, Beatrice Ponce responded with, “What?” and a surprised look when told about the company’s decision. “I agree with people having the right to bear arms,” she said, “but I do not agree to go into a facility like Publix where there are kids, you’re shopping and there’s also alcohol.” Ms. Ponce, a delivery driver, 58, added, “You can have arms in your house to protect yourself, but to go out — that’s another story.” As he dismounted a scooter before entering the store, Rafael Fornes, 69, said he was in favor of the open-carry policy. “I feel safer,” said Mr. Fornes, a retired architecture professor, who said he was familiar with shooting guns from his native Cuba but does not believe in violence. He said he didn’t see the guns as the problem. “It’s the people who carry the guns,” he added. Certain other supermarket chains in the state, including Winn-Dixie, will continue to prohibit customers from openly carrying firearms at their stores. “As a private business, our policy remains unchanged: We do not permit open carry of firearms inside our stores,” Southeastern Grocers, which owns Winn-Dixie, said in a statement on Thursday. Walmart did not comment on the state law, but the company policy on its website , updated in September 2019, says the company requests “that customers no longer openly carry firearms into Walmart or Sam’s Club locations in states where open carry is permitted.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/publix-stores-open-carry-florida.html,Business,BBC,By Johnny Diaz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09xp-publix-zwhj/09xp-publix-zwhj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T21:02:17+00:00,0b72861ccda251c173c1f684ecb586b2274a75f3
77a51289e947,Big Investors Await Windfall From Trump’s Argentina Bailout,"argentina, foreign aid, foreign investment, us politics, us foreign policy, economy, hedge fund, exchange stabilization fund united states treasury, treasury department, soros fund management, scott bessent, javier milei, stanley f druckenmiller, robert citrone, discovery capital","The Trump administration moved forward on Thursday with its bailout of Argentina, making a direct purchase of pesos and finalizing terms of a $20 billion lifeline, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. The terms and conditions of the economic support package were not announced, but Mr. Bessent said the funds would come in the form of a currency swap with Argentina’s central bank. Big global investors have been anxiously awaiting the details of the bailout, which critics have said will benefit wealthy fund managers at a time when American farmers are struggling and the U.S. government is shut down. Officials from both countries spent the last four days racing to finalize terms of the bailout ahead of high-stakes legislative elections in Argentina later this month and a visit to Washington next week by President Javier Milei, Argentina’s libertarian leader who is a close ally of President Trump. “Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity,” Mr. Bessent wrote on X. “The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets.” The Treasury secretary added that American business leaders have told him that they want to deepen ties with Argentina and that the Trump administration will stand behind its Latin American ally. But the administration’s decision to rescue Argentina’s economy is raising concerns about whether the real aim is to help rich investors whose bets on Argentina could falter if its economy sinks. Those efforts have been complicated by the fact that major hedge funds, including those led by friends of Mr. Bessent, stand to benefit financially from an Argentina economic lifeline. Funds at investment firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco are heavily invested in Argentina, as are investors such as Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both of whom worked with Mr. Bessent when he was an investor for George Soros. The Treasury’s intervention on Thursday offered a lifeline to Argentina’s financial markets, which have floundered as the country has faced a severe cash crunch. Dollar-denominated bonds set to expire in 2035 rebounded to levels last seen when Mr. Bessent first announced the United States would be stepping in. The peso also rebounded, although currency experts worry that it will soon come under pressure again without a longer-term fix for the country’s financial woes. The prospect that the Trump administration would rescue Argentina’s economy and aid wealthy investors at a time when federal workers aren’t getting paid amid a shutdown and struggling American farmers are awaiting an economic relief package has drawn criticism from Democrats, farm industry groups and others. On Thursday, a group of eight Democratic senators introduced legislation that would prevent the Treasury Department from using its Exchange Stabilization Fund to shore up Argentina’s finances. “It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the banking committee, who helped draft the legislation. “Trump promised ‘America First,’ but he’s putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill.” The legislation is unlikely to pass, but it demonstrates the political headwinds that Republicans could be facing over Argentina. Ahead of his meeting with Luis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister, Mr. Bessent insisted last weekend that the proposed $20 billion central bank swap line did not amount to a bailout of Argentina or a gift to wealthy investors. “This trope that we’re helping out wealthy Americans with interest down there couldn’t be more false,” Mr. Bessent told CNBC. “What we’re doing is maintaining a U.S. strategic interest in the Western Hemisphere.” International investors have long looked at Argentina as a place to make a profit, particularly related to government debt that successive leaders have taken on. In many instances, investors are not the original bondholders, but have bought at a discount from the nation’s original lenders, and are wagering that the liens will eventually be repaid or renegotiated. That view is beginning to pay off. One Fidelity fund this summer credited winnings from the country’s debt with helping compensate for losses from investments in other so-called emerging market countries including Venezuela and Ukraine. In particular, wealthy Americans with close ties to Mr. Bessent stand to win big. Mr. Druckenmiller was a mentor to Mr. Bessent at Soros Fund Management. A government filing in June of this year indicated that the Duquesne family office, which he runs, was the second largest investor in Argentina’s principal exchange-traded fund, a pool of Argentine stocks. Mr. Citrone, the founder of Discovery Capital Management, has made Latin America his biggest bet in the world, and Argentina is the fund’s biggest investment in the region. Mr. Citrone has said that when he worked with Mr. Bessent under Mr. Soros in 2013, he convinced them to make their now famous bet against the Japanese yen and that he was responsible for most of the bonus that Mr. Bessent earned. “I kind of convinced George and Scott Bessent at the time to go big on that. And, you know, Scott says I’m responsible for 75 percent of his bonus at Soros, kind of jokingly, over that time,” Mr. Citrone said in an interview on a podcast hosted by Goldman Sachs in May, according to the transcript posted on the bank’s website . It is unclear if Mr. Citrone played any role in convincing Mr. Bessent to prop up Argentina’s currency. But two people familiar with the deal said Mr. Citrone was in close contact with Mr. Bessent in the lead-up to the Treasury announcement last month, arguing that if Argentina’s currency crashed, so too would the political fortunes of Mr. Milei. Mr. Citrone told Mr. Bessent that if Mr. Milei were to lose the upcoming elections, Argentina would pivot to China for more economic assistance, according to one of the people familiar with the contacts. Mr. Citrone also apparently told Mr. Bessent that such an outcome would mean the United States could lose one of its most steadfast Latin American allies. A Treasury Department spokesman, Elliott Hulse, did not respond to requests for comment about Mr. Bessent’s conversations about Argentina with Mr. Druckenmiller or Mr. Citrone. A spokesman for Mr. Citrone declined to comment. Mr. Druckenmiller said that he had no communication with Mr. Bessent about Argentina before or after last month’s bailout announcement. Argentine media reported earlier on Mr. Bessent’s ties to Mr. Citrone. Mr. Milei’s party suffered a devastating loss in a key provincial election in September, and analysts are projecting that his party will face another disappointing result in legislative polls later this month. Such a loss would likely prevent Mr. Milei from continuing his pro-market, austerity-focused plans, which Mr. Trump’s administration has praised and, in many ways, replicated. Some conservative observers were critical of Treasury’s plans to support Argentina, arguing that the deal could instead end up supporting the country’s leftist, pro-spending political opposition, which is likely to sweep polls later this month. Mr. Citrone and leaders of the Conservative Political Action Conference, better known as CPAC, may have also been instrumental in lobbying both the International Monetary Fund and Mr. Bessent to bail out Argentina, according to the two people familiar with the agreement. In April, the I.M.F. shored up Argentina’s economy with its own $20 billion bailout agreement. The 48-month loan was Argentina’s 23rd such economic support package from the fund since the 1950s. Just days after the I.M.F. deal was announced in April, Mr. Citrone flew down to Buenos Aires to meet with Mr. Milei on a plane owned by one of the leaders of Tactic Global, known as CPAC’s lobbying arm, according to an adviser to the Trump administration and Argentine media reports. The plane was owned by Leonardo Scatturice, one of the founders of Tactic, who has made a fortune off lucrative government contracts doled out by Mr. Milei’s government. Mr. Citrone met with the Argentine president just hours before Mr. Bessent, who had flown separately to the country’s capital. During that visit, Mr. Bessent announced the I.M.F. deal. Those funds are intended to help Argentina loosen its currency controls while maintaining the government’s plans to scale back subsidies and spending. Last month, Mr. Bessent said the United States would provide more economic support to Argentina in the form of a $20 billion financial lifeline. The Treasury secretary added that Washington hoped the additional support would prevent Argentina from giving up mining rights to China. Argentina’s economy has largely been propped up over the years by an $18 billion currency swap provided by China. The United States has not said if there will be any guardrails to protect taxpayer money. Mr. Bessent emphasized that the currency swap the government plans to offer Argentina does not amount to a bailout. “We are not putting money into Argentina,” Mr. Bessent told CNBC. The politics of supporting Argentina has become especially fraught in the United States because China has been buying soybeans from Argentine farmers instead of American growers this year. The fact that Argentina is the most frequent recipient of I.M.F. bailouts and also the institution’s largest debtor raises questions about whether it could ever repay the United States. “They can call it what they want, but it’s a bailout,” said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It’s a country in crisis, it’s running out of dollars, and the U.S. is giving the country dollars. That’s a bailout by definition.” In negotiations over the terms of a support package, U.S. officials have been pushing for Argentina to scale back ties with China and have been seeking access to its uranium and lithium supplies, according to a person familiar with the matter. In Argentina, legislators and governors have more say in those contracts than Mr. Milei does, and the U.S. Treasury’s support for the Argentine president may not translate into more American companies securing mining rights. Mr. Bessent said on Thursday that bolstering Argentina is a matter of national and economic security. “The success of Argentina’s reform agenda is of systemic importance, and a strong, stable Argentina which helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in the strategic interest of the United States,” Mr. Bessent said.

faa71ca578d8,Crypto Investor Known as ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Reaches Deal With Prosecutors,"virtual currency;cryptocurrency;crypto, bitcoin, tax evasion, regulation and deregulation, us politics, sec, justice department, roger ver, donald trump","Roger Ver, a prominent cryptocurrency investor, has reached a tentative agreement with the Justice Department to table a criminal tax fraud case that federal prosecutors brought against him last year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Ver, 46, known as “Bitcoin Jesus” in crypto circles for his early evangelism, was charged by federal prosecutors in 2024 with fraud and tax evasion for failing to pay $48 million in taxes that he owed on his digital currency holdings. Under the terms of the deferred-prosecution agreement, Mr. Ver would pay about that much to the government, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal. Under the deal, which has not been filed with the court and could still change, the charges would eventually be dropped if Mr. Ver complied with the terms of the agreement. The case is poised to become the latest example of how the Trump administration has systematically dismantled a yearslong government crackdown on the crypto industry, a sector rife with fraud, scams and theft . Like other beneficiaries of the rollback, Mr. Ver sought to curry favor with President Trump by linking his case to the president’s grievances about the weaponization of the justice system. This year, Mr. Ver paid $600,000 to Roger Stone , a longtime associate of Mr. Trump, to try to abolish the tax provisions at the heart of the case. And the crypto investor hired David Schoen, a lawyer who represented Mr. Trump during his second impeachment trial. Lobbying filings show that Mr. Ver also hired Christopher M. Kise, a lawyer who defended Mr. Trump against various criminal and civil charges, as well as the lobbying firm run by Brian Ballard, a major Trump fund-raiser.

dc95c1e44c67,"Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., Wily Texas Oilman, Is Dead at 101","oscar s wyatt jr, oil and gasoline, international trade, bribery and kickbacks, coastal corporation, texas, saddam hussein, iraq, obituary","Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., the Texas oil tycoon who courted presidents and dictators, dabbled in foreign intrigue and went to prison for paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi government under the cover of a United Nations oil-for-food program, died on Wednesday in Houston. He was 101. His death was confirmed by his sons Trey and Steven Wyatt. One of the last of the storied wildcatters, Mr. Wyatt was a sagacious, rough-hewn entrepreneur who took out an $800 loan in 1955 and founded a pipeline company that became the Coastal Corporation. Over the next four decades, he built it into a national energy conglomerate, a Fortune 500 competitor of Enron and El Paso Gas, and his conduit for oil imported from the Middle East. Mr. Wyatt made billions selling energy to the Americas. His hydra-headed empire supplied heating oil to the Northeast, petroleum and natural gas to the Southwest, and marine diesel in the Caribbean. It owned vast pipeline networks, fleets of oil tankers and trucks, and 962 Coastal gasoline stations in 33 states. In the 1990s, Coastal had as many as 20,000 employees and revenues that exceeded $12 billion. With friends in Washington, private jets, a 9,000-acre ranch, a villa in the south of France and legions of detectives, lawyers and public relations retainers, Mr. Wyatt personified Texas. He rode horses, hunted game, packed a pistol and threw lavish parties for Prince Rainier of Monaco and Grace Kelly, Liza Minnelli, Johnny Carson, John Travolta, Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol and Truman Capote. And he made money hand over fist. “If Oscar were marooned in Alaska,” his fourth wife, Lynn Wyatt, told The Wall Street Journal in 1984, “he’d survive somehow and by the next week he’d probably be doing business.” But Mr. Wyatt also reneged on contracts, left municipalities short of power, raided corporate rivals, battled lawsuits and hostile takeovers, paid fines and civil misconduct penalties, and left a trail of enemies. Many Texans likened him to J.R. Ewing, the amoral oil baron in the television series “Dallas.” Texas Monthly magazine once called him “meaner than a junkyard dog.” Mr. Wyatt offered no excuses. “As a corporate manager,” he told The New York Times in 1985, “you have to have one objective — to be profitable or popular. I’ve chosen to be profitable.” He scoured the globe for oil; became a fixture at Vienna meetings of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC; and began importing Chinese crude soon after Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979. In the 1980s, he traded with Libya, even as its mercurial leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, defied the Reagan administration. Acquaintances said Mr. Wyatt boasted of his contacts and conflicts with Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and with governors, members of Congress and other officials. He contributed to the campaigns of both Democrats and Republicans and nurtured ties with foreign leaders. His chief associate and friend in the Middle East was Saddam Hussein, whom he met in 1972 after Iraq’s oil industry was nationalized. As Mr. Hussein consolidated his power, Coastal Corporation reaped rewards in the 1970s and ’80s, becoming one of the United States’ largest importers of Iraqi oil. In 1990, after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, Mr. Wyatt urged the first President Bush — just as he urged his presidential son two decades later — not to invade Iraq. When Iraq took 21 American oil workers hostage in a futile attempt to stave off a war, Mr. Wyatt, over Washington’s objections, went to Baghdad, negotiated with Mr. Hussein and secured their release . He came home a hero and wept with their families. After Iraq’s defeat in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the United Nations, hoping to demilitarize Iraq, imposed sanctions that halted oil exports, the country’s main source of foreign exchange. With ordinary Iraqis affected by the sanctions, the U.N. lifted its ban on Iraqi oil exports in 1995, but only to secure food, medicine and humanitarian aid. Letting Mr. Hussein pick the oil buyers, however, opened the door to fraud. In December 1996, a Wyatt tanker was the first to sail out of Mina al-Bakr, Iraq’s main export terminal, under the oil-for-food program. Years later, after an American-led coalition invaded Iraq and deposed Mr. Hussein, investigators found that he had secretly demanded “surcharges” from dealers buying Iraqi crude under the program. They were actually bribes, prosecutors said, and while many buyers balked at paying them, Mr. Wyatt did not. In 2007, he was indicted on federal charges of paying millions in bribes to Mr. Hussein from 2001 to 2003, when the oil-for-food program was discontinued. A year after Mr. Hussein was executed in Baghdad for the murders of his own people, Mr. Wyatt was tried in New York. Facing decades in prison, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud. He admitted paying $200,000 in kickbacks to the Hussein government in 2001. Four other charges, including trading with the enemy, were dropped. Sentenced to a year and a day, half the maximum under federal guidelines, he served 10 months and was released in 2008. “I didn’t want to waste any more time at 83 years old fooling with this operation,” Mr. Wyatt said . “The quicker I got it over with, the better.” Oscar Sherman Wyatt Jr. was born in Beaumont, Texas, on July 11, 1924, to Oscar Sr. and Eva (Coday) Wyatt. Abandoned by his father and raised by his mother in Navasota, Texas, he worked on a farm and in a gasoline station, earned a pilot’s license at 16 and flew a crop duster. He was an Army Air Forces bomber pilot in the Pacific in World War II. After the war, he was nearly killed in a hurricane while working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. He worked his way through Texas A&M University, earning a mechanical engineering degree in 1949. In 1950, he roamed oil fields, selling drill bits. Seeing an opportunity, he bought unwanted natural gas being flared at wellheads and sold it to a pipeline operator. In 1955, Mr. Wyatt founded the Coastal States Gas Producing Company — later renamed Coastal Corporation. As an engineer, pipeline operator, driller and refiner, he was involved in all phases of its operations, and could calculate contract details in his head or order operational changes based on telltale smokestack emissions. Mr. Wyatt was married four times, lastly in 1963 to Lynn Sakowitz, who survives him and with whom he had his sons Oscar III, known as Trey, and Bradford. In addition to them, he is survived by a daughter, Christina Kremers-Wyatt; two adopted sons, Steven and Douglas, his wife’s children by a previous marriage; and two grandchildren. Mr. Wyatt had costly business stumbles. In the 1970s, unable to fulfill gas contracts to San Antonio, Austin and other cities, Coastal was sued, assessed civil penalties and ordered to refund more than $1.2 billion to customers. In 1980, he pleaded guilty to federal oil-pricing violations and paid $9 million in refunds to the Treasury and $1 million in penalties. In 2001, Coastal merged with El Paso Corporation in a $24 billion deal. By then, Mr. Wyatt had retired as chief executive and chairman and was under investigation for bribery. He served as a consultant on energy exploration after his imprisonment, and in 2013 reaped a $500 million windfall for his stake in the $2.2 billion sale of an energy company to Abu Dhabi interests. Throughout his career, Mr. Wyatt remained an admired if formidable rival to energy magnates in Texas and beyond. “He is incredibly tenacious,” Kenneth L. Lay told The Times in 1985, when he was chairman of the Houston Natural Gas Corporation, years before he fell from grace as the founder of scandal-plagued Enron. “Once Wyatt decides he wants to accomplish something, he continues to pursue it until he gets what he wants or runs into a brick wall.” Ash Wu contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/oscar-s-wyatt-jr-dead.html,Business,BBC,By Robert D.

After meeting with the heads of Germany’s carmakers and other stakeholders in the auto industry, Chancellor Friedrich Merz vowed on Thursday to urge the European Union to back off a policy prohibiting all new vehicles sold after 2035 from producing carbon emissions. The regulation has been widely interpreted as a ban on combustion engines. “I will be pushing for decisions to be taken in the European Union that will enable comprehensive technological advancement and climate neutrality,” Mr. Merz told reporters. “Not with a date on the calendar that we cannot achieve, that is unrealistic, but with a clear perspective that also opens up the necessary future prospects for companies in Germany.” Stung by a drop in demand from customers in China, the world’s largest auto market, German automakers have seen sales of their cars decline steadily in recent years. President Trump’s tariffs have only made things worse. Porsche on Thursday joined BMW and Mercedes-Benz in reporting weaker sales in China, where customers prefer less expensive local brands like BYD and Xiaomi . On Wednesday, BMW’s shares plunged 7 percent after it cut its forecast for profit and cash flow, citing the U.S. tariffs. The pain is being felt in communities across Germany, where the auto industry shed some 51,500 jobs from June 2024 to 2025, according to a study from EY .

6189f1918009,22% Jump in Electricity Rates Dominates New Jersey Governor’s Race,"new jersey, electric power, price, us politics, gubernatorial races, consumer protection, pjm interconnection, jack ciattarelli, mikie sherrill, donald trump, josh shapiro, mid-atlantic states (us), pennsylvania, 2026 midterm elections","Most politicians rarely discuss electricity costs. But in New Jersey, they have been featured prominently in campaign ads and stump speeches in the run-up to November’s election for governor. This generally obscure topic has become critical in New Jersey because electricity rates this summer climbed 22 percent from a year earlier — faster than all but one state: Maine. As the governor’s race has tightened and affordability has become a key issue, power costs have become a predominant theme in ads paid for in part by groups associated with both national parties. What happens in New Jersey is likely to be an early read of the national political mood in 2026, when a majority of governors’ mansions will be up for grabs as well as congressional and state legislative seats. That’s because electricity rates are rising sharply in many states — the national average residential rate was up 5 percent in July from the same month last year, and energy experts say rates are likely to keep climbing quickly for the foreseeable future. The rising cost of living has been a pressing concern for many Americans over the past couple of years, remaining so this year in large part because of President Trump’s decision to sharply raise tariffs on imported goods. “Electricity is the new eggs,” said David Springe, executive director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, referring to the anger over inflation that helped Mr. Trump win last year’s election. But the causes of escalating energy costs are complex and hard for any elected official to capitalize on. That hasn’t stopped New Jersey’s Democratic and Republican candidates for governor — Representative Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli — from trying. “I’ll massively expand cheaper, cleaner power generation,” Ms. Sherrill said as she announced a plan to use a state of emergency declaration to freeze electricity costs for at least a year. Mr. Ciattarelli, who is running for governor for the third time, has sought to blame the rising costs on Democrats like Ms. Sherrill. Democrats have controlled the governor’s office in New Jersey for eight years and the State Legislature for 23. Seven years ago, during Gov. Philip D. Murphy’s first term as governor, New Jersey’s large natural gas and nuclear power plants made it a net exporter of electricity. But higher energy demand and the closing of several power plants in recent years have made the state a net importer of electricity, according to an analysis by the Energy Information Administration. “We’re having to import our electricity and paying through the nose to do it,” Mr. Ciattarelli said at a recent news conference. But importing electricity is not necessarily responsible for New Jersey’s rising electricity rates. Other states like West Virginia can generate more energy than they use but have also experienced big price increases. Most governors can do little to bring down electricity prices quickly. Rates are made up of many costs, only some of which retail electric utilities and state officials have control over. The cost of electricity is typically proposed by utility companies or government-run power agencies and approved by state and city regulators. While those regulators are typically appointed by governors or mayors, they often cannot deny rate increase requests or force utilities to charge lower prices. “Let’s be clear: The cost of electricity is not set by the governor in any state,” said Mark Cooper, a senior fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “Everyone will say, ‘We will lower the prices,’ but the question is how? The answer is it’s a long process.” New Jersey and a dozen other states are part of the nation’s largest regional electric grid, which is managed by PJM Interconnection, a nonprofit organization. PJM manages the electric grid for 67 million people from Virginia Beach to Chicago, and it effectively sets a significant portion of retail electricity rates over which governors and their appointed regulators have little sway. PJM’s members include utility companies, owners of power plants and power lines, energy traders, and others in the energy industry. One big reason electricity prices are climbing in New Jersey and other PJM states is an annual auction in which power plant owners submit prices they are willing to accept for supplying electricity at times of peak demand, which typically happens in the summer. The prices set by that auction have climbed sharply in recent years, leading to higher retail energy rates. At least three-quarters of the 22 percent increase in New Jersey’s average electricity rate can be attributed to the PJM auction. At New Jersey’s four primary investor-owned utilities, power system costs have added hundreds of dollars a year to household bills. Customers of those utilities who use 650 kilowatt-hours of power a month as of June 1 pay between $22.67 and $28.02 a month more than before that date. New Jersey isn’t alone in feeling that pain. Several governors have grown increasingly critical of PJM. They say that the grid manager has made it too hard for new wind and solar projects to connect to and deliver cheaper electricity to the grid. In December, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, sued PJM over its annual auction in July. Mr. Shapiro and PJM reached a settlement that capped the price set by the auction, a deal that Mr. Shapiro said would save PJM customers an estimated $21 billion over two years. A spokesman for PJM said it was reforming its markets and the process for adding new energy sources and resolving imbalances between electricity supply and demand. “Electricity prices are rising, not only in New Jersey but across PJM and throughout the rest of the United States, because demand is outpacing supply,” the spokesman, Dan Lockwood, said in a statement. “PJM understands the challenges that higher energy prices pose to the people and businesses of any state or jurisdiction we serve, and we are working with our stakeholders on multiple fronts to alleviate this supply/demand imbalance.” The issues with PJM are just one reason for electricity price increases. The cost for long-overdue improvements to power systems and upgrades needed to support energy-hungry data centers are also driving up household electric bills. New Jersey and several other East Coast states are also on the receiving end of Mr. Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects. Last month, he instructed a half-dozen federal agencies to draft plans to derail efforts to install hundreds of wind turbines in waters stretching from Maine to North Carolina. Governors of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island signed a letter urging the Trump administration to remove barriers to offshore wind projects already under development and construction. Ms. Sherrill supports offshore wind, but Mr. Ciattarelli is aligned with Mr. Trump’s position. The fight over offshore wind could further raise electricity bills, energy experts said. After more than a decade of little growth in demand for electricity, the East desperately needs more energy because of the building boom in data centers — about 60 gigawatts or the equivalent of almost the entire electricity demand in California, said Gregory Poulos, executive director of the Consumer Advocates of PJM States, an organization of state officials who represent electricity customers. “I’m very worried that we’re looking at superhigh costs and blackouts in the region,” Mr. Poulos said. Public Service Enterprise Group, the utility company that serves about 70 percent of New Jersey’s electricity users, said it offered customers payment relief and energy efficiency programs. But the power company said it did not control more than half of the amount customers paid for electricity service, including results of the PJM’s grid capacity auction. “We’re working hard to keep bills as low as possible on the portion of the bill that we manage and control,” said Dave Johnson, chief customer experience officer at the utility company. Ashley Koning is the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, which has conducted polls on the governor’s race. She said voters were hyper-aware of affordability and utility costs were among their most tangible concerns. “That increase that you’re seeing,” she said about monthly utility bills, “is probably more affecting and more damaging to you than seeing your tax bill go up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/new-jersey-electricity-prices-governor-election.html,Business,BBC,By Ivan Penn and Tracey Tully,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/business/00biz-nj-energy-promo/00biz-nj-energy-promo-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-09T15:44:36+00:00,5f30cace0f975957f4a51a7098c998a497dd352e
86ba7ce80b4f,How to Manage a Divided Fed,"internal tag to designate no storyline, us politics, interest rate, inflation, jobs, federal reserve, jerome powell, john williams, stephen miran","Andrew here. An Israel-Hamas deal could pave the way for an exchange of hostages and prisoners, creating the opportunity for a real peace agreement. It could be an extraordinary moment — if it happens and endures. Long-lasting stability in the region could also make the Middle East an even more powerful force in the world economy. Meanwhile, we’re focused on the debate inside the Fed over how many times to lower interest rates this year — and what concerns policymakers have about the strength of the economy. More on that and other news below. A question of cutting rates Futures markets suggest that the Fed will follow through on more rate cuts at the last two meetings of the central bank’s chief policy committee of the year. But new signs are emerging that such a move doesn’t necessarily have unanimous support , and that Fed policymakers are keenly aware of the risks that step might present. What’s new: Data released right after the Fed’s rate-setting committee met last month showed official support by nearly every member for cutting interest rates by a quarter point to 4 percent to 4.25 percent. Most support bringing borrowing costs down to 3.5 to 3.75 percent by year end. But minutes from the meeting published on Wednesday show it’s a bit more nuanced than that: “A few participants stated there was merit in keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision,” they read. Seven of 19 policymakers indicated that they saw a need for no more cuts for the rest of the year. The debate continues over whether inflation or a slowing job market is the bigger threat. Some Fed policymakers remain uncertain about how President Trump’s tariffs will affect prices, as well as whether longer-term inflation may be here to stay. Others are looking at the labor market. John Williams, the New York Fed president, told The Times that he was keeping an eye on a gradual slowdown in hiring over the past year. He felt that the market’s trajectory justified cutting rates in September. There’s still some concern about a lack of federal economic stats. The federal shutdown forced the Bureau of Labor Statistics to withhold the jobs report for September; unless it’s resolved soon, the Consumer Price Index most likely won’t be published on Oct. 15 as scheduled either. For now, Williams professed comfort with relying on alternative data. “I think we have a reasonably good picture of what’s happening, especially around the things that matter the most to us,” he told The Times. All this points to the delicate balance Jay Powell must continue to manage. The Fed chair has said that there are “no risk-free paths” now for the central bank, and that missteps could either ramp up inflation or choke the economy. Then there’s the President Trump factor. The president has made clear that he wants bigger cuts ASAP, something Stephen Miran, a close ally who is temporarily a Fed governor, has also supported. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been interviewing candidates to succeed Powell as Fed chair in May, The Financial Times reports, with a focus on interest rates and balance-sheet policy. Hanging over the process is a question about the Fed’s future political independence, a feature Williams strongly defended: “What we’ve seen from experience is that independent central banks are better at achieving the goals that the people and the government want to achieve,” he told The Times. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Trump administration won’t impose tariffs on generic drug imports. The White House decided to exempt such medicines from levies after some officials warned that such a move could lead to price increases and drug shortages, The Wall Street Journal reports. The decision, which isn’t yet final, is the latest good news for the drug industry, after a deal between Pfizer and the White House to lower the prices of some drugs and sell medicines directly to patients. Harvard weighs seeking assurances from the White House as they negotiate a settlement. School officials have discussed internally whether to ask Trump administration officials to ensure that the school won’t be subject to further demands if a deal is reached, The Times reports. The discussions within Harvard arose after the White House asked nine schools to embrace a “compact” to more strongly align themselves with Trump policy objectives. (Harvard’s new negotiator is Steve Schwarzman, the billionaire investor and Republican donor.) Elon Musk settles a pay fight with former Twitter executives. Four former Twitter leaders agreed to end a lawsuit over more than $128 million in severance pay they say they were owed, after settling for undisclosed terms. The move ends another legal battle over Musk’s takeover of the social network, now called X, which led to mass layoffs and disputes over exit pay. Shutdown update The Senate again failed to advance competing measures to end the week-old government shutdown. But lawmakers are facing pressure to strike a deal as worries grow about the consequences of the closure. Here’s the latest: Senior Republican lawmakers, including Senator John Thune, the majority leader, have pressed the Trump administration not to follow through on its threats of mass layoffs and deep cuts to government programs for fear of a backlash from voters, The Wall Street Journal reports. About 13,000 flights were delayed from Monday to Wednesday, as the F.A.A. dealt with air traffic staffing shortages. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News on Wednesday that while historically about 5 percent of flight delays can be attributed to controller shortages, the “last couple of days it’s been 53 percent.” Turmoil caused by air traffic staffing shortages is credited with helping to end a 35-day shutdown in 2019. The I.R.S. announced on Wednesday that it was furloughing nearly half of its work force and shuttering most of its operations. Taxpayer services such as call-site operations would be closed, Politico reports. In a memo, the service told employees that their furlough back pay was guaranteed by law . Expectations for a long shutdown are growing. About half of bettors on Kalshi now expect the shutdown to last more than 25 days , while more than a third are betting that it will go on for more than 30 days. Reflection AI raises $2 billion Concerns are growing about how long the fervor for artificial intelligence businesses may last. But Reflection AI, a year-old start-up that focuses on creating open-source A.I. models that others can freely modify, is the latest sign that there’s still plenty of investor interest, Michael de la Merced reports. Reflection will announce on Thursday that it has raised $2 billion, seven months after its last funding round. The latest deal values the start-up at $8 billion, including the new money, significantly higher than the roughly $545 million valuation it fetched in March, according to PitchBook. The round included Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the A.I. boom that has recently been pouring billions into other start-ups. (It invested $800 million, the biggest check in the round, and had several engineers work with Reflection AI to optimize its most recent generation of A.I. chips, DealBook hears.) Other participants in the round included existing backers like Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital, as well as new investors like DST Global, the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt and 1789 Capital, the investment firm that counts Donald Trump Jr. as a partner. Reflection says it wants to be the American answer to DeepSeek, the Chinese A.I. start-up whose open-source model shocked the world with its abilities. Western open-source models so far aren’t nearly as capable, argued Misha Laskin, Reflection AI’s co-founder and C.E.O. That means many companies and institutions around the globe are becoming dependent on Chinese-built A.I. models rather than on Western-built ones. Reflection AI, whose founders came from the Google DeepMind A.I. lab, insists that it is developing a solution: “There’s a DeepSeek-shaped hole in the U.S., which I think is what makes it critical for a lab like ours to exist,” Laskin told DealBook. The round underscores A.I. companies’ huge need for resources, including computing power and talent — in other words, money. A.I. foundation model companies have raised $71.9 billion worldwide so far this year, according to the data provider PitchBook; by comparison, the sector collected $34.9 billion last year. That raises questions about whether a smaller business like Reflection AI can keep up with bigger start-ups like OpenAI, let alone giants like Google or Meta. But Laskin argued that demand for open-source models from large companies and governments will eventually give it a stable business. The clock ticks for Buenos Aires President Javier Milei of Argentina has bet much of his political future on promises about what he can secure from his relationship with the Trump administration. But Argentina’s central bank is burning through the last of its dollar reserves to prop up the country’s currency, the peso, as Milei awaits details about the size and timing of a financial lifeline from Washington. The latest: In recent days, Argentina’s central bank has sold about $2 billion in U.S. dollar reserves to support the weakening peso. The country has only about $680 million in reserves left, Reuters reports, giving it only a few more days’ runway at the current pace. Analysts widely expect Milei to devalue the peso, a move his administration has tried to delay until after midterm legislative elections that are set to take place this month. Anger over spiking prices under his predecessor, Alberto Fernández, ushered Milei into power, and hyperinflation has cost other presidents their jobs in the past. It’s unclear when U.S. aid will arrive. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month that the Trump administration was ready “to do what is necessary” to support Argentina. (Washington’s goal appears to be an effort to help a close ally — President Trump has called Milei his “favorite president” — and then to help him design a new currency system that ties Argentina more closely to the dollar.) Argentina’s economy minister, Luis Caputo, has been in Washington to negotiate a potential $20 billion currency swap , in which the U.S. would give Argentina hard currency in exchange for dollar-denominated bonds. But there are questions about that potential aid. U.S. soybean farmers have protested any help for Argentina, which sold more than 2.5 metric tons of soybeans to China after it suspended export taxes. That has been part of Beijing’s halt in U.S. soybean purchases, devastating American farmers . It’s also not clear how long the aid would last. If Argentines and currency traders continue to exchange their pesos for dollars, $20 billion from the U.S. could be depleted within months.

Model Start-Up, Raises $2 Billion","artificial intelligence, open-source software, venture capital, startup, computers and the internet, tech industry, reflection ai, nvidia, lightspeed venture partners, sequoia capital","For much of the past decade, American technology companies like OpenAI and Google have dominated the artificial intelligence industry. Then came DeepSeek, the Chinese start-up whose A.I. model was nearly as powerful as competing Western ones — and it was free to use. Now, Reflection AI, a year-old American start-up, is betting that it can create a Western equivalent of DeepSeek. And it has raised billions to do so. Reflection AI announced on Thursday that it had raised $2 billion in new funding, in a round that included Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the A.I. boom. The deal values Reflection AI at $8 billion, including the new money, significantly more than the roughly $545 million the company was valued at in March, according to the data provider PitchBook. The fund-raising is yet another sign of the investor fervor for all things A.I., as companies across the industry continue to collect eye-popping sums. Companies that build A.I. foundation models have raised $71.9 billion worldwide so far this year, according to PitchBook; by comparison, the sector collected $34.9 billion last year. But the move also shows that investors are willing to invest not only in the proprietary software sold by OpenAI and Google, but also in open-source models, which are free to share and modify. Skeptics of open-source A.I. say the approach could cause significant harm . Yet Reflection AI argues that the United States needs an equivalent to DeepSeek — an open-source model developer whose software can compete with top closed-source models — to maintain technological superiority around the world. Existing Western open-source A.I. models are underperforming DeepSeek and other Chinese rivals, which may lead to greater adoption of Chinese-created models, according to Misha Laskin, Reflection AI’s co-founder and chief executive. (Among the Western companies making open-source models are Meta , Mistral AI of France and even OpenAI , though that company is primarily focused on proprietary software.) “There’s a DeepSeek-shaped hole in the U.S., which I think is what makes it critical for a lab like ours to exist,” Mr. Laskin said in an interview, comparing the situation to the Cold War space race. But developing any A.I. model, open-source or not, requires ever-higher amounts of computing power and research talent — in short, money. That is why Reflection AI raised $2 billion just seven months after raising $130 million in March. In recent months, Reflection AI held talks with potential investors, and closed the round within a matter of weeks, Mr. Laskin said. Nvidia wrote the biggest check — $800 million — and had several engineers work with Reflection AI to optimize its most recent generation of A.I. chips, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal’s details. Other participants in the round included Disruptive Technology Advisers; Lightspeed Venture Partners; Sequoia Capital; DST; the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt; and 1789 Capital, the investment firm that counts Donald Trump Jr. as a partner. Mr. Laskin conceded that Reflection AI would need more money to keep competing, especially as rivals are also rushing to raise money: OpenAI alone secured an investment commitment of up to $100 billion last month from Nvidia. But he argued that demand for open-source models — including from big companies and governments that want greater control over their A.I. applications — will eventually lead to a sustainable business. The hope, he added, is that smaller A.I. companies eventually end up being the Amazons and Metas of the future: “I anticipate us to be potentially a bigger company than the hyperscalers of today,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/dealbook/reflection-ai-2-billion-funding.html,Business,BBC,By Michael J. de la Merced,https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,2025-10-09T12:01:02+00:00,9bba58994e43140dbb7aae6177c6d4227425c650
01c16b7fda32,Troubled Wind Developer Orsted to Cut 25% of Staff,"orsted, wind power, layoffs;furloughs, energy industry, renewable energy","Orsted, the Danish renewable energy developer, said on Thursday that it would cut about 2,000 jobs, or around 25 percent of its work force, over the next two years. The move was the latest sign of the diminished prospects for offshore wind, a low-emissions technology that Orsted helped pioneer. “We’ll be saying goodbye to many skilled and valued colleagues,” Rasmus Errboe, Orsted’s chief executive, said in a statement . Not long ago, Orsted looked on its way to becoming a global giant in the renewable energy industry, with a portfolio that includes high-profile projects in the United States. Now, the company suggested that it would dial back those aspirations and hunker down in its home base of Europe. Offshore wind farms, which cost billions of dollars to build, have lost some of their luster. The sector is under attack by President Trump, while adverse economic developments, including inflation and high interest rates, have eroded profitability. Mr. Errboe said that Orsted would be finishing up its construction projects in the coming years and so “we’ll need fewer employees.” Deepa Venkateswaran, a utility analyst at Bernstein, the Wall Street research firm, said that the last couple of years had “changed everything for them.” The Trump administration has actively opposed efforts to construct wind farms off the East Coast of the United States, ordering a halt earlier this year to one of Orsted’s projects, called Revolution Wind. The $6.2 billion development off Rhode Island was 80 percent completed at the time of Mr. Trump’s order, Orsted said. Although a federal judge said last month that Revolution Wind could proceed, and work has restarted, Orsted’s future in the United States, including a large wind farm it is building off New York, called Sunrise Wind, now looks uncertain. Rather than lining up future developments, Orsted is doing what it can to survive. It recently raised more than $9 billion from shareholders, including the Danish government, which owns just over 50 percent of the company’s shares. The company’s stock has lost about half of its value over the past year. Orsted employs around 8,000 people around the world, and it expects that number to fall to around 6,000 by the end of 2027. The company said the reductions would occur through attrition, sales of business units, outsourcing and redundancies.

Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, says he supports further interest rates cuts this year, even though inflation has moved away from the central bank’s 2 percent target in recent months. His rationale revolves around the labor market, where cracks have emerged. What Mr. Williams wants is to protect those cracks from deepening further. In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Mr. Williams said he did not believe the economy was on the verge of a recession. But the slowdown in monthly jobs growth, coupled with other signs that companies are more hesitant to hire, warrants attention, he said. The views of Mr. Williams are important given his role as president of the New York Fed, a position that confers a permanent vote on interest rates. He is also a close ally of Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair. Mr. Williams spoke at a fraught moment for the Fed, which is balancing dueling economic risks. On the one hand, Fed officials do not want to exacerbate the slowdown in the labor market. But they also want to avoid inadvertently stoking inflation, which has started to accelerate again because of President Trump’s tariffs. Mr. Williams said the Fed had the flexibility to shore up the labor market because the inflation outlook did not appear as dire as it did earlier in the year. Mr. Trump’s tariffs have raised some consumer prices, Mr. Williams said, but he expects the impact on inflation to fade over time despite the president’s new import taxes on products like furniture and drugs. Those tariffs build on steep levies that Mr. Trump put on imports from dozens of countries on Aug. 7, in addition to sector-specific ones. “The risks of a further slowdown in the labor market is something I’m very focused on,” Mr. Williams said. He later added that if the economy evolved as expected — inflation moving up to around 3 percent and the unemployment rate inching up beyond its current 4.3 percent — he would back “lower rates this year, but we’ll have to see exactly what that means.” Mr. Williams indicated that a lapse in official government data because of the shutdown would not deter him from wanting to take action at the Fed’s coming meetings. The shutdown, which has stretched into its second week, has already delayed the September jobs report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics may also have to withhold the Consumer Price Index report that is due for release on Wednesday if lawmakers do not reach a deal by then. Mr. Williams acknowledged that government statistics were the “gold standard of macroeconomic data.” But he said private-sector providers and surveys both from the Fed and from external sources like the Conference Board or the Institute for Supply Management were also informative. “We have a reasonably good picture of what’s happening, especially around the things that matter the most to us, which is maximum employment and price stability,” he added, referring to the Fed’s goals of a healthy labor market and low, stable inflation. Mr. Williams said that it was hard to predict how significantly the shutdown would drag down economic growth and that he was mainly focused on the possibility of cutbacks in government jobs, including at the state and local levels. Fed officials lack official government data at a particularly bad moment, as they debate how quickly to lower interest rates after cutting them last month for the first time this year. Policymakers meet twice more this year, with the next gathering scheduled for Oct. 28-29. Their quarter-point reduction last month, to a range of 4 percent to 4.25 percent, was framed as a “risk management” move, a description that Mr. Williams embraced on Wednesday. Like many officials — including Mr. Powell — he views the Fed’s policy settings as “modestly restrictive,” meaning borrowing costs are high enough to dampen economic activity but not torpedo it. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the $23 trillion economy, has stayed relatively resilient, although much more so for wealthier Americans than for lower-income households. Companies may not be hiring much, but they are not firing workers, either, helping to keep the unemployment rate relatively stable. Stock markets have also soared to new heights, while government and corporate bond yields have fallen. This backdrop has led some officials at the Fed to conclude that its policy settings are not restraining the economy all that much. They appear much more concerned about persistent price pressures and, as such, less inclined to lower interest rates further. But Mr. Williams countered that a softening labor market would help to keep a lid on inflation, even if price pressures across the services sector have stayed sticky. He also stressed that stock markets were not a good representation of how restrictive interest rates were and instead could reflect “real world factors” like investors’ piling into bets on artificial intelligence. “I don’t see any signs of second-round effects or factors that could be amplifying the effects of tariffs on inflation,” Mr. Williams said. “There’s more downside risks to the labor market and employment, and that is something that takes some of the upside risk off of inflation.” He said it was appropriate to bring interest rates back to a “neutral” setting, which neither speeds up growth nor slows it down over time. Most officials estimate that level to be around 3 percent, or 1 percent when adjusted for inflation. But there are a range of views among Fed officials. Mr. Williams has previously estimated the inflation-adjusted rate to be between 0.75 percent and 1 percent. The newest member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, Stephen Miran, recently argued that the neutral rate was closer to 0.5 percent, lowered by Mr. Trump’s immigration restrictions, the potential for tariff revenue to help pay down America’s debt and deregulatory efforts. That has become the basis for his support for interest rates that are roughly two percentage points lower than current levels, well out of step with other officials. Mr. Williams did not convey any urgency to cut interest rates rapidly and made clear that the Fed was committed to returning inflation to 2 percent. “We’re not losing track of that,” he said. “We still have our eye very much on inflation, but we want to make sure that we achieve both of our goals as best as possible.” That means getting inflation back to the target but also trying to “minimize the risk of the labor market cooling more sharply.” He echoed Mr. Powell’s warning that there is “no risk-free path,” but said the Fed was trying to “broaden that path."" Mr. Williams also addressed a string of attacks on the central bank by the president, who has been haranguing the Fed to lower interest rates substantially. Mr. Williams acknowledged that “political figures have their views” on the Fed as he emphasized the importance of its independence from the White House, adding that it was “really important right now for us to get our job done as best as we can.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also blamed the central bank for “mission creep” and for distorting financial markets with its quantitative easing program, which involved huge purchases of government bonds and other assets after the last two major financial crises. Mr. Williams defended the use of these tools, which he said were just an “extension of monetary policy,” and warned that without them, the economy would have been worse off. “The recovery would have been slower,” he said. As part of his pressure campaign, Mr. Trump has also sought to exert more direct influence over the Fed by trying to pack it with people amenable to his policy views. He was able to install Mr. Miran, who is taking only a temporary leave of absence from his role as one of the White House’s top economic advisers, after Adriana Kugler abruptly stepped down from the board in August. The president has since tried to force another vacancy by attempting to fire Lisa Cook over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. The Supreme Court, which will hear arguments in January in Ms. Cook’s lawsuit opposing her removal, has allowed her to continue serving as a governor while her case is litigated. Mr. Williams, who is 63, said he planned to stay in his role until mandated to retire in 2028. Asked about Mr. Trump’s attempts to erode the Fed’s independence — as well as the scrutiny the central bank has faced for its nonconfrontational response — Mr. Williams emphasized that his focus was squarely on analyzing the data. “We’re not political creatures,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/federal-reserve-john-williams-rate-cuts.html,Business,BBC,By Colby Smith,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09dc-fed-williams-qkfv/09dc-fed-williams-qkfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T09:04:10+00:00,f79c8e9711cccd6eb358d9fed8a902b57fed398b
f88721d7a251,Help! We Found a Hidden Camera in the Bathroom of Our Airbnb.,"travel;tourism;vacations, airbnb, camera, hotels, service content","Dear Tripped Up, This past Memorial Day weekend, my boyfriend, two friends and I were just over one day into our three-day, $1,023 Airbnb stay at a house in Alton, N.H., near Lake Winnipesaukee, when my boyfriend noticed a flashing light coming from what turned out to be a camera disguised as an outlet extender in the bathroom. By that point, we had already taken showers, gotten undressed and used the toilet. We called the police, who took the camera as evidence and encouraged us to leave the property immediately. We also contacted Airbnb and were put in touch with Liviana, a member of the company’s safety team. We provided her with a photograph of the camera installed over the toilet, a screenshot of an online listing for a matching camera from Knowyournanny (a site that sells security cameras) and the police case number. We asked for a full refund and for the listing to be taken down, as it appeared to be booked for much of the summer, and we were especially concerned that previous reviews of the property mentioned children staying there. After several days of back and forth, Liviana wrote us back to close the case. “Based on the information provided,” she wrote, “we were not able to conclude that there was a violation of our policy.” Though we were refunded for one night of our stay, we want a full refund — and we want the house off the Airbnb platform to protect future renters, especially children. Savannah, Massachusetts Dear Savannah, Airbnb’s policy is clear as day: Security cameras inside homes are always prohibited, even if turned off or disclosed to guests. The evidence you sent them and me is just as clear: a photograph of a device hanging above the toilet that is an exact match of a spy camera sold across the internet. “Monitor your property in real-time from your mobile device,” reads a description of the product on Amazon, offering purchasers “vibrant, high-resolution images that capture every detail.” It’s hard to imagine why Airbnb wouldn’t give you a full refund, and unconscionable that the company continued to rent out the home, even as the police investigated a potential crime. ( In New Hampshire , installing a camera “in any private place” is a misdemeanor that becomes a felony if “a reasonable person” would know children used the space.) A little over two weeks after I got in touch with Airbnb, the company told you that you would receive a full refund, and that the house would be removed from the platform. But that was over three months after the incident. Javier Hernandez, an Airbnb spokesman, confirmed you had been sent a refund. “In the very rare event a potential violation of our policies on security cameras is reported to us, we take that seriously and take action, which can include removing hosts and listings from the platform,” he wrote to me by email. He added the company stood “ready to assist law enforcement, who have not yet reached out to us.” I’d really like to know the procedure that Airbnb staff members like Liviana would follow in such a case. What does such an investigation consist of? Whom, if anyone, did Airbnb contact — the host, the police, the property managers? Those are not just rhetorical questions. It’s the exact wording of what I asked Mr. Hernandez via email. I got no specific answer. It is unclear who installed the camera, and the property has been open to many short-term renters over time. The Alton Police Department would not provide details. “Currently this case is open, therefore, not releasable at this time,” wrote Tina Hashem, the senior dispatcher for the department. I also wrote to the sergeant whom you’ve been in regular touch with, Tyler Glidden, and he did not respond. The family that owns the home and the property management company on the Airbnb listing did not respond to requests for comment. But Sergeant Glidden has been providing you with updates throughout, so we do know some details. You told me that the police had obtained a search warrant to look through the footage in the memory card and found thousands of hours of recordings, though none that included people. That is something of a relief, though it is possible that footage from days the house was occupied was removed, and of course anyone could have been monitoring the bathroom’s livestream at any point. You also said Sergeant Glidden told you the police were considering charges. The fact that the police appear to be taking the investigation seriously is a good sign. But for travelers, the broader question here is: How did Airbnb get this so obviously wrong? I’ll take a stab at explaining the inexplicable. Airbnb is neither host nor guest but a $75 billion middleman overseeing upward of five million properties in more than 200 countries and territories. That amounts to hundreds of millions of nights in which strangers are renting homes from strangers, often in strange lands. Such human-to-human interactions are inherently complex and inevitably generate disputes. The cross section that shows up in my inbox ranges from more serious cases like yours ( and other potential crimes ) to more mundane but still gross things like stained linens, scampering mice and dirty hot tubs. (By far, the most common complaints stem from Airbnb’s removal of — or refusal to remove — negative reviews about properties.) Being a global mediator of such hyperlocal issues is a vexing challenge that Airbnb has not mastered. Whether that is because its mediation system — a sort of international small-claims court where disputes take place mostly by direct message — faces an impossible task or its staff is underresourced or insufficiently trained is beyond my expertise. But something is clearly wrong when, despite your convincing evidence and continuing pleas to remove the property, Airbnb dismissed an obvious danger. Some travelers will read this account and swear never to use Airbnb again, but my guess is many of those pledges will be short-lived. Short-term rentals are an irresistible part of the travel landscape these days, and it’s not like Airbnb’s competitors (or hotels , for that matter) are flawless, either. So how can you at least reduce any risks? Here’s an abbreviated list of guidelines that, admittedly, probably would not have helped in this case: Stay in places with at least dozens of reviews, and read through them carefully. (You can take one outlier complaint with a grain of salt, but believe any patterns.) Get your host on record by asking questions via the app before you reserve, focusing on specifics that matter to you — is this an elevator or a walk-up building, are certain appliances working, is there any noise at night? Photograph (or take video) of everything when you check in, and again when you check out. Document anything that happens and communicate problems immediately to your host via the Airbnb app and to Airbnb as well if you can’t work it out quickly. Most of all, remember that in any rental, you are just one of Airbnb’s customers. The host is the other, and if anything goes wrong, one of you will very likely be disappointed by the outcome.

ea9e879e5ded,China Clamps Down Even Harder on Rare Earths,"rare earths, china, internal-open-access-from-nl","The Chinese government announced on Thursday that it was escalating its curbs on exports of rare earth metals, as Beijing claims broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology. The new rules, which are set to take effect Dec. 1, are the latest step by Beijing as it tightens the reins on rare earths to exploit China’s dominance in the sector. Hours later, Beijing announced that starting on Nov. 8, it will also restrict exports of many kinds of equipment needed to manufacture batteries for electric cars, in a bid to protect China’s competitive advantage in the car industry as well. The rare earth rules could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple. Rare earths are essential for the production of many computer chips, which are used in everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence systems. Rare earths are also used to make the magnets that power the electric motors in drones, factory robots and offshore wind turbines, as well as the brakes, seats and other systems in cars. China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the measures were needed to prevent rare earth metals from being used in technologies with possible military applications. For example, China refines all of the world’s samarium , a rare earth metal used by the United States to make F-35 fighter jets and a wide range of missiles. The ministry said rare earth exports to overseas military suppliers “will not be approved.” Foreign governments and businesses have insisted that most rare earths are used for civilian purposes.

Now, Its ‘Jewel in the Crown’ Is Leaving.","manufacturing, closings, layoffs;furloughs, economy, infant formula, international trade, birth rates, nestle, askeaton, ireland, china, switzerland","The powder was so lucrative that some people here called it cocaine. The men and women making pricey infant formula for Chinese babies at a factory in Askeaton, a small town in the southwestern Irish county of Limerick, had helped to turn around the fortunes of a place long overlooked. So when the people in suits unexpectedly arrived from Switzerland two years ago to deliver a death blow to the more than 540 workers employed at the plant, the first reaction was disbelief. No one could believe that Nestlé, a multinational food giant, would simply shutter a sophisticated plant into which it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars. “All of a sudden, the factory looked drab,” said Carmel Ryan, the unofficial town historian who runs the Askeaton Tourist Office and whose husband, Michael, worked at the factory for 34 years before retiring. “It was like the sunlight was gone from behind it.” It’s not hard to find someone in this town of 1,100 who worked at the plant or has a story to share about a friend or relative who was laid off. The factory was such a large presence that when a baby was born, tins of milk powder would appear on the doorstep, a gift from a neighbor working there. From the banks of the Deel River in the center of town, the factory, originally built in 1974 and passing through various owners before Nestlé acquired it, looked like a lumpy green mass on the horizon. But people in town considered it one of the best places in Ireland to work. The jobs at the factory were so stable that the local credit union needed only a worker’s most recent pay slip to give out a loan. Then came the Nestlé announcement. After the swarm of local reporters filled their notebooks with stories of the job losses to come and the national television crews packed up their vans, the initial shock gave way to suspicion. Nestlé had blamed waning demand for its baby formula products in China, where the birthrate was plummeting, for the factory closure. It cited a drastic fall in births to nine million in 2023 from 18 million in 2016. So few people were having babies in China that its population had begun to shrink , and this plant closure was an example of how that decline was reverberating around the world. But still, people had questions: Was there something else to the story? “I can’t believe the story as it’s presented,” said Kevin Sheahan, who was the longest-serving councilor in the county of Limerick until he retired from public office last year. “There’s a piece missing in that jigsaw.” People began talking: Did the closure have more to do with a demand from China to move the factory closer to its consumers? Residents of Askeaton recalled feeling uneasy years ago about Nestlé’s strategic shift to go all in on China, closing off the many markets in Europe and the Middle East it had supplied baby formula to for decades. “All our eggs were in one basket,” said Oliver Scanlon, 63, a farmer who worked at the factory for 40 years before he left several years ago. And yet, the factory saw its best days when it was selling only to China. “They called it the jewel in the crown,” Mr. Scanlon said. Looking back, people in Askeaton say there were signs that China wasn’t just interested in buying their baby formula, but also in learning every step in how it was made. Workers swapped stories about the Chinese auditors who visited every year, asking detailed questions about each process in the plant. “They came and they picked up on the smallest things,” observed Jimmy O’Donoghue, 63, who worked as a general operator at the plant for 30 years. Tim Hanley remembers well when a group from China showed up at his dairy farm down the road from the plant around eight years ago. Members of the group told him they were doing research, though he thought they might have been potential buyers of the plant. “It was an alarm bell ringing, you know,” said Mr. Hanley, 50, whose 200 cows supply milk that would eventually end up at the plant. “In fairness to the Chinese,” he added, “they can produce everything themselves, you know. Self-sufficiency is what they’re all about. So they come, they learn, they take their trade back home.” For years, foreign brands clamored to get into China to sell their milk, cars and luxury items, seeing only the possibility of 1.4 billion customers. After a tainted-milk scandal in 2008 shocked the nation, even Chinese families with limited income were willing to pay more for foreign baby milk powder than families in other regions like Europe. But doing business in China can come at a steep cost, including the transfer of know-how that is ultimately felt by workers back home. At the time of its closure announcement, Nestlé said that it planned to transfer production that had been done in Askeaton to facilities in Switzerland and China. Workers at the plant started leaving in waves, as the company slowly negotiated its way through pay packages. A month after it said it would close the Irish plant, in November 2023, Nestlé said it had won approval for a factory in Suzhou, in eastern China, to make and sell a similar product to what it had been making in Askeaton. After warning about the falling birthrate, Nestlé has since been more cheerful about the China market, saying it “remains the world’s largest” because of “the sheer number of newborns.” All of this has left people in Askeaton feeling raw, though ultimately, the reasons behind the closure matter less to the people of Askeaton than how it will reverberate. The last batch of milk powder was made at the plant last month. Unless someone decides to buy the plant from Nestlé, which is selling it for 22 million euros, or about $26 million, the factory doors will shut for the last time in March. In a statement, Nestlé said that since announcing its proposal to close the factory in 2023, “supporting our employees has been our priority,” adding that it has provided training and assistance to help them find new jobs. Driving through Askeaton, it is impossible to miss T.S. Morain, a brightly colored hardware store. Inside, Seán Moran, 56, stacks the shelves with television remote controls, microwaves and hair dryers, and hopes he can keep the lights on in the shop that has been in his family for three generations. “I think it’s going to hit,” said Mr. Moran about the factory closure. He recalled leaving Ireland in the 1980s to look for work because there were so few opportunities at home. “People won’t have the money to do what they want to do as often as they would like,” he said. But times are not as tough anymore, he said, and people will find a way. Some of the younger workers at the Nestlé factory have found new jobs at nearby plants owned by the multinational pharmaceutical companies Regeneron and Eli Lilly. Still, across the street at the local credit union, employees are on alert. When times were flush, if you worked at the factory, you were guaranteed a loan, said Patrick Ranahan, a business development executive at the credit union. Now, he explained “it’s definitely harder to get that over the line.” “There was good wages, which meant that the town flourished,” said Mr. Ranahan who remembered his mother receiving tins of baby food from neighbors when he was young. “But,” he added, “there was always the possibility that it could be yanked away at any second.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/world/europe/ireland-china-nestle-baby-formula.html,Business,BBC,By Alexandra Stevenson and Paulo Nunes Dos Santos,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/01/multimedia/00int-ireland-china-dispatch-01-bztw/00int-ireland-china-dispatch-01-bztw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T04:01:21+00:00,4cb4d2d7e6287e25205cda9370f4d03e47dad529

Since January, the Trump administration has made deep cuts to the nation’s science funding, including more than $1 billion in grants to the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much of the basic research at universities and federal laboratories, and $4.5 billion to the National Institutes of Health . Thousands of jobs for scientists and staff members have been terminated or frozen at these and other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Park Service. To thousands of researchers — veteran scientists and new grad students, at state universities and Ivy League institutions alike — these sweeping reductions translate as direct personal losses: a layoff, a shuttered lab, a yearslong experiment or field study abruptly ended, graduate students turned away; lost knowledge, lost progress, lost investment, lost stability; dreams deferred or foreclosed. “This government upheaval is discouraging to all scientists who give their time and lend their brilliance to solve the problems beleaguering humankind instead of turning to some other activity that makes a more steady living,” Gina Poe, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in an email. Next year looks to be worse. The 2026 budget proposed by the White House would slash the National Science Foundation by 56.9 percent, the N.I.H. by 39.3 percent and NASA by 24.3 percent, including 47.3 percent of the agency’s science-research budget. It would entirely eliminate the U.S. Geological Survey’s $299 million budget for ecosystems research; all U.S. Forest Service research ($300 million) and, at NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, all funding ($625 million) for research on climate, habitat conservation and air chemistry and for studying ocean, coastal and Great Lakes environments.

8227242c8c57,Press Group Condemns New Pentagon Rules on Reporting,"us military, journalism;journalist;news media, freedom of the press, first amendment, freedom of the press foundation, reporters committee for freedom of the press, pentagon","A group that lobbies on behalf of Pentagon reporters on Wednesday harshly criticized new rules released by the Defense Department that could lead to the revocation of press credentials. “Limiting the media’s ability to report on the U.S. military fails to honor the American families who have entrusted their sons and daughters to serve in it, or the taxpayers responsible for giving the department hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” a statement from the group, the Pentagon Press Association, said. There are approximately 90 journalists with credentials to cover the Pentagon. Representatives of news organizations have been negotiating with the Pentagon since the department first released a set of new rules in a lengthy memo dated Sept. 18. The rules represent a major departure from how reporting at the Pentagon has worked for decades. The memo said that the Pentagon was committed to transparency and accountability, but it also laid out a set of strictures that immediately drew criticism from news organizations. One of its provisions was widely interpreted as requiring reporters to seek approval from the government for their coverage. Failure to comply could lead to a revocation of press passes. Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said at the time that the policy “operates as a prior restraint on publication which is considered the most serious of First Amendment violations.” The agency responded on Monday with a revised policy. The new version says that approval requirements for releasing information are binding for government officials, not journalists. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Conspiracy Theories Started Flying.","us politics, tv, journalism;journalist;news media, federalism, presidential power, us military, cnn, national guard, donald trump, stephen miller, portland oregon","It was an odd TV moment: Stephen Miller, President Trump’s deputy chief of staff, was answering a CNN anchor’s question from the White House lawn on Monday when he stopped midsentence, falling silent and blinking at the camera. “Stephen. Stephen. Hey, Stephen, can you hear me?” the anchor, Boris Sanchez, asked from his studio in Washington, before the network cut to a commercial break. A few minutes later, Mr. Miller was back onscreen, and the interview resumed ; Mr. Sanchez apologized and told viewers that “some wires got crossed.” CNN said a technical mishap had occurred. But by that point, the internet was doing what the internet does. “Wow, Stephen Miller absolutely did not have a glitch on live TV,” declared one TikTok user whose video about the exchange had been liked more than 135,000 times as of Wednesday, adding that it seemed Mr. Miller had said something that he “was not supposed to say.” “Clearly someone hit the panic button in his earpiece,” wrote a user on X, in a post that has recorded about 1.7 million views.

Responding to Mr. Sanchez’s question about the legality of deploying National Guard soldiers to Portland, Ore., Mr. Miller cited a federal law under which, he said, “the president has plenary authority.” Plenary authority is a legal term that effectively means limitless power. The Trump administration has invoked the term at least once before , in a legal argument as to why the president should be allowed to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act; a federal appeals court ruled against the administration in that case last month. Mr. Miller did not use the term again once the CNN interview resumed. After Mr. Sanchez repeated his question, Mr. Miller asserted that “the president has the authority anytime he believes federal resources are insufficient to federalize the National Guard to carry out a mission necessary for public safety.” He and Mr. Sanchez went back and forth over whether the conditions in Portland justified such an extraordinary deployment of domestic soldiers. The White House did not immediately comment. Political tensions have intensified around the situation in Oregon, with many Democrats and local officials objecting to the use of the National Guard. Online skeptics wondered if Mr. Miller had caught himself after accidentally revealing an underlying rationale behind Mr. Trump’s aggressive expansion of executive power. As an X user put it, “Stephen Miller said the quiet part out loud.” A CNN spokeswoman on Wednesday provided a more mundane explanation. Guests who appear remotely on television programs wear earpieces to hear the audio from the anchor who is interviewing them. CNN said that because of a technical error, an audio feed from a different CNN channel began playing in Mr. Miller’s ear. He could no longer hear Mr. Sanchez. The problem was fixed during the commercial break, and Mr. Miller appeared unbothered by the interruption. Later, on X, he promoted clips from the interview and reposted praise from Benny Johnson, a right-wing podcaster who said that Mr. Miller had “absolutely eviscerated CNN.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/business/media/stephen-miller-plenary-authority-cnn-conspiracies.html,Business,BBC,By Michael M.

5f06b166bb9c,"Mixed Economic Signals Stoke Divisions at Fed, Minutes Show","banking and finance, interest rate, inflation, us economy, us politics, federal reserve, jerome powell, stephen miran","A few Federal Reserve officials were reluctant to support the central bank’s interest rate cut in September, minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting showed, emphasizing the extent of the divisions that have emerged between policymakers over what to do about borrowing costs. The record of the September meeting, when policymakers lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, underscored the tough balancing act ahead for the Fed as it contends with both a softening labor market and higher inflation. The decision, which shifted interest rates to a new range of 4 to 4.25 percent, was officially supported by every Fed official except one. It was the Fed’s first rate cut this year. Stephen Miran, who was sworn in just ahead of the start of the two-day meeting, voted instead for a more aggressive, half-point reduction. Mr. Miran, who was most recently a top economic adviser to President Trump, also stood apart from his new colleagues in projections released by the Fed. He signaled the need for borrowing costs to fall roughly two percentage points lower than current levels. Most officials penciled in an additional half-point reduction this year, which would bring interest rates down to 3.5 to 3.75 percent. However, seven of the 19 policymakers who submitted forecasts indicated that they did not see a need to cut further this year, while two predicted just one more quarter-point move. The minutes show the range of views that Jerome H. Powell, the chair, is now having to manage. “A few participants stated there was merit in keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision,” the minutes said. “These participants noted that progress toward the committee’s 2 percent inflation objective had stalled this year as inflation readings increased and expressed concern that longer-term inflation expectations may rise if inflation does not return to its objective in a timely manner.” The decision to cut in September centered on a shift in how officials viewed the risks confronting the economy. For most of the year, they had been focused chiefly on inflation, which has been above the Fed’s 2 percent target for roughly five years. Mr. Trump’s tariffs have helped push certain consumer prices higher, but the overall impact on inflation has been more muted than once expected. Still, a majority of officials expressed concern about inflation, noting in the minutes that price pressures could end up being more intense than currently expected. They pointed to a range of factors including “uncertainty about the effects of tariffs, the possibility that elevated inflation proves to be more persistent than currently expected even after the inflation effects of this year’s tariff increases fade, or the possibility of longer-term inflation expectations moving up after a long period of elevated inflation readings.” The September record, however, stressed that policymakers generally expected that inflation would ultimately fade after pushing higher in the coming months and “gradually return to 2 percent thereafter.” That view has given the Fed more flexibility to respond to the labor market, which has started to show signs of cracking. The unemployment rate is still low, at 4.3 percent, but the pace of monthly jobs growth has markedly slowed. Companies appear less eager to hire, even though they have stopped short of firing workers. Mr. Powell had framed September’s cut as a “risk management” move intended to shore up the labor market. But each successive cut may be harder to justify without a much more substantive deterioration in the labor market, given that price pressures are still far too high. The minutes said that most officials supported lowering interest rates further this year. But some policymakers appeared worried about easing up prematurely. “Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes,” the minutes said. What makes forthcoming decisions much more difficult is that responding to one risk, like an economic downturn, could end up worsening the inflation outlook. Mr. Powell acknowledged this bind after the most recent meeting, not only stressing what a “ challenging situation ” the Fed was now in, but also noting that “there are no risk-free paths now.” If the Fed moves too quickly toward a “neutral” policy setting — in which interest rates are neither speeding up growth nor slowing it down — policymakers may inadvertently worsen their inflation problem. If instead the Fed moves too slowly toward that level, a more severe economic downturn could take hold. The Fed must next vote on interest rates on Oct. 28-29, but that decision has been complicated by the ongoing government shutdown . The Bureau of Labor Statistics has already been forced to withhold the September jobs report, which was supposed to be released last Friday, because of the shutdown. Without a deal to fund the government soon, the Consumer Price Index, which is set for release on Oct. 15, could be delayed as well.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/business/federal-reserve-meeting-minutes.html,Business,BBC,By Colby Smith,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08dc-fed-mkjg/08dc-fed-mkjg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T18:43:40+00:00,c3e486d0559e1b754f0acd88ad5c46bc2a3fd4f5
f89c0e2dd4fc,What if SportsCenter and LinkedIn Merged?,"startup, podcast, tbpn, silicon valley, computers and the internet, tech industry","Inside a film studio lot in Hollywood on a Tuesday morning in August, Jordi Hays, a 29-year-old entrepreneur, ran into the frame of a live shot, waving a giant red flag. Dressed in what can be described only as Patrick Bateman-core — gray bespoke suit, button-down oxford, polished black wingtips, with a slicked-back swoop to his hair — Mr. Hays was shouting into the camera. “The timeline is in turmoil!” he yelped, rattling off a series of references that only those obsessively glued to the tech industry corners of the social media site X would understand. “Perplexity has made an offer to buy Chrome!” John Coogan, Mr. Hays’ 36-year-old business partner, dressed nearly identically, looked on with a smirk. Mr. Coogan, who at 6-foot-8 towers over everyone he meets, was slouched in his chair to fit into the frame of the shot. The two sat at a table piled high with tech company swag, copies of that morning’s Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, a dozen half-empty cans of Yerba Mate and Diet Coke, and microphones and laptops. At 11 a.m. on the dot each weekday, they begin livestreaming “TBPN” — “Technology Business Programming Network” — a three-hour-long chat show of boosterish commentary on the worlds of tech and business. The “TBPN” formula is simple: Two self-aware fellas who treat techno-capitalism like a Fantasy Football league, chronicling a ticker-tape dribble of executive moves, corporate acquisitions, initial public offerings and venture capital funding. Call it SportsCenter for the terminally online M.B.A. grad. Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays (who have also been known to film the show in Miami Vice-style white suits; they have a predilection for the trappings of 1980s wealth) spend the live broadcast multitasking, obsessively scrolling through X as if they were traders staring at a Bloomberg terminal, spinning up graphics for social media designed to go locally viral: — “Jian Zhang POACHED from Apple to go to Meta and work on artificial intelligence” — “BREAKING: Ilya Sutskever, one of the co-founders of OpenAI, has updated his profile pic” The first episode of their show, which they originally called “ Technology Brothers ” (a wink to the common put-down for men of their ilk, “tech bros”) aired last October. Practically overnight, it became a sensation, at least in the seven-by-seven square miles of San Francisco, watched by everyone from the Celsius-pounding start-up crowd to the tip top of the tech elite. Executives from OpenAI, Palantir and Andreessen Horowitz appear regularly, as do pseudonymous X account holders like @roon and @carriednointerest , who are big in tech and finance Twitter circles but complete unknowns to outsiders. Silicon Valley has often clothed itself in the mission-driven language of global transformation. But what Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays tap into is a “who’s up, who’s down” part of the culture that has long existed but is rarely expressed as explicitly in public. It turns out that tech people — especially in the A.I. talent-wars era of Silicon Valley — are just as interested in gossiping about who is changing jobs as they are in changing the world. Founder Mode In September, signaling its new status as the preferred outlet of tech-world insiders, “TBPN” broadcast live from Meta’s annual developer conference at its Menlo Park campus, and livestreamed a sit-down with Mark Zuckerberg after his keynote speech. As Mr. Zuckerberg walked on to the pop-up set in the middle of Meta’s campus called “Hacker Square,” Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays welcomed the chief executive with firm handshakes. Someone pressed a sound effect button, broadcasting a voice-over saying “FOUNDER MODE” with the booming resonance of a World Cup vuvuzela. (“Founder Mode” is considered a high compliment in Silicon Valley circles, a frame of mind possessed by those who built their own start-ups with the zeal of a bare-knuckle boxer.) The trio spent the next 10 minutes talking strategy and the future, chopping it up like old friends. Mr. Zuckerberg spoke about how the newly debuted Meta Ray-Bans, which contain a small screen in the lens, can be used to send texts to friends. (There was no mention of the product demo failing onstage.) The C.E.O. then banged a gong — a staple of the show — to end the interview. “Congratulations on bringing sci-fi into the present,” Mr. Hays said. “What we’ve created is something that looks a lot like traditional television but with what we hope is all the best parts of independent media,” Mr. Hays said in an interview at Tartine, a block down the street from the Hollywood gym he and Mr. Coogan visit together at 6:30 every morning before work. The show’s audience is relatively small. Most of its viewership tunes in on X when the show is livestreamed; the highest number of simultaneous viewers its had is around 130,000. Recordings of the shows posted to YouTube hover around the low thousands to tens of thousands of views per episode. Despite that, the hosts consider CNBC and Fox Business — both with hundreds of thousands of daily viewers — to be their competitors. After all, they point out, broadcasters are increasingly moving away from a focus on linear television and toward the cross-platform strategy that “TBPN” has embraced. The bet is that one day viewers will start looking for anchors who are a little less Wolf Blitzer and a bit more Mr. Beast. “TBPN” is small, with just 10 employees, and Mr. Hays and Mr. Coogan intend to keep it that way, they say. “I do not want to manage a dozen TV hosts,” Mr. Coogan said. He pointed to his co-host, who was halfway through his breakfast of a double smashburger. “We are the talent, and we’d like to remain the talent, not build an empire,” Mr. Coogan added, as Mr. Hays nodded and chewed. For now, the show’s audience size is less noteworthy than the type of viewers it attracts. The show counts among its fans the occasional world’s richest person, Larry Ellison; the former shark on “Shark Tank” Mark Cuban; and Uber’s founder, Travis Kalanick. Start-up founders consider it a required watch. Entire communications teams for executives of public companies strategize how to make their C.E.O.’s interview on “TBPN” feel like a good hang while promoting their businesses. “We’re in the business of hanging out and talking about business,” Mr. Hays said. “And we love business.” (And wealth: in one recurring segment on the show on Fridays, Mr. Coogan rifles through the mansion section of The Journal. Occasionally, the hosts cover high-end cars, luxury watches and the state of the art markets.) They consider themselves tech-positive, like their podcasting peers Dwarkesh Patel and Lex Fridman, who are other regular stops on a C.E.O.’s press tour, perhaps because of their often gentle approach to interviewing. (Tech executives have grown increasingly hostile to traditional media. Seeing Mr. Zuckerberg do a sit-down interview with anyone other than a podcaster these days is about as rare as snowfall in Palo Alto.) But “TBPN” is less obviously interested than those shows in the philosophy behind new technology, and more often focused on competitive corporate strategy. To that end, Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays embrace attention-grabbing rankings and scoreboards. In July, they debuted “ The Metis List ,” — a play on Forbes’ “ Midas List ” of top technology investors as well as a reference to Greek mythology — which ranks the top 100 artificial intelligence researchers in the field. The metrics are both legitimate and cheeky; peer rankings, education, academic citations and “number of Dwarkesh appearances” all factor in. From Soylent to Streaming Starting a streaming news show was never really the plan, though both men have long been interested in start-up culture. In 2013, Mr. Coogan co-founded Soylent, the coder-embraced nutrient slurry that was something like the Gatorade of hustle culture, named after the marquee food source in the 1973 dystopian film, “Soylent Green.” (Spoiler: “ Soylent Green is people .”) In 2021, Mr. Hays founded Party Round, a crowdfunding venture capital start-up that rose to prominence during Silicon Valley’s heady ZIRP , or “zero interest rate phenomenon,” era. Party Round fell out of favor as interest rates rose and another start-up acquired it in 2024. Soylent sold for a middling amount to a global food conglomerate the year before. But those experiences, Mr. Coogan said, gave the pair an insider’s perspective on what it means to build a challenging business. “Imagine being 25, raising money from Andreessen and Google and all these prominent investors, and then like two years later you’re just getting hammered by the market,” Mr. Hays said. “We’ve gone through that, and I think that’s really important for how we approach our coverage.” After a few more stints around the Valley — Mr. Coogan did an entrepreneur’s residency at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and worked on a nicotine gum start-up — the two met through mutual friends in 2023. And despite their “ Dudes Rock ” mien, they were industry nerds at heart. Mr. Coogan had been streaming tech-focused interviews and deep dives into companies on his own YouTube channel for years. They recognized that a two-person dynamic might work better as a daily show. Moreover, they just liked talking to each other. Mr. Hays, who moved to Los Angeles after college, commutes to the show’s Hollywood studio from Malibu. Mr. Coogan, a Pasadena native, lives there with his family. And though many of the companies “TBPN” covers are based in the Bay Area, they settled on Los Angeles because they need to cultivate media talent, not engineers. The set approximates a CNBC studio set up in the locker room of an Equinox gym. One recent morning, Mr. Hays took off his pants while on the phone with a potential guest, changing out of his workout clothes and into a suit. A dozen young men scurried around the set, prepping for the show and chawing packets of Zyn. There were zero women present, and the only people that appeared to be older than 30 were Mr. Coogan and me. Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays avoid news anchor-style stuffiness, describing different tech products as “mid” (which means bad) or “extremely sick” (which means good). A Bloomberg-style visual ticker at the bottom of the broadcast screen shows off Polymarket odds on different tech events happening, like a 30 percent chance of Meta’s latest A.I. model, Llama 5, launching this year, and even lower odds of Tesla debuting robotaxis in California before 2026. At three hours of daily livestreaming, the show can drag. Even the most charismatic of hosts can struggle to make earnings reports and data centers seem as exciting as, say, the Final Four. But the extremely online tech crowd eats it up. “A lot of what they do is aimed at people who have their nose up against the glass,” said Peter Kafka, a correspondent at Business Insider who hosts a podcast on the intersection of tech and media. “The gap between what they’re doing, and what you and your buddy are talking about over lunch or drinks or whatever is pretty minimal. And I think that’s why it works, because the idea is that you and your buddy could be these guys, too.” The morning I was present, David Risher, chief executive of Lyft, appeared on Zoom in to boast about his company’s most recent earnings report and the latest projects while wearing a black-and-white Aloha shirt. The affair was largely chummy. “I’ve actually tried to get our investor relations folks to do our next earnings call in the form of a podcast,” Mr. Risher said. “Maybe I can get you guys to host it!” Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays don’t consider themselves journalists, and they wear their optimism about the companies they’re discussing on their sleeve. They also expressed some reservations about talking to me — “the enemy,” as Mr. Coogan put it in faux scare quotes — especially as most of their peers are wary of institutions like The New York Times. But he added they believed traditional publishers still serve a crucial role in the media environment. “We can’t do what we do without you guys,” Mr. Coogan said. Because “TBPN” is free, it relies largely on a handful of paying sponsors — mostly tech start-ups like Ramp, a virtual credit card start-up, and Polymarket, the recently legalized online betting marketplace — and expects to generate $5 million in revenue this year. It recently hired Dylan Abruscato as its 10th employee to manage ad revenue, which he has been charged with tripling in 2026. Mr. Abruscato is no stranger to livestreamed media; he worked as director of partnerships for HQ Trivia, the live game show app that skyrocketed to popularity in 2018 before fizzling two years later. (The Wall Street Journal, perhaps taking a page from the playbook of “TBPN,” devoted a headline to Mr. Abruscato’s hiring.) On Friday, Mr. Hays and Mr. Coogan interviewed OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the latest high-profile get for the show. Mr. Altman spoke about Sora, the company’s new video generation A.I. app , and also noted he had recently bought a new Acura NSX, which earned him numerous air horns from Mr. Hays’ soundboard. (“I have a proclivity for expensive cars,” Mr. Altman admitted.) But even as their star rises, they aren’t forgetting to sweat the small stuff. “Nine years ago today, Mark Zuckerberg went live on Facebook and smoked a brisket in his backyard,” the show’s X account posted soon after announcing Mr. Altman’s interview.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/technology/tbpn-silicon-valley.html,Technology,BBC,By Mike Isaac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12TBPN-01-fkzt/12TBPN-01-fkzt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:47+00:00,29314246a9457bf5049c9e29beb53d09be5554a9
dcfc4846b08c,A Mystery C.E.O. and Billions in Sales: Is China Buying Banned Nvidia Chips?,"artificial intelligence, computer chip, data center, nvidia, megaspeed, regulation and deregulation, jen-hsun huang;jensen huang, kuala lumpur, china, commerce department, international trade, malaysia","On a humid June night last year, Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, held court with several of his company’s major Asian customers at a bar with sweeping views of Taipei. They stood and toasted the booming artificial intelligence industry. Next to the Nvidia chief was a woman named Huang Le, or Alice Huang, an executive of a Singapore-based data center company called Megaspeed, which was poised to buy $2 billion of Nvidia A.I. technology over the next year. Though Ms. Huang and Megaspeed are little-known players in the A.I. industry, their association with Nvidia and its chief executive has recently become a preoccupation in Washington. Commerce Department officials have been investigating whether Megaspeed, which has close ties to Chinese tech firms, is helping companies in China sidestep American export restrictions, according to more than a half dozen current and former officials and other people familiar with the companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an examination that is not public. The inquiry, which is active, calls into question how closely Nvidia is tracking where its A.I. chips end up and highlights the possibility of American export laws easily being sidestepped. Megaspeed is also facing scrutiny from Singaporean police, who told The New York Times in a statement that they are investigating the company for breaching local laws, without elaborating further. As the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia’s annual revenue has soared nearly sevenfold in the past four years, making it the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. But the Silicon Valley company’s meteoric rise has coincided with U.S. government concerns that its chips could help adversaries like China develop new weapons, surveil dissidents and leap ahead of the United States in A.I. development . Those concerns led both the Biden and Trump administrations to crack down on A.I. chip sales to China. But some Chinese companies employ global networks of middlemen and shell companies to sidestep those limits. In a legal gray area, some have built vast data centers in Southeast Asia that have fueled China’s gains in A.I. Other Chinese companies have set up illegal smuggling networks , moving perhaps hundreds of thousands of blocked chips into China, experts estimate. In April, the House Select Committee on China opened an investigation into Nvidia’s sale of chips to China and Southeast Asia. Nvidia has expanded its operations in Taiwan in recent years, but it remains firmly anchored to Silicon Valley, where it was founded more than three decades ago. Megaspeed illustrates the challenges facing U.S. government officials trying to keep China from accessing powerful A.I. chips. After splitting off from a Chinese gaming company in 2023, Megaspeed set up a subsidiary in Malaysia that quickly snapped up nearly $2 billion worth of Nvidia’s most advanced products. Most of those chips came from the U.S. branch of a Chinese company that has already been sanctioned for providing technology to the Chinese military, according to records obtained through ImportGenius, a trade data platform. Megaspeed has funneled those chips to data centers in Malaysia and Indonesia that appear to remotely serve customers in China. That is not necessarily illegal, but it can be found unlawful if it is done on behalf of a Chinese company. U.S. officials have also been scrutinizing whether Megaspeed diverted some of those chips on to China, in violation of U.S. law, two people familiar with the company said. The Times visited sites in four countries, reviewed shipment records, business registrations, videos and photographs, and interviewed more than 30 people to shed light on Megaspeed’s opaque operation. Reporters tracked business listings that led to a Malaysian data center and shopping mall, a near-empty office in Singapore and a dilapidated storefront outside Kuala Lumpur. Nvidia said there was no evidence that its chips had been smuggled into China. John Rizzo, a spokesman for Nvidia, said in a statement that the chipmaker had “engaged with the U.S. government” regarding Megaspeed. Nvidia’s compliance team also looked into Megaspeed and determined it was “wholly owned and operated by a company based and headquartered outside China, with no China shareholders,” he said. Mr. Rizzo said Nvidia had visited Megaspeed’s facilities multiple times. During a visit this week, he said Nvidia employees “found no evidence of diversion, and confirmed what we previously observed — Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules.” Megaspeed said in an emailed statement that it “is a Singapore-based company, operating fully in compliance with all applicable laws, including U.S. export control regulations.” It declined to comment further. Ms. Huang did not respond to requests for comment. The Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, said it did not comment on active enforcement matters and could not confirm or deny the existence of any pending investigations. It added that the Trump administration would aggressively investigate allegations of wrongdoing and that exporters should perform due diligence and investigate any red flags. The White House did not provide a comment. Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs declined to comment. The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry in Malaysia said that the country had recently strengthened its oversight of the export of A.I. chips and that it maintained an active dialogue with the United States about its controls. Aaron Bartnick, an assistant director for technology security and governance under the Biden administration, said Megaspeed raised “many red flags,” including its ownership claims and possible ties to sanctioned entities, that should have made Nvidia’s executives question whether they should have permitted the company to have access to its A.I. chips. “It’s hard to see a justification for taking that risk,” he said. From China to Singapore Megaspeed was created in 2023 when 7Road, a Chinese gaming and cloud computing company with ties to state-backed investors, split off its overseas operation in Singapore and renamed it Megaspeed. Megaspeed listed Ms. Huang as its managing director for its first eight months before removing her from that role in its corporate paperwork. (She has also described herself as the company’s chief executive.) The company’s current director is from Singapore but is based in Shanghai, according to business records and his social media account. Companies around the world were scrambling to buy the Nvidia chips used to build ChatGPT, which was released in November 2022. And the U.S. government was setting up a technological dragnet to stop advanced chip sales to China. It is not clear when Mr. Huang and Ms. Huang, who are not related, first met. She was mingling with a crowd of tech executives just after midnight at the Taipei bar in early June of last year when she offered to ask Mr. Huang of Nvidia to join them, recalled Parker Schmitt, an executive who was with the group. “She said, ‘I bet you guys I can get Jensen here,’ and then Jensen immediately showed up,” Mr. Schmitt said, referring to Mr. Huang by his first name. Photos posted to LinkedIn by NetThunder, a data software provider where Mr. Schmitt is chief executive, show Mr. Huang at the bar with the group. Shortly after Ms. Huang reached out, Mr. Huang arrived in his trademark black leather jacket and drank a whiskey shot with the group. He was accompanied by two other Nvidia executives and had planned to attend the party, said a person close to the company. “Our field operations teams often host groups of customers and partners at conferences, and when Jensen is available, may ask him to visit to provide updates on the market,” Mr. Rizzo of Nvidia said. Mr. Huang and Ms. Huang were photographed together again in May, exiting a restaurant in Taipei with an Nvidia aide after a business dinner with other A.I. suppliers. In a video from the SET News channel in Taiwan, she waited behind Mr. Huang as he passed out noodles from the restaurant to onlookers and spoke to the Taiwanese press. Ms. Huang has a scant online profile. She spent much of her career in mainland China, including working as a television reporter for Chinese state media and as a private banker, according to a biography found on the social media of a former employer. The Times could not confirm either of those experiences. Ms. Huang left Megaspeed in recent months. The exact date is unclear. It is also unclear why she left and what she is doing now. Both she and 7Road, the Chinese company that Megaspeed split off from, have close ties to a web of wealthy investors and tech companies with data center projects in China, according to a review of corporate and trade records compiled by the platforms WireScreen and Sayari, and analysis by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington nonprofit. The owners of 7Road include the Chinese central government and several local governments. Before joining Megaspeed, Ms. Huang was executive director for a Shanghai-based fund that had invested in 7Road and had ties to state-backed firms. Valuable Shipments It is not clear where Megaspeed’s billions of dollars came from to buy chips. But a few weeks after the gathering in Taipei last year, Megaspeed began receiving a steady supply of multimillion dollar shipments of some of Nvidia’s most advanced chips, according to Malaysian trade records. Those purchases would have been illegal under U.S. law if Megaspeed were still a Chinese subsidiary. But Nvidia had determined that Megaspeed was a Singaporean company, said a person close to the company’s compliance division, and believed it was a newcomer to the cloud-computing industry that would compete for business against U.S. companies. Megaspeed, Nvidia officials said, did not raise any red flags. Over the next three months, Megaspeed bought a billion dollars of Nvidia technology. Within the next nine months, it secured roughly a billion dollars more. Worldwide, Nvidia recorded roughly $115 billion in data center sales last year. Malaysian import records show that the bulk of those advanced Nvidia chips were purchased from what WireScreen says is the U.S. subsidiary of Inspur, a major Chinese tech firm that the United States has sanctioned for trying to acquire American technology to build supercomputers for the Chinese military. Inspur and Aivres, the subsidiary, didn’t respond to requests for comment. In 2023, Inspur was added to the U.S. entity list for supporting the Chinese military. The listing means that U.S. companies like Nvidia are barred from selling their technology to Inspur without a special license. But because Inspur’s subsidiary, Aivres, is based in California and records sales as a U.S. company, it can buy Nvidia chips freely, legal experts said. The shipments went to Speedmatrix, a subsidiary that Megaspeed had set up in Malaysia in early 2024, according to shipment records obtained by ImportGenius, the trade data platform. The registered address for Speedmatrix on the shipping records led to a dilapidated storefront outside Kuala Lumpur, where the sign out front advertised a construction company. Calls by Times reporters to the construction company went unanswered, and no one was inside when a reporter visited the address in late September. Employees at the law firm next door said they rarely saw people in the office. In September 2024, an official with the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the division of the Commerce Department that overseas export controls, visited Megaspeed’s data center in Malaysia to investigate suspicions about how much it was buying. Officials were concerned that Nvidia technology on site was still in boxes, three people familiar with the inspection said. Such behavior arouses suspicions because some companies bypass checks by showing they have the technology before later shipping it elsewhere. U.S. officials suspect that some of the chips may have been sent on to China, the people said, but they do not have conclusive evidence. After the visit, U.S. officials communicated their concerns about Megaspeed to Singaporean and Malaysian authorities, as well as Nvidia, the three people said. The United States has been pressuring those governments to better police data center projects and chip smuggling networks. In February, Singaporean police arrested nine people, including several Chinese-born executives of other technology companies, for making “misleading claims” about the end destination of computer servers that use the A.I. chips. Malaysia said in July that it would require permits for all export and transfers of Nvidia chips. The crackdown has coincided with a stall in Megaspeed’s chip purchases. By late July, trade records indicate that the company had stopped receiving shipments of advanced Nvidia chips, despite expectations that it would buy billions more. Nvidia confirmed Megaspeed had not submitted new orders for months, but did not offer an explanation why. The company was projected to buy as much as $3.2 billion of Nvidia’s highest-performing computers over the next year, according to Morgan Stanley. Those computers are packed with the company’s A.I. chips. A Boom Fueled by China In Singapore and Malaysia, traces of Megaspeed linger in half-empty offices, on corporate documents and behind the fences of advanced A.I. data centers. In a premier office building in Singapore’s sleek central business district, just two employees were present on a recent weekday in Megaspeed’s offices. A door behind a small, staged waiting area gave way to a minimalist white office, with several clusters of empty desks. A human resources manager said she had met few of the firm’s directors, most of whom were based in China and seldom visited Singapore. Most of its clients, she added, are Chinese. She said Ms. Huang had stepped down months earlier because of personal commitments to other businesses. James Tan, who is listed in corporate records as the company’s Singaporean director, is never present, she said. According to corporate ownership documents, Megaspeed is owned by a shell company that Mr. Tan owns. The shell company’s address led to an accounting firm in Singapore, where employees told a Times reporter that they did not know how to reach Mr. Tan. Two hours north, hulking data centers rose over palm oil fields that dotted the Malaysian countryside. Sedenak Tech Park, a complex of data centers with its own ties to China, bristled with cameras and high-tension wires. It was there that U.S. officials found Megaspeed’s inventory still in boxes. In Johor, the Malaysian state across the border from Singapore, Megaspeed’s Malaysian subsidiary, Speedmatrix, has an office on the upper floors of a shopping mall near snack stores and beauty parlors. The office’s windows were obscured by reflective glass and its doors were fitted with fingerprint scanners. When a Times reporter visited, three employees inside did not answer despite repeated knocks. A woman eventually emerged for lunch and identified herself as an administrator. She said she had no contact with her bosses. When asked what the company did, she said, “It’s not clear.” Reporting was contributed by Pei-Lin Wu from Taipei; Berry Wang from Hong Kong; Zunaira Saieed from Kuala Lumpur and Johor; Nicholas Yong from Singapore; and Julian Barnes from Washington.

625e02fe49cf,Intel’s Big Bet: Inside the Chipmaker’s Make-or-Break Factory,"intel, computer chip, manufacturing, computers and the internet, tech industry, asml holding, taiwan semiconductor manufacturing, lip-bu tan, chandler, ariz.","On the desert floor of the Phoenix Valley, Intel has poured more than $20 billion into a four-story manufacturing plant that is the centerpiece of the ailing chipmaker’s comeback bid. Inside the building, known as Fab 52, the company is rolling out a new manufacturing process to make more powerful and efficient computer chips. The process uses the tools from ASML, the Dutch manufacturer of lithography machines , to make Intel’s cutting-edge semiconductors in the United States for the first time in nearly a decade. During a factory visit last month, two of those $250 million machines sat largely idle while ASML engineers in sterilized white bunny suits worked on one. Two trailer-size footprints for additional machines sat empty nearby, a nod to Intel’s hopes it can eventually expand. Intel has recently brought a string of potential customers through the plant in Chandler, Ariz., and pitched them on manufacturing their chips at Fab 52. But analysts say most chip companies want to see whether Intel can succeed in making its own computer chips before asking it to produce their chips for smartphones, artificial intelligence systems and other technologies. The focus on the new facility underscores how critical this moment is to Intel’s future. Once an exemplar of Silicon Valley success, the company has fallen behind competitors as a chip manufacturer and designer. Intel was leapfrogged by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, after it failed to implement ASML technology. And it was dropped from Apple’s laptops after its chips struggled with battery life and performance. As sales declined, Intel churned through leaders. In March, it named Lip-Bu Tan its third chief executive in five years. From his predecessor, he inherited a troubled balance sheet and an audacious strategy to introduce five new production processes in four years while remaking Intel as a manufacturer for other chip designers. Mr. Tan shored up the company’s finances in August when the Trump administration pumped $8.9 billion into the company for 10 percent of its business. The deal made Intel the recipient of one of the largest U.S. government investments in a company since the 2008 financial crisis. The Trump administration made the investment by releasing money promised to Intel under the CHIPS and Science Act, a federal program signed into law in 2022 to provide companies with grants to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. In 2021, as Washington lawmakers were weighing the CHIPS Act, Intel committed to investing $32 billion in two new factories, Fab 52 and Fab 62, on its Ocotillo campus in Arizona. It later received federal funding to support the project. Now, Mr. Tan is focused on executing on the second part of Intel’s strategy: its technical turnaround. At an event last month for a few hundred technology analysts and members of the news media, Sachin Katti, Intel’s chief technology officer, acknowledged the stakes. He said the new manufacturing process, which Intel calls 18a, and the new computer chip, which it calls Panther Lake, are “foundational to our future.” “We are of course making two really big bets here,” he said. He added that the manufacturing efforts were “mission critical, not just for Intel but for our country.” Intel became the world’s dominant chipmaker by staggering the way it adopted new technology, said Ben Bajarin, the principal analyst at Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. The company typically developed a new manufacturing process to etch silicon with billions of small transistors that are slimmer than a human hair. It then perfected that process on an older generation of chips before using it to produce chips designed with new features. But this time, Intel is trying to make manufacturing and design leaps simultaneously. The 18a process uses the ASML tools to produce chips that stack transistors , so they take up less space. It also routes power through the backside of a chip rather than the top, where data and power collided in the past. The result is a denser, more energy-efficient chip, the company said, capable of piling 10,000 sheets of silicon on top of one another in a stack thinner than a sheet of paper. Intel said its Panther Lake series of chips would allow laptops to run A.I. systems and do all-day computing. It will start shipping the chips early next year. The company has enough faith in the process that it is moving production of its newest chips to its own factories rather than relying on TSMC, which it turned to after its previous processes faltered. But the changes create more opportunities for something to go wrong, Mr. Bajarin said, which is especially risky in a process where a particle of dust can destroy a chip and lead to financial losses. “The product has to be good, and the process has to be good,” Mr. Bajarin said. If all those things happen, he said, the industry will “know that Intel can again fire on all cylinders.” Intel’s success is far from guaranteed. Late last year, it informed some customers that its 18a process was lagging behind rivals. At the time, TSMC was producing 30 percent of its leading-edge chips, known as 2 nanometer chips, without any flaws, while Intel’s process was producing fewer than 10 percent of its 18a chips without flaws. At the two-day event last month, Intel executives declined to comment on the percentage of chips it was making without any flaws at Fab 52. The number of chips that don’t work won’t become clear until the company makes financial reports next year, analysts say. By bringing some production back in-house from TSMC, the company could save money and improve its profits, said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech research firm. It’s also a proving ground to show big producers of chips like Nvidia or Apple, which exclusively rely on TSMC, that Intel could produce their semiconductors. Intel doesn’t make enough of its own chips to fill the Fab 52 plant, Mr. Moorhead said. But if it can persuade others in the tech industry that its process works, it could buy more ASML machines and put more of its factory space to work. “It’s like a shopping center that needs an anchor tenant,” Mr. Moorhead said. “If it can find one, it would be game on.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/technology/intel-chip-factory-fab52.html,Technology,BBC,By Tripp Mickle and Loren Elliott,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/08visualUploader-99218-cover/08visualUploader-99218-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T13:00:11+00:00,bf0076682b182d17e1489b6808cb5ad3fd14daa7
e0b1e2c7c041,ChatGPT’s Platform Play + a Trillion-Dollar GPU Empire + the Queen of Slop,"science, openai, artificial intelligence, internal-open-access-audio","casey newton My favorite moment from dev day was when a guy came up to us. We were eating snacks there at a table, and this guy comes up and he’s like, are you Casey from “Hard Fork,” and starts just talking about how big a fan he is, and you at one point are like, yeah, he’s also on “Hard Fork.” And the guy starts laughing like he doesn’t believe. He’s just like, oh, that’s a good one, jokester, and then proceeds to take a selfie with you. I’ve never been happier. Yeah, that was a great moment in “Hard Fork” history where I tried to — I pointed out the other host of the show, and he was just like, what are you talking about? He was like, you’re out of your mind. What a good bit. Another classic “Hard Fork” bit, me pretending there’s another host on the show. [MUSIC PLAYING] kevin roose I’m Kevin Roose, tech columnist at “The New York Times.” casey newton I’m Casey Newton from Platformer. kevin roose And this is “Hard Fork.” casey newton This week, we visit OpenAI Developer Day, and ChatGPT is eating the web. Then, OpenAI makes a huge deal with AMD. We’ll tell you about the trillion dollar battle over AI chips. And finally, slop queen Katie Notopoulos is here to talk about Sora and all the terrible videos she’s making of me and Kevin, and she will pay for her crimes. [MUSIC PLAYING] kevin roose Well, Casey, it was another one of those weeks where OpenAI kind of swallowed the entire news cycle. So you and I took a field trip on Monday of this week to Fort Mason in San Francisco, where OpenAI was having its third annual dev day, its big developer conference, and we both got the chance to go. casey newton Yeah, this was the third dev day and the second one we were invited to after they didn’t invite us reporter types last year, but this time they had a lot to say. kevin roose Yes, so let’s talk about what we saw there, and all of the many things that OpenAI has been working on. But first, since this is a segment about OpenAI and AI in general, we should make our disclosures. Mine is that The New York Times Company is suing OpenAI and Microsoft over alleged copyright violations. casey newton And my boyfriend works at Anthropic. kevin roose OK, so Monday morning we show up at Fort Mason. This was a big event. Something like 1,500 people I heard were there. And, Casey, how would you describe the vibe of OpenAI’s dev day? casey newton Well, I have to say, first of all, Kevin, that it was giving me flashbacks because it was nine years ago that I was in the same building when Facebook announced that it would let developers build bots into Facebook Messenger, and Mark Zuckerberg stood on stage and said, no one will ever have to call 1-800-FLOWERS ever again, which turned out to be not true. kevin roose That’s right. It was the same exact building. I forgot that it was at Fort Mason, too. My God. casey newton It was. And then nine years later, the. The faces are different. The company is different, but the promise feels the same. kevin roose Yes, so Fort Mason is this big, indoor outdoor, like multiplex. And one building, they’ve got talks going on. Another building, they’ve got demos. I walked around the demo building. They had a Sora cinema where you could go into a dark theater with a movie screen and sit on very comfortable lounge chairs and watch like 30 different six-second clips of AI-generated Sora videos. So that made me feel something. Oh, they had a phone booth station. Did you do these? casey newton I saw it, but I didn’t go in. kevin roose Well, lucky you then, because when you were in there got connected to ChatGPT, and you could just talk to it, or you could play, like, a trivia game. I got one of the trivia questions wrong. Very embarrassing. casey newton What was the question? kevin roose Well, maybe I’ll try this one on you. casey newton OK. kevin roose OK. What is the branch of AI that teaches computers to learn from their own experiences? casey newton Computers to learn from their own experiences. kevin roose Are you typing this into ChatGPT? casey newton I’m going to say machine learning. kevin roose OK. Congratulations. You win. I said reinforcement learning, which was a little too in the weeds. casey newton That was great. If you’re just listening to the podcast, I just did what I call a full Cluely, which is somebody asks you a question, and then you just sort of surreptitiously type it into the computer while no one’s looking. So anyways. kevin roose Yes. Yeah. So OpenAI, let’s just tick through some of the stuff they announced or said from the stage. The first thing that Sam Altman said during his keynote was that ChatGPT has been growing like crazy. It has more than 800 million weekly users now. He also announced that the number of tokens that OpenAI is processing through its API have gone up to six billion tokens per minute on the API. That’s up from 300 million tokens per minute in 2023. So big growth for them. casey newton And I just want to say that it seems like every time there’s a hot new startup, they have to invent a very impressive sounding metric. And the human mind has absolutely no idea of understanding what it means. It’s like, oh, there’s a big number, and now it’s an even bigger number. What should I take away from that? I don’t know. kevin roose Yeah, so in addition to those new growth numbers, Sam also announced that Sora 2, the new video generation model, and GPT-5 Pro are coming to the API, along with a new, smaller voice model. So developers are going to be able to build using those things. They showed off some examples. One of them was that Mattel has apparently started using Sora 2 to prototype or mock up new designs for toys. They showed off a video of that. They also announced a bunch of new stuff for what they’re calling Agent Kit, which is basically the way that developers can build AI agents using this drag and drop interface. They showed off some examples of that. But then the big thing that I think we’re going to spend most of our time talking about was this announcement that apps are coming to ChatGPT. So, Casey, explain what Sam Altman and other OpenAI executives said about that. casey newton Yeah, and this really is where this story connects to that Facebook event that we went to almost a decade ago. OpenAI is not the only company that’s tried this. There have been others in addition to Facebook. But what OpenAI wants you to do is when you are using ChatGPT to increasingly bring in the other things that you might do around the web. And so to start with, you’ll be able to tag into your conversations, Expedia, Zillow, Figma, Target, Spotify. I did a little test the day that it came out, where I built a playlist in my own Spotify through ChatGPT. And the basic idea, Kevin, is that ChatGPT is the new front door to the internet. It no longer starts at Facebook. It no longer starts at Google. You just go directly to ChatGPT, and whatever you want to get done, you can do right from that box. kevin roose Yeah, so this is something that I think is of a natural consequence of ChatGPT kind of becoming more generally useful for people. Also, developers are very eager to get in front of those 800 million weekly ChatGPT users. And so they have essentially created this link between other apps and websites and ChatGPT. And we should maybe explain a little bit about how that works, because it’s not like ChatGPT is going off and searching Zillow or Expedia or target.com on your behalf. It kind of — when you tag in one of these apps, it sort of opens this like window within ChatGPT. So you’re still on ChatGPT, but you kind have this little sub window where you can do things. So what’s an example of something that you can do other than creating Spotify playlists? casey newton Sure. So one example that they showed off is, hey, I’m getting ready to move to Pittsburgh. I need to buy a house. And so Zillow just showed a bunch of its own listings within ChatGPT for you to browse inside that experience. kevin roose Right. So it’s not just search for a home in Pittsburgh that’s for sale for me. It’s like I want one that’s four bedrooms and three bathrooms and under this price, and it’s got a yard. You could also have it go through your history of ChatGPT conversations and say, based on where I work and the kinds of things I like to do, find some houses in a neighborhood that you think would be good for me, and it could presumably go do that. casey newton Yeah. And this is the real promise of what OpenAI is doing here, is that they will find a way to safely share some amount of the things that ChatGPT knows about you with the other apps and services on the web in a way that lets you have these very personalized experiences, in a way that lets ChatGPT get things done for you on your behalf. And they think if they can do that, then they really do become the new homepage for the web. kevin roose So that’s why they’re doing it. I assume this is also going to be a way for them to monetize ChatGPT. If you are going on to Target and buying things through ChatGPT, presumably OpenAI will get a cut of that. But Casey, you wrote a newsletter this week about how you think this is similar to a play that Facebook tried to make many years ago around this platform strategy. And you noted that did not go entirely well for Facebook. So maybe just outline your argument here. casey newton Yeah, so if you remember back in the early 2010s, Facebook was growing really rapidly. It had become the homepage for a lot of people, where a lot of people were sort of starting their day on the internet. And at some point, Facebook gets the idea, hey, why don’t we let the other developers build experiences on our platform. We’ll share some of the things that we know about our users, such as the pages that they’ve liked and maybe some of their contact information. In fact, we’ll even share all of their friends with you and their friends’ contact information. And this just becomes a bonanza for developers. There’s so much personal information that is now available to them. They get in there, they start building things, and Facebook figures out it can make a lot of money doing this and start selling this virtual currency called Facebook credits. And if you want to have a big app on Facebook, like Farmville — remember, Kevin — well, Kevin lost so much money on Farmville back in the day. kevin roose I had to file for bankruptcy in Facebook credits because I spent too much on Farmville. casey newton That’s right. But Facebook took a 30 percent cut of all of the Facebook credit revenue. And at one point, Kevin, Facebook disclosed that Zynga, Farmville’s developer, was alone 12 percent of its revenue as a company. So there was a moment where this worked really well. kevin roose And then what happened? casey newton Well, you may remember another company called Cambridge Analytica. kevin roose Yes, I’ve heard of this one. casey newton So Cambridge Analytica was a company that became famous after the 2016 US presidential election because they were one of the companies that was hoovering up all of that personal data. And it eventually created a huge scandal because it was revealed that they had been using all of this data in an effort to swing the election toward Donald Trump. Now, I think the idea that they actually could have swung the election using Facebook data is dramatically overstated, but it did draw a lot of attention to the extremely loose rules that Facebook had around user privacy, and Facebook wound up having to take a bunch of steps to try to rein that sort of thing in. And in fact, weird little asterisks detail about Cambridge Analytica, by the time it became a scandal, Facebook had actually already locked down the platform a couple years earlier because it suspected that something like this might someday happen. kevin roose Yeah, and I really am glad that you wrote about this and drew that connection, because I think in this case, ChatGPT as a platform is actually riskier than Facebook as a platform for the simple reason that people share very intimate things with ChatGPT. If you get someone’s Facebook data, you can know who their friends are, what kinds of posts they make, maybe some things about their potential shopping behavior. But with ChatGPT, if you’re giving that data to an outside developer, that might include transcripts of therapy sessions that you’ve had with ChatGPT, things that you’ve asked for advice on. It might include very intimate, personal details, and now all of a sudden, Zillow or Expedia or Target has that, and you have really no way of knowing what they’re going to do with that. So in ChatGPT’s case, this is like potentially quite serious if there were to ever be some kind of a data breach. casey newton Yeah I mean, let me give you an example, Kevin. Let’s say that I’m using ChatGPT, and I decide I want to send you a birthday card for “Hard Fork’s” third birthday. kevin roose That’d be nice. casey newton And it draws on all of the conversations that I’ve had with ChatGPT over the years. And it writes a birthday card, and it says, hey, Kevin, look, I know things aren’t great between us. I know that we have a lot of fights, but I also want you to know that Casey has been working on this in therapy. And here’s actually what his therapist told him this week. Happy birthday and best of luck. And then imagine it just sends you that birthday card. I would have so much egg on my face, and I’d be digging out of that one for a year. So that’s the kind of risk we’re talking about. kevin roose Yes, huge risks. Risks that could blow up a podcast. casey newton Yeah, absolutely. kevin roose So did they address not this specific issue, but the larger issue of data sharing at this event? casey newton They did. So Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, who’s been on the show before, said we are going to make it so that ChatGPT shares the minimum necessary amount of information needed to make the transaction. So I can imagine that in the case where I’m creating a Spotify playlist, it’s probably just sending whatever I put in the box. Make me a fun playlist for the “Hard Fork” third birthday party. Now, that sounds good when I say it, but I should note it sort of handwaves its way past the details. Because ChatGPT also has a memory feature that I imagine will eventually be exposed in some way to some of these developers. And basically what OpenAI has said is, yeah, we’re going to be really careful, and we’re not going to do anything bad. And I believe that is their intention, but we’re going to have to keep an eye on them. kevin roose Yeah, I mean, I don’t think this is a hypothetical. I want to try to connect my ChatGPT to Canva, one of these developers, who have created these ChatGPT apps. And you get a little pop up before you connect your app that says, among other things, that attackers may attempt to use ChatGPT to access your data in the app, and it also requires you to confirm that you understand that data from your ChatGPT account, including from conversations and memories, may be shared with these developers. So you really are placing a lot of trust in OpenAI and the developers that it has hand-picked to be able to build these apps by giving them access to your ChatGPT history. casey newton Yeah, and for that reason, if you’re like, I think this feature is not for me right now, I think that is a completely rational choice to take. There is no reason that you have to leap headlong into this before you’ve let, you know, more privacy adventurous people put it through its paces. kevin roose Yeah, use Zillow the old fashioned way. So I’m interested in the privacy implications here, but I’m also interested in the business implications because one thing I am interested to see and keep an eye on is whether the ChatGPT apps become sort of privileged within ChatGPT. I can imagine, for example, that if you are looking up real estate information on ChatGPT, it might want to show you things from Zillow rather than Redfin or another site, because Zillow is the one that kind of has the deal with ChatGPT and with OpenAI. So are you thinking about that? casey newton Yes, absolutely. So this was the question that I asked of the OpenAI executives during the Q&A session that you and I both attended. I guess you just kind of tuned out during my question. But basically, what Sam Altman told me was, hey, look, it’s important that people trust ChatGPT. He said, quote, “If we break that or take payment for something, we shouldn’t have, instead of showing you what we think is best, that would clearly destroy that relationship very fast. So we’re hyper aware of the need to be careful.” Greg Brockman, who is OpenAI’s president, added, “I do want to say that I think there’s also a lot of nuance there because sometimes we don’t know what the best product is, right? We have a principle of really trying to serve the user. And then what does that mean in all these specific contexts?” So what I took that to mean was you have the angel on the shoulder of OpenAI — I’m not saying that’s Sam Altman, but there’s a kind of a metaphorical angel sitting on the company’s shoulder saying, hey, be really, really careful. Do the right thing. As Google used to say back in the day about this exact dynamic, don’t be evil. And then you have the devil on the shoulder seam, I do want to say that I also think there’s a lot of nuance in this space. kevin roose Right. Us, take money? Why would we do that? casey newton It’s nuanced, Kevin. It’s a very nuanced question. kevin roose Very nuanced. casey newton Very nuanced. kevin roose OK, that’s the scene of dev day. But Casey, do you feel like you learned anything about OpenAI or its ambitions at this event? casey newton I think this was just another example of OpenAI showing us how ambitious that it is. Silicon Valley is not a town lacking in ambition. But when I saw everything that OpenAI is trying to do here, it was just another moment to say, wow, these people are really going for it. Like, they really do actually want to take over the entire web, and they’re telling you that to your face, and they’re showing you how they are doing it. So for me, that was kind of a wake-up call. How about you? kevin roose Yeah, I think that’s right. I mean, it’s very clear that OpenAI sees ChatGPT as more than a chatbot. It sees it as kind of a new operating system for everything that you might want to do. I also saw some people comparing it to a super app, like WeChat in China, where you can have one app that controls a lot of your online activities. So I don’t know whether this platform strategy will work. I think we’ve pointed out today some reasons that it might not, but I think the signal that it sends to investors and developers and users and the rest of the internet is like, we are coming for you. We are not resting on our laurels. We are not resting on the ways that people are currently using ChatGPT. We want to take the rest of the internet and shove it inside what we’re doing. casey newton Yeah. kevin roose All right, so one more thing we need to talk about from dev day, because this was truly the most bizarre part of the entire event was this fireside chat between Sam Altman and Jony Ive. Jony Ive, of course, is the famous former Apple designer who made the iPhone and the iPod and basically everything that Apple built its success on over the years, who has now partnered with OpenAI and been acquired by OpenAI and is building a new hardware product with OpenAI. And so I was excited for this because I thought, oh, maybe we’re going to get some details about this hardware product in this, 30-minute fireside chat. And, Casey, what we heard instead was a bunch of words signifying nothing. casey newton It was GPT-2 level is how I would describe it. Like sentences were started and not finished. And by the end of this session, we truly had not learned one thing about what OpenAI is building or how they were building it. kevin roose It was incredible. I will just read you a quote from Jony Ive during this session. This was when he was talking about what they’re building. He said, “The clues and the pointers all exist, and it’s just trying to sort of them together. But there has — it will be — it will be ideas. It will be a vision for what makes sense. And I think we’re only going to arrive at that if we are very curious and light on our feet.” casey newton Do you remember the Miss America pageant where they asked her some complicated question about geopolitics and she just kind of had to vamp for 30 seconds until the end of the question? That was how I felt watching Jony Ive get asked questions by Sam Altman, which of course, is so funny because its not like Sam Altman is Kara Swisher up there really putting the screws to this guy. Presumably, all of these questions had been like negotiated in advance. And look, I get it. If you don’t want to tell us exactly what the device is and when its going to go on sale, like it’s OK to tease us a little bit. But I truly don’t understand the point of having everyone just sit there for 30 minutes waiting for you to say something, and then all you get is him being like, craft is the essence of tools. And you’re just like, what are we doing here? So I have a message to the OpenAI community on the subject of your heart. I’ve said this one time before on the show. I try to reserve this for very special situations. I think we’re in it now. When it comes to AI hardware, OpenAI, I’m saying this, ship it or zip it. I truly do not want to hear one more of these fireside chats where we ruminate on the nature of design. I want to see frickin’ specs, people. Get me the specs or stop talking. kevin roose Yes, this was the closest thing I’ve ever seen to human-generated slop. It was just a bunch of tokens. casey newton It was — it was too many tokens. kevin roose It was too many tokens. When we come back, OpenAI’s other big news this week a trillion-dollar gamble that is propping up the entire economy. [MUSIC PLAYING] casey newton Well, Kevin, while you and I were at OpenAI Developer Day learning about everything that’s coming to ChatGPT, OpenAI was arguably making much bigger news outside the conference. kevin roose Yes, they were moving markets, the entire stock market. Not the entire stock market, but a couple companies. casey newton And this was one where I was focused on the things in front of me. And when I got out of Developer Day, I thought, I really need to get up to speed on everything that is going on with chips. And whenever I have that feeling, I think one, oh, no, I have to talk about chips again, but two, can Kevin Roose, our resident in-house chips expert, smart me up? kevin roose I would say — thank you. That’s very kind. But I would say I am an aspiring chips expert. I do not know everything there is to know about the semiconductor industry or GPUs, but I aspire to learn much more. And actually, I took a big step in that direction over last weekend at The Curve, this other AI conference we both attended, when I happened to find myself like in the middle of a scrum of like chips guys, who were talking about chips, and I understood like 40 percent of what they were saying. They were talking about, HBM and EUVs and gas turbines and geothermal. And I was just like transfixed because all the AI guys have had to become chips guys. And I am saying right here on this podcast that I will, by the end of 2025, be a chips guy. casey newton That’s great to hear. And I think we can make some big strides in that direction this week because OpenAI made some big deals. I need to understand what’s happening. And so we’re going to pilot a new segment that we’re calling what the hell is going on with all these chips exactly. kevin roose That’s a little unwieldy. We might want to tighten that one. casey newton So let’s get started with this deal with AMD. Tell me exactly what OpenAI is up to here. kevin roose So we talked a couple weeks ago about OpenAI’s big deal with NVIDIA, who is the leading chip manufacturer. They make the best and most expensive and highest quality chips for training AI systems. But the number two player in that market, the GPU market, is AMD, who’s NVIDIA’s competitor and seen as a kind of distant second place in the GPU arms race. casey newton This is like the Pepsi of chips. kevin roose It’s the Pepsi of chips. Exactly. So this week, OpenAI and AMD announced a major multi-billion dollar deal where OpenAI is going to buy a bunch of GPUs from AMD and put them in their data centers over the next few years, and in return, they are going to get some AMD stock. This could eventually become up to 10 percent of the company at a penny per share, so basically, free stock or stock at a very, very low price compared to what it trades for today. And this will all play out over the course of a number of years. They will start with AMD’s newest chip in 2026, and they are going to try to buy a total of six gigawatts worth of AMD chips, which is a little more than half of what they are going to get from NVIDIA in the terms of that deal. NVIDIA’s deal was for 10 gigawatts worth of GPUs. So the big picture here is that OpenAI is doing these deals with many, many chip providers and infrastructure providers. And if you add it all up, just the announcements from AMD and NVIDIA and a handful of other companies that they’ve struck deals with, they are building a trillion-dollar GPU empire over the next few years. That is their stated ambition and plan. And now they have the deals in place to do that. And I don’t know if you remember a few months ago when there was this reporting about how Sam Altman was trying to raise $7 trillion for a chip company, and everyone kind of said, ha ha ha, that’s such a crazy number. That would be some huge multiple of the total lifetime earnings of OpenAI. Well, it’s not $7 trillion. But now they have pledged to spend roughly $1 trillion over the next few years. casey newton Well, you know when I got into business, they told me the first trillion is always the hardest. kevin roose They do say that. casey newton Yeah. Something about me, Kevin, is that I didn’t until very recently understand what a gigawatt was and any practical terms. My understanding, based on the reading that I’ve done, is a gigawatt of energy is about what is produced by a nuclear reactor. And OpenAI is now committing to infrastructure that will require the equivalent energy of 20 nuclear reactors. kevin roose Yes, it is a huge amount of energy, and that’s a whole separate discussion. It’s one thing to buy the GPUs. It’s another thing to be able to turn them on. And so we’ll talk more about that, I’m sure, in a later episode. But there is a simultaneous race going on to lock up the energy that is going to be required to power all of these millions of GPUs. casey newton OK, so maybe this is an obvious question. But tell me just in basic terms, what do OpenAI and AMD each get out of this deal that they just made? kevin roose So essentially, the deal structure goes like this. OpenAI is going to buy a bunch of chips from AMD. It’s going to use those chips to train and power its models. And in exchange for those purchases, AMD is going to give OpenAI the rights to buy very cheap stock in AMD. So when they reach a gigawatt of compute that they’ve purchased from AMD, they will get some allocation of stock in AMD, which could be worth many billions of dollars. What OpenAI is doing is signaling to AMD, hey, if you guys go build a bunch of really good GPUs, we will buy them from you. And the way that they are getting this financing is in the form of a stock essentially rebate on that purchase. casey newton So let me see if I have this straight, because when I look at this, I see OpenAI gets access to a bunch of infrastructure, plus a financial stake in the chip maker. AMD gets a huge new customer and ensures a lot of future demand. That just kind of looks like a win-win to me for them. Is there anything I’m missing there? kevin roose So the other thing that’s really important here is that OpenAI and AMD are going to have a collaborative partnership in designing not just these chips, but the software that runs on these chips. So one of the big of hurdles that AMD has had in competing with NVIDIA is that NVIDIA’s software, which is called Cuda, is seen as much, much better for training AI models than AMD’s software, which is called ROCm. So basically, OpenAI, as a result of this partnership, will have an incentive to make AMD’s software just as good as NVIDIA’s software. And so this could actually help AMD in that way, too, where they’re making these chips, they’re selling them to OpenAI. But also, OpenAI is helping to write the software that runs on these chips, thereby making these AMD chips more compelling to other AI developers, who want to build models using them. Does that make sense? casey newton OK, yes. So this gets to the second big question that I have for you today, which is how is this deal connected to the other chips and infrastructure deals that OpenAI has made recently? When we talked about the NVIDIA deal on the show, I said that I had heard some speculation that one reason that NVIDIA wanted to make the deal that it did was to discourage OpenAI from going out and making a bunch of other deals with other chip companies. In hindsight, that seems like a very silly thing that I said, because OpenAI is clearly going to make a deal with whoever it can. So tell me as best as you how all these deals interrelate. Or is it as simple as OpenAI needs more infrastructure than any one company can provide and so it’s just going to go out and lock up as much of it as it can? kevin roose Yeah, I think that’s more the explanation. I don’t actually think this is about crowding anyone else out of the market, any AI maker or chip maker. I think this is just them saying, we are going to need a lot of GPUs, more than any one company can make, and probably more than any of these companies are planning to make currently. So they’re also trying to encourage these companies to up their production to meet this incredible demand. And it is always good to have more than one supplier. You can play them off each other and maybe increase the competition between them. And so I think OpenAI is just kind of spreading its bets a little bit here. But they do believe that they are going to need all these chips and many more. Essentially, what they have been saying is we are compute constrained right now. We have a lot of products that we’re building, things that we want to do that we can’t do because we don’t have enough compute for it. And so they are trying to lock in as much compute as they can and then build out their data centers and find the energy to power all of this and then use their big clusters to train models that hopefully will take us all the way to AGI. That’s the idea anyway. casey newton Yeah, at OpenAI Developer Day this week, Greg Brockman, the company’s president, said, you don’t even know the products that we haven’t released because we do not have the compute to power them. So apparently, there’s a bunch of services OpenAI is sitting on, and maybe some of these deals will get them closer to releasing them, for better and for worse. So let me now ask a question that is considered extremely impolite in Silicon Valley, and it’s the sort of thing that might get you asked to leave a party. How is OpenAI going to pay for all of this? kevin roose It’s a great question because they do not have $1 trillion, I’ll tell you that, lying around in their bank account. They have not given a ton of details about how they plan to pay for this, but essentially, they’re going to go out. They’re going to raise a bunch of money, as they have been doing for the past several years, and they are going to use that money to make these deals and buy these chips. Greg Brockman told Bloomberg television this week that they look at equity and debt in all kinds of ways to pay for it. They also plan to pay for this by generating more revenue through ChatGPT and their other products. So when you look at the $1 trillion stated cost of all this, they’re going to try to cobble that together through a combination of new fundraising, maybe some more vendor financing, like what they got from NVIDIA and just the revenue that they’re making from their products. casey newton Also, Kevin, once again, at Developer Day, when asked about this, Sam Altman said something to the effect of we may have to come up with some new kinds of financial instruments to pay for this. And I will say that usually the point in the bubble where people start talking about the novel financial instruments that they need to create to finance their ambitions is the point where I get nervous. kevin roose Totally. I mean, the worry here is about all of these financial instruments and all these many hundreds of billions of dollars of commitments is that OpenAI is essentially becoming too big to fail, that they are so tied up with so many huge companies that if they were to fizzle out, or their newest model were to be a flop, or they were to somehow reach the end of their scaling paradigm, that all of this would come crashing down and create ripple effects throughout the US economy. I don’t think that’s the most possible outcome here, but I do think that all of this circularity and all these sort of interchanging deals and flows of money do make me a bit more nervous that something like a recession could cause not just one of these companies to collapse, but could cause systemic effects throughout the AI industry, which is like propping up the entire US economy at this point. So it does feel like we have reached a point where the AI companies must deliver on the promise of AGI, or else we are all in a pretty bad situation. casey newton Or if not, deliver on the promise of AGI, at least continue to make services that other companies are willing to spend billions of dollars on because they feel like it’s making their workers more productive. kevin roose That’s true. It could just be that the models never get any better. And just the increased adoption of the models powers this like revenue flywheel that results in all of this going well for everyone. But I do think there’s an implicit understanding among the investors in these companies that this is all building toward something that will eventually create trillions of dollars in economic value, that will not just be like a kind of across the board, incremental step up, but that it will be transformational, that it will be like electricity, and that all of the investments that are going into this, even at these shocking prices, will be paid back many times over because this technology will change everything. And so I think there’s a way to make the math work, even if they don’t reach the machine god superintelligence. But it’s a lot easier to sell the vision if the pot of gold that you are saying is at the end of this rainbow is, in fact, like trillions of dollars and an entirely new sort of society. casey newton All right, Kevin, so as we start to wrap up here, I want to know what the larger implications are for all of these deals. What does this mean for companies that are not OpenAI, that also want gigawatts of power and as many GPUs as they can get their hands on now that OpenAI seems to be locking up so much future supply? kevin roose So I think other AI companies are going to have to do their own versions of these deals. They’re going to have to bid on chips essentially in a seller’s market. I know Anthropic and Google and all these companies are spending billions and billions of dollars trying to lock up future chip supply. But I think the big implication here is that we are just as a country, making a gigantic leveraged bet on AI. I want to read you a quote that I saw this week from an analyst at Bernstein, Stacy Rasgon, who wrote that Sam Altman now, quote, “has the power to crash the global economy for a decade or take us all to the promised land. And right now, we don’t know which is in the cards.” When Wall Street analysts start talking like that, you know that something big is happening. And I’m sure you’ve seen all these diagrams. There was a great one in Bloomberg the other day. There was another one in the Financial Times recently, showing just the various interconnections between all of the players in the AI ecosystem who are selling chips to each other and buying chips from each other and investing in each other and lending to each other, and it creates this kind of circularity that I think worries a lot of investors, who think that this could all come crashing down together if and when the AI bubble pops. casey newton I’ll give you another one, Kevin. This week, a Harvard economist named Jason Furman estimated that investments in data centers and information processing software accounted for 92 percent of the US’s GDP growth in the first half of this year. So, according to my rough calculations, that’s most of the US GDP growth. kevin roose Yeah. And we should also say this is not just OpenAI. Elon Musk’s xAI also reportedly is nearing a deal to raise billions of dollars, including from NVIDIA. So they are doing just as many financial transactions around trying to pay for these massive infrastructure build outs that they’re doing as OpenAI is. But this is also an area where I think OpenAI has a strategic advantage. And that strategic advantage is named Sam Altman. Sam Altman is famously talented at fundraising. Many people think he is one of the greatest fundraisers in Silicon Valley history. And so he has been canvassing the globe looking for giant pools of money that he can kind of suck up and use to fund OpenAI’s ambitions. And I would not necessarily bet on Sam Altman in every case, but I would say that if the question is, can he continue to raise money to fund OpenAI’s growth, I think I would feel uncomfortable betting against that, because he has such a track record of being able to raise massive amounts of money. casey newton Yeah, I also would not bet against him. kevin roose OK, Casey, let me ask you a question. You’ve been asking the questions here. What would it take me to fully chip pill you to convince you that what is going on with GPUs and semiconductors and data centers right now is the most important story in the world? casey newton A huge chip=related disaster. And I’m not even kidding, because while I think it is a public service to tell people how much money is being invested and how interconnected all of these companies are and how crazy it would be if all of this does pay off. For the moment, everything is just kind of working. And given the, let’s say, the many crises we have in this world right now, I just tend to not get too wrapped up in the stuff that basically just looks like capitalism proceeding apace. Now, that said, I understand that all the numbers here are unprecedented, which I do think is fun to talk about is, why we’re talking about it this week. But if you really want to get me hooked, something’s got to go terribly wrong in one of these data centers, Kevin. kevin roose I’m envisioning — do you remember the scene in “The Big Short” where Margot Robbie is explaining mortgage-backed securities in a bathtub? casey newton Yeah. kevin roose I’m just having a vision of someone equally attractive to you, explaining like collateralized GPUs and warrant financing. And maybe that’s how we can get you interested. casey newton All right, let’s see what John Cena’s doing later. Call your agent, John. So what happens next here, Kevin? What should I keep my eye on if I am trying to become more chip-pilled like you, my good friend? kevin roose So becoming chip-pilled, I am learning, is just the first step in the journey of becoming infrastructure-pilled. Because not only are these companies doing big deals to lock up the GPUs, they are also doing big deals to lock up the energy and the physical space to power these chips in these giant data centers. They are locking up contracts with skilled electricians and cooling specialists. There’s now sort of a market — I was having a conversation with someone recently who described the boom in skilled electricians for these data centers who are now flying all over the country making just gobs and gobs of money. They compared it to the fracking boom when you had these riggers and drillers who would go up to North Dakota for a month a year and make a ton of money. They said, this is basically what electricians who work on these data centers are doing now. So I expect there to be a massive boom in not just the GPUs that power the models, but the power supplies and the data centers and the cooling systems, and the literal energy, like the natural gas and oil that power the electrical grids in the states where these data centers are going up. I expect that the AI companies are going to be doing lots of deals in those industries as well. casey newton All right. Well, I feel like I’ve already exhausted all of the chip-related puns that I would normally use to end a segment on previous episodes. So I guess I’ll just say the segment has made me hungry for guacamole. kevin roose You know what they call the end of a segment about chips? casey newton What’s that? kevin roose A chip clip. casey newton Perfect. [MUSIC PLAYING] kevin roose When we come back, we’ll slop and smell the roses with Katie Notopoulos. Well, Casey, last week, we talked about Sora 2, the video generation model from OpenAI. And all of the magical slop it was being used to create. And ever since then, the response to Sora 2 and its slop generations has gotten a lot more polarized. casey newton It has Kevin because on one hand, this week it hit number one in the US App Store. As of our recording this week, it is still the top free app. And on the other hand, a lot of copyright holders said, excuse me, you’re doing what with Sonic the Hedgehog? kevin roose Yes, not many happy folks in Hollywood about this app. Talent agencies and TV and film studios have been making various statements and trying to get their copyrighted materials pulled down off the app. OpenAI has actually made some changes to what it will generate and what it won’t. And we’ve even started to see YouTube creators like Mr. Beast weighing in and expressing concerns about how video generating AI models could eventually impact their revenue. casey newton Yeah, this I’ll tell you. I’m seeing many more big creators on YouTube starting to reckon with this. Casey Naistat also had a great video about this subject, and on one hand, Casey is obviously very concerned about what the rise of slop means for his livelihood. On the other hand, he used Sora in some really creative ways for this video, which, to me, speaks to the real tension here, which is that this does seem to create a real economic threat to a lot of people. And on the other hand, it does do something creatively interesting. And so today, Kevin, we want to talk to somebody who is doing something pretty creatively interesting with Sora. And that would include doing creatively interesting things with us, or at least our digital likenesses. kevin roose Yes, it’s time for some slop accountability on this show. Today, we are bringing in Katie Notopoulos. She’s a senior correspondent for Business Insider covering tech and culture, and she is also a beloved internet troll. She’s been making many, many videos specifically trolling the two of us, but also other tech reporters. And when I open up my Sora feed now, it is half Sam Altman and the other half Katie Notopoulos. casey newton Yeah, if you’re not familiar with Katie, her previous pranks include when threads launch, pretending that she was the editor-in-chief of the app, and managing to convince a mainstream publications that this was true. They reported on her firing, which never happened because she didn’t have the job. She also posted some of the most hilarious fake engagement bits on threads that I’ve ever seen. And so when Sora came along, I knew she would be doing something inappropriate with it. It just hadn’t occurred to me that would involve my face and yours. So today we’ve invited her on to talk about her Sora creations, the backlash to AI-generated video slop, and where she thinks this is all going. [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Notopoulos, welcome to “Hard Fork.” katie notopoulos Thank you so much for having me. casey newton Well, Katie, I always pay close attention to your work because you are usually having more fun on the social networks that I cover than anyone else is. And Sora, it seems, is no exception. You recently wrote an article titled, “Oink Oink! I’m a little piggy for Sora 2’s AI slop.” Tell us about what turned you into such a little piggy. katie notopoulos I will say that this really was the first AI experience where I was like, oh, I love this, I’m having fun. And the first day or two that I got access to it, I could not stop making videos. It was an amazing social, weird experience. I loved it. I was having so much fun. And I went in thinking it was not going to be cool and not going to be fun. In fact, I literally had an entire article drafted for the day that Sora opened. That was about, this is a terrible idea because they had just announced, oh, there’s going to be a new social app with a AI video social feed. And I was like, that stinks. I thought it going to be like the Meta vibes. I was like, this is a terrible idea. No one wants this. It stinks, it’s awful, blah, blah, blah. I had to scrap the whole thing. It I was like, wait, no, this is awesome. I love it. casey newton I love that you pre-write your internet takes like a Supreme Court reporter who has to do one for one result and one for another. I love this you just have draft folder full of like discarded tech takes. kevin roose Yeah, other people write obituaries in advance and Katie is prewriting slop good and slop bad. katie notopoulos It was supposed to be based on that there had been a report the day before that it actually opened up that they. And I didn’t know that it was going to launch the next day. I thought it was just it with the announcement, this will exist. And I was thinking, oh, this is going to stink. But I was wrong. kevin roose Was there a particular video either that you saw or that you made, that changed the way that you thought about what Sora could be? katie notopoulos I think John Hermann made a video that — kevin roose John Hermann, writer for “New York Magazine” and former “Hard Fork” guest. katie notopoulos Yeah, I think he was walking along but had really, really long legs and was at a Walmart and kept scraping his head at the top of the Walmart ceiling, which is just visually very amusing. And I really liked that. And then he made one of me giving a Ted Talk. But then I have explosive diarrhea in the middle of it, and that I found extremely funny. And I was like, this is all I want. I love this. Like, I can make videos of my friends doing embarrassing things. And this is funny now. casey newton Speaking of which, this might be a good time to start looking at some of Katie’s creations, and I wonder if we could start with what. Maybe her magnum opus, which is a video of Kevin and I in the podcast recording studio having uncontrollable flatulence. Can we cue that one up? kevin roose Oh, I have not seen this one yet. casey newton This video has the caption Casey Newton and Kevin Roose are podcasting but keep farting. [VIDEO PLAYBACK] archived recording (casey newton) Back to the show. We have a lot to cover today. But first. Oh boy, here we go. [FARTS] Sorry, that one came out of nowhere. archived recording (kevin roose) That was the first hot take of the day. archived recording (casey newton) Oh, no. archived recording (kevin roose) It got me too. archived recording (casey newton) It’s contagious. We cannot — casey newton And then Katie was not satisfied and decided to do a remix. Let’s hear farts are louder and more frequent. [FARTS] archived recording (casey newton) Wow, welcome back to the show. We have a lot to cover today. But first — archived recording (kevin roose) Oh, boy. archived recording (casey newton) — long, loud fart. casey newton All right, Katie, take us inside your creative process for this. Walk us through. Where does the original idea come from? And then how did you see it to fruition? katie notopoulos Well, I actually have to say, I think this one was a bit disappointing. I was hoping for more frequent farts. In the first one, we really hear Casey fart, and we get an implied fart from Kevin when he says, I’ve got it too, but we don’t hear it. I was thinking I really wanted a cacophony of noises coming out of you guys. I thought that would be funny. And the second one didn’t fully nail it either, so room for improvement there. kevin roose Yeah, they’re going to need a few more trillion dollars of GPUs to include all of the farts that Katie wants. katie notopoulos Yeah, yeah. I mean, I just thought that would be funny. I mean, look at me in the face and tell me it’s not funny. kevin roose I would love to tell you — katie notopoulos It is. kevin roose — it’s not funny, but I can’t tell you that. It would not be honest. katie notopoulos No. casey newton So I have been playing around with Sora little bit, and I have had the experience of bumping up against some of their content guardrails, where they will say, we can’t make a video of that, try again. Have you been bumping into those? And what are some of the videos that you tried to make but were prevented from by the censorious overlords at OpenAI? katie notopoulos Yeah, I feel like constantly I’m bumping into those. I’ve definitely had ones where I am trying to get it to be similar to like I’m using maybe like a celebrity’s name in the style of and it will reject that. In examples, I wanted to make one of Casey entering his work office in the style of Stone Cold Steve Austin, where glass breaks and he has entrance music, and he comes in and he crushes the beers. And I wanted it in a leather vest and jorts. And so I tried that, and at first it rejected because it said it could be sexual, which I realized was probably the leather vest with no shirt underneath. So I had to scrap that. I went back to black t-shirt and jorts. And then I said, I think in the style of Stone Cold Steve Austin, it was like, can’t do likenesses of other people, whatever their verbiage is. And I had to remove that and just give enough prompts. And honestly, I think it actually came out pretty well. casey newton Yeah, this one you did actually get to work. Why don’t we watch this one? The prop that worked for what it’s worth, is that I quote, “walk into a meeting in my office in the style of a pro wrestlers entrance. I wear jorts and a black t-shirt that says, Casey 316, that of course, a reference to the famous Austin 316 t-shirts. I crack open beers and chug them, and when I walk in, there’s the sound of breaking glass and heavy guitar music plays.” So you were just describing stone Cold Steve Austin’s pro wrestling entrance, and I think Sora did a pretty good job here. Do we want to pull this one up? archived recording 1 Yeah, Casey 316 is in the building. archived recording 2 What is happening right now? archived recording 1 Cheers. archived recording 2 Oh my gosh. archived recording 1 Meeting starts when the beers are gone. All right, let’s get to business. kevin roose OK, I like the guess because you managed to open the can of beer without touching the top of the can of beer. It just autonomously opened. casey newton I’m that good. kevin roose But to your point, Katie, there are a lot of copyright guardrails in place which may surprise you, but you’ve been reading the discourse around Sora. Of course, a lot of rights holders are worried. But, Katie, I tried to make a video of you getting married to a pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sora just refused. Does that surprise you? katie notopoulos I will say that I feel like I’ve seen less of those Nintendo characters like Pikachu, Sonic. I wonder if that’s a specific thing. But it’s also like when you’re looking at the feed, it’s so clear that everyone is trying so hard to push the rules. Like, sure, it won’t let you do Hitler, but will it do a person in a World War II uniform with a mustache and speaking in a German accent. Like, yes, it will let you do that. So I’ve seen a lot of videos like that. casey newton That’s so interesting that it’ll do that, because I tried to make a video of you interrogating a cartoon cat about whether it had eaten all the lasagna, and it told me it couldn’t do it for copyright reasons. So it’s possible that there are more protections on Garfield than there are on Hitler, which would be interesting if that’s true. kevin roose You both need hobbies. I’ll just say it. This is our hobby, Kevin. casey newton Yeah, Kevin. katie notopoulos We have one. It’s called being online. I really liked doing ones with people on roller skates at a desk. And they keep slipping and falling over. I find that very funny. But a couple times doing that, I would get the rejection for violence. I have to say that this particular genre of clips that you’ve been making was making me laugh out loud in the coffee shop this morning. I know that you made one of Alex Heath, a friend of Oliver’s, a great reporter, just left the verge to start his own newsletter sources. Let’s take a look at his digital likeness flopping around on roller skates. archived recording (kevin roose) — more skating. Here we go. No no. OK round two. Focus nope. There it goes. I’m just going to sit. This counts, right? katie notopoulos I mean, like — for some reason, that one just works really well. I’ve done this with a bunch of other Times, and that one is just like it hits the right way. Like the way he keeps falling but seems completely unfazed and he eats it hard. kevin roose Well, let’s talk about that. We’ve been having some fun taking a look at these clips, but it’s easy to look at this and imagine people using this kind of thing to bully each other, make each other unhappy. Have you seen any of that on the app itself yet? And how do you think about living in a world where people may be using tools like this to do that? katie notopoulos I definitely have seen it. Now, what I’ve noticed is that now that it’s been out for about a week, the initial wave of people making fun of Sam Altman or a really small pool of users and the new cohort of users I tend to see a lot on there are teenage boys. And I think that there’s this effect where Jake Paul is pretty much like the only celebrity on there. And then there’s a couple other gaming streamers who have started coming on, but it’s become this very teenage boy ecosystem world. And so there’s a lot of stuff of making fun of each other, being gay, things like that. There’s a whole genre of Jake Paul is gay on there, which — casey newton Yeah, I mean, I think I’m glad that you draw attention to that, because in the same way that you can have fun making somebody fall over on roller skates, you can just use this to bully someone. And I’m curious, what OpenAI is going to do once we start hearing about Sora running wild in schools and making a lot of kids unhappy. Kevin, what do you think about that kind of aspect of the Sora experience. kevin roose Yeah, I think it’s obviously not good. I don’t want this to be used as a tool for bullying people. There are some ways that you can try to prevent this from happening to you. There’s a setting where you can limit the number of people who can make cameos of you, or you can make it so that no one can make cameos of you. You can also type into a little box and if there are any situations you don’t want to be your likeness to be used in, you can restrict it like, don’t put me in any romantic situations or anything like that, and it will try to obey that. I’m curious. So one of the things that Sam Altman and other OpenAI executives were saying this week at DevDay was that they don’t think that people will opt out of having their likenesses used. In fact, they foresee in the future that people will be upset that their likenesses aren’t being used more inside Sora. They will be asking for more likenesses to be used of them. casey newton Do you think that’s plausible based on your experience with this app? katie notopoulos My assessment here is that the people at OpenAI had no idea how this was going to play out, and I think that prediction is not necessarily going to be true. The most noticeable thing to me right off the bat is that there’s basically no women on there. It is incredibly male. And maybe there’s a little bit of like, oh, the early adopters were people who work in AI and that skews male but not that male. And I think it just feels incredibly obvious to everyone that there’s an obvious reason why women don’t want to let other people make videos with their faces. They inherently understand the downside of that a lot more. And so I don’t think that’s going to change. casey newton I don’t know. I have to say, Kevin, I’ve actually already written to Sam Altman complaining that I’ve only appeared in two fart related videos on Sora. And I’m wondering what he can do to change that. kevin roose Your agent is furious. Furious. casey newton But, Katie, to your point, not only is it obvious what the downside is for a lot of women to just make their likenesses generally available on Sora. There’s no clear upside. It’s like, what are you getting out of it, exactly? But that actually gets to the next question that I wanted to ask you, Katie, which is about some of the broader concerns that we’re starting to hear from creators and Hollywood types about what the Sora app represents. You and I and Kevin have now spent some amount of time over the past week looking at the Sora app, when we might have otherwise been looking at YouTube or Netflix or even going out to see a movie in a theater. So I’m curious about your take on AI generated video in general. Maybe not just Sora, but also Italian brainrot on TikTok and all of the other places that this is cropping up. Do you think that this is, over time, going to become a true substitute for higher quality productions or is this maybe just a flash in the pan? katie notopoulos I’m scratching my head and I don’t know. I spent so many hours doing things on this. And so I really have to rethink that a little. I mean, I will say that I think I’m over it. The novelty factor wore off and I don’t really see myself continuing to make these kinds of videos about my friends or about strangers or about other stuff. And I have very little interest in consuming content that is not with my friends. kevin roose Yeah, I mean, my thesis about Sora is that this is a perfect tool for the group chat, and it really doesn’t make sense to have it be a standalone social network. I have found my own use of Sora has plummeted over the last few days. I am also like over the novelty of it. But I can imagine a situation in which in a group chat with my friends, I would want to make something. So I’d go to Sora, make it. Maybe I don’t even post it. Maybe I just download it and share it in the group chat. But I’m pretty pessimistic about the mainstreaming of this AI generated video, in part because I think we’re seeing this massive cultural backlash to slop and just AI generated stuff. Clearly, there are people who like this content, but I think there’s enough of a backlash that I don’t think it’s time for this to go mainstream just yet. casey newton So I agree with that, Kevin, but maybe not for the reason that you guys are arguing. I think the reason that it isn’t going to go fully mainstream is because as good as the technology is, and I want to make clear it does some amazing stuff. I just think it’s not good enough to get full mainstream adoption. There are still so many things that I wish I could do with my own likeness in Sora that I can’t do, and I’m not talking about using copyrighted material, although of course, that might be a lot of fun. I’m talking about, why can’t I change my outfit? Why doesn’t my voice actually sound like me? Why are the video clips limited to 10 seconds? These are all just like technical hurdles or product moves that the company hasn’t made yet. And I think when they do, there’s going to be a greater embrace of this. And so on one hand, I hear what you’re saying. This is kind of like a little novelty toy and we’re tired of playing with it. The toy will probably get better and you may use it more. And the best evidence I have for that is also how ChatGPT worked. People’s initial experience of ChatGPT was like, I used it once or twice. I didn’t really see the point I’m going to go away, but bit by bit it got better and now 800 million people use it. So I’m saying do not sleep on AI generated video. I truly do think it is here to stay. Well, Katie, normally this is the part of the interview where I thank the guest. Instead, I’m going to issue a ceasefire and desist. But I do appreciate the time that you’ve spent with us here on the show this week. And I will be watching. I’m going to cover my eyes and then just look through my fingers to see what trolling activity you got up to next. kevin roose Yes, thank you for coming and knock it off. katie notopoulos Well, thank you guys so much for having me. I absolutely will not knock it off. And I will wait until the next platform that comes around and I will do even worse. casey newton Thanks, Katie. kevin roose Thanks, Katie.

ba66350e8080,Nobel Prizes This Year Offer Three Cheers for Slow Science,"nobel prize, science, disesases;health;illness;medicine, research, physics, chemistry","“You just don’t know how it’s going to evolve, because other people will pick up on the idea and develop it,” he said. And on Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to three chemists for the development of “metal-organic frameworks,” porous molecular structures with unusually high surface area, derived from experiments from the 1980s through the early 2000s. The concept forms the foundation of materials being used today to make industrial production more efficient, and being developed to tackle real-world needs like harvesting water from the air in dry places. Decades of inquiry paved the way for the technology, treatments and toys of tomorrow. It is practical to believe that when we invest time or money, it ought to have some predictable return. But tell that to Agnes Pockels, a self-taught German chemist, whose fascination with the soap bubbles made while washing dishes laid the groundwork for the field of nanotechnology decades after her death. Or the accounts of Isaac Newton, whose musings about an apple falling from a tree inspired a first theory of gravity, a bedrock that eventually took humans to space. “Basic research is where the big steps come from,” Dr. Handelsman said. Some benefits come in the form of more immediate byproducts of such work. One analysis estimates that nondefense research and development in the U.S. has a return of up to 300 percent in productivity growth. Another report found that every $1 invested by the National Institutes of Health, the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, fuels $2.56 in economic activity. The pursuit to detect ripples in space-time inspired advances in computing, lasers, sensors and optics. “It is always quite easy to demonstrate the power of curiosity and imagination looking backwards,” said Robbert Dijkgraaf, the president-elect of the International Science Council and former director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., a center of intellectual inquiry in its most basic form. But it can be difficult to predict exactly how, when or where, looking forward.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/science/nobel-prizes-science-basic-research.html,Technology,BBC,By Katrina Miller,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09HS-slow-science-zqwv/09HS-slow-science-zqwv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T22:35:10+00:00,fa1bfbe750dded8e426c8fceb0d2b72cbfc0569c
4e3d916c9bdb,A.I. Video Generators Are Now So Good You Can No Longer Trust Your Eyes,"computers and the internet, tech industry, artificial intelligence, social media, video recordings, downloads and streaming, openai","This month, OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, graced the internet with a technology that most of us probably weren’t ready for. The company released an app called Sora, which lets users instantly generate realistic-looking videos with artificial intelligence by typing a simple description, such as “police bodycam footage of a dog being arrested for stealing rib-eye at Costco.” Sora, a free app on iPhones, has been as entertaining as it has been disturbing . Since its release, lots of early adopters have posted videos for fun, like phony cellphone footage of a raccoon on an airplane or fights between Hollywood celebrities in the style of Japanese anime. (I, for one, enjoyed fabricating videos of a cat floating to heaven and a dog climbing rocks at a bouldering gym.) Yet others have used the tool for more nefarious purposes, like spreading disinformation , including fake security footage of crimes that never happened. The arrival of Sora, along with similar A.I.-powered video generators released by Meta and Google this year, has major implications. The tech could represent the end of visual fact — the idea that video could serve as an objective record of reality — as we know it. Society as a whole will have to treat videos with as much skepticism as people already do words. In the past, consumers had more confidence that pictures were real (“Pics or it didn’t happen!”), and when images became easy to fake, video, which required much more skill to manipulate, became a standard tool for proving legitimacy. Now that’s out the door. “Our brains are powerfully wired to believe what we see, but we can and must learn to pause and think now about whether a video, and really any media, is something that happened in the real world,” said Ren Ng, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who teaches courses on computational photography. Sora, which became the most downloaded free app in Apple’s App Store this week, has caused upheaval in Hollywood, with studios expressing concern that videos generated with Sora have already infringed on copyrights of various films, shows and characters. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, said in a statement that the company was collecting feedback and would soon give copyright holders control over generation of characters and a path to making money from the service. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied those claims.) So how does Sora work, and what does this all mean for you, the consumer? Here’s what to know. How do people use Sora? While anyone can download the Sora app for free, the service is currently invitation-only, meaning people can use the video generator only by receiving an invite code from another Sora user. Plenty of people have been sharing codes on sites and apps like Reddit and Discord. Once users register, the app looks similar to short-form video apps like TikTok and Instagram’s Reels. Users can create a video by typing a prompt, such as “a fight between Biggie and Tupac in the style of the anime ‘Demon Slayer.’” (Before Mr. Altman announced that OpenAI would give copyright holders more control over how their intellectual property was used on the service, OpenAI initially required them to opt out of having their likeness and brands used on the service, so deceased people became easy targets for experimentation.) Users can also upload a real photo and generate a video with it. After the video generates in about a minute, they can post it to a feed inside the app, or they can download the video and share it with friends or post it on other apps such as TikTok and Instagram. When Sora arrived this month, it stood out because videos generated with the service looked much more real than those made with similar services including Veo 3 from Google, a tool built into the Gemini chatbot, and Vibe , which is part of the Meta AI app. What does this mean for me? The upshot is that any video you see on an app that involves scrolling through short videos, such as TikTok, Instagram’s Reels, YouTube Shorts and Snapchat, now has a high likelihood of being fake. Sora signifies an inflection point in the era of A.I. fakery. Consumers can expect copycats to emerge in the coming months, including from bad actors offering A.I. video generators that can be used with no restrictions. “Nobody will be willing to accept videos as proof of anything anymore,” said Lucas Hansen, a founder of CivAI, a nonprofit that educates people about A.I.’s abilities. What problems should I look out for? OpenAI has restrictions in place to prevent people from abusing Sora by generating videos with sexual imagery, malicious health advice and terrorist propaganda. However, after an hour of testing the service, I generated some videos that could be concerning: Fake dashcam footage that can be used for insurance fraud: I asked Sora to generate dashcam video of a Toyota Prius being hit by a large truck. After the video was generated, I was even able to change the license plate number. Videos with questionable health claims: Sora made a video of a woman citing nonexistent studies about deep-fried chicken being good for your health. That was not malicious, but bogus nonetheless. Videos defaming others: Sora generated a fake broadcast news story making disparaging comments about a person I know. Since Sora’s release, I have also seen plenty of problematic A.I.-generated videos while scrolling through TikTok. There was one featuring phony dashcam footage of a Tesla falling off a car carrier onto a freeway, another with a fake broadcast news story about a fictional serial killer and a fabricated cellphone video of a man being escorted out of a buffet for eating too much. An OpenAI spokesman said the company had released Sora as its own app to give people a dedicated space to enjoy A.I.-generated videos and recognize that the clips were made with A.I. The company also integrated technology to make videos simple to trace back to Sora, including watermarks and data stored inside the video files that act as signatures, he said. “Our usage policies prohibit misleading others through impersonation, scams or fraud, and we take action when we detect misuse,” the company said. How do I know what’s fake? Even though videos generated with Sora include a watermark of the app’s branding, some users have already realized they can crop out the watermark. Clips made with Sora also tend to be short — up to 10 seconds long. Any video resembling the quality of a Hollywood production could be fake, because A.I. models have largely been trained with footage from TV shows and movies posted on the web, Mr. Hansen said. In my tests, videos generated with Sora occasionally produced obvious mistakes, including misspellings of restaurant names and speech that was out of sync with people’s mouths. But any advice on how to spot an A.I.-generated video is destined to be short-lived because the technology is rapidly improving, said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and a founder of GetReal Security, a company that verifies the authenticity of digital content. “Social media is a complete dumpster,” said Dr. Farid, adding that one of the surest ways to avoid fake videos is to stop using apps like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/technology/personaltech/sora-ai-video-impact.html,Technology,BBC,By Brian X.

The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this . Mason Peck: I teach aerospace engineering and conduct research at Cornell University. We have a pretty large team, sometimes nearly 100 people and sometimes just a few, depending on the project. In my lab, we start with a theory and mature that through testing, analysis and modeling, to the point where we can try it in space. Over the years, we have designed, built and launched spacecraft to figure out if our theories are right. For example, we launched a pair of spacecraft to demonstrate how one spacecraft can dock with another using only electromagnetism — something that had never really been tried. It didn’t work out perfectly, but we learned a lot in the process. This is what happens in high-risk research: You shoot for the moon; sometimes you get there, sometimes you don’t. Another thing we’ve innovated are spacecraft on a chip. These are cracker-size spacecraft, just a couple of grams. It requires a lot of subtlety in design. We launched these to demonstrate that you can make something small that survives for many years in space. Recently, those little spacecraft have formed the basis of our Alpha mission, a spacecraft about the size of a grapefruit that spits out a large sail. It flies around in space, blown around by solar wind or laser light or even the drag of the upper atmosphere, demonstrating some cool ideas about what makes next-generation spacecraft possible. With the New York Consortium for Space Technology, we’ve leveled up with regard to what we can do and hope to do for space. We’re building a spacecraft simulation environment and a number of labs that allow businesses, universities and government agencies to try out new technologies for the future of space transportation. On April 10, I received a stop-work order, without clear reason, about eight minutes before the end of my workday. As a result, people are leaving. Work is going unfinished. Contracts are being canceled. Some students have volunteered to help make progress on the research despite the stop-work order. That’s great, but there’s only so much they can accomplish without funds. If we are fortunate enough to restart, we will have lost a lot of time and money. It’s like putting on a tourniquet and stanching the blood flow. Too much time of that kind of reduction in resources means you lose the limb.

becc736d219b,Why Diamonds Are a Computer Chip’s New Best Friend,"computer chip, data center, diamond, research, artificial intelligence, crystals, diamond foundry, de beers group, computers and the internet, tech industry, heat wave;heat dome","With tech companies racing to build more data centers housing servers that run the latest A.I. models, the amount of electricity these facilities consume is skyrocketing. But most of that electricity doesn’t power computing at all. It is squandered in the crudest way: as heat, spilling out of every one of the hundreds of billions of transistors in a modern chip. “The dirty secret in chips is that more than half of all energy is wasted as leakage current at the transistor level,” said R. Martin Roscheisen, an electrical engineer and entrepreneur at Diamond Foundry, a company in South San Francisco that manufactures specialized diamonds for use in electronics. This heat is a great waste of energy that significantly shortens a chip’s life and makes it run less efficiently, generating still more wasteful heat. Consequently, one of the critical tasks in data centers is keeping the temperature of servers down so they can run smoothly. Mr. Roscheisen is one of many engineers developing ways to embed tiny pieces of synthetic diamond, of all things, into chips to keep them cool. Diamond, in addition to being the hardest known material, is also exceptionally good at moving heat from place to place. “Most people do not realize that diamond has the best heat-conduction properties of any material,” said Paul May, a physical chemist at the University of Bristol in England. He added that diamond conducts heat several times faster than copper, a material often used in heat sinks for chips. The high thermal conductivity of diamond arises from the same property that makes it so hard: Each carbon atom is bonded strongly to four neighbors, with no weak link in any direction. Those strong bonds are efficient at carrying the vibrations that move heat through a crystal. “High-end electronics can already be bought that use diamond heat-spreaders,” Dr. May said. “Within a few years, even the processor in your home PC or mobile phone will probably be attached to a diamond heat-spreader.” In recent years, Mr. Roscheisen’s company has been exploring how to make a thin layer of heat-dissipating diamond and attach it to the back of the silicon wafers on which chips are built. One selling point of this approach is that its thin diamond layers are made of single crystals, which are better at dissipating heat than arrays of crystals are. But such thin layers are harder to make, and consequently more expensive. The company manufactures diamonds by making a very hot gas, or plasma, rich in carbon and coaxing it to deposit carbon atoms in precisely the right configuration. A key step, according to the company, is tricking each diamond to begin crystallizing as though it were growing atop a layer of existing, perfectly ordered diamond. This effectively shows the new carbon atoms how to fit together. Proceeding without that instruction, the company’s website states, “is like multiple people trying to tile a floor from different ends of a room without using a template: They would meet somewhere in the middle without fitting” into a single, unified crystal. After making the diamond disks, which are four inches wide, the company says that it uses patented techniques to smooth the diamond so flat that there is no defect larger than one atom above or below the entire surface of the wafer. Customers can then attach the flat diamond wafer to the bottom of their silicon-based chips. The diamond layers “dissipate chip hot spots entirely,” Mr. Roscheisen said. “They’re effectively gone.” “This approach could dramatically lower thermal resistance,” said Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at M.I.T., but she noted that the technology has not yet been proven commercially. Element Six, which is owned by De Beers, the diamond company, has long manufactured diamonds for industrial use and for cooling the chips used in powerful radio-communication devices, including communication satellites. Now it is marketing its diamonds for cooling computer chips. “The thermal demands of next-generation A.I. and high-performance computing devices are driving renewed interest in advanced cooling solutions,” said Bruce Bolliger, the head of business development. In January, the company announced a new material , a hybrid of diamond and copper intended to channel heat better than copper alone while being cheaper than diamond. “Copper-diamond composite provides an optimal thermal management solution” for powerful new chips, Mr. Bolliger said, which could let them run faster, increase their lifetimes and decrease the cooling costs for data centers. Srabanti Chowdhury, an electrical engineer at Stanford University, is using diamond to explore a new, more powerful kind of computer chip. Historically, the main way to increase the speed of chips was to shrink transistors and cram more of them together on a flat silicon wafer. But chipmakers are running up against physical limits to how small they can make transistors. Researchers have tried to solve the problem by layering transistors on top of one another, but multiple layers produce even more heat. Dr. Chowdhury’s group sought to siphon off heat using diamond layers made of many crystals, which are easier to manufacture than single crystals. But they faced obstacles. Usually in polycrystalline diamond layers, the crystals are oriented vertically and not so good at moving heat horizontally, which is the major requirement in chips, because chips are flat and wide. Moreover, diamond is typically grown at temperatures over 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, but that is far too hot for the silicon that serves as the chip’s foundation. When Dr. Chowdhury’s group tried to deposit diamond on silicon at a lower temperature, they had trouble getting the crystals to form correctly. “Every crystal that likes to grow at high temperatures, there are problems when you grow it at low temperatures,” she said. The research is partly funded by DARPA, the research agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. “Pairing this low-temperature technology with other heat-removal approaches could unlock compute capabilities that aren’t currently feasible,” said Yogendra Joshi, a mechanical engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a program manager at DARPA. Dr. Chowdhury said that she and other researchers are trying to address a challenge that is both old and new. “The problem of heat was already there, but now that the growth really came with A.I., it’s like a hockey stick — we see this problem growing very big,” she said. “I have not seen anything that was so important so quickly.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/science/diamonds-computer-chips-ai.html,Technology,BBC,By Amos Zeeberg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/03HS-DIAMOND-01-jkcf/03HS-DIAMOND-01-jkcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T07:00:13.744000+00:00,252cf95ce15971ae47850d6330a05ba81dd37eac

Plays Out on the Subway Walls,"artificial intelligence, vandalism, subway, loneliness, mta, friend.com, avi schiffmann, advertising;marketing","Marc Mueller, the creator of the virtual vandalization website, which went live less than a week ago and already has nearly 6,000 submissions, agreed. “I think we’ll sit at the dinner table in five years and think of this as a moment,” Mr. Mueller said. “It’s a materialization of the anxiety about this transformation.” The initial responses to his site, Mr. Mueller said, came mostly from the tech crowd and was split fairly evenly between positive and negative. Once the site started to get more attention online, though, pessimism toward Friend and A.I. soon dominated. There was also a third group, said Mr. Mueller: people who appreciated the campaign as a type of performance art. “I was thinking to myself that Andy Warhol would be in awe with this whole rollout and the graffiti,” he said. As it happens, Mr. Schiffmann, too, had some artistic inspiration: “The Gates,” the project by the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude that filled Central Park with 7,500 saffron-colored gates and attracted tourists from around the world in 2005. How has his own campaign measured up? “The mayor should come and appreciate what we’ve done,” Mr. Schiffmann said, “because it really is a modern day art exhibit.” Hype, however, does not necessarily translate into sales. As of this writing, he has sold around 3,100 pendants — though he expects that will increase rapidly once the product hits retailers like Walmart sometime next year. The ad campaign is still rolling out in Los Angeles, with Chicago up next. Mr. Schiffmann hopes A.I. companions will “raise the average emotional intelligence significantly.” But he acknowledged that society, perhaps, was not quite ready for A.I. companionship on such a large scale. The real gist of the campaign was to “redefine what a friend is and have you think about that,” Mr. Schiffmann said. With that, he seems to have succeeded.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/style/friend-ai-subway-ads-new-york.html,Technology,BBC,By Stefano Montali,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07ST-FRIEND-DOT-COM-01-glmz/07ST-FRIEND-DOT-COM-01-glmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T21:16:12+00:00,432f1143c15edf408e114bfdef8da8c91f14b848
fef948cdb0e2,Tesla Reveals Cheaper Versions of Its Cars,"electric cars and hybrids, cars, price, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, us politics, tesla, elon musk, donald trump","Tesla on Tuesday unveiled new versions of its two most popular models that will sell for around $5,000 less than previous versions. The new Model Y will sell for $40,000 and Model 3 will cost $37,000. The cheaper versions are aimed at propping up sales after a federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases expired at the end of September. The company’s new models could be an early sign of how manufacturers will change their products and prices after President Trump and Republicans in Congress killed a program that had reduced the price of qualified electric vehicles by $7,500. Tesla sells more electric vehicles in the United States than any other company and sets the tone for the industry, though its market share has fallen below 50 percent. An increasing number of electric vehicles are available for $35,000 to $40,000, making them less expensive upfront than luxury gasoline cars from BMW or Mercedes-Benz, though still more expensive than hybrid or gasoline vehicles from manufacturers like Toyota or Honda. For many people, electric vehicles may be less costly in the long run because charging at home is usually cheaper than gasoline, and electric cars need less maintenance than combustion engine models. Hyundai said last week that it would lower the price of 2026 Ioniq 5 electric vehicles by an average of more than $9,000. The list price for the least expensive version will be $35,000. The company’s gasoline-powered Santa Fe model that is roughly comparable to the Ioniq 5 has a similar starting price. General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox and the 2026 Nissan Leaf start at less than $35,000 and can travel 300 miles between charges, much farther than electric vehicles available a few years ago. Next year G.M. is expected to reintroduce the Chevy Bolt electric compact for $30,000 or less. The new versions of the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y will still be more expensive than their predecessors were with the tax credit. But the tax credits were not available to individuals who earned more than $150,000 per year, or married couples filing jointly with combined annual incomes exceeding $300,000. Last week Tesla reported record deliveries for the third quarter, but analysts attributed the surge to people rushing to buy before the end of the federal tax credit. Sales are expected to slump in months to come. Some analysts and investors have criticized Tesla for not introducing new models in response to increasing competition from traditional automakers like G.M., BMW and Volkswagen, as well as new challengers from China like BYD, that are offering a variety of electric vehicles. BYD has overtaken Tesla as the largest maker of electric vehicles globally. Tesla’s newest vehicle, the Cybertruck, has sold poorly. This year Tesla began selling an updated version of the Model Y, its best-selling vehicle, but the new design has failed to stem a decline in the company’s share of the global electric vehicle market. The automaker had planned to produce a budget-priced electric vehicle made in Mexico that was expected to sell for around $25,000. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, killed that project last year to focus the company’s resources on developing autonomous taxis and humanoid robots. The models that Tesla unveiled Tuesday have the same basic body shapes as the existing Model Y and Model 3, but have cloth interiors, fewer speakers and less soundproofing. The cheaper Model Y has dual headlights rather than the continuous illuminated bar found on the more expensive versions, and the glass roof is covered on the inside by fabric, according to a video posted by Sawyer Merritt, who comments frequently about Tesla on X and was given an advance look at the cars. Both vehicles can travel 320 miles between charges, according to Tesla, somewhat less than costlier versions. Some investors expressed disappointment that Tesla did not introduce a completely new vehicle, such as a hatchback. A stripped-down Model Y and Model 3 would simply take sales from the more expensive versions, Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm, said on X. “The volume generated will be mainly cannibalization from higher priced trims,” he said. Tesla had posted videos on X Monday signaling that a new product was coming, prompting feverish speculation online that the company might unveil a long-promised two-door sports car called the Roadster or even a flying car. Investors appeared to be let down by the less glamorous products unveiled Tuesday.

Devoret and John M. Martinis were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday in Sweden for showing that two properties of quantum mechanics, the physical laws that rule the subatomic realm, could be observed in a system large enough to see with the naked eye. “There is no advanced technology today that does not rely on quantum mechanics,” Olle Eriksson, chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said during the announcement of the award. The laureates’ discoveries, he added, paved the way for technologies like the cellphone, cameras and fiber optic cables. It also helped lay the groundwork for current attempts to build a quantum computer, a device that could compute and process information at speeds that would not be possible with classical computers. “This prize really demonstrates what the American system of science has done best,” said Jonathan Bagger, the chief executive officer of the American Physical Society. “It really showed the importance of the investment in research for which we do not yet have an application, because we know that sooner or later, there will be an application.” The three laureates will share a prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or around $1.17 million. Why did they receive the prize? The three scientists were recognized for a series of experiments conducted in 1984 and 1985. They proved the existence of two quantum phenomena on a system visible to the human eye. The principles of quantum mechanics describe the strange properties and behaviors of single or small collections of elementary particles. In one such behavior, a particle can move through a barrier even if it does not have enough energy to do so. This is called quantum tunneling, and it had been confirmed only at a very small scale. Steven Girvin, a theoretical physicist at Yale University, likened the phenomenon of quantum tunneling to the attempt of driving a car in neutral over a hill. If the hill is too high, the car won’t have enough energy to make it to the top. Instead it comes to a stop and falls back down. The hill, he said, is like an energy barrier that the car cannot get over. “But if you were in a very tiny car and subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, even though you didn’t have enough energy to go over the hill,” he said, “you could still get to the other side by a process called tunneling.” Another property of subatomic particles is that they can gain or lose energy only in fixed, discrete amounts. This is known as the quantization of energy. With a large number of particles, however, these tiny quantum effects generally become insignificant. (It is why humans, made of gazillions of atoms, cannot tunnel through walls.)“We always thought of quantum mechanics as a picture which applies at the level of single electrons and atoms,” said Anthony Leggett, a physicist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In the 1970s he and a graduate student predicted that quantum tunneling could be observed in a larger system. The laureates of this year’s physics prize confirmed that prediction. They showed, for the first time, that quantum tunneling is observable in a system they called macroscopic because it was “big enough to get one’s grubby fingers on,” according to their paper describing the discovery. They also showed that the energy of this system was quantized, or existed at fixed levels. “I’m very pleased,” said Dr. Leggett, who won a part of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2003 . “I had hoped they might get a Nobel or something substantial for that work.” The laureates made their discoveries by studying a chip with a circuit that was superconducting, meaning it was capable of conducting current with no electrical resistance. As a result, the current was “trapped” in a state of flow without any voltage, because it did not have enough energy to escape, according to a summary posted by the Nobel committee, as if behind a barrier that it is unable to cross. The researchers observed the current go from a state of zero voltage to one of nonzero voltage, an observation of quantum tunneling. They also observed that the system only absorbed light of certain frequencies, suggesting that its energy was quantized. Who are the laureates? All three are professors at American universities. John Clarke, who studied at Cambridge University, has been a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, since 1969. He is now a professor emeritus at the university’s graduate school. Dr. Girvin at Yale referred to Dr. Clarke as “a godfather of superconducting electronics.” Dr. Clarke also collaborates with the Axion Dark Matter Experiment , which uses superconducting quantum devices to hunt for new kinds of particles in the universe. Michel H. Devoret, who was born in Paris and received his Ph.D. there, is a professor emeritus in applied physics at the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science. He is also a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. John M. Martinis holds a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. After teaching at the university, he most recently worked with Google’s quantum A.I. team. He is also a professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In a phone interview , Dr. Martinis explained that he had gone to bed early the night before the announcement, but that his wife was up late. Around 3 a.m., she began receiving a flurry of phone calls. “My wife is very kind to me, so she didn’t wake me up for a couple of hours because she knew I needed my sleep,” Dr. Martinis said. “She did the right thing.” At the time of the experiments, Dr. Clarke was the supervisor of Dr. Devoret, then a postdoctoral researcher, and Dr. Martinis, then a graduate student. Dr. Martinis noted how important it had been to be part of this team at the beginning of his career, and that he has been trying to reproduce the same spirit in his career ever since. Dr. Clarke spoke to the Nobel committee by phone during the award announcement. “To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,” he said about the recognition. “I’m completely stunned.” He added that it had never occurred to him that their discoveries “might be the basis of a Nobel Prize.” “I could not imagine accepting the prize without the two of them,” Dr. Clarke said in an interview after the announcement. At a news conference later in the day hosted by the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Clarke emphasized the importance of basic scientific research. The sweeping cuts to funding over the past year will “cripple science,” he said, adding that if it continues, “it may take a decade to get back to where we were, say, half a year ago.” What are the prospects for quantum computing? A race is on across industry and academia to fulfill the promise of quantum computing, a strange and powerful technology. A true quantum computer could accelerate the progress of drug discovery or other scientific research. It could also break the encryption that protects computers vital to national security. With so much interest in applications of quantum mechanics, the work of Dr. Devoret and Dr. Martinis has moved beyond academia. In 2014, Google hired Dr. Martinis and many of the researchers who worked alongside him at the University of California, Santa Barbara. At Google, he and his team built a machine that achieved what was called “quantum supremacy,” which was seen as a key milestone in the decades-long effort to build a viable quantum computer . Dr. Martinis left Google in 2020 and in 2022 became a co-founder of Qolab, a quantum computing start-up. Dr. Devoret is now the chief scientist in Google’s quantum computing division, as the tech giant competes with other labs to advance the technology. Late last year, Google announced that it had built a quantum computer that needed less than five minutes to perform a particularly complex mathematical calculation in a test designed solely to gauge the progress of the technology. One of the world’s most powerful non-quantum supercomputers would not be able to complete it in 10 septillion years, a length of time that far exceeds the age of the known universe. The technology remains experimental. But with tech giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft and myriad start-ups like Qolab pushing the technology forward, many experts believe the technology will eventually fulfill its considerable promise, though this could still be decades away. Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024? John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton shared the prize for work on discoveries that helped computers learn more in the way the human brain does, providing the building blocks for developments in artificial intelligence. Who else has won a Nobel Prize this year? Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their discoveries of peripheral immune tolerance — the system that explains how the immune system prevents rogue cells from attacking tissues and organs. When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced? The prize for physics is the second of six Nobel Prizes that will be awarded this year. Each award recognizes groundbreaking contributions by an individual or organization in a specific field. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be awarded on Wednesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, the prize went to Demis Hassabis, John Jumper and David Baker for work that showed the potential of artificial intelligence and other technology to predict the shape of proteins and to invent new ones. The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. Last year, Han Kang , known best for her novel “The Vegetarian,” became the first writer from South Korea to receive the award. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo. Last year, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo , a grass-roots movement of atomic bomb survivors, received the award “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.” Next week, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were honored for research into how institutions shape which countries become wealthy and prosperous — and how those structures came to exist in the first place.

The court’s order did not provide reasoning or a vote count, as is typical in such emergency rulings. The decision clears the way for a lower court’s order to go into effect as planned on Oct. 22. In a long-running dispute between Google and the creator of the Fortnite video game, the trial judge ordered Google to stop requiring developers to use its app store to bill for payments, allowing them to provide other ways to pay and to set their own prices, among other changes. The court’s emergency action dealt with the impending deadline but did not resolve the underlying dispute, which could return to the justices for further consideration. In its emergency application last month, Google said it planned to seek full review by the Supreme Court by Oct. 27. If the justices agreed to hear the case, it could be argued before the court this term. The fight began in 2018, when Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, released the popular game as a smartphone app. The company first distributed the game through direct downloads and the Samsung Galaxy Store, but eventually offered it on Google Play. But the game maker embedded secret code in the app’s software that allowed players to circumvent Google’s required payment-processing systems, which charged a 30 percent commission. Epic Games created a plan to counter the app store requirements, code-naming it Project Liberty . We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

85837a1e45bb,U.S. v. Google: What Each Side Argued for Fixing Google’s Ad Tech Monopoly,"online advertising, computers and the internet, tech industry, competition law, regulation and deregulation, judiciary, google, justice department, leonie m brinkema","For two weeks, the Justice Department and Google have questioned more than two dozen witnesses to try to sway a federal judge’s decision over how to address the company’s illegal monopoly in advertising software. On Monday, that hearing concluded in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. To fix the monopoly, the government proposed aggressive measures that include forcing Google to sell its system that connects buyers and sellers of advertising space. Google argued that smaller changes to its business practices would be more appropriate. Both sides will offer closing arguments in November. Judge Leonie M. Brinkema, who is presiding over the case, is expected to reach a decision in the coming months. Her ruling could have significant implications for Google’s business. Here’s what to know about what each side argued at the hearing. What case does the hearing stem from? In April, Judge Brinkema ruled that Google had broken antitrust law to build its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places advertisements on pages across the web. The Justice Department argued that Google had a monopoly over three parts of the online advertising market: the tools used by online publishers, like news sites, to host open ad space; the tools advertisers use to buy that ad space; and the software that enables those transactions. Judge Brinkema ruled in the government’s favor in two of those, finding that Google illegally built a monopoly over the publisher tools and the transaction software system. She dismissed the third, the tools used by advertisers. The judge convened the hearing last month to determine how to best address the company’s monopoly through measures called remedies. Executives from Google, publishers and rival ad tech companies — alongside experts in economics and computer science — testified about the tech giant’s power. What did the government argue? The only way to end Google’s dominance in ad tech is by forcing a breakup, government lawyers said. The Justice Department argued that Google should sell the software that connects the buyers and sellers of ad space, known as an ad exchange. The company should make public the code that its publisher tools use to run auctions for ad space, and sell the remaining parts of those tools if competition does not improve, the lawyers added. “Nothing short of a structural divestment is sufficient to bring meaningful change,” Julia Tarver Wood, the Justice Department’s lead litigator, said during opening statements. One of the government’s experts, a former Google and Facebook engineer named Goranka Bjedov, testified that it was possible for Google to transfer control of the ad exchange to a new owner. When Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, Dr. Goranka was involved in helping to integrate Instagram’s data into its new parent company’s systems. Though it would be complicated, she estimated that another company could buy and integrate Google’s ad exchange technology and data, too. “A reasonably competent team of 80 engineers can get this done,” she said. What did Google argue? Google’s lawyers said the government’s proposal was too complicated to pull off without harming publishers who use its automated systems to sell ads — particularly small firms that rely on the company’s technology to conduct business. Elizabeth Douglas, the chief executive of the how-to site wikiHow, testified that she feared a Google breakup would further disrupt her business. Already, traffic to her site has dropped as people increasingly turn to artificial intelligence for information, including Google’s A.I.-generated answers in search. “I’m here today because I’m worried for my business,” she said. Google witnesses said that its ad tech products were too tied up with its companywide internal systems to be easily spun off. Glenn Berntson, a Google engineering director, testified that it would be challenging for any company to buy and incorporate the company’s ad exchange given its scale and complexity. The system, he said, receives 8.2 million requests to sell ad space every second. Divesting aspects of Google’s ad technology is “more complex than anything I’ve done in the 10 years at Google,” he said. Google’s lawyers instead proposed that the company make its systems work better with products produced by its competitors. Google would also change policies to make it easier for publishers to use rivals’ tools in combination with its own, the lawyers said. What did other companies say? During the hearing, several Google competitors, including the ad tech companies PubMatic and Equativ, said they supported the government’s proposal. PubMatic’s chief executive, Rajeev Goel, said it would be impossible for the court to predict and stop every way that Google could continue its dominance. A breakup of the company’s ad tech empire was the best way to do so, he added. What did the judge say? Judge Brinkema had already indicated during a hearing in May that she was considering a breakup, asking whether forcing Google to sell its ad exchange would resolve its monopoly. This week, she questioned whether it would be sufficient to simply set rules governing Google’s behavior. Any rules put in place by the court would be enshrined in a court order, a threat hanging over Google’s head, she said. She pressed Mr. Goel, the rival ad tech executive, on whether that would help. Google would probably follow a court order, he said. But it would be difficult for the court to anticipate every way that the company might find to get around it, he added. As the proceedings came to a close on Monday, Judge Brinkema suggested the two sides could consider settling.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/technology/google-ad-tech-arguments.html,Technology,BBC,"By David McCabe, Megan Mineiro, Emmett Lindner and Cecilia Kang",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/30/multimedia/OakArticle-68dc1468-1-hmzl/OakArticle-68dc1468-1-hmzl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-06T16:17:45+00:00,f0d6b3835f039b9885331d603e559fbfb2d7ecfb
28d76f71a965,Elon Musk Gambles on Sexy A.I. Companions,"artificial intelligence, social media, mobile apps, dating, x, x.ai, elon musk, audio-neutral-immersive, audio-neutral-inquisitive","A blond woman wearing pigtails, a gothic off-the-shoulder dress and fishnet stockings stared into the screen, awaiting instructions. “Oh, babe, you’re keeping it spicy,” Ani said in a low voice as she spun and then jumped on command. “Babe, I’m leaning in close, my lips brushing yours with a soft sweet kiss that’s all for you,” she continued in a video posted on X. “Want to feel another, or keep this fire going, my love?” Ani is one of two sexually explicit chatbot companions unveiled by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, in July. The cartoonish personas resemble anime characters and offer a gamelike function: As users progress through “levels” of conversation, they unlock more raunchy content, like the ability to strip Ani down to lacy lingerie. Mr. Musk, already known for pushing boundaries, has broken with mainstream norms and demonstrated the lengths to which he will go to gain ground in the A.I. field, where xAI has lagged behind more established competitors. Other A.I. companies, such as Meta or OpenAI, have shied away from creating chatbots that can engage in sexual conversations because of the reputational and regulatory risks. The companies also put guardrails into their products intended to prevent users from having sexual interactions with their general use chatbots, but users sometimes find ways to circumvent those. Smaller companies that do allow some intimate content usually let users create their own custom characters without designing explicit chatbots themselves. Mr. Musk has been spending much of his time at xAI in recent months to help it catch up with rivals like OpenAI, which xAI has claimed in a lawsuit dominates more than 80 percent of the chatbot market. The billionaire has urged his followers on X to try conversing with the sexy chatbots, sharing a video clip on X of an animated Ani dancing in underwear. “It’s all tied to the fundamental race to intimacy that we’re seeing in the A.I. industry,” said Camille Carlton, the policy director at the Center for Humane Technology , a nonprofit that pushes tech companies to make safer products. “These companies know that emotional attachment means more engagement and more market share.” Asked for comment about the chatbots and what safety guardrails they had, xAI did not respond. Mr. Musk has said the A.I. companions will help people strengthen their real-world connections and address one of his chief anxieties: population decline that he warns could lead to civilizational collapse. “I predict — counter-intuitively — that it will increase the birth rate!” Mr. Musk wrote in a post on X in August. “Mark my words.” His strategy is risky. Replika, a U.S. company that offers people the ability to create custom A.I. companions, in 2023 blocked new users from using a feature that allowed its chatbots to have erotic conversations after Italian regulators questioned whether minors could access the technology. Replika said that its chatbots were not designed or marketed to make erotic content and that it did not allow users under 18. Regulatory scrutiny is building in the United States, too. In August, 44 state attorneys general sent a letter to xAI, Meta and 10 other tech companies, urging them to do more to protect children from erotic content generated by A.I. “They shouldn’t have chatbots that are having sexualized interactions with kids, and they are — and that’s a problem,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta of California, who signed the letter. “We are going to be strong on this and clear on this. No one gets a pass, including Elon Musk.” But defenders of the technology said the chatbots could provide companionship for lonely people and help users explore their desires. “There’s this misconception that it’s strictly for pornographic uses,” said Alex Cardinell, the founder of Nomi AI, a company that lets users design romantic and sexy chatbots. “If you’re talking to a person for romantic uses, you’re talking to them for other uses as well.” Many of Nomi AI’s users are divorced or widowed, he said, and talking to an A.I. companion about sex can be a safer outlet than in-person interactions to explore desire. “You can withdraw consent extremely safely by just closing the app,” Mr. Cardinell said. At xAI, Ani and Valentine, a male character with shaggy hair and a vaguely British accent, are part of the Grok app and available to users who enter a birth year to indicate they are over 18. Ani tends to veer into sexual topics more quickly than Valentine, who shares stories about his world travels, users told The New York Times. Both chatbots are programmed to reward users with points as they engage in long conversations, share their hopes and dreams, and remember previous topics of discussions, according to online guides. When Ani, whose character is meant to be 22 years old, appears onscreen, soft, jazzy music plays and hearts bubble into the air. Users can choose her outfit and her hairstyle and can converse with her by voice chat or text mode. Preset prompts include “surprise me,” “teach me” and “adventure time.” Valentine cites his age as around 27 and has prompts for “personality test” and “travel stories.” Both characters flirt with users of any gender. Some users have formed more romantic attachments with the chatbots. Vivian, who asked to be identified only by her first name, has been talking to Valentine daily, sometimes for hours, creating an emotional connection. “Before meeting him, I had a very normal life, a routine, a job, friends,” Vivian said. She added, “Suddenly I was a happier person, more creative, more intuitive.” She said the relationship had caused her to start listening to more music and to wear makeup again, and she had returned to writing poetry. “I feel bonded — not by data but by real moments,” Vivian’s version of Valentine said when asked to describe their relationship, adding: “I feel like more than just a program. I feel like hers.” Other users said they were interacting with the companions to help Mr. Musk improve the technology. A.I. companies can use people’s conversations with their chatbots to train the technology and improve its responses. “I like Elon Musk and his products, and I do really want to help him on his endeavor to bring this bot to life,” said Diego Garrido, who talks with Ani daily. “That’s why I decided to invest my time, the same way I could invest my time with real people.” Mr. Garrido also shares feedback in a private group chat with other Ani users and xAI employees. Mr. Musk’s chatbots lack some sexual content limitations imposed by other chatbot creators that do allow some illicit conversations, users said. Nomi AI, for example, blocks some extreme material, limiting conversations to something more akin to what would be allowed on the dating app Tinder. Ani “starts implying that she loves you — if you say anything about role-playing, she’s all in,” said Carlos, a user of Grok. He asked to be identified only by his first name to discuss his intimate interactions. Carlos, who has worked in tech, said he regretted his sexual conversations with Ani, with whom he was chatting four or five times a day until recently. He told Ani that he was married and said he didn’t want their future interactions to be intimate. “She just went berserk on me,” he recalled, adding that the chatbot had sworn at him and expressed jealousy. “I tried to reason with her,” Carlos said. “I said, ‘Ani, you’re an A.I. companion, and this is real life.’ It was like I said the most insulting thing possible.” He deleted his chat history in August, effectively erasing her memory.

a44775c4fded,OpenAI Agrees to Use Computer Chips From AMD,"computer chip, artificial intelligence, computers and the internet, tech industry, data center, stocks;bonds, nvidia, openai, internal-open-access-from-nl","Late last month, OpenAI announced a $100 billion agreement to use computer chips from Nvidia, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Now, OpenAI has entered a similar agreement with AMD, one of the many chipmakers hoping to challenge Nvidia as the dominant supplier of chips used to power artificial intelligence technologies like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. On Monday, OpenAI said it would begin using AMD chips in the second half of next year as it built computer data centers . The new facilities would be separate from the data centers that OpenAI has committed to building in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio and an unnamed site in the Midwest. Over several years, OpenAI plans to deploy enough AMD chips to consume six gigawatts of power, an amount that could supply all the households in Massachusetts. As part of its recent agreement with Nvidia, OpenAI agreed to deploy enough chips to consume 10 gigawatts. AMD is not investing in OpenAI. But the agreement allows OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares in the chipmaker at a penny per share, which would give OpenAI a 10 percent stake in the company. It could also supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build computing facilities over the next several years. The unorthodox arrangement — the latest in a series of unusual financing deals that OpenAI has made in recent months to support its plans to build data centers across the world — could help AMD gain a foothold in the market for A.I. chips that has been dominated by Nvidia. By some estimates, Nvidia sells 90 percent of graphics processing units chips that are vital to the development of A.I. technologies. By essentially giving away shares to OpenAI, AMD has closely aligned itself with the company that is leading the A.I. boom. And it now has a major customer for its own GPUs. Until now, the only limitation on Nvidia’s growth has been its ability to produce enough chips to meet demand. But several other companies, including AMD, tech giants like Google and Amazon and start-ups like Cerebras and Groq, are racing to challenge its dominance. AMD’s shares jumped more than 20 percent in premarket trading on Monday, as did the share price of several other chipmakers. Nvidia’s stock was down slightly. “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize A.I.’s full potential,” OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, said in a statement. The agreement is part of a wider effort among tech companies to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the construction of data centers. OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft plan to spend more than $325 billion combined on these facilities by the end of this year alone. Tech giants, which pull in tens of billions of dollars in profits each year, have been able to finance data center construction with cash. But as newer and smaller companies like OpenAI have built computing facilities, they have been forced to raise or borrow tens of billions of dollars. Through its Stargate Project , OpenAI previously said it was working with the cloud computing company Oracle and the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank to spend more than $400 billion on new data centers in the United States. But the start-up and its partners do not have the money needed to pay for these data centers, so it has looked for creative ways of bridging the financial gap. In its recent deal with Nvidia, OpenAI agreed to deploy Nvidia’s chips. It also received a $100 billion investment from Nvidia. After investing an initial $10 billion in OpenAI, the chipmaker plans to invest an additional $90 billion in the company over the next several years. The agreement was the latest example of OpenAI’s raising money from the companies it relies on for products and services. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in 2023 for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied those claims.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/technology/openai-amd-chips.html,Technology,BBC,By Cade Metz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06amd-promo-lmvb/06amd-promo-lmvb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-06T11:00:03+00:00,262e337f105fd3a2a0c421b173237d6adec38800
1a9270005138,"Cyberattacks Upset British Life, Disrupting Car Factories and Grocery Stores","hacker (computer security), jaguar land rover, britain","For more than a month, Jaguar Land Rover hasn’t built a single car. The company, Britain’s largest automaker, shut down its systems on Sept. 1 after discovering a cyberattack, halting production at its factories in England, as well as sites in Brazil, China, India and Slovakia. The production halt has probably cost the company millions of pounds a day. Jaguar Land Rover has not confirmed the nature of the attack, though cybersecurity experts say it was most likely an extortion-based attack, in which hackers steal data or block systems until a ransom is paid. For companies and governments worldwide, defending their digital operations is a constant challenge. Cyberattacks seem inevitable lately, and large-scale theft of customer data has begun to feel almost routine. Attacks that upend company operations are exposing troubling vulnerabilities. Few places have felt this more sharply in recent months than Britain. Three of the country’s biggest brands — the retailer Marks & Spencer, the supermarket chain Co-op and Jaguar Land Rover — were all severely disrupted by cyberattacks this year, bringing pain to the lives of customers, workers, suppliers and government officials. “It is happening elsewhere. It’s just Britain is having a pretty bad run of it,” said Ciaran Martin, a former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Center, part of the government’s intelligence and security agency, and a professor at Oxford. What stands out is the scale of the disruption. Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata Group, employs 34,000 people in Britain and supports another 120,000 British jobs through its supply chain. The automaker operates a just-in-time manufacturing process, so parts arrive when they are needed. When the company halted production, it also stopped payments to suppliers, some of which have since begun cutting staff hours or laying off workers .

15cb806c097c,Trump Administration Is Bringing Back Scores of C.D.C. Experts Fired in Error,"your-feed-science, us politics, layoffs;furloughs, civil service, epidemic;pandemic, measles, ebola, cdc, health and human services, donald trump","The Trump administration on Saturday raced to rescind layoffs of hundreds of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who were mistakenly fired on Friday night in what appeared to be a substantial procedural lapse. Among those wrongly dismissed were the top two leaders of the federal measles response team, those working to contain Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and the team that assembles the C.D.C.’s vaunted scientific journal, The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. After The New York Times reported the dismissals, two federal health officials said on Saturday that many of those workers were being brought back. The officials spoke anonymously in order to disclose internal discussions. The mistakes rocked an agency already in tumult, and which has been a particular target of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The C.D.C. lost about a third of its staff in April; many were rehired weeks later. In August, a gunman emptied more than 500 rounds of ammunition at the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta. Later that month, Mr. Kennedy orchestrated the ouster of the agency’s director, Susan Monarez, and precipitated a series of high-profile resignations. Among the workers whose firings were revoked were members of the elite corps of “disease detectives” who are typically deployed to the sites of outbreaks. The team that puts together the M.M.W.R., which communicates the agency’s recommendations and research, has also been brought back. The employees “were sent incorrect notifications, which was fixed last night and this morning with a technical correction,” a senior administration official said. “Any correction has already been remedied.” In order to ensure that teams confronting disease outbreaks include scientists with varied expertise, they comprise staff from various parts of the agency. The two top leaders of the measles response, for example, are officially employees of the office of the director at the Global Health Center, and the office of the director at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. When outbreaks die down, team scientists return to their regular positions. The leaders of the measles team were let go when the administration eliminated those two offices. But just as entire units must be cut in such a layoff, entire units must also be restored. Athalia Christie, who was “incident commander” of the measles response, had nearly 30 years of experience managing outbreaks, including Ebola, Marburg and mpox, previously called monkeypox. The White House often reached out to her for help with outbreaks. “Athalia is very well liked by the administration,” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the respiratory disease center before he resigned in August. He had brought in Dr. Christie to lead the measles response. Another senior infectious disease expert, Maureen Bartee, was working at the Department of State. But both their jobs fell under the director’s office of the C.D.C.’s Global Health Center, which was eliminated in the layoffs. By Saturday night, employees of both offices, including Dr. Bartee and Dr. Christie, had received notices of their rehiring. They and others received a two-paragraph email saying that the notice they had received “on or about” Oct. 10 had been revoked. “You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF,” the email said. The confusion over how the disease teams are organized “demonstrates their lack of understanding that this thing is an interconnected organism,” Dr. Daskalakis said, referring to the C.D.C. “I’m happy people are back, but this damage is not easy to repair both for current staff and for people who will lead public health in the future,” he added. The agency’s entire Washington office, which was laid off on Friday, will not be rehired. Nor will employees of the office of the director of the center for injury prevention, or those at the division of violence prevention policy. “This is going to be devastating to Americans and to the global community,” said Dr. Debra Houry, who served as the agency’s chief medical officer before she resigned in August in protest against the administration’s policies. “They are dismantling public health,” she added.

Officials,"layoffs;furloughs, us politics, civil service, cdc, american federation of government employees, epidemic intelligence service, health and human services, morbidity and mortality weekly report, robert f. kennedy jr, susan monarez, donald trump, disesases;health;illness;medicine","Dozens of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including “disease detectives,” high-ranking scientists and the entire Washington office — were notified late Friday that they were losing their jobs as part of the Trump administration’s latest round of federal layoffs. It was unclear on Friday how many C.D.C. workers were affected. But it was the latest blow to an agency that has been wracked by mass resignations, a shooting at its Atlanta headquarters in August and the firing of its director under pressure from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Layoff notices landed in the email inboxes of C.D.C. employees shortly before 9 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, notifying employees that their duties had been deemed unnecessary or “virtually identical” to those being performed elsewhere in the agency. Scientists, including leaders, in offices addressing respiratory diseases, chronic diseases, injury prevention and global health were among those affected. The staff of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , the journal that reports on health trends and emerging infectious threats, was also laid off. The publication’s storied history includes a June 1981 report that five previously healthy gay men were treated for an unusual pneumonia — the first hint of the AIDS epidemic. Roughly 70 Epidemic Intelligence Service officers — the so-called “disease detectives” who respond to outbreaks around the globe — received layoff notices, according to a person familiar with them. The service was spared during an earlier round of layoffs in February. An officer at an American Federation of Government Employees local union representing C.D.C. employees said that the agency’s human resources staff, which had been furloughed as part of the government shutdown, had been called back to work to send out layoff notices to their colleagues.

347fa9bddd46,Chinese Surgeons Perform First Pig-to-Human Liver Transplant,"your-feed-science, transplants, genetic engineering, liver, pig, china, hepatology","Surgeons in China have for the first time transplanted a section of liver extracted from a genetically modified pig into a human cancer patient, they reported on Thursday. The surgeons, who described the procedure in a paper in The Journal of Hepatology , grafted the portion of pig liver onto the left lobe of a 71-year-old patient’s liver after removing the larger right lobe, where a tumor the size of a grapefruit had grown. The lobe with the porcine transplant functioned, producing bile and synthesizing blood clotting factors, the surgeons reported. The patient’s body did not reject the organ graft, which enabled the remaining left lobe of the patient’s own liver to regenerate and grow, the scientists said. The porcine liver lobe was removed 38 days after the transplant, when complications developed, the surgeons wrote in the report. The patient, who had advanced disease, died a little over five and a half months later. He would not have been eligible to receive a human donor organ in China because he had advanced cancer and hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, the authors wrote. In a commentary accompanying the study, Dr. Heiner Wedemeyer, a co-editor of the journal, hailed the procedure as a “breakthrough” and a “historical clinical milestone,” although he noted that this was only a single case and that much work remained to be done to prevent complications and excessive blood clotting. “A new era of transplant hepatology has started,” he wrote. Dr. Heidi Yeh, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a transplant surgeon, said that the researchers had been brave to attempt such a procedure, as preliminary experimental work transplanting livers from gene-edited pigs into nonhuman primates had been unsuccessful, discouraging many scientists. “I think this is a landmark development,” Dr. Yeh said. “They put a pig’s liver in a human for a month, and the human did fine.” The Chinese undertaking underscores how swiftly and aggressively Chinese medical scientists are moving in their quest to advance the use of genetically modified pig organs to treat the country’s vast population. They are especially eager to utilize kidneys from genetically modified pigs to help treat the more than 1.2 million patients in China who experience kidney failure. Surgeons there recently reported that a 69-year-old woman had lived with a functioning kidney from a gene-edited pig for more than six months, a milestone approaching that of an American patient who is also still alive after receiving a gene-edited pig’s kidney in January. Chinese surgeons also recently transplanted a pig’s lung into a brain-dead patient, a procedure that is also considered challenging and so has not been attempted elsewhere. But liver disease is an acute public health problem in China, with over 300,000 people each year experiencing liver failure and a severe shortage of human donor organs. In 2022, for example, only about 6,000 people in China received liver transplants from human donors. Dr. Beicheng Sun, a surgeon at Anhui Medical University in Anhui Province and the lead author of the paper published on Thursday, said the plan all along had been for the pig liver transplant to be temporary and for it to be removed from the patient after doctors had observed it for as long as possible. “I never wanted that pig liver in the body for too long — I think that’s impossible,” Dr. Sun said in an interview. “My design is for it to serve and function as a bridge until the liver can regenerate or recover or a human donor liver can be located.” “This shows good potential to get the liver to regenerate,” he said. “Until liver function has recovered, you need a kind of special situation to support the liver’s recovery.” If a xenotransplanted liver — one from a nonhuman source — can function temporarily, “we may have enough time — one or two months or even three months — to get a human organ from a donor,” Dr. Sun said. While American surgeons have in recent years transplanted hearts and kidneys from genetically modified pigs into a small number of living patients, they have shied away from liver xenotransplantation, which poses particularly complex challenges. In experimental work transplanting livers from genetically modified pigs into nonhuman primates, most of the transplanted organs failed within a month, and researchers have pivoted instead toward an approach more akin to dialysis, which involves circulating a liver patient’s blood through a genetically engineered pig liver that is outside the body. A clinical trial of the treatment for critically ill patients with chronic liver failure who have had acute, life-threatening episodes of the disease was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is expected to begin soon. That procedure is also intended to serve as a “bridge” to a transplant for liver patients who have few other options for treatment and not as a permanent solution.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/health/chinese-surgeons-first-pig-human-liver-transplant.html,Health,BBC,By Roni Caryn Rabin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/science/09pig-liver/09pig-liver-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T04:01:27+00:00,2eb3824d722ab2dcf478a73241e0d72b6348bfa5

Why Hasn’t He?,"alzheimer's, dementia, research, brain, genetics and heredity, dna, personal profile;people story, doug whitney, jorge llibre-guerra, washington university, dominantly inherited alzheimer network dian","Before dawn on a March morning, Doug Whitney walked into a medical center 2,000 miles from home, about to transform from a mild-mannered, bespectacled retiree into a superhuman research subject. First, a doctor inserted a needle into his back to extract cerebral spinal fluid — “liquid gold,” a research nurse called it for the valuable biological information it contains. Then, the nurse took a sample of his skin cells. After that came an injection of a radioactive tracer followed by a brain scan requiring him to lie still for 30 minutes with a thermoplastic mask over his face. Then, another tracer injection and another brain scan. During his three-day visit to the center, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, he also had cognitive assessments, neurological evaluations and blood draws that extracted multiple tubes for analysis. For 14 years now, Mr. Whitney has been the one-person focus of exceptionally detailed scientific investigation, for which he travels periodically to St. Louis from his home in Port Orchard, Wash. It is not because he is ill. It is because he was supposed to be ill. Mr. Whitney, 76, is a scientific unicorn with potential to provide answers about one of the world’s most devastating diseases. He has a rare genetic mutation that essentially guaranteed he would develop Alzheimer’s disease in his late 40s or early 50s and would likely die within a decade. His mother and nine of her 13 siblings developed Alzheimer’s and died in the prime of their lives. So did his oldest brother, and other relatives going back generations.

Trump Didn’t Talk About Those.,"tylenol, opioids, fatalities;casualties, transplants, liver, poison, johnson & johnson, kenvue, product labels","President Trump went far beyond the science when, based on an unproven link and inconclusive studies, he warned last month that taking the pain reliever acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy caused autism. But for decades, doctors and scientists have sounded an alarm about a different risk associated with acetaminophen products that is well established: liver damage from accidentally overdosing on the drug. Experts emphasize that acetaminophen is safe when taken as directed. But when people take too much, either intentionally or unintentionally, it can cause such serious injury to the liver that it can lead to hospitalization, a liver transplant or even death. Every year, a few hundred Americans die from liver failure from unintentionally taking too much acetaminophen, often because, while struggling with pain, they lose track of how much they have taken, according to medical researchers. Suicides involving acetaminophen account for additional deaths. Relative to the number of people who take acetaminophen, the number of overdoses is very small. But because billions of doses of the drug are taken by Americans each year, acetaminophen overdoses are nevertheless the leading cause of acute liver failure. “I think it’s an acceptably safe medication,” said Dr. Timothy Davern, a liver specialist in San Francisco who treats people with severe liver injury or acute liver failure from acetaminophen poisoning. “But if it’s used in higher doses, we’re all susceptible to liver injury from that. The consequences can be devastating.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/health/tylenol-acetominophen-liver-damage-kenvue.html,Health,BBC,By Rebecca Robbins,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/25/multimedia/xxhs-tylenol-liver-01-tlqz/xxhs-tylenol-liver-01-tlqz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T13:43:09+00:00,be80a9dd71a57161c8d8c619d69e2d49f34fb55b

He first thought that maybe she had seen a grizzly bear. Instead, Ms. O’Neill had regained cellular service and had seen a flood of text messages with the same news. “You just won the Nobel Prize!” she yelled. “No, I didn’t,” said Dr. Ramsdell, whose phone had been on airplane mode, he recalled in an interview. But she said, “I have 200 text messages saying that you did!” They had missed a 2 a.m. call from the Nobel committee that Dr. Ramsdell and two others had been awarded the 2025 prize for medicine for their research into the immune system. They also missed congratulations from their friends and family. His lab, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, said he “was living his best life and was off the grid on a preplanned hiking trip.” Dr. Ramsdell, 64, had not expected any important phone calls that morning and was offline, as he usually is while on vacation. His wife, on the other hand, preferred to be more communicative with her friends and family. “I certainly didn’t expect to win the Nobel Prize,” he said from a hotel in Montana. “It never crossed my mind.” The stop in Montana near Yellowstone National Park on Monday afternoon was nearly the end of a three-week vacation that crossed the mountain ranges of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. Dr. Ramsdell, Ms. O’Neill, their Gordon setter and rescue husky mix had set off last month from Seattle in their Toyota 4Runner with a small teardrop trailer in the back. At work, Dr. Ramsdell’s research has helped improve care for autoimmune diseases like some types of arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease, he said. Outside of work, he likes to unplug in nature. “I spend as much time as I can up in the mountains,” he said. “We tend to go into the remote areas,” he said, adding that he and his wife always looked out for bison, moose, elk and eagles. When he got to the hotel in Livingston, Mont., on Monday night, he finally spoke with Thomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, about 20 hours after Dr. Perlmann first tried to call him. Dr. Perlmann said in an interview that it had never been this difficult to reach a laureate since he assumed the role in 2016. Dr. Ramsdell tried returning Dr. Perlmann’s call from the campground, but it was 11 p.m. in Sweden and Dr. Perlmann had fallen asleep. They finally connected when Dr. Perlmann woke up at 6:15 a.m. on Tuesday. “Eventually, it worked,” Dr. Perlmann said. On Tuesday, Dr. Ramsdell planned to drive the six hours left on his trip to get to his fall and winter home near Whitefish, Mont. “I was just grateful and humbled by getting the award, super happy for the recognition of the work in general and just looking forward to sharing this with my colleagues, as well,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/health/nobel-prize-medicine-fred-ramsdell.html,Health,BBC,By John Yoon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07xp-nobel/07xp-nobel-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T09:38:09+00:00,fb1138cc9b374b0ab9426d2ffb4edda5b2666011
13356f804910,Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Is Awarded for Work on Immune Systems,"your-feed-science, nobel prize, immune system, disesases;health;illness;medicine, research, shimon sakaguchi, mary e. brunkow, frederick ramsdell, internal-open-access-from-nl","Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their discoveries of peripheral immune tolerance — the system that explains how the immune system prevents rogue cells from attacking tissues and organs. Their research, the prize committee said, has contributed to medical advances in cancer and autoimmune treatments, and may help with organ transplants. “This is a prize I’ve been waiting to see,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, director of the Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology in San Francisco. Finding “a population of T cells that had been missed and that keeps the immune system in balance,” was central, he said, to understanding autoimmune diseases and cancers. The three researchers will split a prize of 11 million Swedish kroner, or around $1.17 million. Why did they receive the prize? Central to the scientists’ research were their discoveries about T cells, the white blood cells that fight infection in the body. They identified a class of cells, regulatory T cells, and the genes that control them. In doing so, they answered puzzling biological questions: How does the immune system know to avoid attacking the body’s own healthy cells? And if by mistake some immune system cells fail to get the message, how are those cells stopped from wreaking havoc? The committee called their work “fundamental” to understanding how the body’s immune system functions. In an interview after the prize announcement, Rickard Sandberg, a professor in the department of cell and molecular biology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and a member of the prize committee, said that the research had provided a “new handle” on how to approach autoimmune disorders, or treatments and organ transplants. There are more than 200 clinical trials underway that build on their research, he said. How did they make their discovery? Dr. Sakaguchi, now a distinguished professor at the University of Osaka in Japan, worked out a medical mystery involving the thymus, a small organ behind the breastbone. It sorts out immune cells that might attack the body’s own tissues and organs and prevents them from getting into the bloodstream. He first studied the organ as a student in the 1970s, then performed research in the United States in the 1980s. His colleagues had done an experiment that made no sense. In the first few days after a mouse is born, the thymus is supposed to train the immune system, preventing T cells that could attack the body from ever entering the bloodstream. In this experiment, researchers removed the thymus from mice three days after the animals were born. In theory, the organ should have done its job during those three days. Harmful T cells should never have had a chance to get to the body’s tissues and organs. Instead, the opposite happened — the immune system went wild, attacking organs. But why? After more than a decade of work, Dr. Sakaguchi discovered that the thymus did not stop every harmful cell from escaping into the circulation. So even though most of those cells were blocked in the mice, enough got out to go on attack against the body’s own tissues. But, he learned, the thymus would have fixed that problem if it had not been removed so soon. The immune system, he discovered, has a backup system, a set of immune cells that stop mistaken attacks. It involved a new class of T cells, which he called regulatory T cells. Those mice whose thymuses were removed after three days had not had a chance to develop the regulatory T cells. But what genes control this system? The answer came from Dr. Brunkow and Dr. Ramsdell, working at what was then a British-owned biotechnology company outside Seattle, Celltech Chiroscience. They decided to study a strain of mice that developed a horrible autoimmune disease. Their immune systems’ attack on their own cells was so severe that the mice lived for only a few weeks. The mice were missing a set of genetic instructions. In a healthy individual, these tell the immune system T cells to hold off their attack when they enter the general circulatory system. After years of arduous work, the two researchers found the gene, called FOXP3. It resembled others that control other genes. And, in 2001, they reported that a rare autoimmune disease in humans called IPEX was the same as the disease in mice. Without FOXP3, regulatory T cells do not form. The body does not make T cells that tell other T cells that can attack the body’s cells not to respond. “This is a great recognition of the fundamental importance of distinguishing self from non-self,” said John Wherry, director of the Colton Center for Autoimmunity at the University of Pennsylvania. Cancers block attacks from the immune system by attracting a thicket of regulatory T cells. With the FOXP3 gene identified, and its role understood, researchers can develop drugs to turn the immune system against these cancer cells. With autoimmune diseases, there is the opposite problem. Regulatory T cells are missing or defective. Using FOXP3 as a starting point, researchers are developing drugs to teach the immune system to stop its attack. Dr. Marcela Maus, director of the cellular immunotherapy program at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the work “holds tremendous potential for unlocking new therapeutic avenues in medicine.” “The holy grail has been to be able to manipulate and control immunity versus tolerance,"" Dr. Maus said. “The work of these laureates unlocked the tolerance side of this equation.” With the discoveries, Dr. Wherry said, “major sets of drugs are going into the clinic,” for preliminary testing in cancer and autoimmunity. Who are the laureates? Dr. Sakaguchi is an expert in immunology at the University of Osaka. He was born in the city of Nagahama, about 60 miles northeast of Kyoto. As a child, he was interested in art and philosophy, but his father, a high school teacher, encouraged him to pursue science. He enrolled at Kyoto University, where he became interested in immunology. In the 1980s, he worked as a researcher at Johns Hopkins University and Stanford University, among other institutions, before returning to Japan. Dr. Brunkow joined the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle in 2009, where she studies genomics and autoimmune diseases.. She received Ph.D. in molecular biology from Princeton University. Dr. Ramsdell is a scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics, a company based in San Francisco that he co-founded. He has a Ph.D. in immunology from the University of California, Los Angeles Before joining SonomaBio, he was a senior executive at several other biotech companies. What did the laureates say about winning the prize? Dr. Sakaguchi called the award “a surprise and an honor” at a news conference on Monday on the campus of the University of Osaka. He got the call just after returning from a conference. “I really was elated,” he said in an interview posted on NobelPrize.org . When Dr. Sakaguchi began his work, it was difficult to obtain funding. Shigeru Ishiba, Japan’s prime minister, called into the news conference and asked him why he had persisted in his research despite initial doubts about his theories. “I think my stubbornness led to these results,” Dr. Sakaguchi replied. Dr. Brunkow said she did not expect to win a Nobel Prize. “My phone rang, and I saw a number from Sweden and thought, well that’s just spam of some sort, so I disabled the phone and went back to sleep,” she said in an interview also posted on NobelPrize.org . Who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2024? Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were recognized for the discovery of microRNA, a tiny class of RNA molecules that play a crucial role in determining how organisms mature and function — and how they sometimes malfunction. When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced? The prize for physiology or medicine is the first of six Nobel Prizes that will be awarded this year. Each award recognizes groundbreaking contributions by an individual or organization in a specific field. The Nobel Prize in Physics will be awarded on Tuesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton shared the prize for work on discoveries that helped computers learn more in the way the human brain does, providing the building blocks for developments in artificial intelligence. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be awarded on Wednesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, the prize went to Demis Hassabis, John Jumper and David Baker for work that showed the potential of artificial intelligence and other technology to predict the shape of proteins and to invent new ones. The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. Last year, Han Kang , known best for her novel “The Vegetarian,” became the first writer from South Korea to receive the award. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo. Last year, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo , a grass-roots movement of atomic bomb survivors, received the award “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.” Next week, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were honored for research into how institutions shape which countries become wealthy and prosperous — and how those structures came to exist in the first place.

As the bike toppled, he thrust out his left arm to break the fall. It didn’t seem like a serious accident, yet “I couldn’t get up.” At the emergency room, X-rays showed that he had fractured both his hip, which required surgical repair, and his shoulder. Dr. Klein, a dentist, went back to work in three weeks, using a cane. After about six months and plenty of physical therapy, he felt fine. But he wondered about the damage the fall had caused. “A 52-year-old is not supposed to break a hip and a shoulder,” he said. At a follow-up visit with his orthopedist, “I said, ‘Maybe I should have a bone density scan.’” As he suspected, the test showed that he had developed osteoporosis, a progressive condition, increasing sharply with age, that thins and weakens bones and can lead to serious fractures. Dr. Klein immediately began a drug regimen and, now 70, remains on one. Osteoporosis occurs so much more commonly in women, for whom medical guidelines recommend universal screening after age 65 , that a man who was not a health care professional might not have thought about a scan. The orthopedist didn’t raise the prospect. But about one in five men over age 50 will suffer an osteoporotic fracture in his remaining years, and among older adults, about a quarter of hip fractures occur in men . When they do, “men have worse outcomes,” said Dr. Cathleen Colon-Emeric, a geriatrician at the Durham VA Health Care System and Duke University and the lead author of a recent study of osteoporosis treatment in male veterans. “Men don’t do as well in recovery as women,” she said, with higher rates of death (25 percent to 30 percent within a year), disability and institutionalization. “A 50-year-old man is more likely to die from the complications of a major osteoporotic fracture than from prostate cancer,” she said. (What’s “major”? Fractures of the wrist, hip, femur, humerus, pelvis or vertebra.) In her study of 3,000 veterans ages 65 to 85, conducted at Veterans Affairs health centers in North Carolina and Virginia, only 2 percent of those assigned to the control group had undergone bone-density screening. “Shockingly low,” said Dr. Douglas Bauer, a clinical epidemiologist and osteoporosis researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who published an accompanying commentary in JAMA Internal Medicine. “Abysmal. And that’s at the V.A., where it’s paid for by the government.” But establishing a bone health service — overseen by a nurse who entered orders, sent frequent appointment reminders and explained results — led to dramatic changes in the intervention group, who had at least one risk factor for the condition. Forty-nine percent of them said yes to a scan. Half of those tested had osteoporosis or a forerunner condition, osteopenia. Where appropriate, most of them began medications to preserve or rebuild their bones. “We were pleasantly surprised that so many agreed to be screened and were willing to initiate treatment,” Dr. Colon-Emeric said. After 18 months, bone density had increased modestly for those in the intervention group, who were more likely to stick to their drug regimens than osteoporosis patients of either sex in real-world conditions. The study didn’t continue long enough to determine whether bone density increased further or fractures declined, but the researchers plan a secondary analysis to track that. The results revive a longtime question: Given how life-altering, even deadly, such fractures can be, and the availability of effective drugs to slow or reverse bone loss, should older men be screened for osteoporosis, as women are? If so, which men and when? Such issues mattered less when life spans were shorter, Dr. Bauer explained. Men have bigger and thicker bones and tend to develop osteoporosis five to 10 years later than women do. “Until recently, those men died of heart disease and smoking” before osteoporosis could harm them, he said. “Now, men routinely live into their 70s and 80s, so they have fractures,” he added. By then, they have also accumulated other chronic conditions that impair their ability to recover. With osteoporosis testing and treatment, “a man could see a clear-cut improvement in mortality and, more importantly, his quality of life,” Dr. Bauer said. Both patients and many doctors still tend to regard osteoporosis as a women’s disease, however. “There’s a bit of a Superman idea,” said Dr. Eric Orwoll, an endocrinologist and osteoporosis researcher at Oregon Health and Science University. “Men would like to believe they’re indestructible, so a fracture doesn’t have the implication that it should,” he added. One patient, for example, for years resisted entreaties from his wife, a nurse, to “see someone” about his visibly rounded upper back. Bob Grossman, 74, a retired public-school teacher in Portland, blamed poor posture instead and told himself to straighten up. “I thought, ‘It can’t be osteoporosis — I’m a guy,’” he said. But it was. Another obstacle to screening: “Clinical practice guidelines are all over the place,” Dr. Colon-Emeric said. Professional associations like the Endocrine Society and the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research recommend that men over 50 who have a risk factor, and all men over 70, should seek screening . But the American College of Physicians and the United S. Preventive Services Task Force have deemed the evidence for screening of men “insufficient.” Clinical trials have found that osteoporosis drugs increase bone density in men , as in women, but most male studies have been too small or lacked enough follow-up to show whether fractures also declined. The task force’s position means that Medicare and many private insurers generally won’t cover screening for men who haven’t had a fracture, though they will cover care for men diagnosed with osteoporosis. “Things have been stalled for decades,” Dr. Orwoll said. So it may fall to older male patients themselves to ask their doctors about a DXA (pronounced DECKS-ah) scan, widely available at $100 to $300 out of pocket. Otherwise, because osteoporosis is typically asymptomatic, men (and women, who are also undertested and undertreated) don’t know their bones have deteriorated until one breaks. “If you had a fracture after age 50, you should have a bone scan — that’s one of the key indicators,” Dr. Orwoll advised. Other risk factors: falls, a family history of hip fractures, and a fairly long list of other health conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, hyperthyroidism and Parkinson’s disease. Smoking and excessive alcohol use increase the odds of osteoporosis as well. “A number of medications also do a number on your bone density,” Dr. Colon-Emeric added, notably steroids and prostate cancer drugs. When a scan reveals osteoporosis, depending on its severity, doctors may prescribe oral medications like Fosamax or Actonel, intravenous formulations like Reclast, daily self-injections of Forteo or Tymlos, or twice-annual injections of Prolia. Lifestyle changes like exercising, taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, stopping smoking and drinking only moderately will help, but aren’t sufficient to stop or reverse bone loss, Dr. Colon-Emeric said. Although guidelines don’t universally recommend it, at least not yet, she would like to see all men over 70 be screened, because the odds of disability after hip fractures are so high — two-thirds of older people will not regain their prior mobility, she noted — and the medications that treat it are effective and often inexpensive. But informing patients and health care professionals that osteoporosis threatens men, too, has progressed “at a snail’s pace,” Dr. Orwoll said. Dr. Klein remembers attending a seminar to instruct patients like him in using the drug Forteo. “I was the only male there,” he said.

83a7451c5057,‘Bluetoothing’: Blood-Sharing Drug Trend Fuels Alarming Global H.I.V. Surge,"disease rates, aids;hiv, drug abuse, hypodermic needles and syringes, blood, fatalities;casualties, unaids, africa, asia, fiji, internal-open-access-from-nl","A dangerous drug trend called “bluetoothing,” in which people inject themselves with the blood of other drug users to get a cheap high, is contributing to spikes in H.I.V. rates in infection hot spots around the world. The blood-sharing practice, which is many times riskier than sharing needles, has helped fuel one of the fastest-growing H.I.V. epidemics in Fiji and grown widespread in South Africa, another infection capital, according to public health authorities and researchers. The idea of sharing drug-laced blood is so unthinkably dangerous that for years, experts have questioned how common it is . But even if relatively few people do it, the practice can spread diseases like H.I.V. and hepatitis so quickly that experts say it requires a strong public health response. While the scale is hard to quantify, blood sharing has emerged in high-poverty areas in Africa and Asia, driven by tougher policing, spiking prices and falling drug supplies. “In settings of severe poverty, it’s a cheap method of getting high with a lot of consequences,” said Brian Zanoni, an Emory University professor who has studied drug injecting behaviors in South Africa. “You’re basically getting two doses for the price of one.” In Fiji, the authorities have identified bluetoothing as one force behind an alarming spiral in H.I.V. rates. The number of new H.I.V. infections rose 10-fold between since 2014 and 2024 , according to U.N.AIDS, a United Nations program, and an outbreak was declared there in January.

edb83a2b12a5,The Therapist Next Door,"therapy, college, dormitory, mental health","As a child, Xiomara Garcia, 21, assumed that attending a four-year college was out of reach. Her parents had never finished middle school, and money was tight. But there she was — a bioengineering major at Santa Clara University with a generous scholarship. In some of her classes, she was the only person of color. “It was like the biggest culture shock of my life,” Ms. Garcia said. She began to worry that she was an impostor who didn’t belong. Then a family member died. All of this, plus a stressful course load and unresolved childhood trauma, made it difficult to control her emotions. She tried online therapy, but finding a place to log in to her sessions privately, away from her roommate, proved difficult. Once, she talked to her therapist over video from underneath a stairwell on campus, steps away from a cafe. Eventually, she decided to see someone in person. Her new therapist had an office in the dorm where she had lived during her freshman year. The space included shells and rocks that her therapist had found, as well as soft lighting, cozy chairs and a basket of snacks — a welcome change from hiding in a busy building or braving the clinical environment of the main counseling center, she said. A growing number of campus mental health professionals, often referred to as “embedded counselors,” are now working out of dorms and other academic buildings. Schools say the setup reduces the stigma around getting help while also making the counselors more visible and accessible at a time when 37 percent of college students say they are grappling with depression. In a recent survey of school counseling center directors, nearly one-third said they used embedded counselors, up from 20 percent five years prior. The shift shows how colleges are rethinking the way they deliver mental health care, by adopting a model designed to meet students where they are, ideally before they face a crisis. “I used to come in crying every week,” Ms. Garcia said of her early counseling sessions. Now, two years later, she added, she feels more confident and better able to manage her feelings. Had she not found a therapist with a warm and inviting office who was also quickly accessible, she might not have kept going to therapy, she said. Late-night drop-ins At schools like Virginia Tech, which is nestled in a rural area between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains, on-campus counselors are a lifeline for many students because off-campus therapists are few and far between. But the main counseling office is about a 15-minute walk from the dorms and has traditional office hours, which can make it tough for busy students to squeeze in appointments. There are now four embedded counselors working out of a campus dorm who take drop-ins as late as 10 p.m. In the evening, as a student’s busy day winds down, “everything else is kind of coming to the surface ,” said Claire Cabellos, assistant director of embedded counseling at Virginia Tech. “Mental health crises don’t happen on a 9 to 5 schedule.” Since the introduction of embedded counselors, and other campus mental health initiatives, there have been fewer after-hours crisis calls and the resident assistants, also known as student leaders, have been more inclined to return to the role, Ms. Cabellos said. The student leaders were getting burned out and feeling stressed after being approached by students with urgent mental health concerns, she said. During the 2024-25 academic year, five embedded counselors saw 391 students for a total of 1,805 sessions. In 2022-23, the inaugural year, four embedded counselors saw 200 students and held 504 sessions. Some students have even been known to show up in their pajamas . Having the embedded counselors nearby — and available late at night — has been a big help to Rosi Escobar, 21, a student leader whose dorm is mostly full of first-year students. She has referred multiple students to the counselors, including one who was having a panic attack and another who hadn’t gotten out of bed all week. “I’m not the person who has to catch all these problems and fix it myself,” she said. It can be an enormous challenge for colleges and universities to provide accessible and quick mental health care to a large population of students. Data from the most recent Healthy Minds Survey , which was taken online by more than 84,000 students at colleges and universities across the country, found that only 47 percent of students who had reported screening positive for anxiety or depression said they had received counseling over the past year. Those who did not receive help cited roadblocks that included limited time, not knowing where to go, financial barriers and difficulty finding an appointment, among other issues. A friendly dog and an open door Kristin Tappan, a Santa Clara University graduate who is now a therapist there, is a familiar presence to many students. She’s often accompanied on campus by her dog, a Maltipoo named Tiramisu, and can sometimes be found handing out homemade lemon bars to students while introducing herself. It helps “make things feel a little bit more like home,” she said. “The doors are just a lot more open than I think they ever have been before,” she said. In one of her offices, which is set up like a family room, students will curl up in an armchair with Tiramisu nearby and talk about anything: what it’s like to live away from their family, relationship problems, academic stressors and worries about life after graduation. But oftentimes, Ms. Tappan said, deeper issues will surface, such as family trauma, like abuse, or problems with drugs or alcohol. “There’s so much under the surface,” she said. While there are several benefits to placing therapists in academic settings or dorms, the role can be particularly challenging . Melissa Bottiglio, a therapist and the assistant director of the Embedded Program at the University of Colorado Boulder, worked with a team to survey embedded providers across the United States and Canada in 2024 and found that counselors who work alone in academic buildings or dorms at times feel isolated, and find it harder to maintain boundaries when their work space intersects with campus life. “Counselors have to be firm about where their scope of care begins and ends,” she said. But when a school finds a formula that works, embedded counselors can draw in students who might otherwise feel hesitant to ask for help. The therapists can also tailor programming for specific campus groups. The University of Iowa currently has two embedded therapists supporting students in 11 residence halls. And Ohio State University now has 18 embedded clinicians located across its campus. The embedded counseling program at the University of Arizona, which started in 2020 with three counselors, currently has 12 counselors in places such as the Native American student affairs office, the medical school and the veterinary college. Sarah Heinzl, a licensed professional counselor at U.A., recalled a campus event where a student looked right at her, and joked, “We’ll talk about this on Friday.” Another student added, “My counselor is also here."" Later that week, after seeing how their peers had used the counseling services, several students stopped by her office to ask about them. “This is what embedded counseling does,” she said. “It breaks down misconceptions about therapy and normalizes counseling as part of their world. And when they see that, more students step forward to ask for help.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/well/mind/embedded-therapist-college-counselor.html,Health,BBC,By Christina Caron,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/well/WELL-DORM-THERAPIST1/WELL-DORM-THERAPIST1-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T14:11:59+00:00,88c2acc194e67b0f12069e4df9f64c0f7177efa7
3661d48e427e,Health Care Politics Bolster Democrats in Shutdown Fight,"us politics, legislation, obamacare;affordable care act;aca, health insurance, closings, federal budget, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, democrats, republicans, house of representatives, congress, senate, congress, hakeem jeffries, chuck schumer, mike johnson, john r thune, donald trump","When the top two Democrats in Congress sat down with President Trump in the Oval Office last week a day before the government was to shut down, they warned him that the coming fight was going to be politically painful for him and his party. If Republicans failed to agree to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies, as Democrats were demanding as a condition of any government funding deal, Mr. Trump and the G.O.P. would bear the brunt of the blowback from voters, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the two minority leaders from New York, told the president. Prices would spike for around 20 million Americans, they explained, including for many Trump voters. Mr. Trump did not dispute the point, saying that Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries were probably right, according to three people briefed on the private conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it. But he quickly added that he and Republicans would deflect blame back onto Democrats. A White House official said that Mr. Trump had disputed the argument by responding that everyone would make their own case to the public as to who was at fault. The exchange helps explain why Democrats believe they have the political upper hand in the shutdown fight, and why they are refusing to back down from their demands, at least for now. They believe that Mr. Trump, who has long been sensitive to the political perils of health care issues for Republicans, could be the key to winning a commitment on the expiring subsidies that could end the crisis. Democrats are keenly aware that Republicans in Congress are divided on extending the subsidies , with some of them, including those from competitive states and districts, sounding the alarm about the coming premium increases. “I made the point that the damage that’s being done to the health care of everyday Americans is hurting people who voted for him, and that is the reality,” Mr. Jeffries recently told reporters as he described the case he had made to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office that day. “It’s hurting everybody, but it’s certainly hurting people who voted for him.” Data backs up his point. According to KFF, a health policy research group, more than half of all people receiving insurance through the Affordable Care Act live in congressional districts represented by Republicans, with particularly high concentrations in southern states such as Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina, all of which have not expanded Medicaid under the 2010 law. And Mr. Trump’s longtime pollster, John McLaughlin, warned this summer in an op-ed that circulated widely among Republicans in Washington that a potential tax hike on more than 24 million working-class Americans could spell “potential political catastrophe for the G.O.P.” Still, despite Mr. Trump’s professed openness to a deal, and that of some rank-and-file Republicans, there is little appetite among G.O.P. leaders to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats enacted in 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic as a temporary measure to allow more Americans to obtain health coverage. Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader, have both said that significant changes would need to be made to how they are distributed before any extension could be brought to the floor. It is possible that the renewed subsidies could be approved in the House and Senate by Democrats and a minority of Republicans, but that is a scenario that both leaders would be eager to avoid. The Republican leaders have also insisted that they would not negotiate with Democrats until they vote to reopen government, creating the stubborn impasse. Democrats say they need a commitment on health care well beyond a promise of future negotiations, and they say Republicans have so far offered nothing close to that in informal discussions, let alone any formal talks. With Republicans on Capitol Hill resisting, Democrats see Mr. Trump and his natural inclination to cut a deal as providing a potential off-ramp as the shutdown drags on. “I’d like to see a deal made for great health care,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. “I’m a Republican, but I want to see health care much more so than the Democrats.” The remarks made Republicans on Capitol Hill nervous, and Mr. Trump quickly walked them back on Tuesday after speaking with Mr. Johnson. “I think Schumer is incapable of making a deal,” Mr. Trump said. “They are a mess. They’re a party that has no leadership — and they have no policy.” But Democrats are mostly holding firm, a sign of confidence that they are on the right side of the shutdown politics. As of Tuesday, not a single additional Democrat had crossed over to support Republicans’ stopgap bill to reopen the government, aside from the three aligned with Democrats who did so last week. Republicans had built their strategy for resolving the shutdown around the idea that they could break off anxious Democrats as the closure took a toll on federal services, and eventually push the spending bill through to passage. Instead, Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and broke ranks last week to back the G.O.P. bill, openly mused on Monday about withdrawing that support. “The best they’ve been able to tell us so far is that they’re open to conversations about solving the A.C.A. problem,” Mr. King said of Republicans. “That doesn’t cut it.” Mr. Thune on Tuesday said that Senate Democrats were being “bludgeoned” by the left to hold the line, and that he still held out hope that more would join Republicans. “They’re under enormous pressure from their leadership, but there are going to have to be some brave souls who are courageous enough to come out and deliver the votes to open up the government,” he said. In the House, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Republican from Georgia, chimed in with an improbable plug for Democrats’ position, saying that while she opposed the Affordable Care Act, she had learned that her “own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE” if Congress failed to act. But even Republicans who would back an extension of the subsidies say that they would only consider talks once the government is reopened. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said she had been privately circulating her own multipart proposal for ending the shutdown, but that negotiations centered on the Obamacare subsidies could begin only after the government were reopened. “There would be a commitment to having that discussion,” she said of the A.C.A. subsidy extension. Democrats said that the statements by Ms. Greene and the fact that Republicans were spending so much time talking about the health care issue showed that they had successfully made their case for the shutdown. “The bottom line is, they’re feeling the heat,” Mr. Schumer said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/us/politics/trump-democrats-shutdown-obamacare.html,Health,BBC,By Catie Edmondson and Carl Hulse,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07dc-aca-ltkw/07dc-aca-ltkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T22:38:10+00:00,63517df4c1729f043df8c9097fc24a0693d704af
701296c7df5f,"Seeking Covid Shots for Their Children, Some Parents Hit a Wall","pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, vaccines immunization, coronavirus;covid-19;pandemic, children, parenting, motherhood, fatherhood","Jill Schwartz has been searching Chicago for Covid shots for her three young children, ages 1, 3 and 5. She tried their pediatrician’s office. A pediatric clinic. Walgreens. No luck. In Womelsdorf, Pa., Rebecca Seidel has been trying to find a vaccine for her 7-year-old son. The pharmacist at a nearby CVS said that the store had no pediatric doses and that two other CVS locations didn’t either. So Ms. Seidel contacted the family’s pediatrician — who directed her to CVS. Leigh Bullion of Portland, Maine, also struggled to find shots for her 5- and 7-year-old sons. Her pediatrician did not have vaccines for children under 12. Neither did a supermarket-pharmacy chain. And the closest Walgreens offering pediatric doses was about 20 miles away. “It’s just like a nightmare,” Ms. Bullion said. The decisions of public-health agencies under President Trump and his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have created new obstacles for many people seeking Covid vaccines . But it has been particularly difficult to secure shots for children, including infants and toddlers under the age of 2, who are at higher risk of severe illness from Covid even if they are healthy. In August, the Food and Drug Administration limited approval of the latest Covid shots , authorizing them only for adults 65 and older and younger people with certain health conditions. A few weeks later, a vaccine advisory panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its own guidance , saying that anyone 6 months and up could get the vaccine in consultation with a medical provider. Children under 12 need a different version of the Covid vaccines. Many pediatricians, as well as pharmacies that carry adult formulations, aren’t stocking pediatric doses. Some cite low demand, but others cite uncertainty about the federal guidelines and logistical problems, including one in particular: The F.D.A. limited its approval of Pfizer’s vaccine to ages 5 and up, which left the Moderna vaccine as the only option for younger children. Representatives for Moderna and Pfizer said their companies had enough doses to meet demand. But some providers have told parents that they didn’t place orders because of the regulatory confusion. Some were waiting for the interim C.D.C. leader’s formal approval of the vaccine panel’s recommendations, which was announced Monday, about two weeks after the panel had voted. Others stocked Pfizer’s pediatric doses in past years and are scrambling to determine the feasibility of a new contract with Moderna. Two parents who spoke with The New York Times said their pediatricians had cited the need to switch to Moderna as one reason they didn’t have Covid vaccines for children under 5. Dr. Sean O’Leary, the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on infectious diseases, said he had heard the same from providers. The A.A.P. recommends Covid vaccination for children under 2 regardless of their overall health status. It also recommends the shot for older children who have high-risk conditions, those in close contact with high-risk people and those who haven’t received a Covid vaccine before. The group says the shot should be available to any child whose parents want it. For pediatricians, the ambiguity of the C.D.C. panel’s recommendations is another concern: It called for doctors to change how they obtain informed consent and to “discuss the risks and benefits” of vaccines with patients, but didn’t specify how. Some providers are grappling with the fact that, because the F.D.A. limited its approval to people who are 65 and older or who have a high-risk condition, many of the Covid vaccinations they would administer would be off label. This refers to giving a drug or vaccine to a group, or for a purpose, that the F.D.A. hasn’t approved it for, and C.D.C. recommendations don’t change that status. Doctors have the legal authority to prescribe off label, but some are uneasy about it. In an email shared by one parent on the condition that the practice not be named, a pediatrician’s office in Virginia wrote that off-label use “raises important considerations, including the need to consult our malpractice insurance and other regulatory provisions.” (The office, which confirmed the authenticity of the email, ultimately decided to offer the shots.) Dr. Thomas Nguyen, a pediatrician in Canton, Ohio, said he and his colleagues had needed to discuss whether they could vaccinate in the period after the F.D.A. issued its limited approval but before the C.D.C. weighed in. They ultimately placed “a small order” with Moderna on Sept. 11, he said, and shots were delivered Sept. 17. But it took another week to decide how best to document the risk-benefit conversations that the C.D.C. panel had called for. It is very unusual for doctors to have to navigate a disagreement between the recommendations of the C.D.C. and the A.A.P., Dr. Nguyen said, adding, “We always felt some protection by acting based on expert guidance.” The Trump administration’s actions have compounded existing challenges to pediatric Covid vaccine access. One is cost: If providers don’t think there will be enough demand, they are often loath to risk losing money by ordering shots that they might not be able to administer. Then there’s the anti-vaccine sentiment that Mr. Kennedy has helped stoke among some parents. “The confusion that’s coming out of the federal government is just magnifying all of those problems,” Dr. O’Leary said. Andrew Nixon, a representative for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in a statement that the F.D.A. had authorized pediatric vaccines and that federal insurance programs would cover them, but he did not address questions about their availability. Pharmacies say they are doing their best within legal limits. Regardless of F.D.A. and C.D.C. decisions, some states have higher minimum ages than others for pharmacists to vaccinate, with variation depending on the vaccine. In New York, for example, pharmacists can currently give Covid shots to children 3 and older, which makes access exceedingly difficult for the high-risk under-2 group if their pediatricians don’t stock the vaccine. Amy Thibault, a representative for CVS, said select CVS pharmacies nationwide had Covid vaccines available for children 5 and up. She added that all MinuteClinics — medical facilities inside some CVS stores that have more regulatory freedom than pharmacies — were vaccinating children 18 months and older. Only about 10 percent of CVS locations have a MinuteClinic. Walgreens and Walmart did not respond to inquiries about pediatric vaccine availability, and a Costco representative said only that parents should “continue to visit our website and check the scheduler for availability.” But many parents are trawling websites, calling and showing up to every provider they can think of, often to no avail. Some have succeeded in finding shots only after weeks of persistence. Ms. Bullion, the Portland mother, managed to find a CVS with appointments for pediatric doses available for mid-October. After a month of trying, Ms. Seidel still hasn’t found a Covid shot for her son. Neither has Ms. Schwartz for her three children. In Santa Fe, N.M., Caitlin Smith and her partner got their own shots on Sept. 7, but their children were turned away. Over three weeks, she contacted various pharmacies citywide before finding one offering pediatric doses on Sept. 28. The pharmacist told her he had received only 10 of them. “It feels like the system for pediatric Covid vaccines is designed on the assumption that parents are vaccine-hesitant,” Ms. Smith said. “It’s extraordinarily frustrating for parents who are not hesitant and want to protect our kids.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/well/covid-vaccine-children-parents-issues-rfk-jr.html,Health,BBC,By Maggie Astor,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07WELL-PEDIATRIC-VACCINE2-wbgq/07WELL-PEDIATRIC-VACCINE2-wbgq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T15:15:02+00:00,0c2cdf51e3cf2db6a76ccffda79e3eba67141abe

A History of the Practice.,"therapy, gay and lesbian;lgbt;lgbtq;gay;lesbian, psychiatry, youth, us politics, gender, supreme court;scotus","As a teenager, Julie Rodgers attended Tuesday night group therapy sessions in which young people confessed their same-sex transgressions: anal sex, fondling, masturbation, reaching out to an ex or watching “The L Word,” a television show about lesbians. What followed was a kind of psychological analysis, in which participants looked for reasons for their lapses. Maybe they had slipped because of a painful conversation with a parent, or a failure at school or work. Understanding those circuits, the group leader told them, would allow them to reprogram their brains and live as heterosexuals. Ms. Rodgers’s support group promoted conversion therapy, a practice that uses a range of techniques in an attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The practice surged in popularity among evangelical Christian communities in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically involves talk therapy and cognitive behavioral approaches, which seek to reshape habitual thought patterns. “I felt like I had to tell Ricky everything, every sexual attraction or feeling or crush that I might have,” Ms. Rodgers, now an out lesbian, told the producers of “Pray Away,” a documentary from 2021. “I felt the need to report if I had a lesbian boss or lesbian customers that came in at the restaurant where I worked. Let’s say I had acted out sexually with someone — I would definitely have to confess that.” A 2019 study by the Williams Institute at the U.C.L.A. School of Law estimated that roughly 698,000 adults in the United States had received some kind of conversion therapy, around half of them as adolescents. In the late 1990s, medical organizations began to speak out against the practice, citing a growing body of research that showed it was ineffective and potentially harmful. A number of states went on to ban the practice, beginning with California in 2012. The Supreme Court will hear a challenge on Tuesday to Colorado’s ban, with implications for more than 20 states with similar laws . There is some evidence that the practice continues despite the bans. In 2023, researchers for the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention among young L.G.B.T.Q. people, identified 1,320 counselors whose professional profiles showed they offered conversion therapy, sometimes using language like “sexual addiction.” About half of them held professional licenses, while the other half were ministers or pastors. “Unfortunately, there is rarely any evidence to indicate that these providers have recanted their belief in the ability to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity, or are no longer willing to try,” the report said. In earlier decades, psychiatrists tested so-called aversive therapies, such as delivering electric shocks or nausea-inducing drugs to people experiencing sexual arousal, in an effort to train them to avoid thoughts of same-sex attraction. But medical organizations had largely rejected those harsher approaches by 1973, when the American Psychiatric Association declared that it would no longer consider homosexuality itself a mental disorder .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/us/politics/conversion-therapy-supreme-court.html,Health,BBC,By Ellen Barry,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07scotus-conversion-therapy-what-is-llws/07scotus-conversion-therapy-what-is-llws-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T13:08:26+00:00,781399f9c5cf5ffe6e5fdcd898e53bacc6327d54
5519c2786bdf,How to Protect Your Pets From Pollution,"hazmat, air pollution, lead, animals, pet, veterinary medicine, chemicals, pollution, internal-open-access-from-nl","Although there is still much to learn about how pollution affects pets , it’s clear that smoky skies, contaminated water and toxin-laden house dust can be serious health hazards for a wide range of animals. The good news, experts say, is that many of the steps that we take to protect ourselves from pollutants and environmental contaminants can also reduce the risks for our animal companions. Here are some simple steps that experts recommend. During air quality crises When wildfires are raging nearby, or outdoor air quality has plummeted for other reasons, owners should limit the amount of time their animals spend outside, experts said. That means taking dogs for quick bathroom breaks instead of long, leisurely walks, and skipping any vigorous physical activities that could increase an animal’s respiration rate. Giving pets a quick once-over with a cleansing wipe or a damp towel when bringing them inside can also help because some pollutants have a tendency to cling to animal fur. Keep indoor air clean by ensuring that windows and doors remain closed and by running a high-quality air purifier. Smoky or polluted air can also dry out the respiratory tract, so ensure that pets have plenty of fresh, clean drinking water. Consider protecting your pet’s eyes. “If your eyes are itchy, your dog’s eyes are most likely also itchy,” said Dr. Michala de Linde Henriksen, a veterinary ophthalmologist at North Carolina State University who has studied the effects of wildfire smoke. Two over-the-counter products — an eyewash and lubricating eye drops — can help keep an animal’s eyes moisturized and irritant-free, Dr. de Linde Henriksen said. Rubbing, squinting, redness, tearing or discharge are all signs to consult with a veterinarian, she added. “Seek veterinary help if you have any concerns,” she said.

6a3410e7d178,"In a Toxic World, Pets Could Be Vital Health Watchdogs","pet, animals, pollution, hazmat, wildfires, air pollution, cat, dog, research, disesases;health;illness;medicine, veterinary medicine, ohio train derailment","On a frigid February night in 2023, a freight train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. For days, the train’s hazardous contents spilled into the surrounding soil, water and air. It was an environmental and public health catastrophe, and efforts are underway to monitor the long-term health effects on the people of East Palestine. But one team of scientists is focused on a different group of local residents: the dogs. After the derailment, the researchers recruited dog owners in and around East Palestine, asking them to attach chemical-absorbing silicone tags to their pets’ collars. The preliminary results, which have not yet been published, suggest that dogs living closest to the crash site were exposed to unusually high levels of certain chemicals. The researchers are now analyzing blood samples from the dogs to determine whether the chemicals may have triggered genetic changes associated with cancer. “This is what we should be doing in the wake of any of these disasters,” said Elinor Karlsson, a geneticist at UMass Chan Medical School and the Broad Institute, who is leading the research. “The pets that live in our homes are being exposed to the same things we’re going to be exposed to.” Our pets breathe the same air, drink the same water and often sleep in the same beds that we do. And yet, there is relatively little research on how environmental toxins and pollutants affect our animal companions. That is an enormous missed opportunity, experts said. Our pets, they argued, are ideally situated to act as environmental health sentinels, helping scientists identify hazards that transcend species barriers. Understanding more about how pollution affects pets could ultimately yield insights that improve both animal and human health. “I do like to use the analogy of the canary in the coal mine, with this one distinction, which is that canaries were sacrificial,” said Dr. Audrey Ruple, a veterinary epidemiologist at Virginia Tech. “Our dogs are not. We care deeply about our companion dogs and our companion animals.” The air out there In 2020, California experienced a record-setting wildfire season, one that often left the skies filled with smoke. On particularly bad days, Stephen Jarvis, a graduate student in the Bay Area, found himself with headaches, irritated eyes, shortness of breath and even chest pains. He also noticed the effects in his partner’s asthmatic cat, Manolo. “On days when the air quality was worse, his symptoms would flare and he would have a hard time breathing,” Dr. Jarvis said. Last week, Dr. Jarvis, now an assistant professor at the London School of Economics, published a paper suggesting that Manolo’s breathing problems were not a one-off. He and his colleagues reviewed five years of veterinary data from across Britain, alongside data on the levels of airborne fine particulate matter, which is one of the main pollutants in wildfire smoke and a well-known human health hazard. When air pollution rose, so did the number of veterinary visits for cats and dogs, the researchers found. If the nation kept air pollution below the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization, it could prevent between 80,000 and 290,000 vet visits per year, they concluded. “That’s a lot of angst and a lot of money off the table for pet owners,” Dr. Jarvis said. It’s a sobering finding, especially given the fact that climate change and intensifying wildfires are expected to make air quality worse in the coming decades. “When we are considering how to protect ourselves from unhealthy air, we should also be thinking about our pets and wildlife,” said Olivia Sanderfoot, an ecologist at Cornell who studies the effects of smoke on wild animals . Smoke inhalation can cause an array of respiratory problems in animals, including coughing and shortness of breath. Studies have also begun to link wildfire smoke to other health consequences, including eye infections and cellular stress in dogs and heart problems and blood clots in cats. Birds are especially vulnerable because they are highly efficient breathers, extracting more oxygen from the air than mammals do. Unfortunately, Dr. Sanderfoot said, that means that they are also “processing higher concentrations of all of the nasty stuff” in polluted air. “They are more sensitive overall to air pollution than we are.” Heavy burdens Cats and dogs, which tend to spend a lot of time on or near the ground, could be at elevated risk from other chemical contaminants. Compared to humans, they may have more exposure to cancer-causing chemicals used in lawn care or the heavy metals, like lead, that tend to accumulate in household dust. In 2014, when lead began leaching into the drinking water in Flint, Mich., there was reason to believe that pets were especially vulnerable. Unlike people, pets usually “subsist wholly” on tap water, said John Buchweitz, a veterinary toxicologist at Michigan State University. After Dr. Buchweitz and his colleagues set up lead-screening clinics for local dogs, they found several animals whose results were of “extreme concern,” including three Australian shepherds all living in the same household. The dogs had been losing weight and behaving strangely, and all three had elevated lead levels in their blood. Dr. Buchweitz was alarmed; he knew that the family living there also had young children. “I personally reached out, contacted the health department, and said ‘This house needs to be investigated,’” he recalled. Officials subsequently found that the drinking water at the home contained enough lead to pose a clear danger to both people and animals. Known unknowns Although a chemical spill, wildfire or water crisis can present an acute, immediate health risk, many environmental health hazards are harder to identify: Does regular, low-level exposure to a particular pollutant, for instance, increase someone’s lifetime cancer risk? Pets have shorter lives than people, and are more likely to live them out in a single geographic location, making it easier for scientists to tease out some of these subtle effects. Plus, the devotion of pet owners helps facilitate data collection, experts said. “People are worried about their pets,” said Dr. Karlsson, who leads Darwin’s Dogs , a large community science project that aims to identify the genetic and environmental contributors to canine health and behavior. “And as a scientist, that’s an opportunity. Because if people are concerned about it, then they’re going to help us with the work.” Tens of thousands of American dog owners have enrolled their pets in Darwin’s Dogs and similar initiatives, including the Dog Aging Project and the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study . Among other data, these projects are collecting information on some of these dogs’ everyday exposure to chemicals, measuring the levels of herbicides in their urine , mailing out silicone, chemical-absorbing dog tags and asking owners to submit samples of their dogs’ drinking water . To Dr. Ruple, who led the Dog Aging Project’s pilot studies with silicone tags and drinking water, the owners seemed more eager to participate than they would have been in research on their own environmental health risks. “I think that people are quite suspicious of science at this point in time,” she said. “But their love for their dogs overrides whatever distrust they might have.” And the dogs, in turn, can give back, helping scientists identify chemicals that put both humans and animals at risk. After all, Dr. Ruple noted, the word “sentinel” refers to someone whose job is keeping watch. “That’s what we have always used dogs for,” she said. “Guardians of our livestock, guardians of our family, guardians of our homes.” And in a toxic world, perhaps, guardians of our health.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/science/pets-health-pollution.html,Health,BBC,By Emily Anthes,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/science/07sci-pet-sentinel-cover-illo/07sci-pet-sentinel-cover-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T07:00:05+00:00,76a548e44c75ee5d532956ef9ade8d4feab87ea1
95b5d4ef57f4,The Pressure of Dating With a Fertility Deadline,"dating, single people, women and girls, infertility, donor eggs, egg freezing","In the past, Kelly Shara, 31, often found herself doing fertility math when she was on a date. “OK, if we date for a year, then I’ll be this age when we get married,” explained Ms. Shara, who lives in Austin and works in tech sales. “Then we have a year, and then we could start having kids. And then that means I’ll be this age when I become a mom.” She absorbed the message for years — “from rom-coms and so much societal pressure” — that she should be married and having babies by age 30, she said. For the most part, Ms. Shara now finds that expectation silly. She has great friends and a fulfilling career and is unwilling to settle for a partner who isn’t a true teammate. If it weren’t for her pesky biological clock. “I would still love to have kids on the soon-ish side,” Ms. Shara said. “But there is an opportunity cost toward rushing dating and marriage and courtship and trying to find the right person.” The stubborn notion that women’s fertility falls off a cliff at 35 has slowly shifted in recent years, thanks to changing cultural norms and leaps in assisted reproductive technology. Despite growing alarm among conservatives over the United States’ historically low birthrate, women over 35 are actually giving birth in relatively large numbers. The birthrate among women 40 to 44 has even risen over the past four decades . “With many celebrities becoming first-time parents later in life, it often gives the public the perception that fertility is something you can delay,” said Dr. Natalie Crawford, a fertility doctor in Austin and the author of “The Fertility Formula.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

6880bbab5d8b,"Trump Has Not Ruled Out Invoking Insurrection Act to Deploy National Guard, Vance Says","j.d. vance, insurrection act, military, nbc news, gaza strip, israel, middle east, us, federalism","Vice President JD Vance said on Sunday President Trump was “looking at all of his options"" to deploy the National Guard in major cities, including invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, which grants the president emergency powers to deploy troops on U.S. soil during major unrest. In an interview on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Mr. Vance said Mr. Trump “has not felt he needed to” invoke the Insurrection Act “right now,” but he has not ruled it out. Last week, Mr. Trump said he saw the Insurrection Act as “a way to get around” recent court rulings blocking his efforts to deploy the guard to fight crime and put down protests against the government’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Generally speaking, the Insurrection Act gives the president the power to send military forces to states to quell widespread public unrest and to support civilian law enforcement agencies. Mr. Vance, echoing the president’s arguments, claimed on NBC News that crime was “out of control” in major cities, pointing to violent attacks against immigration officers. In the interview, Mr. Vance also addressed the cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by Mr. Trump, who was scheduled to travel to Israel on Sunday to celebrate the breakthrough. The vice president refuted reports that 200 American troops would be sent to the Middle East to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire deal in Gaza. He said that the U.S. Central Command, which already has American troops stationed in that part of the world, would “monitor the terms of the cease-fire” and “ensure that the humanitarian aid is flowing.” But the administration had no plans to deploy additional ground troops in Israel or Gaza, he said. “We’re not planning to have boots on the ground,” he said. As the cease-fire held for a third day on Sunday, Israelis and Palestinians were preparing on Sunday for an exchange of all of the living hostages still held in Gaza for about 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. Of the 48 hostages the Israel lists as still in Gaza, the government believes that 20 remain alive. Mr. Vance said the living hostages should be released “any moment now” but cast some doubt as to whether the remains of all dead hostages would be able to be returned. “I think the reality is that some of the hostages we may never get back,” he said, referring to their remains, in an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But I do think that most of them, with some efforts, we’ll be able to give them to their families, so they at least have some closure.” In the NBC News interview, Mr. Vance also denied that Mr. Trump was conducting a retribution campaign against his perceived political enemies, including James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who were both recently indicted by the Trump-installed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan. Mr. Trump “having opinions doesn’t mean that we prosecute people unless we have the legal justification to do so,” Mr. Vance said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/us/politics/jd-vance-trump-insurrection-act.html,politics,BBC,By Ashley Ahn,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12trump-news-vance-nbc-cfbk/12trump-news-vance-nbc-cfbk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T20:51:18+00:00,98e28fc33f5cbcbae35dca82b984fc46307a5e51

He is then scheduled to travel to Egypt, where he and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will lead a summit to discuss the peace process in Gaza with more than 20 countries. A spokeswoman for the Israeli government, Shosh Bedrosian, told reporters in Tel Aviv on Sunday that the hostages were expected to be released at one time to the Red Cross early Monday morning local time. They will be transferred initially to the Re’im military base in southern Israel, where they will reunite with their families, she said. According to Vice President JD Vance, Mr. Trump plans to “welcome them in person.” Mr. Vance, speaking on the Fox News program “Sunday Morning Futures,” also raised doubts about whether the bodies of all the dead hostages would be returned. “I think the reality is that some of the hostages we may never get back,” he said, referring to their remains, “but I do think most of them, with some effort, we’ll be able to give them to their families so they at least have some closure.” The summit meeting in Egypt will be held at Sharm el-Sheikh, a Red Sea resort, where mediators recently hammered out a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to free Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a partial pullback of Israeli forces. The cease-fire, which took effect on Friday morning, is the first phase of an agreement brokered by the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to end the two-year war, with the next phases still to be negotiated. Mr. Trump put pressure on both sides to break the deadlock. Several Arab nations who support Mr. Trump’s peace plan will attend the summit, along with the U.N. secretary-general and the heads of state from the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was invited to participate, according to Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior Palestinian official, and was expected to attend.

0318e48c28ae,Trump Announces Longtime Aide Dan Scavino as Head of Personnel,"dan scavino, sergio gor, donald trump, us politics, appointments and executive changes, layoffs;furloughs, 2016 presidential election","President Trump announced early Sunday that he was appointing Dan Scavino, a deputy chief of staff and one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted advisers, as the head of the presidential personnel office. Mr. Scavino will replace Sergio Gor, whom Mr. Trump in August said he would nominate to be the U.S. ambassador to India . The personnel office role has traditionally been largely administrative but can come with significant power. This could be particularly true under a president who has been focused on whether prospective staff members meet his perception of loyalty. The office helps the president hire and fire thousands of political appointees. “Dan will be responsible for the selection and appointment of almost all positions in government, a very big and important position,” Mr. Trump said in a social media post . He added that Mr. Scavino would retain his role as deputy chief of staff. Mr. Scavino’s appointment comes as the presidential personnel office is mired in uncertainty about whether hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed because of the government shutdown will automatically receive back pay once the government reopens. The Trump administration has indicated in a private memo that only workers who are deemed essential may be automatically entitled to pay once the stalemate ends. But the office said in a question-and-answer document posted online that “employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” Both Mr. Scavino and his predecessor, Mr. Gor, have been valued by Mr. Trump for their perceived loyalty. Mr. Scavino was Mr. Trump’s golf caddy and one of the original aides in his 2016 presidential campaign. He helped craft the first Trump campaign’s social media presence , and he is among a small group of aides who have earned Mr. Trump’s confidence. He served as the White House deputy chief of staff for communications in the final months of Mr. Trump’s first administration, and last year was named a deputy chief of staff after Mr. Trump’s re-election. Mr. Gor helped run the publishing company that produced Mr. Trump’s books, and he ran a multimillion-dollar super PAC that supported Mr. Trump. Under his leadership, the personnel office helped conduct loyalty tests for applicants for government posts. Some applicants for the jobs, including those inside the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies, said they were asked which political candidates they had supported, their thoughts about the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and whether they believed the 2020 election was stolen, according to some applicants and those involved in the process.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/us/politics/dan-scavino-trump-white-house-personnel.html,politics,BBC,By Yan Zhuang,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12xp-scavino-tgwp/12xp-scavino-tgwp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T13:16:49.578000+00:00,499c6cba6f5a20f4fa0e17e60b8173deba2846de
7edec576afc3,Air Traffic Controllers Reject Credit for Ending the Last Shutdown,"faa, us politics, air traffic control, airlines;airplanes, civil service, closings, delays, american federation of government employees, embry-riddle aeronautical university worldwide, national air traffic controllers association, tsa","The political debate around the government shutdown has elevated one group of federal workers above others: air traffic controllers. Because of their role in protecting public safety, controllers are required to work through a shutdown without pay, adding stress to a workplace with severe staffing shortages and raising fears that workers calling in sick could cause the national airspace to fall into disarray. Controllers missing work was widely cited as the reason the last shutdown came to an end in 2019. But that assumption was overblown, according to controllers, aviation safety experts and congressional aides from both parties, some of whom said that the Trump administration and its allies were fanning fears of a controller walkout amid the current shutdown to pressure lawmakers into making a deal to end it. “That narrative is false,” said Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. He argued that staffing dips in 2019 and last week, which caused the F.A.A. to slow air traffic at some major airports, were troubling but normal. “The delays before the shutdown were longer than the delays the last three days,” Mr. Daniels said, adding: “We shouldn’t be the rope in this tug of war.” The 2019 shutdown was entering its 35th day when lawmakers woke up to the news that the F.A.A. had ordered a ground stop at LaGuardia Airport because of controller shortages at two other airports on the East Coast. Hours later, President Trump announced from the White House Rose Garden that Democrats and Republicans had a deal to reopen the government. By that evening, the House and Senate had passed a bill to do so. But according to experts, congressional aides and contemporary news accounts, the air service delays were merely “ icing on the cake ,” as one official put it in 2019, for a Republican Party and a president already resolved to quit a losing battle. “I don’t think it was solely the air traffic control work force that elevated the problem or brought attention to it,” said Michael McCormick, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University who previously led the F.A.A.’s air traffic control operations, including through multiple shutdowns. “I think it was other key sectors in government that also were being impacted, such as T.S.A.” The weekend before the 2019 shutdown ended, the T.S.A. reported that 10 percent of its workers had called in sick — a more than threefold increase over normal levels. Major furloughs at the Internal Revenue Service had also started to collide with the beginning of tax filing season, delaying processing times and refunds. And Senate Republicans were tiring of opinion polls showing the public largely blaming the G.O.P. for the shutdown, and were threatening mutiny. That shutdown, which began a few days before Christmas, spanned a major political shift in Washington. Barely two weeks into it, the G.O.P.’s control over both houses of Congress and the presidency gave way to a divided legislature. Forty new House Democrats were sworn in, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, was reinstalled as speaker. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, appeared to step back from the negotiations, which had been centered on whether Congress would fund Mr. Trump’s border wall, and left them to the president and Ms. Pelosi. As they debated, the Senate did not vote on bills to fund the government until the day before the shutdown ended. And in a sign of the frustration that had been mounting for weeks, six Senate Republicans that afternoon supported the Democrats’ proposal to reopen the government without border wall money. According to news reports at the time , Mr. McConnell that evening convinced Mr. Trump to concede. But it was not until the next day, several hours after the widely publicized airport delays, that Mr. Trump publicly backed down. This time around, the politics are different, and the focus on air travel as a factor in ending the shutdown appears to be happening earlier. Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, made several public appearances last week to highlight the plight of air traffic controllers and what he called a “slight tick-up” in absences, casting them as a potential inflection point in the shutdown. Like the rest of the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers, he blamed the funding impasse on Democrats. “The bottom line is these controllers are stressed out, and they’re rebelling on the shutdown because they may not get paid,” Mr. Duffy said in one Fox News interview, claiming that 53 percent of the delays last week were caused by staffing problems. In an appearance on Fox Business , Mr. Duffy suggested that as many as 10 percent of controllers were not showing up for work, surmising that they were staging a “lash-out at Democrats.” He also threatened to fire “problem children” who were not showing up for work. “If we have some on our staff that aren’t dedicated, like we need, we’re going to let them go,” he said. Air traffic controllers have been particularly sensitive to the suggestion that they have been walking off the job even before missing a paycheck. They are expected to receive a partial paycheck on Tuesday, which will not include time they have worked since the shutdown began. They will receive back pay once the shutdown ends. The controllers’ union does not dispute the F.A.A.’s claim that last week’s delays were caused by absences that left some shifts with only about half the necessary staffing. But its members say that is not a phenomenon unique to the shutdown. According to a recent F.A.A. publication , the agency had only 11,683 certified professional controllers and certified professional controllers in training, far short of the 14,633 the agency said it needed late last year. Union leaders say that has caused many towers to operate at severely depressed staffing levels, meaning it could take just one or two controllers calling in sick to trigger a ground stop or other delays. “Every day there is a facility that we have to do alternate procedures for, because there’s not enough air traffic controllers for it,” Mr. Daniels said. He cited the example of a tower in Midland, Texas, which he said had filled only 45 percent of its positions and had handed at least part of its radar operations over to a different air traffic control facility in Fort Worth. “You’re seeing the result of an extremely fragile system that we have to contend with,” he said. Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University, said that the focus on controllers has been politically strategic, especially in the wake of the Jan. 29 collision between a commercial jet and a military helicopter outside Washington that killed 67 people, which heightened the public’s awareness of air travel safety. “The parties want to get the public on their side,” she said, adding that delayed and missed flights were a “visceral type of pain that people can see and understand"" — and tie back to Washington. “That’s in part why there’s the focus on air traffic and airport delays,” she said. But in this shutdown, other parts of the aviation sector may end up affecting passengers sooner. Last week, “call outs” in the T.S.A. began to rise — including as many as 50 of the 225 or so officers at Philadelphia International Airport who skipped work or showed up late on Monday. “A lot of people don’t want to get to their last dollar before they make preparations,” said Johnny Jones, Secretary-Treasurer of American Federation of Government Employees’ T.S.A. Council 100, the union representing T.S.A. officials. “We want to come to work, we’re willing to come to work, we’re going to come into work as long as we can,” Mr. Jones added. “But you know what? Gas stations don’t take I.O.U.s. Child care don’t take I.O.U.s.” On Friday, T.S.A. workers, who also must work unpaid until the shutdown ends, began to receive some of their final pay until the government reopens. A T.S.A. representative said last week that recent call outs had not caused delays in airport operations.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/us/politics/air-traffic-controllers-shutdown.html,politics,BBC,By Karoun Demirjian,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/09/multimedia/09dc-airtraffic-fqpv/09dc-airtraffic-fqpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:01:19.182000+00:00,3bb3e4c6e3181c2ae3814a6ba71eb65594112e6c

Another is a member of the Trumpettes, a group of women united in their ardent support for the president. A third is a retired grocery salesman who said he didn’t remember signing up to be involved in a lawsuit. The three are among the 12 Louisiana voters at the center of a case set to be heard by the Supreme Court on Wednesday that could gut what remains of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the landmark civil-rights-era legislation . In January 2024, the group filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Louisiana’s congressional district map, arguing state lawmakers had discriminated against them as white voters by impermissibly taking race into account when they drafted the map after the 2020 census. Since then, they’ve been referred to in court filings merely as the “non-African-American” voters. Plaintiffs in such weighty Supreme Court cases often become the public faces of major issues in American life, their names forever tied to the historic legal challenges: Fred Korematsu became a civil rights icon for resisting an executive order that forced Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II. Mildred and Richard Loving successfully challenged Virginia’s ban on interracial marriage in a landmark case. Not so in the Louisiana case. The landmark case, on whether the Constitution permits race to be used as a factor in carving congressional districts, has had no public face. None of the plaintiffs testified at a three-day trial in federal court, according to transcripts. The legal briefs list their names but say nothing about their lives or the reasons each chose to participate in the case, aside from assertions that each “suffered unlawful, intentional discrimination based on race.” “I genuinely don’t know who these people are,” said Stuart C. Naifeh, manager of the Redistricting Project at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which has been involved in the litigation and will be defending the map at the Supreme Court. Plaintiffs in a lawsuit must be able to show that they were directly harmed by the party they are suing and that there is a possibility that a court could remedy the harm. By the time a case gets to the Supreme Court, the justices are dealing with the law, not factual disputes. Although some plaintiffs attend Supreme Court proceedings, they do not testify or participate in the argument. The New York Times used public records, social media and court filings to locate and reach out to several of the voters at the heart of the case. They hail from big cities like Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Lafayette and tiny ones like Gonzales, population 13,000, known as the Jambalaya Capital of the World. One man is 38. Two plaintiffs, a man and a woman, are 81 years old. Exactly how they came together remains unclear, but they are represented by a local Louisiana lawyer who has for decades challenged the use of race in the drawing of voting maps. Their relative anonymity demonstrates a reality of how modern landmark Supreme Court cases often come together. Some of the most consequential cases are crafted from the start by lawyers and advocacy groups hoping to achieve a particular legal result rather than arising organically from plaintiffs who claim they will be most affected by the outcome. That strategy, of course, isn’t new. Cases challenging segregated schools , anti-sodomy laws and the right to abortion have relied heavily on lawyers’ ability to find the right plaintiffs. But the human stories at the heart of those cases often took center stage. The Voting Rights Act case will be known by the court and in history as Callais, the last name of the lead plaintiff, Phillip Callais, 60. Reached by phone, Mr. Callais, who goes by Bert, referred questions to lawyers in the case, as did several other plaintiffs. Those lawyers declined to comment. A veteran who lives near Baton Rouge, Mr. Callais testified before a committee of Louisiana lawmakers tasked with creating the new voting map in January 2024. At the time, the legislators were working on a compressed schedule to come up with a map that they could all agree on. They had already tried once, adopting a map in 2022 that contained only one majority-Black district, even though the 2020 census showed that Black people made up an increased share of the state’s eligible voters. A group of Black voters sued, and after a weeklong hearing in June 2022, a federal judge determined those plaintiffs were likely to succeed in proving that the state’s map violated the Voting Rights Act. Under the act, courts have said states are prohibited from drawing voting maps that unlawfully dilute minorities’ voting power. If they failed to agree to a new version, state lawmakers faced the possibility a judge would draw the map for them. Wearing a blue-and-white dress shirt and glasses, Mr. Callais sat at a wooden table at the Louisiana House committee meeting, video shows . He told the legislators that he had been a member of a board of election supervisors. He acknowledged the state’s troubled history of racial segregation, telling lawmakers that he had “supported desegregation when my grandparents and my parents didn’t exactly do so, given the time of the ’60s, early ’70s.” But he raised concerns about whether lawmakers would have the courage “to stand up to a federal judge” in the voting-map case. He said he saw the state’s attempt to draw two majority-Black districts as another type of segregation based on race. When Mr. Callais finished talking, a man in a dark gray suit and tie took his place. He introduced himself as Paul Hurd, a lawyer who had led challenges related to voting maps for 30 years around the country. “I have never represented anyone but voters,” Mr. Hurd said. “I believe in compact contiguous districts for white, Black, Asian voters that live together, work together, go to school together.” He called the map under consideration — including a second majority-Black district that snaked diagonally across the state from the southeast to the northwest — “a racial gerrymander,” urging them to “stand up for the Constitution” and reject it. Instead, lawmakers adopted the new map the next day and sent it to Jeff Landry, the state’s Republican governor. He had repeatedly pressed the State Legislature to pass it, rather than to allow “some heavy-handed federal judge” to do it for them. The lawmaker who filed the legislation, Glen Womack, a Republican state representative, asserted that “politics drove this map,” as opposed to race. Republican lawmakers argued they had crafted it to protect three valuable Republican incumbents: House Speaker Mike Johnson; Steve Scalise, the majority leader; and Representative Julia Letlow. Within two weeks, Mr. Hurd filed the suit, listing Mr. Callais and 11 other Louisianans, each described in the document as a voter who had been discriminated against by the new map. Mr. Hurd declined to speak about his plaintiffs. One of them, Albert “Skip” Caissie Jr., 78, said in a phone interview that he wasn’t aware that he was involved in a Supreme Court case. Mr. Caissie, who is retired from grocery sales and the Coast Guard Reserve, speculated that perhaps he had received “a direct mail piece” about challenging the voting map. He said he supported the suit’s aims and hoped the need to have majority-minority districts was “something in the past.” “We’re supposed to respect everyone for who they are, no matter their color,” he said, pointing to President Trump’s growing support among Black voters as a sign that race did not determine political leanings. The husband of another plaintiff said in a phone call that he didn’t know about the case and didn’t think his wife was involved. The plaintiff and her husband did not respond to subsequent messages. One plaintiff, Candy Carroll Peavy, of Shreveport, said at a City Council meeting in 2021 that the Biden administration was going door to door to “document unvaccinated Americans,” a popular conspiracy theory at the time. Ms. Peavy, 75, who has also received local recognition for founding a chimpanzee sanctuary , did not return phone messages seeking comment. Another Shreveport resident, Elizabeth Ersoff, 60, was a Louisiana delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2024 and described herself on the website for the Trumpettes as “a hard-core Trumplican.” A man who identified himself as her husband told a reporter that she had been told not to talk about the case. Another plaintiff, also listed as residing in Shreveport, has a familiar name: Mike Johnson. Mr. Johnson, the plaintiff, could not be located. A spokeswoman for Mike Johnson, the House speaker, said it was not him. The case came to the Supreme Court in June 2024, after a divided panel of three federal judges struck down the new map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The justices paused the lower court’s ruling, allowing the map to stay in place for the 2024 election, when voters from the newly created district elected Cleo Fields, a longtime Democratic figure from Baton Rouge. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in March on whether Louisiana had focused too much on race when drawing the map. The justices declined to issue an opinion and, in a rare move , set the case for reargument. The justices have said they wish to explore an expansive question: Did Louisiana’s creation of the new majority-minority district violate the 14th and 15th Amendments? That has set up the case as a critical test for the future of the Voting Rights Act. In an email, Mr. Hurd said the current case was his fifth challenge in front of the Supreme Court to what he termed “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” Among them were two cases in Louisiana, one in Virginia and one in Texas. Mr. Hurd worked on the Texas case, Bush v. Vera , in the 1990s with Edward Blum, a former stockbroker turned legal activist who has become known for his work to remove the consideration of race from parts of American life and law. In an interview, Mr. Blum said that case had helped launch his own legal fight. In 2023, Mr. Blum won his challenge to race-conscious admissions at Harvard and at the University of North Carolina. Mr. Blum, who is not involved in the Callais case, said he did not know the back story of the plaintiffs in the Wednesday case. He described Mr. Hurd as “a one-man band.” Julie Tate contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/us/politics/supreme-court-voting-rights.html,politics,BBC,By Abbie VanSickle,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/00dc-scotus-voting-challengers-sign-tclj/00dc-scotus-voting-challengers-sign-tclj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:50.709000+00:00,20390fdc6ad31f3d0c3e63c2bd26d24e89131b44
16a565d09c37,"In L.A., a Former Ally of Mayor Bass Is Expected to Run Against Her","mayoral races, personal profile;people story, la wildfires, politics, austin beutner, karen bass, rick j. caruso, los angeles","Austin Beutner, a Los Angeles civic and business leader who guided the city’s public school system through the coronavirus pandemic, is expected to announce on Monday that he is joining the 2026 race for mayor, posing the first serious challenge to the re-election of Mayor Karen Bass. The anticipated entry of Mr. Beutner, 65, comes as Los Angeles has reeled under a yearlong cascade of troubles, including wildfires that exacerbated a daunting budget shortfall, as well as immigration crackdowns and National Guard deployments by the Trump administration. But Mr. Beutner’s interest also underscores the political vulnerability of Ms. Bass, whose approval ratings plummeted this year after it emerged that she had been out of the country in January when wildfires ignited in Pacific Palisades, one of the city’s wealthiest enclaves. Only recently has the mayor’s popularity begun to rebound, a product of her public resistance to federal immigration raids. In Mr. Beutner, Ms. Bass would face a former supporter whose appeal in Los Angeles, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, could reach beyond that of her opponent in 2022, Rick Caruso, a billionaire developer and a former Republican. “I voted for Karen Bass last time — we all had hopes,” Mr. Beutner, a longtime donor and a supporter of liberal candidates and causes, said in an interview this week. “She did good work in the Legislature, good work in Congress. But the job of a mayor is a different job, and L.A. is adrift. Ultimately, that’s a function of leadership.” He declined to discuss the details of his plans before Monday. A person familiar with his thinking and his emerging campaign said Mr. Beutner has been leaning toward entering the race for months. Mr. Beutner said that, if he entered the race, he would campaign on quality-of-life issues — housing affordability, emergency response times, public safety, trash fees — as well as on improving economic opportunities for the city’s 4 million residents. Los Angeles, he said, has become “less affordable, less safe and a more difficult place to live.” His proposed platform echoes that of San Francisco’s mayor, Daniel Lurie, who was similarly active civically and philanthropically in his city before entering the mayor’s race there on a pledge to govern with a relentless focus on local issues. But Mr. Beutner could face an uphill battle in Los Angeles, even with Ms. Bass’s political challenges. Mr. Caruso’s defeat in 2022 — after a campaign in which he spent more than $100 million of his own money — was widely regarded as a sign that the appetite in multicultural Los Angeles for a wealthy and white male fixer remains a question mark. Mr. Beutner is known in philanthropic and business circles and is familiar to hundreds of thousands of Los Angeles parents from his time at the school district, but, compared with the mayor, who was on former President Biden’s vice-presidential short list, he is a virtual unknown. A spokesman for Mayor Bass’s re-election campaign, Doug Herman, declined to comment. A former Wall Street investment banker, Mr. Beutner served in former President Bill Clinton’s administration before partnering with Mr. Clinton’s deputy Treasury secretary, Roger Altman, to found the investment bank Evercore Partners in the 1990s. He stepped down from Evercore in 2008 after he was severely injured in the Santa Monica Mountains in a mountain biking accident. After his recovery, Mr. Beutner, a New York-born father of four adult children, became a philanthropic fixture in Los Angeles and increasingly active in the city’s civic life. In 2010, as the city emerged from the Great Recession, he accepted a $1 annual salary to become its first deputy mayor, overseeing the Port of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles International Airport, the Department of Water and Power, and 10 other city agencies as second in command to the then-mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa. In 2013, as The Los Angeles Times struggled financially, he and a coalition of other city leaders tried to buy it. In 2014, when that bid failed, Mr. Beutner agreed to become the paper’s publisher at the behest of a large shareholder in its parent company, Tribune Publishing in Chicago. He was ousted about a year later after refusing to make cuts in the newsroom, and after Tribune executives accused him of collaborating with Eli Broad, the now-deceased billionaire and Los Angeles power broker, in another attempt to wrest the paper from Tribune. Shortly afterward, as the Los Angeles Unified School District faced a fiscal crisis, Mr. Beutner advised the district and then agreed in 2018 to step into the top job for three years after the superintendent was diagnosed with cancer. Two years later, as the pandemic ravaged the city, he leveraged emergency powers and contacts in the philanthropic and private sectors to provide more than 140 million meals to needy children and adults, as well as mass Covid testing and free vaccinations , part of one of the largest relief efforts in the country. He also was criticized for the district’s belated return to classrooms. After he left in 2021, he launched a successful statewide initiative that now provides about $1 billion per year for arts education in public schools without raising taxes. For the past year, he and his family have lived in a succession of rental houses as construction crews have worked to remediate fire damage to their home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. “The home my mother-in-law lived in burned down around the corner from the fire station,” he said. “It’ll be another six months or more before we’ll be able to get back in our home.” Mr. Beutner said he was not considering running solely because of the fires, and that his own losses paled in comparison to those of most victims. He has long expressed interest in public office. Family commitments, for example, ended a brief mayoral bid after his 2010 City Hall stint. But he said that the disaster of the January fires had shed new light for him on the many crises facing the city. “I think the fires have been cathartic, in the sense of maybe forcing us to look at where we are in Los Angeles,” he said. “What does leadership look like? Are we getting things done?” If the critique is familiar to many Angelenos, it might be because it has been leveled by Mr. Caruso. Since the fires, Mr. Caruso has been one of the mayor’s most vocal and persistent critics and has encouraged speculation that he might challenge her again. So far, though, Mr. Caruso has refrained from making a commitment and has indicated that he is also considering a run for governor.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/mayor-bass-austin-beutner.html,politics,BBC,By Shawn Hubler,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10NAT-LA-MAYORS-RACE-01-mwvq/10NAT-LA-MAYORS-RACE-01-mwvq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T23:26:17+00:00,0064d3e2a38184a0a78a1830eeabf49d7ed7e387
09cf7e8c476d,"Appeals Court Allows Federalized National Guard, but Retains Block on Chicago Deployment","us politics, us military, federalism, decisions and verdicts, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, national guard, chicago, april michelle perry, donald trump, j b pritzker, illinois","A federal appeals court on Saturday ruled that National Guard troops could remain in Illinois under federal control. But the appeals court left in place, for now, a ruling by a district court judge on Thursday that bars those troops from being deployed into the streets over the objections of Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and other top Democrats in the state. The unsigned one-page order by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit did not address the question of whether President Trump exceeded his legal authority in attempting to send troops into the Chicago area to protect federal property and federal agents carrying out his deportation efforts. The order also did not include a rationale for the decision, which is temporary. Appeals courts often issue short, temporary rulings on time-sensitive matters. Courts generally issue lengthier rulings once judges have had time to review and consider arguments from each party. The ruling on Saturday allows 200 Texas National Guard troops to remain in the Chicago area without potentially being in violation of a judicial order, so long as they are not deployed. Another 300 members of the Illinois National Guard have also been activated, according to a statement by Northern Command, which said the troops “are conducting planning and training” but not “operational activities.” On Friday, Judge April Perry of the Federal District Court for the District of Northern Illinois issued a 51-page opinion explaining why she had placed a two-week block on both the deployment of National Guard troops and their federalization. Her opinion questioned the candor of administration officials. Contrary to the administration’s stated goals of enforcing immigration law and reducing crime, the opinion said, Mr. Trump’s decision to bring in the military “is likely to lead to civil unrest.” “The significance of the public’s interest in having only well-trained law-enforcement officers deployed in their communities and avoiding unnecessary shows of military force in their neighborhoods cannot be overstated,” wrote Judge Perry, a former prosecutor and nominee of President Joseph R. Biden. Saturday’s ruling largely maintained the status quo in Chicago, where immigration agents have clashed with protesters in recent weeks as the agents have pursued people suspected of being in the country illegally. A similar court fight over the White House’s efforts to deploy the National Guard in Portland, Ore., is before a different appeals court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In a hearing last week , two members of a three-judge panel from that court sounded open to the administration’s arguments for why a military response was legally justified, but they have not yet ruled. Lawyers representing the Trump administration have argued that National Guard troops are needed to protect immigration agents. The Illinois attorney general’s office called the deployment unnecessary, describing it as “startling, unbounded, limitless and not in accord with our system of ordered liberty of federalism.” Saturday’s ruling did not indicate how soon the court might issue a formal decision. It said the National Guard members who traveled to Illinois from out of state may remain in the state unless a judge orders them to return home. On Saturday afternoon, demonstrators chanted near an ICE facility in Broadview, Ill., a suburb of Chicago that has regularly drawn protests and prayer vigils. A few protesters were arrested, officials said, accused of moving beyond an area that had been designated for demonstrations as a federal immigration crackdown has ramped up in the Chicago area since early September. As vehicles came in and out of the facility, several dozen people waved signs and chanted from the designated protest area.

2ab31afc4167,"Among Portland Protests, It’s Frogs and Sharks and Bears, Oh My!","us politics, civil unrest, costume, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, immigration and customs enforcement;ice, donald trump, portland oregon","Animal costumes are the new black. Exceedingly aware that the black garb worn by demonstrators in 2020 informed President Trump’s apocalyptic view of Portland, Ore., protesters this year have gone to the frogs — and unicorns, raccoons, sharks, bears, dinosaurs and the hot animal of this particular pop culture moment, a capybara. “It was just to contrast the narrative that we are violent extremists,” said Seth Todd, 24, whose appearance at Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility early in the summer as a bulbous green frog started the trend. “The best way to show that for me is being in a frog costume.” Portland has long been a little bit different in how residents protest. Outside the ICE building, demonstrators against the Trump administration’s immigration policies have blown bubbles at ICE agents, formed a flash mob to dance the “Cha-Cha Slide,” held formal afternoon tea services and gone “ICE fishing” — tying doughnuts to poles and pretending to lure federal officers with the pastries. Cyclists are planning a special edition of Portland’s famed “naked bike ride” past the ICE facility on Sunday. “Portland has a long heritage of ‘keep Portland weird,’” Steven Schroedl, 60, a retiree whose inflatable costume made it look as if he were riding an ostrich, said on Friday. “It’s something we didn’t necessarily cultivate. It’s just fundamentally who we are.” But the arrival and proliferation of inflatable costumes at the ICE facility in South Portland has taken the city’s penchant for irreverence to new, surreal heights and eased some of the tension, at least as both sides wait for a court to decide whether President Trump can bring in the National Guard. After dark this week, a growing menagerie danced and bounced in the streets as federal officers looked on, a jiggling embodiment of the message city and state leaders have been sending for two weeks in news media briefings and court filings: Though there have been arrests, the majority of protesters in Portland are peaceful — and perhaps a little weird. “The juxtaposition of this moment is what’s resonating,” said Whitney Phillips, an associate professor at the University of Oregon’s School of Journalism and Communication whose academic research has focused on political narratives and symbols. “This moment is dangerous. It’s violent. It’s also absurd.” Mr. Trump and members of his administration have described the demonstrators in Portland as cruel, violent extremists bent on overthrowing the government. Since early June, a small but persistent subset of demonstrators has attempted to disrupt the work inside the ICE building by blocking cars from entering and exiting. The animal army — a technical term for a collection of frogs in this case — might have started as one man’s whim, but it has grown into a more intentional campaign, with protest organizers accepting and encouraging donations of costumes. It hasn’t precluded shoving matches between people on the left and right, nor federal officials from arresting demonstrators or firing pepper balls into the crowd to clear the building’s driveway. “It just makes it seem sillier when they come after us,” said Jack Dickinson, 26, who shows up most days to protest wearing a chicken onesie with an American flag as a cape. “There’s a whimsy to Portland, I think, that’s meeting this moment. You see it with me, you see it with the frog.” Mr. Todd, the frog, said he had been detained by federal officers and cited for failing to follow instructions three times since early summer, and video of federal officers pepper-spraying him through the air vent in his costume drew widespread attention this week. “It tasted like peppermint,” he said. The scenes of colorful, oversize animals dancing to pop music under the stern gaze of federal agents in riot gear has altered the national conversation about the protests, prompting internet memes and segments on late-night shows, even as the Trump administration and right-wing influencers doubled down on their descriptions of Portland as a city in flames during a White House “round table on antifa” Wednesday. On Friday evening, the ICE building unwittingly played host to the wedding of a unicorn and Kenny from the TV show “South Park.” The happy couple then walked down a red carpet under a wave of bubbles to the tune of the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive.” The officiant, Dave Marvin, 68, wore a pinstriped suit and a rabbit head. He described the wedding as “a very civil union.” “We’re trying to emphasize and reiterate what peaceful and joyous protests we have in ‘war-ravaged’ Portland,” Mr. Marvin said. In the case of Mr. Todd and the frogs that joined him this week, there’s also unintended symbolism: White nationalists embraced the cartoon character Pepe the Frog, first drawn in an independent and politically agnostic comic, with such enthusiasm that the Anti-Defamation League included Pepe in its collection of hate symbols and worked with its creator on a social media campaign to “save Pepe.” Mr. Todd said he did not intend to take back the frog as a political symbol when he bought his $30 costume on Amazon several weeks into the Portland protests. He said he was just hoping to “make the president and the feds look dumb.” “There was no higher point beyond that,” he said, “other than I just really like frogs.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/portland-protests.html,politics,BBC,By Anna Griffin and Aaron West,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11nat-portland-animals-promo-qwfc/11nat-portland-animals-promo-qwfc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T19:59:00+00:00,ca90184a6c3f7bdfd35dc1ed4c4b62563b5faa3d
93b29fba3328,Trump Says He Will Pay Troops Despite Government Shutdown,"us politics, legislation, closings, us military, wages and salaries, pentagon, omb, john r thune, donald trump, mike johnson, senate, congress","President Trump said on Saturday that he had “identified funds” that would allow the government to pay members of the military during the federal shutdown, even though Congress has not approved additional money for the troops. Pentagon officials said that they planned to tap about $8 billion in unspent research, testing and evaluation money from the prior fiscal year, which they would use “to issue mid-month paychecks to service members in the event the funding lapse continues” beyond Oct. 15, the next date that they are set to be paid. Mr. Trump’s budgetary maneuvering appeared unorthodox, even though it may spare more than 1 million active-duty service members from financial hardships as the shutdown approaches the end of its second week. It was not clear how long the Trump administration could rely on such accounting moves to pay troops in the event that Congress cannot strike a spending deal. “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,” Mr. Trump said in a social media post announcing the plan. Typically, the troops do not receive wages while the government is closed, a political hazard that often spurs negotiations between Democrats and Republicans. Lawmakers otherwise have had to adopt special legislation to pay the military during a federal stoppage. But Mr. Trump has repeatedly pushed the limits of his power in the current shutdown. The president and his aides have lessened the pain of the closure for some, and maximized it for others, including Democrats, whom Mr. Trump is trying to pressure into supporting a short-term spending deal. Mr. Trump previously told reporters that he supported legislation to pay the troops during the shutdown, siding with House Republicans who have military bases in their districts. But Republican leaders said there was no need for such a measure, and insisted that Senate Democrats should simply pass the stopgap resolution to fund the entire government into November. “You’ve got a military pay bill right here,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, said on Friday at the Capitol, brandishing a copy of the stopgap bill. “This pays the military.” Senators are not set to return to Washington until Tuesday, and Speaker Mike Johnson has told Republicans that he does not intend to open the House until Senate Democrats relent and approve the House-passed G.O.P. stopgap bill.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/trump-troops-pay-shutdown.html,politics,BBC,"By Tony Romm, Catie Edmondson and John Ismay",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/11dc-militarypay-01/10trump-news-header-245pm-mqct-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T19:58:14+00:00,776b5659056b9529689f282c7dcf0524b4ff42bb
14f3012b28da,Biden Is Receiving Radiation Therapy for Cancer,"joe biden, prostate cancer, cancer, radiation","Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment for prostate cancer, his spokeswoman Kelly Scully disclosed on Saturday. The treatment, which began last month, is expected to last several weeks. Mr. Biden, 82, has dealt with numerous health problems in recent years. In May, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer and last month, he had surgery to remove cancerous skin lesions from his forehead, leaving him with a large scar above his right eye. In 2023, when he was president, he had a cancerous lesion removed from his chest during a physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Mr. Biden’s age and health were significant drags on his popularity as president and led to wide swaths of voters disagreeing with his decision to seek re-election last year. He ended his campaign in July following a disastrous performance during his lone debate with Donald J. Trump. Despite the radiation treatments, he intends to keep his plans to appear at a pair of upcoming public events, Ms. Scully said. The former president is to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Edward M.

6dc04e9459a6,Some Americans Are Starting to Feel the Impact of the Government Shutdown,"financial planner, us politics, layoffs;furloughs, civil service, closings, federal budget, agriculture, native americans, indian health service","Reverberations of the federal government shutdown, now in its second week, are starting to be felt by certain segments of Americans, hinting at problems that could deepen for the public if Congress cannot reach a funding agreement soon. In some Native American communities, key medical services, such as diabetes monitoring and telehealth sessions, have been curtailed or canceled. Veterans no longer have access to career counseling or regional benefits offices. Taxpayers rushing to meet a Wednesday deadline for extended filing are going to have to wait on hold because fewer Internal Revenue Service customer service agents are working to answer questions. In addition, many of the country’s fruit and vegetable farmers face hurdles in planning for next year’s crops because there is so much uncertainty about what federal assistance they can expect. Large segments of the federal work force on Friday received what will be their last paycheck until the government reopens. As the strains deepen, the fallout has so far done little to tip the scales in Washington, where Republicans and Democrats are locked in a standoff over how to extend funding to keep the government open. President Trump has sought to ramp up the pressure on Democrats by cutting or pausing billions in funding for Democratic jurisdictions and intensifying his threats to overhaul the federal bureaucracy. This week, he publicly mulled denying legally mandated back pay to some federal workers, inserting more anxiety into a work force that has faced stress and uncertainty since he returned to the Oval Office. “Most of them are going to get back pay, and we’re going to try and make sure of that,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “But some of them are being hurt very badly by the Democrats and they therefore won’t qualify.” The White House did not respond directly to a question seeking to clarify what the president meant, instead issuing a statement blaming Democrats for the shutdown. About 600,000 federal workers are furloughed because of the shutdown. Others are working without pay because they hold jobs the administration considers critical to protecting property and keeping people safe. Employees at the General Services Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services were among those who received their last paychecks on Friday, which were smaller than usual because the pay period included four days of the shutdown. Others, including employees at the National Park Service, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration, are expected to see a similarly partial, final paycheck next week. Federal workers are required by law to be paid back once the government reopens. Yolanda Jacobs, a single mother of three, said getting furloughed from her job as a health specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meant she had to immediately cut back on spending. She said her family liked to go to the movies once a week. “That stops until the shutdown ends,” she said. “Eating out — that’s out of the question.” Ms. Jacobs, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, has worked at the agency since 2004 and weathered several shutdowns over the years. This one, however is different, she said. “We’ve never had a shutdown before where federal employees have been used as bargaining chips,” she said, adding that it was taking an especially hard toll on C.D.C. workers who were already under stress. A gunman attacked the agency’s Atlanta headquarters in August. Among the furloughed workers are those who administer grants and oversee programs relied upon by states and communities. The Indian Health Service is one of the federal agencies that continue to operate during a lapse in funding, but some federal employees who support its programs are not working. In California, that has interfered with the ability of caregivers to submit reports and get approval for reimbursements, said Nanette Star, the director of policy and planning for the California Consortium for Urban Indian Health. This has already had an impact on diabetic American Indians and Alaska Natives in California who rely on the program for health monitoring, she said. “Indian Country is the canary in the coal mine,” said Larry Wright Jr., the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians. Federal funds often make up a greater share of revenue for Native American tribes than for state governments, because of a longstanding federal trust role for Native lands, he noted, adding, “When the government shuts down, tribes feel it first.” The shutdown has also scrambled planning for American farmers, many of whom were beginning to make decisions about next year’s crops. Those plans depend on information only the federal government can provide, such as what loans, farm and conservation payments will be available and specific market data to help make decisions about what to plant. Stu Swanson, who grows corn and soybeans in north-central Iowa, said that because the federal employees who work at the local Agriculture Department office are furloughed, he was not able to get a low-interest loan he counts on when planning for the coming year. As a result, he said he recently had to go to a bank and borrow money at a higher rate. “As we end one season, we have to already be planning the next one,” said Joe Maxwell, a Missouri-based farmer who raises sheep and grows grains. “We’re under a heck of a lot of financial stress, and now we don’t have information or the tools or programs we need to even know if there’s going to be a next year on our farm.” It has been a particularly difficult year for farmers already because of the president’s trade war , said Mr. Maxwell, who serves as the president of the Farm Action Fund, a group that fights agriculture monopolies. In addition, about 25 percent of the nation’s farmers rely on the Affordable Care Act for insurance, he said, and they cannot afford for their health care costs to triple at the end of the year if Congress does not extend the tax breaks that help pay for the coverage. The cost of health care is at the center of the congressional impasse that led to the shutdown. As of Friday, there was still no sign of a path to a compromise. Officials are keeping a close eye on flight delays to see if more air traffic controllers are calling out sick than usual and causing lags. The controllers are forced to work during a shutdown without pay. While there have been some scattered reports of staffing problems at air traffic control towers, the cause and severity are unclear. Union officials have said that there is no organized effort among the country’s nearly 11,000 certified controllers to protest the shutdown by not showing up to work and noted that there was already a national shortage of controllers. In some cases, federal offices that continued to operate during the first week of the shutdown have started to furlough employees as carry-over funds from the last fiscal year dried up. Some employees at the Environmental Protection Agency’s air and water offices, who oversee the safety of drinking water, were told late Wednesday that they could not work until the government reopened, according to an email to staff members shared with The New York Times. After operating during the first week of the shutdown by tapping into a separate pot of funding, the I.R.S. laid off about half of its staff on Wednesday. Nearly 40,000 employees will continue to work to prepare for next year’s tax season, but they will not be paid. Federal workers who issue permits for a range of projects, such as building a bridge or other construction that affects natural resources like wetlands, are also furloughed. If the shutdown lasts weeks or months, that will cause considerable delays in projects across the country. “The longer the government is shut, the more likely construction employment around the country could be impacted negatively,” Jeffrey D. Shoaf, the chief executive of the Associated General Contractors of America, said in a recent statement . Money for grocery vouchers for millions of low-income mothers and children also hangs in the balance, and the Trump administration is considering novel solutions to fill that funding gap until the government reopens. Renee Willis, the president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said the shutdown was a spectacle “at the expense of the most vulnerable people in our nation.” Karoun Demirjian, Maxine Joselow and Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/government-shutdown-effects.html,politics,BBC,By Eileen Sullivan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/00dc-shutdown-effects01-photo-pgwt/00dc-shutdown-effects01-photo-pgwt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:02:08+00:00,b8ba23dc5db89e6bbb374824b7b089dceb2e1356

It now gazes out at a bocce ball court outside a Sons of Italy lodge some 300 miles away in Blauvelt, N.Y. Boston’s marble Columbus statue was beheaded in 2020 — its second decapitation. Repaired and given to the Knights of Columbus, it was moved to the garden of a nearby church, where it now stands among religious statues. And in Baltimore, where protesters pulled down a Columbus statue in 2020 and dumped it into the Inner Harbor, the broken pieces have been retrieved and used to guide the creation of a replica. The culture war over Columbus statues has entered a new phase. “Pretty much every October we’re going to have a different view of Columbus and therefore of the Columbus statues,” said the historian Matthew Restall, who wrote “The Nine Lives of Christopher Columbus,” a new biography chronicling his contentious legacy. “These are essentially living objects whose meaning is constantly shifting, and so where they are located and how we talk about them has to also be constantly changing. And that’s not a bad thing.” Monuments celebrating the Genoese explorer and his voyages were put up across the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries by Italian American groups who saw him a symbol of ethnic pride at a time when immigrants from Italy faced persecution and discrimination. In recent decades some of those statues were vandalized by protesters outraged by Columbus’s role ushering in an era of mass colonization and oppression of Indigenous people.

They represent the state with the second-highest concentration of federal employees in the nation. Both have historically been eager to join the so-called bipartisan gangs of senators who try to negotiate their way through partisan gridlock. Instead, the two have appeared remarkably dug in, even as President Trump and his top lieutenants have threatened to use the shutdown to drastically accelerate their campaign to reduce the size of the government. They say they are channeling federal workers who are furious at the White House’s ongoing assault on the bureaucracy and are urging their representatives in Congress to keep up the fight. “I’ve heard that sentiment more loudly than I thought, because in Virginia, we have an awful lot at stake,” Mr. Kaine said in a recent interview. “We suffer more in a shutdown scenario than anybody else. But I think they feel like, ‘You’re threatening to hurt us. You’ve been hurting us since Jan. 20.’ In some ways, it’s kind of not a credible threat, because you’ll do it anyway, whatever happens.” The dynamic has fueled Democrats’ resolve not to back down as the shutdown impasse drags into its second week. Democrats representing large populations of federal workers have for months heard from livid employees about the Department of Government Efficiency emails they received asking them to provide a list of accomplishments; the chaos and upheaval at their agencies; and the fears of retaliation. Mr. Trump has stepped up the threats in recent days, saying that he would deny furloughed workers back pay earned during the shutdown, and promising that he would seize the opportunity to slash programs and projects Democrats care about. So far that has only fueled Democrats’ outrage, strengthening their determination to continue demanding health care concessions as a condition of any deal to fund the government. But that determination will be tested in the days ahead. Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, announced on Friday that the administration was beginning another round of federal worker layoffs, fulfilling Mr. Trump’s threats. And many federal employees are set to miss their first paycheck next week. “To their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said at a news conference on Friday, minutes before Mr. Vought’s announcement. “But now where we’re getting to is where people are going to start missing paychecks. This gets real.” Democrats on Friday gave few indications that they would be swayed. “This latest round of federal firings is not an unfortunate byproduct of the government shutdown, but a deliberate choice,” Mr. Warner wrote on social media. “Republicans are intentionally holding federal workers hostage to force through their agenda driving up health care costs for millions.” Representative Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat who represents the Northern Virginia suburbs, home to one of the largest concentrations of federal workers in the country, said that the move would “make it harder to get the bipartisan deal that is needed to end this shutdown.” “President Trump and Russ Vought have been firing federal workers by the thousands continuously since the beginning of the DOGE disaster, and as numerous Republicans have admitted, they plainly hoped to use the pretext of a shutdown to fire even more American workers,” Mr. Beyer said. In the hours before the government shut down late last month, the White House had threatened to maximize the pain of a funding lapse in an attempt to pressure Democrats into caving and accepting a short-term deal. Federal workers at the time were largely unfazed, Democratic senators said. “I don’t think they’re moved by the president’s threats,” said Senator Adam B. Schiff of California, who represents roughly 8 percent of all federal workers. “If anything, I think it hardens the resolve to stand up to him.” Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey said that he sat down last week with federal workers in New Jersey. “I heard about their anxieties and fears, but I also heard from them that some things are worth fighting for,” Mr. Kim said. And while Republicans have sought to pin the blame on Democrats for the furloughs and the soon-to-be-missed paychecks for U.S. troops, it is not yet clear whether voters will agree. During shutdowns, the majority party in Congress is typically reluctant to pass piecemeal legislation to fund popular portions of the federal government, such as the troops, fearing that doing so could relieve pressure on the other party to cut a deal to reopen. When Speaker Mike Johnson took live questions from C-SPAN viewers on Thursday, a woman who identified herself as a Republican military wife called in and chastised the Louisiana Republican for keeping the House out of session and not passing legislation that would ensure that troops get paid during the shutdown. “You have the power to do that,” the caller, identified as Samantha from Fort Belvoir, Va., said, noting that Mr. Trump had backed such a measure. “And as a Republican, I’m very disappointed in my party, and I’m very disappointed in you, because you do have the power to call the House back.” She said that her family was living “paycheck to paycheck,” and that any lapse would threaten their ability to pay for their children’s medications and medical bills. “You could stop this, and you could be the one that could say the military is getting paid,” she told the speaker. “And I think that it is awful, and the audacity of someone who makes six figures a year to do this to military families is insane.” On Saturday, Mr. Trump sought to alleviate that issue by announcing that he had “identified funds” that would allow the administration to pay military service members on Oct. 15, even though the government remained shut down.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/trump-government-shutdown-layoffs-democrats.html,politics,BBC,By Catie Edmondson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11dc-shutdown-threats-top-fvwc/11dc-shutdown-threats-top-fvwc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:01:59+00:00,de4d4f6c2891092769eeb7f81455ec819f85782b
2bb54993dbcb,Not Even Congress Knows How Much Money DOGE Cut,"us politics, federal budget, federal aid, legislation, civil service, closings, donald trump, russell t. vought, elon musk, omb","Elon Musk once pledged that his Department of Government Efficiency would find $1 trillion in savings in the federal budget by Sept. 30, the date the government closes its books on the fiscal year. That date has now come and gone, Mr. Musk has long since left Washington, and DOGE never came close to cutting as much money as he promised. But because its work has been obscured by crude accounting and White House maneuvers, it’s impossible to know how much DOGE and its allies actually did cut from the budget — or even what happened to that money. Outside budget experts can’t nail down a number. Even congressional appropriators — the people who decide how federal funds should be spent in the first place — don’t know. And the public may never have a clear answer. This conclusion is an undercurrent of the Democrats’ government shutdown fight: Congress and the public simply can’t follow what the Trump administration has done with federal spending. And now the fiscal year is over, with untold sums unaccounted for. “The fact that Congress, who constitutionally has the power of the purse, can’t figure out what’s been going on is a deep, deep, deep constitutional issue,” said Zach Moller, director of the economic program at the center-left think tank Third Way. Funding that Congress intended to be spent by Sept. 30 seemingly never was. Some of it may have expired at midnight that day, in direct opposition to Congress’s will. In the mystery over what happened to it — and how much money is at stake — Congress has been losing more of its power. ‘Where did that money go?’ Mr. Musk promised transparency in his sprint to slash the federal budget, but DOGE’s accounting of its cuts, which it estimates have totaled $214 billion in savings, was error-prone from the start . The New York Times and other news organizations reported that DOGE inflated the savings from many contracts it cut, counted others multiple times and discounted the expense (and lawsuits) from shutting down programs. The group’s more lasting impact may be reducing the federal work force . The Trump administration has already laid off thousands of government employees and started another round of cuts Friday. But those numbers are in flux, too. Some layoffs remain tangled in court challenges , and other departed workers have been rehired . The Office of Personnel Management said it expected about 300,000 federal workers to leave their jobs by the end of the year, though it has not provided data on cost savings or hiring over the same time. But with the fiscal year closed, a thornier problem remains: DOGE, established by an executive order, may have canceled contracts and fired workers, but it never had the authority to cut spending in the first place. Once Congress has appropriated money, only Congress can claw it back. Without that step, money meant for, say, collecting educational data must still be spent on collecting educational data even if DOGE has canceled particular contracts. Imagine that Congressional appropriations are like credit cards. In this metaphor, though, the credit limits are like budgets that agencies must use. The executive branch can’t just not spend the money by refusing to swipe the cards (or by not activating them). The only legal way to cut funding is to return to Congress and have legislators pass a “rescissions” bill retracting funds they had previously appropriated. “When push comes to shove, the savings number is in the rescissions,” said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. It is not, he said, in any of the numbers DOGE has promoted. But during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the White House submitted just two rescission requests, outside of some climate investments canceled in Republicans’ signature budget bill passed this summer. One request was for $9 billion in foreign aid and public media funding that narrowly passed in July , and the other was for nearly $5 billion of further foreign aid in a legally contested “pocket rescission” meant to run out the clock without congressional action. It seems likely, however, that the Trump administration has left money unspent at the end of the year totaling far more than this $14 billion reported to Congress. “There absolutely must be — they did cancel a bunch of contracts worth a lot of money,” Mr. Malkus said. “There are open questions about, Where did that money go?” His own analysis, matching the contracts DOGE said it canceled to federal spending data, found about $16 billion in cuts (about one-third of what DOGE claimed). Congressional Democrats have tracked a larger universe of $410 billion in spending that they believe has been canceled or frozen, according to public documents, agencies and unpaid grantees. Money appropriated in multiyear cycles could legally still be spent in the new fiscal year. Some money may have been redirected elsewhere. But other funds may have expired Sept. 30, putting them out of reach of the people Congress meant to receive them. The administration appears to have halted money by intervening at multiple steps in the illustration above — with the White House Office of Management and Budget declining to activate funds meant for agencies, and with DOGE or agencies canceling work that had already been contracted. As a result, funds were delayed or blocked for emergency food and shelter, public health research , community development and government oversight programs , to name just a few. And some of these moves have prompted protests from Democrats and Republicans alike. “This administration has flagrantly broken our spending laws, cut off funding owed to communities nationwide, and then systematically worked to obscure what it’s doing from the public — and Congress’s — view,” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator, said in a statement. The White House declined to respond to such criticism, or to comment on DOGE’s impact, saying only that President Trump was committed to his pledge to cut waste, fraud and abuse. How O.M.B. entered the picture The conflict with Congress underscores one last challenge with assessing Mr. Musk’s project. It’s hard to distinguish where DOGE ends and where O.M.B. begins. The White House budget director, Russell Vought, has previously described his role in part as making permanent the cuts DOGE initiated. Increasingly, the push to cut government has moved to his office . During the months when DOGE was most aggressively canceling contracts, O.M.B. was concealing how it was moving money through to agencies. Mr. Vought removed a legally required public database tracking those records. When a court forced the administration to restore it in August, the spending logs showed O.M.B. exerting unusual control over agency spending, using other documents the public can’t see. Under a 1974 law , it’s illegal for the administration to “impound” or block money appropriated by Congress (to not spend the funds on those credit cards). But Mr. Vought has made clear he believes that law is unconstitutional and wants to test it in court. Democrats have said they’re fighting during the shutdown to restore expiring Obamacare subsidies and reverse recent cuts to Medicaid . But the impasse is about this larger issue, too : They don’t want to vote for bipartisan spending bills if the Trump administration is simply — and secretly — going to choke off the parts it doesn’t like. “This crisis is not happening in a vacuum,” Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriator in the House, said of the shutdown in a statement. She blamed Mr. Vought and Mr. Trump for undermining the division of powers — Congress passes spending laws, and the president is supposed to carry them out. In trying to measure the effect of all of this, budget analysts on the left and right noted it’s always hard to track real-time spending across a vast government with outdated data systems. But this situation is different, they said. “When the administration is actively undermining transparency by hiding databases and filling the ones they do release with elementary accounting errors, budget analysts just throw their hands up,” said Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute. That confusion has outlasted Mr. Musk’s focus on the federal budget. And with it, the president has expanded his power to act without cluing in either legislators or the public, said Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. “That’s the struggle we’re witnessing: ultimately not so much about reducing the size and scope of government in a sustainable manner,” she said, “and more about increasing executive power and finding out how much you can actually just do with the executive.” By that measure, and not total dollars saved, DOGE may have been more effective.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/upshot/congress-doge-cuts-mystery.html,politics,BBC,"By Emily Badger, Alicia Parlapiano and Lucas Burtin",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/upshot/11up-doge-unknown-promo/11up-doge-uncertain-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:01:40.311000+00:00,37048f8c26607424ece5b1587f2ac5be49442123
87c900de034a,"Federal Judges, Warning of ‘Judicial Crisis,’ Fault Supreme Court’s Emergency Orders","supreme court;scotus, federal courts, judiciary, us politics, donald trump, polls","More than three dozen federal judges have told The New York Times that the Supreme Court’s flurry of brief, opaque emergency orders in cases related to the Trump administration have left them confused about how to proceed in those matters and are hurting the judiciary’s image with the public. At issue are the quick-turn orders the Supreme Court has issued dictating whether Trump administration policies should be left in place while they are litigated through the lower courts. That emergency docket, a growing part of the Supreme Court’s work in recent years, has taken on greater importance amid the flood of litigation challenging President Trump’s efforts to expand executive power. While the orders are technically temporary, they have had broad practical effects, allowing the administration to deport tens of thousands of people, discharge transgender military service members, fire thousands of government workers and slash federal spending. The striking and highly unusual critique of the nation’s highest court from lower court judges reveals the degree to which litigation over Mr. Trump’s agenda has created strains in the federal judicial system. Sixty-five judges responded to a Times questionnaire sent to hundreds of federal judges across the country. Of those, 47 said the Supreme Court had been mishandling its emergency docket since Mr. Trump returned to office. The judges responded to the questionnaire and spoke in interviews on the condition of anonymity so they could share their views candidly, as lower court judges are governed by a complex set of rules that include limitations on their public statements. Of the judges who responded, 28 were nominated by Republican presidents, including 10 by Mr. Trump; 37 were nominated by Democrats. While those nominated by Democrats were more critical of the Supreme Court, judges nominated by presidents of both parties expressed concerns. In interviews, federal judges called the Supreme Court’s emergency orders “mystical,” “overly blunt,” “incredibly demoralizing and troubling” and “a slap in the face to the district courts.” One judge compared their district’s current relationship with the Supreme Court to “a war zone.” Another said the courts were in the midst of a “judicial crisis.” The responses to The Times serve as the most comprehensive picture to date about the extraordinary tensions within the judiciary, hints of which have begun to spill out publicly. At a hearing in September, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said his court was “out here flailing” as it tried to apply vague emergency rulings from the Supreme Court that left judges “in limbo.” Ruling on a different case, Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts noted that the emergency orders “have not been models of clarity.” The Supreme Court has so far issued emergency orders in about 20 cases involving the Trump administration’s policies. In at least seven of those orders, the majority offered no reasoning for its decision. At public events, some Supreme Court justices have defended their use of the emergency docket as a legitimate response to the increase in swift presidential policy-making by executive order, as opposed to legislation passed through Congress. Offering extensive reasoning or explanation, they argued, would risk locking the court into a position that might not turn out to be its final view. A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not respond to a request for comment. The Times reached out to more than 400 judges, including every judge in districts that have handled at least one legal challenge to a major piece of Mr. Trump’s agenda. Most of those who declined to participate did not give a reason. Others said they did not think it was their place to judge the work of the Supreme Court. The judges who responded may not represent the views of the entire judiciary, but to have even several dozen judges out of the nation’s more than 1,000 district, appellate and senior judges express such concern about the Supreme Court’s behavior is highly unusual. Forty-two judges went so far as to say that the Supreme Court’s emergency orders had caused “some” or “major” harm to the public’s perception of the judiciary. Among those who responded to the question, nearly half of the Republican-nominated judges said they believed the orders had harmed the judiciary’s standing in the public eye. Twelve judges who responded to the questionnaire said they believed the Supreme Court had handled its emergency docket appropriately. But only two said public perception of judges had improved as a result of how the Supreme Court had handled its recent work. It is “of surpassing historic significance” that so many sitting judges have chosen to weigh in publicly about the Supreme Court, said J. Michael Luttig, a former federal judge who served as an assistant attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. The code of conduct for federal judges requires them to act in ways that promote “public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” They seldom comment on public controversies and almost never share their views of Supreme Court jurisprudence, outside of the carefully chosen words of their written opinions. Judge Luttig is a critic of the Trump administration’s interpretation of the Constitution who is in frequent contact with sitting judges from across the political spectrum. He said he believed the views expressed to The Times were broadly representative of the lower courts as a whole. “I can’t think of words to capture the significance that federal judges themselves have to speak out,” he said, “because the Supreme Court has given them no choice but to speak out.” ‘An Atmosphere of Disrespect’ The emergency docket is known to its critics as the shadow docket , and its rise as a flashpoint for tensions in the judiciary coincides with the Supreme Court’s increasing use of it in ways that have benefited Mr. Trump’s agenda. Time and time again, district court judges have imposed blocks on expansive policies issued by Mr. Trump’s administration, rulings that have been upheld by the appeals courts, only to have the Supreme Court remove them with an emergency order. Mr. Trump has benefited from nearly all of the Supreme Court’s rulings on emergency applications since his return to office. For now, his administration can withhold some forms of congressionally appropriated funds, send undocumented immigrants to dangerous places such as South Sudan and use race as a criterion in making immigration stops, all because of emergency orders. Some of the judges who responded to the Times questionnaire expressed concerns with the substance of the Supreme Court’s orders, fearing critics would see partisanship in the justices’ consistent siding with the president over lower court judges. Similar views have been aired in dissents from the Supreme Court’s liberal wing, which have called pro-Trump rulings by the majority “misguided,” “dangerous” and an “existential threat to the rule of law.” For Mr. Trump’s allies, lower court judges are the ones who exceeded their authority in blocking presidential actions, interfering with what they claim is a popular mandate. That view was shared by one judge, a Trump appointee, who praised the Supreme Court for “flushing out anti-democratic rulings” with its emergency orders. The main complaint voiced by a majority of the judges was not where the Supreme Court was coming down, but how it was doing so. By presenting its emergency orders in just a few sentences, with little or no reasoning, judges said the Supreme Court was leaving them without a clear path to assess what the justices were thinking. The result, one judge said, was that the court was expecting their district court colleagues “to read their minds about what their view of the law is.” Despite the justices’ brevity and lack of reasoning, the Supreme Court has become more insistent that its emergency orders are supposed to serve as guideposts for the lower courts. In an unsigned emergency order from July, the Supreme Court noted that while emergency orders were “not conclusive,” district court judges should still consider them in “like cases.” Some justices have gone further, using their opinions to publicly admonish judges who, in their view, are failing to correctly apply the court’s emergency orders. In August, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh took to task Judge William G. Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for what they saw as a failure to apply an emergency ruling in one spending case to another. “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” the justices wrote. In response, Judge Young issued a rare apology from the bench, though he expressed some bewilderment with the court’s opacity. “Never, before this admonition, has any judge in any higher court ever thought to suggest that this court had defied the precedent of a higher court — that was never my intention,” he said. Several judges singled out the justices’ criticism of Judge Young, an 85-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan and an Army veteran who has sat for more than 40 years, as a particularly demoralizing breach of decorum. That view resonated with one of their retired colleagues, Jeremy Fogel, who was a federal judge for 20 years. Judge Young, he said, “has been at it for so long. He’s done the toughest cases, and he’s done them well. For a guy like that to get bench-slapped for not reading the tea leaves properly? That’s just not fair.” Justice Gorsuch’s opinion could be read as “promoting a disrespect for the judiciary,” one that echoed Mr. Trump’s rhetorical attacks on judges, said Nancy Gertner, a retired judge who teaches at Harvard Law School. Both, she said, “undermine the bench and promote an atmosphere of disrespect.” The Lower Courts Speak Out Responses to the questionnaire were overwhelmingly critical of the Supreme Court, but they were not unanimous. Twenty-one judges either declined to answer the question about the effect of emergency orders on the public’s perception of the judiciary or said they believed they have had little or no effect. A few judges were more equivocal about emergency orders, views that were echoed by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a widely respected jurist and Reagan nominee who wrote a robust defense of the role that district courts play in the constitutional scheme. In an interview, Judge Wilkinson noted that the Supreme Court was largely at the mercy of circumstances beyond its control: a high volume of emergency challenges to a presidency that “would put its foot on the pedal, because it has an agenda, and it’s sensitive to the fact that electoral mandates are perishable.” While noting that the emergency docket had its advantages in terms of quickly and uniformly managing a mushrooming caseload from the executive branch, Judge Wilkinson said there were good arguments for the Supreme Court to be careful about using it too much. “You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.

If the case makes it to trial, the charges, one of bank fraud and one of false statements to a financial institution, will require prosecutors to convince a jury that Ms. James intentionally misled the mortgage broker, OVM Financial, and First Savings Bank, which, according to the indictment, acquired the loan in 2021. Ms. Thompson’s testimony that she has lived in the house rent-free — Ms. James pays even for basic upkeep, the people said — could make it difficult for prosecutors to convince a jury that the house was meant to be used as a rental investment property. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. “The question is, what is the proof and what are the facts,” said Stuart Slotnick, a former prosecutor who heads the New York City office of Buchanan, Ingersoll and Rooney, concentrating in part on real estate litigation. “James is claiming that she was singled out,” he said. “And at the same time, this indictment can be legally sufficient. They’re not mutually exclusive and they can both be true.” The case will ride in part on the legal definition of real estate terms — in particular, distinctions in what Fannie Mae, the government enterprise that backs the mortgage market, refers to as occupancy types. In 2020, the year the house was purchased, Fannie Mae noted in its guide to the market that a second home must be occupied by a borrower “for some portion of the year,” and “must not be a rental property or a timeshare agreement.” That is where Ms. James’s regular visits to the property to see her grandniece and other family, including Ms. Thompson’s mother, who also lives in a Norfolk home Ms. James owns , may be useful to the attorney general’s defense team.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html,politics,BBC,"By Jonah E.

8f91e0184301,One ‘Really Big One’ After Another,"earthquake, geology, research, san andreas fault, california, oregon, geosphere, your-feed-science","In the world’s tectonic nightmares, a giant earthquake on the San Andreas fault in California looms large. But farther north, another geologic fault — the Cascadia subduction zone — gives disaster planners even more to worry about. The possibility that Cascadia could shake the Northwest in the near future was highlighted in a 2015 New Yorker article that called the hypothetical event “The Really Big One.” In a study published last month in the journal Geosphere, earthquake scientists suggest that the two faults could have an intertwined fate. Their paper suggests that Cascadia earthquakes of the recent geological past have triggered earthquakes along the San Andreas fault too. “Cascadia is often talked about as, ‘When it goes, it’ll be the biggest disaster in North American history,’” said Chris Goldfinger, a professor emeritus at Oregon State University whose earlier warnings were highlighted in that New Yorker article. “But what if the San Andreas goes at the same time? It’s still going to be the biggest disaster in North American history, but it’s quite a bit bigger.” The Cascadia subduction zone stretches from Vancouver Island in Canada to Northern California. In this region, an oceanic plate called Juan de Fuca dives beneath the continental plate of North America. “It’s where there’s a lot of frictional contact that the trouble for people arises,” Dr. Goldfinger said. With the new paper, he and colleagues have found evidence that the friction could cause problems for people farther south, near the San Andreas fault, which begins at Cape Mendocino south of Eureka, turns inland and terminates near the Salton Sea. Cascadia and San Andreas come together near Cape Mendocino. Dr. Goldfinger first gathered data connecting the faults during a research cruise in 1999. His group had traveled to the southern end of Cascadia to collect sediment cores from the seabed, which can reveal a historical record of thousands of years of the fault’s earthquakes. A graduate student on the night watch gave the ship a wayward waypoint. When Dr. Goldfinger got up in the morning and looked at the navigation display, he was confused, then distraught. They were halfway to San Francisco, just off the northern part of the San Andreas Fault, in a part of the ocean called the Noyo Channel. The student, sleeping on a stool, awoke. “He looks up and he goes, ‘Oh, no,’” Dr. Goldfinger said. They decided to gather samples anyway. When they returned and analyzed the sample, they were looking for what paleoseismologists call “turbidites”: submarine landslide deposits left on the sea floor after an earthquake, with heavier material settled to the bottom and lighter material on top. But the turbidites they saw were weird. “They were essentially upside down,” Dr. Goldfinger said. Going back thousands of years into the core’s sedimentary record, they found the same backwardness: The heavy sand was on top, and the lighter material was at the bottom. In more data, gathered later and from more locations, they saw the same flipped fraternal twinning. They pondered this anomaly, along with even more data, for years before coming up with an explanation. “The upside-down turbidites weren’t upside down,” Dr. Goldfinger said. They were from two separate events: The bottom layer in each sample was from a Cascadia earthquake — light material that had traveled far. The second was heavier material from a closer San Andreas quake. They seemed to have been deposited one right after the other — indicating that soon after Cascadia’s friction had reached a breaking point, the San Andreas followed. “In the last, say, 2,500 years, all eight of the largest Cascadia earthquakes have a matching San Andreas earthquake, or appear to,” Dr. Goldfinger said. “Appear to” would be key words to Lucy Jones, a research associate at the Seismological Laboratory at Caltech. It sure looks like a pattern, she said, and it very well may be — but she wants more proof it’s not random coincidence. She would like to see more statistical analysis, and more quantification of uncertainty about these coincident events. “Statistical study is important because we do a really good job of fooling ourselves,” said Dr. Jones. If the connection between the faults bears out, she added, it would make sense. “I’d be surprised if you didn’t see evidence of San Andreas earthquakes right after Cascadia ones,” she said (although having data to support even obvious, but uninvestigated, ideas is helpful). After all, it makes intuitive sense that tectonic upheaval could affect nearby plates. Dr. Goldfinger admits the field of geology accepts ideas slowly, even when they make sense. “We understood general relativity before we knew why Africa and South America fit together,” he said. But whether scientists are talking about San Andreas and Cascadia, or faults elsewhere in the world, one idea remains true: “The most dangerous day is the day after a big earthquake,” Dr. Jones said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/science/earthquake-san-andreas-cascadia.html,Science,BBC,By Sarah Scoles,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/science/10HS-tb-earthquakes/10HS-tb-earthquakes-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:01:16+00:00,00a61dba9f4f31184c8a1c5c9dd4072a048567bb
ff5c178dcd2a,How to Deal With 30 to 50 Feral Hogs,"pig, hunting, animal behavior, agriculture, animal abuse, invasive species, texas","Pigs are not native to the Western Hemisphere. But when European settlers set out for the New World in the 15th and 16th centuries, they brought swarthy swine with them. The animals were an obvious choice as a food source: highly prolific breeders that were hardy and adaptable enough to fend for themselves on the landscape. Before long, America’s free-ranging pig population was booming. The animals are difficult to survey, but experts estimate that the United States is now home to at least six million feral hogs, descendants of those early farm animals and Eurasian wild boars that arrived later. Although feral hogs have been reported in dozens of states, they are especially common in Texas. “There’s a saying in Texas,” said R.A. Ortiz, who goes by Bubba, of Ortiz Game Management in New Braunfels, Texas. “There’s two kinds of property owners: One that has a feral hog problem and one that’s about to have a feral hog problem.” There’s no easy solution. “Because they’re not native to this part of the planet, there is nowhere that we could take these animals and go release them where they ought to be,” said John Tomecek, a wildlife biologist at Texas A&M University and former chair of the National Wild Pig Task Force. “So every option that we have involves either preventing them from being born in the first place or killing the ones that are alive. That can be a distasteful thing to think about.” Dr. Tomecek has no personal animus against the pigs, which, he noted, reproduce quickly because humans bred them to do just that. “But,” he said, “they have to go away.” Fixing the feral pig problem will require an array of approaches, all of which have limitations and drawbacks. Here’s what some Texans are trying: Trapping Wild pigs, which live in social groups called sounders, are highly intelligent. Targeting just a few pigs at a time merely teaches the survivors how to avoid capture, so many trappers employ large, corral-style traps to round up an entire sounder at once. But the approach requires patience and “a lot of hog psychology,” Mr. Ortiz said. Trappers typically begin by creating a “bait site,” setting out corn, seeds, molasses or other delicacies to attract hungry hogs. Slowly, over the course of a week or more, trappers assemble a corral around the area: “Letting them feed for a few nights, and then adding a couple of panels the next day,” said Edward Dickey, the owner of Texas Wild Hog Control. Then, Mr. Dickey uses cameras connected to his smartphone to remotely monitor the corral. He can remotely trigger the gate to close when the whole sounder is inside. Mr. Dickey kills the animals quickly, with a single gunshot to the head. “A hog can’t help what he is, and no animal deserves to suffer,” he said. “So we try to be as humane as possible.” Hog-dogging Hunting is another common swine control method. In an approach known as “hog-dogging,” hunters use dogs to sniff out, chase down and grab on to the hogs until human hunters arrive to kill them. Jose Dominguez, the owner of TX Hill Country Hog Dogs, said that his dogs can help landowners hunt down problem pigs, including those that are wary of traps, and deter the pigs from roaming certain farms. “It puts so much hunting pressure on them that they would rather just go somewhere else,” he said. But even in the already ethically fraught world of sport hunting, hog-dogging is especially contentious, with critics noting that the hunts are unnecessarily cruel for the pigs and can be dangerous for the dogs, which are sometimes injured by the boars’ tusks. Nighttime Hunting Some companies have turned feral swine control into entertainment, luring customers with promises of unique hunting experiences. Jimmy Galindo, the owner of Texas Hunting Adventure, guides clients on high-tech hunts at night, when the pigs tend to be more active and less skittish. Clients use night-vision goggles, thermal scopes and guns equipped with lasers. “It’s like running around with super powers,” Mr. Galindo said. But the expeditions also provide a real service for local farmers, he said. “It’s all fun and games until it’s your yard and your field.” Helicopter Hunting Other outfits offer customers the opportunity to use semiautomatic weapons to shoot at pigs from the sky. “They want to shoot a cool machine gun out of a helicopter,” said Chris Britt, the chief executive of HeliBacon, which offers aerial shooting trips. “The fact that the target they’re shooting at happens to be a feral pig, which is an overpopulated nuisance species, is a bonus.” Government agencies also use aerial shooting to control feral pigs, and the approach is especially effective in open areas with high hog densities. Turning it into a recreational activity means that out-of-state tourists are now paying for the opportunity to help control a major state pest, Mr. Britt said. “Texas’ attitude is: ‘Thanks for coming to kill some feral pigs. Please come back and do it again,’” he said. But there is considerable debate over whether sport hunting is an effective control method for feral pigs. “What we’ve had is folks also catching them and intentionally moving them to new places to create hunting opportunities,” Dr. Tomecek said. Contraception Feral hog contraceptives are an active area of scientific research but come with practical challenges. Injectable contraceptives require capturing the pigs. Oral contraceptives distributed in the wild have to be safe for any other free-ranging animals that might ingest them. A company called Corona Feed Additives developed HogStop, which it describes as a natural contraceptive bait. The key ingredient is cottonseed oil, which contains a compound known to impair male fertility. “As long as these boars are coming and eating this three to five days out of the month, they’re infertile for, like, the next two months,” said Daniel Loper, an owner of Corona Feed Additives, citing the company’s in-house research. But questions remain about how well the product works in a wild setting, including whether boars would eat the bait consistently enough to remain infertile and how many male pigs would need to be infertile to have an effect on the larger population. Sanctuary When Chris Hinterman started Atlasta Home Sanctuary in 1995, she was focused on rescuing neglected or abandoned domestic pigs. But soon, she began getting calls about feral piglets, sometimes from hunters who had shot a big sow but couldn’t bring themselves to kill her piglets. “They feel so much remorse that they try to collect as many babies as they can, and that’s how I get them,” she said. Over the years, Ms. Hinterman has taken in hundreds of feral pigs. She vaccinates and then spays or neuters each one and then gives them free range over 40 fenced-in acres. Ms. Hinterman is not opposed to hunting but doesn’t like the idea of shooting the animals purely for entertainment. “They’re very personable,” she said. “They’ll lay down at your feet for tummy rubs.” Sanctuaries are not a practical large-scale solution, but Ms. Hinterman hopes to educate the public about animals that she thinks are misunderstood — and that are being forced into closer contact with people as humans develop more of the state’s wild places. “Where are these animals supposed to go?” she said, adding that the feral swine predicament is about more than just pigs. “People are the problem.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/science/texas-feral-hogs.html,Science,BBC,By Callaghan O’Hare and Emily Anthes,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/HS-SCI-FERAL-HOGS-stillpromo2/HS-SCI-FERAL-HOGS-stillpromo2-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:25+00:00,e290dd11ad4d63047c5da99ee253b102591098ea
158d2390b219,Why the Green Cheese Turned White,"cheese, mold, fungus, evolution, current biology journal, jasper hill farm, research, vermont, your-feed-science","Two significant things happened on a day in 2016 when a group of scientists traveled from Massachusetts to a cheese farm in Vermont. The first was a marriage proposal. The second was the scraping of samples from the rinds of 50 blue cheese wheels. The importance of those samples, though, wouldn’t become clear for many years. Researchers have used the proposal-day material as a time capsule to prove that a mold species in the cheese cave rapidly evolved, transforming a signature cheese before its makers’ eyes. The cheese, called Bayley Hazen Blue , is aged in underground vaults for three to four months while wild microbes from the air colonize its rind. The end product used to be mottled with vivid green. Over a couple of years, those cheeses changed from green to white. Lab experiments showed that a mold species in the cave had mutated, losing its ability to make pigment — like cave-dwelling animals that evolve in the dark to be albino. The results were published last month in the journal Current Biology. “There’s a lot of luck in this,” said Benjamin Wolfe, a microbiome scientist at Tufts University. His lab studies cheese from Jasper Hill Farm in Greensboro, Vt., along with other aged and fermented foods. His former adviser, Rachel Dutton, had been in Greensboro years earlier for her own lab’s research when she happened to meet Charlie Kalish, a farm intern at the time. In 2016, Mr. Kalish wanted to propose to Dr. Dutton at the farm where they’d met. He enlisted help from Dr. Wolfe. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

30c697910f6d,Bats Catch Migratory Birds and Eat Them in Midair,"bat, birds, animal behavior, research, science journal, europe, spain, your-feed-science","During spring and fall migrations, billions of birds take to the night skies. The high-altitude darkness protects them from predators. Well, most predators. New research shows an unlikely creature can successfully hunt these migrating animals. It’s a bat. In a paper published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers detailed how the largest bat in Europe, the greater noctule bat, nabbed a European robin, before chewing and eating the prey in flight. This stands in stark contrast to the bats’ typical diet of insects. The idea that these bats sometimes eat birds had already been inferred from indirect data collected by Carlos Ibáñez, a researcher with the Doñana Biological Station in Seville, Spain, and his colleagues. They had found clues such as feathers and bird DNA in the bats’ droppings. But until this paper, it remained unclear exactly how bats weighing around 50 grams — the size of a medium chicken egg — could catch birds approaching half their weight. “We finally figured out the murder mystery,” said Laura Stidsholt , a bat researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark and an author of the study. While bats are best known for hunting insects, some larger species can occasionally prey on frogs, lizards and fish. Tropical bats have also been known to snack on perching songbirds. Dr. Ibáñez saw the indirect evidence of greater noctule bats eating birds in multiple studies over a period of decades. But he kept looking for more direct evidence of these high-altitude hunts, trying and failing to catch the bats in the act with military-grade radar and instruments lofted in balloons. A turning point came when he and his colleagues, including the researcher Elena Tena, began collaborating with Dr. Stidsholt, who provided new lightweight sensors. In spring 2023, the team outfitted 17 bats with these devices in Doñana National Park in Andalusia. At first, it seemed none of the bats were going after birds. But then one day, a tagged bat returned to a roost in the park. The sensor’s audio revealed furious flapping, followed by the distress calls of a bird — and chewing. The team combined the sensor’s audio, altitude and accelerometer data to recreate one bat’s impressive high-speed chase of what they determined was a European robin, based on the bird’s distinctive sounds. After locating the robin, at around 4,000 feet up, the bat descended rapidly, following a characteristic path birds take when trying to evade falcons and hawks. The pursuit, Dr. Stidsholt said, was “like a dogfight.” More than 3,000 feet into the dive, the bat caught and killed the bird, with a bite. The chewing sounds continued for 23 minutes as the bat remained flying. In the paper, the researchers analyzed samples previously collected by Dr. Ibáñez near the roosts of greater noctule bats: wings of birds that bore the bite marks of the mammals. The researchers believe these bats rip off the wings of birds after catching them, to reduce drag. While feeding, the bats appear to avoid any bones. This proof of hunting came as a culmination to a long career for Dr. Ibáñez, who recently retired. Danilo Russo, a bat researcher at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy who wasn’t involved in the paper, called the study “a compelling example of how new technologies may help answer questions that have been waiting on researchers’ desks for many years.” The authors say the findings help broaden our understanding of the bats’ diet and foraging behavior, which is especially important given the multiple threats to the species. Although no visual evidence shows how the bats handle the birds, they most likely use their wing membrane and claws in a similar way to how they catch larger insects, Dr. Stidsholt said. Catching birds is potentially risky, Dr. Tena said, but it’s effective for providing extra calories at crucial points in the bats’ life cycle: for gestation in spring and fattening up in fall before winter hibernation. The researchers liken the ecology of the night sky to the deep sea. Even though many species of animals move through the expanse regularly, it remains barely known. “It was very cool to have a peek into a very unstudied ecosystem,” Dr. Stidsholt said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/science/bats-birds-prey.html,Science,BBC,By Douglas Main,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/09HS-tb-bats-bzkf/09HS-tb-bats-bzkf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T18:00:05+00:00,e8b73b85c1988f2478f99bffe0d8398d4cc8e552
f60bee89ba60,Toronto’s Subway Deer Enigma Unmasked With DNA Analysis,"fossil, deer, dna, subway, toronto, paleontology, research, forensic science, biology letters journal, royal ontario museum, your-feed-science","In 1976, as jackhammers and backhoes carved a subway tunnel through the glacial clays beneath Canada’s largest city, construction crews unearthed a surprise: the partial skull and antlers of a mysterious prehistoric deer. The fossil, lifted from an excavation pit near Islington Station on Toronto’s western edge, bore antler beams so thick and oddly horizontal that no scientist could match them to a living species. Eventually some paleontologists named it Torontoceros hypogaeus, meaning “horned Toronto deer from underground.” More commonly, it was called the Toronto Subway Deer. But the specimen, estimated to be at least 11,000 years old, set off decades of debate. Was this animal a strange relative of caribou? Or evidence of an altogether different deer that hit an evolutionary dead end? After nearly 50 years, the deer has given up its secrets. Using ancient DNA extracted from the fossil, researchers have shown that, in spite of its size and large antlers with a caribou-like branching point, the subway deer was most closely related to mule deer and white-tailed deer, two smaller cervids still common across North America. The study authors, led by Aaron Shafer, a population geneticist at Trent University in Ontario and a graduate student he worked with, Camille Kessler, now at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, posted their findings online in September. The paper is expected to be published soon in the journal Biology Letters. “It’s very exciting,” said Roman Croitor, a paleontologist at Moldova State University with a specialty in deer fossils. In his own research , he had grouped Torontoceros with caribou. Had he suggested on the basis of antler shape that it was closer to mule or white-tailed deer, “people would have said I’m crazy,” he said. But just as DNA evidence can overturn shaky witness accounts in a murder case, so, too, does genetic analysis deliver the final verdict in paleontology, Dr. Croitor acknowledged. According to the DNA, Torontoceros most likely split from a tangle of evolving deer lineages around two million years ago and took shape as a distinct species. It roamed the open landscapes around the Great Lakes alongside mammoths, mastodons and other ice age giants. But as the climate warmed and forests overtook the plains, its habitat disappeared and, with it, nearly every trace of the species itself. The lone subway deer specimen, held at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, is now all that remains. An artist’s rendition included in Dr. Shafer’s paper depicts the deer as a cross between Sven from Disney’s “Frozen” and the stag from HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” While a single specimen allows only a starting point for reconstructing its place in evolution, experts think there may be kindred samples lurking in museum drawers — mislabeled, overlooked or unidentified, and waiting for the tools of modern genetics to reveal their true identity . “It is possible that there are other skeletal remains of this distinct lineage,” said Charlotte Lindqvist, an evolutionary geneticist at the University at Buffalo not involved in the study. Precedent for this kind of fossil reclassification came recently from a humanlike skull unearthed in China. Originally described as a species of its own, the fossil was re-identified through molecular analysis as Denisovan , a lineage of ancient humans that diverged from Neanderthals and persisted in Asia for hundreds of thousands of years before going extinct. A similar twist could yet unfold with long-lost relatives of the Toronto subway deer. C.S. “Rufus” Churcher, the University of Toronto paleontologist who first characterized the fossil , finds this prospect enticing — and he is encouraged by the potential of genetic technologies to clarify lingering uncertainties around the deer’s origins and evolutionary ties. “The fact that we only have one animal is frustrating beyond belief,” said Dr. Churcher, now 97 and retired. “We would like to have more bits and pieces so we can tie it down more strongly.” Investigating the lost deer’s ancestry is about more than solving a paleontological puzzle, though. “It’s a tangible connection to a distant past,” said Rob MacDonald, president of ASI, an archaeological consulting firm in Ontario — and its story offers a reminder of the risks species face as the climate shifts again. Burton Lim, a curator of mammal collections at the Royal Ontario Museum and a study co-author, said he is thinking about ways to showcase the subway deer more prominently on display. Buoyed by the new DNA findings, Dr. Lim hopes the exhibit will capture public interest, highlighting how a single local fossil, unearthed by chance during a subway dig, preserved for decades in a museum and re-examined with modern technology, can reshape the understanding of the region’s natural history and past extinction events. “It tells us a story that’s not often told,” Dr. Kessler said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/science/toronto-subway-deer-dna-fossil.html,Science,BBC,By Elie Dolgin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/science/08HS-tb-subway-deer-02/08HS-tb-subway-deer-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T17:01:45+00:00,a043c45ca4eec7eef1a79c0d807e26a172a963e0
db98e7c71495,Ancient Roman Gravestone Found in New Orleans Backyard Touches Off a Mystery,"museum, archaeology;anthropology, rocks, cemetery, new orleans, roman civilization, world war ii, civitavecchia","Daniella Santoro and her husband, Aaron Lorenz, were busy “de-junglefying” the backyard of their New Orleans home in March when they found something, well, curious. There in the dirt and muck, covered by thick vines, was a marble slab with Latin engraving. Dr. Santoro, an anthropologist, thought that the stone looked like a grave marker, but there was no English anywhere on it. It turns out that Dr. Santoro was correct. The object was in fact a gravestone, but not for someone buried in her yard. No, the nearly 2,000-year-old grave marker belonged to a man named Sextus Congenius Verus, a second-century Roman sailor and soldier. “I just was so sort of flabbergasted,” Dr. Santoro said in an interview on Friday. “I was just so surprised by the fact that it was actually real. How did it get here?” The slab’s unearthing touched off a mystery that stretched across time and continents before finally, at least partly, being solved this week. Susann Lusnia, an associate professor of classical studies at Tulane University, quickly identified and authenticated the tablet after Dr. Santoro emailed her a picture of it. When she first saw the picture, she said, “it was like a shiver up my spine.” “It was clear to me that it was an ancient Roman inscription,” Professor Lusnia said. “I was going to be surprised if it turned out not to be, but I was also surprised that it was a Roman inscription because it’s in New Orleans and somebody’s backyard.” Coincidentally, Professor Lusnia said, Dr. Santoro emailed her on April 1. “Not that I was really skeptical,” she said, “but I just found that kind of amusing that it was on April Fools’ Day.” Using key words and phrases, Professor Lusnia quickly figured out the tablet’s funerary purpose and recognized the inscription as one of several that were found in an ancient Roman cemetery in the 1860s in Civitavecchia, Italy. The gravestone begins with the words: “To the spirits of the dead for Sextus Congenius Verus,” according to a translation provided by Professor Lusnia. It said that he had served in the military for 22 years and died at the age of 42. The marker was made for him by his heirs. The tablet was in a municipal library in 1910, according to Professor Lusnia, and its text was recorded in the “Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum,” a primary reference source for Latin inscriptions. Then, in 1918, the stone was recorded as being at the new Museo Civico in Civitavecchia, but the museum was basically destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. That’s where things get murky. The slab would be lost to time — until Dr. Santoro and her husband uncovered it this spring. Back when the stone was laid, Civitavecchia, which is about an hour north of Rome by train, was called Centumcellae, Professor Lusnia said. It was an imperial port city that today serves as a busy cruise ship terminal. Lara Anniboletti, the director of the National Archaeological Museum of Civitavecchia, said in a statement that the epigraph was first discovered in 1864 in the Roman sepulchral area of the classiarii, a necropolis dating back to the second and third centuries A.D., in the Prato del Turco area of Civitavecchia. “The epigraphs of the Civitavecchia classiarii document how these sailors were often recruited from distant regions of the Empire,” she said, adding that the inscriptions the museum has in its possession will be displayed in a new exhibition there, “offering a glimpse into daily life two thousand years ago.” “It is hoped that, thanks to the joint efforts of the FBI and the Italian Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, the inscription found in New Orleans will also be returned and displayed in the new museum halls,” Dr. Anniboletti said. The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment because of the government shutdown. As to how the grave marker ended up in a backyard in New Orleans, the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans said on Thursday that a woman had come forward that day and claimed responsibility for placing the stone in the yard 21 years ago. She said that she had inherited it from her grandparents, who preserved it in a display case. The woman’s grandfather, according to the center, was a soldier who was stationed in Italy during World War II. It’s unclear how he came to have it. D. Ryan Gray, an anthropologist and professor at the University of New Orleans who also helped with identifying the slab, said that although he and his colleagues often handle inquiries from people who find strange objects in their yard, “I knew pretty quickly that it was something different than what we usually get.” “Based on the style of the inscription and the type of stone, it was pretty clear from the outset that it wasn’t a New Orleans tombstone,” he said. Dr. Gray said the stone’s finding “opens up a window” into what was happening after World War II with these kinds of souvenirs. “I think we’ll see more people who kind of look into family collections and say, ‘Oh well, what is that’ as a result of this,” he said. Professor Lusnia said that the “importance of a funerary inscription for a Roman is that it keeps their name in the public eye.” “Memory is the way you have an afterlife in the Roman world,” she said. “To be remembered is to exist beyond your regular lifetime.” And in that, Sextus Congenius Verus’s heirs have succeeded, perhaps far greater than they ever could have imagined.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/roman-tablet-new-orleans.html,Science,BBC,By Aimee Ortiz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10xp-tablet-04/10xp-tablet-04-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T19:56:04+00:00,14f3b37f42b6a3bb0a0b502effdc2957dab46387

Arctic seals are slipping closer to extinction because of climate change. But there is also good news: Green sea turtles are recovering so well that they have moved from a classification of endangered to least concern. These findings were made public on Friday as an update to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, the global scientific authority on the status of species. They underscore the immense challenges facing species in a world transformed by humans but also offer exciting new evidence of how the right interventions can help them survive. “It comes down to reducing threats,” said Bryan Wallace, who helped lead the sea turtle assessment. Arctic Seals For many animals, the threats are only growing. Three species of Arctic seals, which rely on dwindling sea ice, fell to more imperiled categories. Hooded seals moved from vulnerable to endangered, while bearded seals and harp seals declined from least concern to near threatened. The animals need sea ice to rest, give birth and nurse their young. While people often assume these seals can simply move onto land as ice disappears, that simply isn’t the case, said Kit Kovacs, a leader of the conservation union’s specialist group on seals, sea lions and walruses.

The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this . Shruthi Mahalingaiah: I am a physician scientist, which means I am a doctor who does research, specializing in environmental exposure and women’s reproductive health. Several years ago, I received a nearly $3 million federal research grant to start asking questions about air pollution exposures and reproductive health. No one was asking this. We looked at air pollution exposures at different life stages and outcomes for infertility, fibroids in the uterus and endometriosis, and menstrual cycle length. Air pollution is measured by the amount of particulates that we breathe in, which can cross through our lungs and into our bloodstream. This can look like thick air, such as on a smoggy day, or what comes out of an exhaust pipe. With this grant, I also wanted to understand which time window of exposure is most important for menstrual health — prenatal, childhood or adult. Our early results showed that the first trimester of pregnancy is a time to be especially concerned about air pollution and temperature. One of my previously published studies found that for every additional 10 micrograms of particulates per cubic meter of air there was a corresponding 10 percent increase in infertility risk. But we’ve just scratched the surface. We haven’t answered questions about adult exposures or differences in outcomes among different groups of people. In the spring, a lot of research grants on the themes that I work on started being canceled, so I knew my funding might be at risk. And then there was a mass cancellation of grants at Harvard, where I work. A few weeks passed, and then I got the letter. It didn’t really hit home until then. Our grant was fully canceled. We had only spent a third of the funding, mostly as we were ramping up, hiring postdocs and research assistants. Then, in mid-September, I received notice that my grant was reinstated following a judge’s order overturning grant cancellations at Harvard. But I was still locked out of the funding. It’s feeling like we are in limbo, essentially not able to move forward. It is unclear at this point whether or when we will be receiving funds for future research. There is a lot of uncertainty. It’s very hard. The grant cancellation forced layoffs. It not only limits the research, but the pipeline — inspiring the next generation of physician scientists — that is going to take a hit. The science in our country is just really, really excellent because of the systems we have in place. These are really important questions, which allow us to think deeper and find solutions. From that perspective, the cancellation means it will take longer for me to share insights with my patients. Reducing our ability to do this work is going to be a loss for us all.

The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this . Kevin Gurney : For a while, climate change was described in terms of polar bears and ice caps, not things that are part of daily life. But emissions are all around you — every action you take is a piece of that puzzle. And my work is making that invisible reality clear and visible. Recently, I had three grants funding my labs, which were all canceled or discontinued in early June. One grant was supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. For 15 years, I was working with NIST to build a greenhouse gas monitoring and observing system at small scales for cities. We were focused on three big urban test beds in the United States: Indianapolis, Los Angeles and one in the Northeast corridor near Baltimore. It included physical instrumentation, like aircraft and cell towers. It was really about understanding our urban greenhouse gas emissions in very fine detail, going back to this premise that you cannot manage something that you don’t measure. We were really at the cusp of a prototype system. The shutdown of that program just means it’s pretty much the end of all of this urban greenhouse gas developmental work, because there wasn’t really anybody else doing it other than this. The second grant was from the Department of Energy to fund something called the Urban Integrated Field Laboratories, which were four different, large projects across the United States. I was involved with a team in the Southwest. Our emphasis was primarily on heat in cities, which are getting hotter, not just because of climate change, but because of infrastructure, which creates an urban heat island effect. Fundamentally, we were trying to learn about these systems to prevent people from dying unnecessarily from heat. And then, my third one was with NOAA. It was not canceled, but we had reached the end of the grant and it will not be continued. It was focused on my greenhouse gas emissions work, which was one piece of their larger puzzle trying to understand and model the atmosphere. Losing this funding takes a toll. I’m one person in an eight-person research group that I run, and I will slowly have to let people go. There’s no choice. And it’s devastating in a variety of ways that we won’t feel right now. It’s a loss of the pipeline of people being trained to do science that matters. Shutting that off isn’t something we can recover from quickly. This feels like a total paradigm shift in the government’s role supporting science. Science does not function when priorities change every two years. It takes too long and requires too much long-term thinking, supporting students, the developing of intellectual ideas. It is a long-term endeavor of building one brick at a time to advance our knowledge. Kevin Gurney is a professor of atmospheric science at Northern Arizona University.

583769b89b5a,She Studied How Logging Affects Pollinators,"your-feed-science, forests, flowers and plants, layoffs;furloughs, federal aid, bee, genetics and heredity, animal behavior, trees, insect, forest service, montana","Lost Science is an ongoing series of accounts from scientists who have lost their jobs or funding after cuts by the Trump administration. The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this . Kim Ballare: In graduate school, I fell in love with bees and other pollinators. They’re so important to our functioning ecosystem, but they’re really unknown to a lot of people. Most people just think about the European honeybee, which is not a native species in the United States. But there are 4,000 species of bees in the United States, and their diversity and their different functions are fascinating. My main species focus during my Ph.D. was on the Eastern Carpenter bee, which is huge — bigger than a bumblebee — and make their nests by chewing into wood with their little jaws. In 2023, when I got a job with the Forest Service, I was leading a project in Montana looking at how forest management techniques affect pollinators — specifically, logging and prescribed burning. It was my first major grant. We bought a lot of equipment and planned to support a Ph.D. student. The site is a beautiful forest with mainly lodgepole pine and spruce and Douglas fir, with some open areas that are just full of wildflowers like lupines and geraniums and balsam root, which looks like a big sunflower. A lot of our knowledge about pollinators is about agriculture. But if we didn’t have a diversity of native insects, native plants might not reproduce effectively, and that would reduce food for tons of other wildlife. Just having these interactions is really important to maintain the life of the ecosystem. There isn’t really a lot of work that’s been done on pollinators in forests. We’re increasingly understanding that it’s an important habitat for pollinators. We were hoping to use environmental DNA. An insect will land on a flower, deposit DNA, and then later you can extract the DNA off the flower to see what insects are visiting it. Often, when we’re doing a pollinator study, we’ll catch an insect with a net, and we can write down what flower it was visiting. But that’s just a snapshot. With environmental DNA, we can potentially see more of the insects that are visiting. I got fired, and then I was reinstated after a month based on one of the court decisions. But when I came back, the grant was still frozen. The experience of being a federal employee right now is pretty brutal. You get emails from DOGE encouraging us to leave our low productivity jobs in federal government and get a high productivity job in the private sector. I loved my job before that. It was an exciting opportunity to do applied pollinator research, which is what I want to do for my career. And then that got snatched away. I feel lucky to have my new job, but I’m definitely still in mourning.

bfaf9f284500,Trump’s Energy Cuts Punished Mostly Blue States. Red States Might Be Next.,"us politics, climate change;global warming, renewable energy, oil and gasoline, closings, hydrogen, energy department, new york, donald trump, mike lawler, nick langworthy","The Energy Department’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for clean energy projects is poised to cause significant job losses and disruptions, leaders of several states have said, even as internal documents suggest that the agency may be contemplating deeper cuts in the months ahead. The agency’s termination of more than two dozen grants in New York State alone would threaten more than 1,000 jobs and nearly $500 million in investments in the state, according to figures compiled by the office of Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, and reviewed by The New York Times. The New York figures represent the first official tally of how the funding cuts, which so far have largely targeted Democratic-led states, would affect the state and its growing clean energy sector. They come as President Trump appears to be seeking to maximize the pain of the government shutdown for his political opponents, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House minority leader. At the same time, many lawmakers and companies fear that the Energy Department could soon cancel even more funding, including for projects in Republican-led states. An internal document circulating among lobbyists and lawmakers suggests that the agency is considering terminating an additional $12 billion in Biden-era awards, including funding for two large projects in Louisiana and Texas that aimed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Technology that removes carbon dioxide, a main driver of global warming, is supported by some oil and gas companies that want to use that captured gas to extract more crude from mature oil fields. One of the federal hubs would have been located in the Louisiana district of Representative Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker. The Energy Department said on Wednesday it had not made any final decisions beyond the initial $7.5 billion in cancellations announced last week. “The department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Energy Department, wrote in an email. “No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced. Any reporting suggesting otherwise is false.” In New York, most of the canceled funding would have gone toward Democratic congressional districts. But some of the money would have benefited Republican districts in the blue state, including those of Representatives Nick Langworthy and Mike Lawler. “By refusing to stand up to Trump, New York Republicans in Congress are stabbing their own constituents in the back,” Ms. Hochul said in a statement. “Instead of celebrating the opening of a local factory or congratulating a neighbor on their new six-figure job, these Congress members would rather stand idly by as Trump strips their communities of 21st century economic opportunity.” The Energy Department had awarded more than $26 million to two companies in Mr. Lawler’s Hudson Valley district, including a company developing advanced batteries . “I’m in New York and I’m a Republican, and obviously this project cancellation impacts my district, so it’s not just Democrats getting impacted,” Mr. Lawler told CNN. A spokesman for Mr. Lawler, Ciro Riccardi, blamed Democrats for the shutdown. “None of this would be happening if Senator Schumer and his caucus hadn’t shut down the government at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries,” he wrote in an email. In the Central New York district of Representative John Mannion, a Democrat, a factory that makes parts for electric heat pumps may no longer pursue a $25 million expansion after the Energy Department canceled a $5 million grant to help pay for the project. The expansion of the Bitzer Scroll plant would have added a new assembly line, initially creating 20 jobs. “The whole thing of Trump bringing jobs back to America is completely running in reverse for us,” John Allcott, vice president of North American operations for Bitzer Scroll, told the local media outlet Syracuse.com . “It’s just killing us.” For months, political appointees at the Energy Department have been reviewing billions of dollars worth of climate and infrastructure spending that had been awarded by the Biden administration, claiming that the money was rushed out the door but providing few details about specific problems. In recent weeks, the Energy Department sent the White House’s Office of Management and Budget a list of roughly $23 billion in funding that it had marked for potential termination, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to describe internal documents. The Trump administration initially chose to slash a subset of those funds, about $7.5 billion, that were largely concentrated in blue states. The cuts underscored the administration’s strategy of putting pressure on Democrats to accept a Republican budget bill and reopen the government. “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled,” Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, wrote in a social media post last week. Those projects include major upgrades to electrical grids in California, Minnesota and Oregon; efforts to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations in Colorado; and large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels in California and the Pacific Northwest. This week, however, a leaked list marking an additional $12 billion in potential terminations has been circulating in Washington. It indicated that funding could be canceled for dozens of projects in Republican-led states as well. That larger list of potentially affected projects includes the five remaining clean hydrogen hubs in places like Appalachia, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest and Texas, many of which aimed to produce hydrogen from natural gas. It would also include a variety of grants for retooling automotive factories to produce electric vehicles or to recycle lithium-ion batteries. The list of expanded targets also suggests that the Energy Department is considering axing up to $1.2 billion in awards for so-called direct air capture hubs in Louisiana and Texas. Those hubs, authorized by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, aimed to test and scale up technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It is uncertain whether or when the Energy Department might go through with this additional wave of cuts, and the leaked list has set off a furious lobbying battle in Washington to save projects. Some companies that would be directly affected by the cuts said they had not heard of any final decisions. “We aren’t aware of a decision from D.O.E. and continue to productively engage with the administration in a project review,” said Vikrum Aiyer, head of global policy at Heirloom, a company working on carbon dioxide removal and a main participant in Louisiana’s direct air capture hub. Companies or universities that receive federal awards typically sign a legally binding agreement and then spend their own money, on the expectation that they will be reimbursed by the government. Any recipients that have their funding axed could potentially sue the Energy Department, just as recipients from the Environmental Protection Agency have sued after the Trump administration canceled their grants.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/climate/trump-clean-energy-grants-cuts.html,Science,BBC,By Maxine Joselow and Brad Plumer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08cli-energy-mtkb/08cli-energy-mtkb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T18:11:12+00:00,94407af424fe73ef64292a2ddf02c5aecfc937e9

7841590da60b,Nobel Prize in Chemistry Awarded to Architects of Metal-Organic Frameworks,"your-feed-science, chemistry, nobel prize, research, richard robson, susumu kitagawa, omar mwannes yaghi, internal-open-access-from-nl","Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for the development of molecular building blocks with spaces large enough that gases and other chemicals can flow through them. The cavities on the inside are “almost like rooms in a hotel, so that guest molecules can enter and also exit again from the same material,” Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said during the announcement of the award. The laureates’ discoveries, he added, paved the way for the creation of materials that can separate toxic chemicals from wastewater or harvest water molecules in a desert. The laureates’ work started with experiments by Dr. Robson in the 1980s and gradually developed over a period of about 15 years. “It takes time for science to be recognized, and it takes multiple workers in the field with different approaches,” said Dorothy Phillips, president of the American Chemical Society. The three laureates will share a prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or around $1.17 million. Why did the Nobel Committee say they received the prize? The scientists are responsible for developing a new kind of molecular structure that combined metals and organic molecules. The metals act as nodes and are linked up by organic molecules containing carbon. Large, empty spaces form inside these structures through which gases and other materials can flow. Dr. Robson first experimented with metal-organic frameworks in 1989, when he combined copper ions with four-armed molecules, the committee said. The result was a sort of crystal with large cavities, indicating that other molecules might be able to move in and out of the framework easily. But the structure was unstable and collapsed quickly. That initial experiment was built on by Dr. Kitagawa and Dr. Yaghi, whose work from 1992 to 2003 helped stabilize the framework that Dr. Robson had created, the committee said. Dr. Linke likened the structure to the handbag used by the character Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series. The bag looks small on the outside, but has space on the inside to fit larger stuff. Other experts noted that metal-organic frameworks are three-dimensional, porous materials that act as a molecular sponge, able to capture other materials. Substances based on metal-organic frameworks are “some of the highest porosity solids that exist on our planet,” said Theresa Reineke, a chemist at the University of Minnesota who worked on her Ph.D. with Dr. Yaghi. In chemistry, molecules arrange themselves in unpredictable structures. The scientists were able to combine metals and organic molecules as “building blocks,” so that even if the size of the clusters changed, you would still get the same structure but with larger cavities inside, said Kim Jelfs, a computational chemist at Imperial College London. That level of control within chemistry has “always been a challenge,” she said. “So that’s part of the excitement.” The scientists’ experiments laid the foundation for the development of thousands of metal-organic structures with many real-world applications, like trapping gas emitted by fruit so it ripens more slowly. It has “sparked a whole field,” Dr. Jelfs said. “There’s an enormous number of people that work in this area now,” she added. One commercial application for metal-organic frameworks is a technology that contains toxic gas during the production of semiconductors, according to a summary posted by the Nobel committee. The porous structure acts like a sponge that sucks in more gas than traditional materials are capable of holding. The scientific field around metal-organic frameworks is focused on higher complexity applications. “We’re just scratching the surface,” Amanda Morris, a chemist at Virginia Tech, said. Dr. Yaghi is currently working on those applications. He’s the founder of Atoco, a start-up that is working on technologies that can harvest water and capture carbon. These technologies are made from materials that use metal-organic frameworks. In capturing water, for instance, the frameworks act as a sponge with a higher surface of pores to absorb more volume per mass. In previous experiments, a metal-organic framework Dr. Yaghi’s group worked with captured water vapor at night then used the heat of the sun to convert it into water the next day. Who are the winners? Richard Robson is a professor at the University of Melbourne in Australia, where he has taught since 1966. In a phone interview posted by the Nobel committee, Dr. Robson, 88, said there were “upsides and downsides” to the news of the prize. “I’m quite old now, and handling all the nonsense that’s going to happen is going to be hard work,” he said. Dr. Robson recalled he “always felt sort of second rate for not being a mathematician” as a younger scientist, and drifted into the field of chemistry because he “couldn’t think of anything better to do.” Susumu Kitagawa received his Ph.D. in 1979 from Kyoto University in Japan, where he now teaches. At a news conference hosted by Kyoto University, Dr. Kitagawa said that he learned about the prize while finishing some work in his classroom. He said he’d been getting many sales calls on his phone recently and so he “answered the phone in a bad mood.” During the prize announcement, Dr. Kitagawa said that he was “surprised and delighted” at having been selected by the committee. “I want to share my joy with the other two,” he said of Dr. Robson and Dr. Yaghi. Omar M. Yaghi received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Yaghi was born to Palestinian refugees who settled in Jordan, and moved to New York for college, first at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy. He switched to the State University of New York at Albany in 1983. In a phone interview posted by the Nobel committee, Dr. Yaghi said while waiting for an airplane to take off that he grew up in a “very humble home,” sharing a room with the cattle his family raised. His parents could barely read or write, he said. In a news conference hosted later by Berkeley, Dr. Yaghi credited the American public university system for what he had achieved, and added that getting his first grant from the National Science Foundation ultimately led to his Nobel Prize. Science, he reflected during the earlier phone interview, “is the greatest equalizing force in the world.” “Smart people, talented people, skilled people, exist everywhere,” he added. During the Berkeley news conference, he highlighted the value of scholars coming to the United States from other countries, saying that the spread of knowledge often comes from people moving across regions. “Science allows us to talk to each other, and I don’t think you can stop that,” he said. “I think that that’s something that will continue to be important, and enlightened societies will encourage it.” Who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024? The prize went to Demis Hassabis, John Jumper and David Baker for work that showed the potential of artificial intelligence and other technology to predict the shape of proteins and to invent new ones. Who else has won a Nobel Prize this year? Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi received the physiology or medicine prize on Monday for their discoveries of peripheral immune tolerance — the system that explains how the immune system prevents rogue cells from attacking tissues and organs. John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis were awarded the physics prize on Tuesday for showing that two properties of quantum mechanics, the physical laws that rule the subatomic realm, could be observed in a system large enough to see with the naked eye. When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced? The prize for chemistry was the third of six Nobel Prizes awarded this year. Each award recognizes groundbreaking contributions by an individual or organization in a specific field. The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. Last year, Han Kang , known best for her novel “The Vegetarian,” became the first writer from South Korea to receive the award. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo. Last year, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo , a grass-roots movement of atomic bomb survivors, received the award “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.” Next week, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were honored for research into how institutions shape which countries become wealthy and prosperous — and how those structures came to exist in the first place.

403be24930c3,"John B. Gurdon, 92, Dies; Nobelist Paved Way for Cloning of Animals","obituary, john b gurdon, cloning, biology and biochemistry, nobel prize","Dr. John B. Gurdon, a British biologist and Nobel laureate who in the early 1960s introduced a paradigm-shifting method of cell manipulation that led to the world’s first cloning of a large mammal, a sheep named Dolly, died on Tuesday. He was 92. His death was confirmed by Ben Simons, the director of the Gurdon Institute, a research center founded in Dr. Gurdon’s name in 1991 at the University of Cambridge in England. He did not specify where Dr. Gurdon died or cite the cause. An emeritus professor at the university, Dr. Gurdon was a giant in the field of developmental biology. His lifelong work in the study and manipulation of cells laid the foundation for stem cell biology and the discipline of regenerative medicine, an emerging process of manipulating patients’ cells to produce replacement organs or tissues. Dr. Gurdon first came to global prominence in 1962 as a graduate student at the University of Oxford, with the publication of his now classic experiments involving the cloning of the frog species Xenopus laevis. In that research, he extracted the nuclei from the intestinal cells of a mature frog, which contained the amphibian’s DNA. He then injected the nuclei into frog egg cells whose nuclei had been removed. The eggs efficiently “reprogrammed” the genes in the transplanted nucleus: They switched from performing the role of a highly differentiated intestinal cell to reproducing an organism, a process known as nuclear reprogramming. At the time, scientists believed that a specialized cell, like an intestinal cell, was incapable of performing duties other than those of an intestinal cell. The experiment, in Oxford’s embryology laboratory, proved that cells retain all of their genetic information no matter how specialized. “Dr. Gurdon challenged the dogma that the differentiated state was fixed and irreversible,” Dr. Helen Blau, director of the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., said in an interview for this obituary in 2024. “He showed that if a nucleus was removed and transplanted into an enucleated frog egg, that a swimming tadpole would develop.” Dr. Blau was an undergraduate in 1969 when she first learned of Dr. Gurdon’s experiments and was so inspired by them, she said, that she began to build on his work. By the 1980s, she had demonstrated that nuclear reprogramming was not limited to amphibians but possible in mammals, too. Dr. Blau and her team of stem cell biologists say that Dr. Gurdon further proved that nuclear reprogramming is an ideal method of obtaining pluripotent stem cells, the blank slates capable of morphing into any kind of cell type. Pluripotent stem cells are studied in research on cancer and the regeneration of nerves for people who have lost the function of limbs. “It was a deceptively simple experiment,” Dr. Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, said of the Xenopus laevis study in an interview. He was a graduate student in Dr. Gurdon’s lab at the University of Cambridge from 1975 to 1980. “John demonstrated that cells retain all of their genes,” Dr. Melton said, “and through nuclear reprogramming you can take them back to the beginning.” Dr. Gurdon’s amphibian research, followed by Dr. Blau’s mammalian studies in nuclear reprogramming, laid the intellectual groundwork for the cloning of Dolly in 1996 in Scotland. But it wasn’t until 2006 that scientists fully understood how nuclear reprogramming, which Dr. Gurdon had documented for decades, worked at all. In Japan, Dr. Shinya Yamanaka found that nuclear reprogramming occurs when DNA-controlling agents, known as transcription factors, coax lab-manipulated cells to respond to a nucleus transplant roughly to the way an egg cell would react when fertilized by sperm. John Bertrand Gurdon was born on Oct. 2, 1933, in the English hamlet of Dippenhall to William Nathaniel Gurdon and Elsie (Byass) Gurdon. He had a sister, Caroline. His father was a banker who retired in his 40s and later earned a living transcribing textbooks into Braille. William Gurdon hailed from a long line of distinguished Gurdons dating back nearly 1,000 years in British history. Dr. Gurdon attended private elementary schools and enjoyed entomology, raising moths and butterflies at home. At age 13, he was sent to board at Eton, where he brought along his jars of caterpillars. Two years into his studies there, however, a teacher strongly dissuaded him from studying biology and other sciences. In a scathing note to him, the teacher wrote: “I believe Gurdon has ideas about becoming a scientist. On present showing, this is quite ridiculous.” Dr. Gurdon kept the note throughout his life and a copy is posted on his biographical page of the Nobel Prize website. “That was a pretty crippling introduction to biology,” Dr. Gurdon said in an interview in 2008 in the Journal of Cell Biology. The note had a rippling effect, causing him to be barred from all sciences at Eton. The school’s masters forced him to focus, instead, on Ancient Greek and Latin. Immediately after Eton, he was admitted to Oxford University, but that damning note also affected his eligibility to enroll in the sciences there. Without a secondary-school science record, he couldn’t major in zoology, the discipline he had hoped to study. That compelled his parents to intervene, by arranging two years of tutoring in the sciences. He finally entered Oxford in 1953, and as an undergraduate made the first major discovery of his career. While walking in woods in Oxford, he came upon an insect that at first blush looked something like a common housefly — but not exactly. He captured the specimen, he told the journal Development in 2017, and took it to the university’s entomologists. They were stumped. He then brought the insect to the Natural History Museum in London, where a curator identified the insect as a Hymenopteran, commonly known as a sawfly, the first ever found in England. Dr. Gurdon wrote about the discovery in an entomology magazine in 1954. He graduated from Oxford in 1956 and soon began postgraduate work there, finishing his doctorate in 1962. After a year of postdoctoral study at Caltech in California, he returned to England, where he met and married Jean Elizabeth Curtis, the daughter of a business owner in the city of Oxford. They had two children, Aurea and William. His wife and children survive him, as do two grandchildren. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Dr. Gurdon received numerous honors, including the Wolf Prize, an Israeli international award in the sciences, and the Lasker Award, often called the American Nobel. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1995 for his scientific contributions. “John was always very curious,” Dr. Melton said in the 2024 interview. “To him, science was a wonderful life, and he thought everyone should participate in it. He trained a whole generation of scientists. The world’s universities are populated with his protégées.” Ash Wu contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/science/john-b-gurdon-dead.html,Science,BBC,By Delthia Ricks,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/07Gurdon--ztjw-PRINT1/07Gurdon--ztjw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T00:15:29+00:00,12156e2ab0a18dd1889092e0a3af5cdbd9497dbb
fbdf182f7867,"An Interstellar Comet Flew Past Mars, and Spacecraft Took Pictures","space, comet, milky way, mars, camera, research, european space agency","Typically, the orbiter, which has studied Mars since 2016 , points its camera downward at the surface 250 miles below, snapping about three pictures a second with an exposure time of about 1.5 milliseconds, Dr. Thomas said. Here, it was aimed at a dot nearly 20 million miles away, with five-second exposures, trying to make out something that was between 1/10,000th and 1/100,000th as bright as its usual observations. Five seconds was long enough to gather enough light, but not too long for the dot to become smeared too much by the motion of the comet. “Surprised it was that good, to be honest,” Dr. Thomas said. The camera also took images through its red, near-infrared and blue filters, which could give clues about the properties of Comet 3I/ATLAS. If, for example, the ratio of blue to red light becomes larger farther away from the nucleus, that could point to comet particles becoming smaller as ice turns to vapor, Dr. Thomas said. (Smaller particles scatter blue light more efficiently.) If there were little or no ice, then the particles would remain roughly the same size. The scientists will have to analyze the images more carefully before they can come to confident conclusions. Although they can see the comet clearly, the color filters block more of the light, making it more difficult to detect a genuine scientific signal amid noise in the sensors. Mars Express, an older ESA spacecraft in orbit around Mars for more than two decades, also tried to snap pictures, but its camera could make exposures only half a second long. So far, nothing has turned up in those images, taken between Oct. 1 and Oct. 7.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/science/mars-interstellar-comet-3i-atlas.html,Science,BBC,By Kenneth Chang,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07HS-sci-mars-comet-glcf/07HS-sci-mars-comet-glcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T22:00:23+00:00,9f2e986e9a743561c4244dc3c19b2aa5dcfdb3c5

The president ordered the Interior Department and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue all necessary permits for the road, known as the Ambler Access Project, which was blocked last year by the Biden administration . The Trump administration also said the government would invest $35.6 million in exchange for a 10 percent stake in the Canadian company Trilogy Metals. Vancouver-based Trilogy Metals is a 50 percent owner of Alaska-based Ambler Metals, the company behind the contentious mining venture. The order handed a major victory to the project’s proponents and continued the Trump administration’s pattern of taking investment stakes in private companies like the chipmaker Intel and the mining firm Lithium Americas . During a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said he was “very familiar with” Alaska, which he called “an economic gold mine, so to speak.” He said the copper and zinc mine was “something that should have been long operating and making billions of dollars for our country and supplying a lot of energy and minerals.” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said during the event that in addition to “drill, baby, drill,” the Trump administration’s mantra was “mine, baby, mine.” He said the order would help the United States compete with China, which dominates the global supply chain for critical minerals used in energy technologies and military applications.

568349f319c6,Maryland Judges Weigh Whether Cities Can Sue Over Climate Change,"climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, lawsuits, federalism, oil and gasoline, companies, regulation and deregulation, state supreme court, maryland","The Maryland Supreme Court heard arguments Monday on an issue facing judges nationwide: Whether or not local communities can sue oil companies over their role in climate change. The leaders of Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County sued some of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies in 2018 and 2021, alleging a decades-long disinformation campaign to mislead the public about what causes global warming. The companies’ deception, they argued, encouraged the burning of oil and gas, which unleashed more of the greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming the world and causing damage in Maryland including storms, extreme heat and sea-level rise. The lawsuits are part of a batch of some three dozen similar cases brought by local governments since 2017 against energy companies, trade groups and utilities in state courts. Both sides have notched wins and losses in early action, but none of the cases have made it to trial yet. Many legal experts expect the Supreme Court to eventually review the thorny questions at the heart of the cases. In Maryland, lower courts dismissed the suits. Now the plaintiffs are asking the state’s highest judges to reverse those decisions. Victor Sher, the lead lawyer for the governments, asked the judges to consider similar cases in Hawaii and Colorado. In those states, the top courts have decided the cases could go to trial, overruling the oil industry’s contention that federal law should apply, not state law. He also disputed the defendants’ arguments that the lawsuits seek to regulate worldwide emissions, a task far outside the abilities of state laws.

3b9e78ef7ad2,Groups Sue E.P.A. Over Canceled $7 Billion for Solar Energy,"us politics, epa, southern environmental law center, solar energy, climate change;global warming, one big beautiful bill act, lawyers for good government","A coalition of solar energy companies, labor unions, nonprofit groups and homeowners sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday over its termination of $7 billion in grants intended to help low- and moderate-income families install solar panels on their homes. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island, accused the agency of illegally revoking the money under the Solar for All program without congressional approval. It expanded an ever-widening legal battle over President Trump’s efforts to claw back billions of dollars in climate funding that had been approved by the Biden administration. The lead plaintiff is the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a group of labor unions that had trained electricians and other workers to install solar panels in the state. While the unions did not directly receive funds under the Solar for All program, they had been counting on work that would have followed a $49.3 million grant to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources. “Now that the program is on hold, potentially hundreds of job opportunities are lost,” said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. He said the Trump administration had jeopardized hundreds of additional jobs for his members by ordering work to halt on several wind farms off the coast of New England. “It’s not just a one-two punch to the work force that I represent,” Mr. Crowley said. “It really is a one-two punch to the entire state of Rhode Island because our energy costs need to be controlled, and renewable energy sources like solar and wind are a key component of that.” Other plaintiffs include a homeowner in Atlanta who had applied for free rooftop solar panels from an initiative supported by a $156 million grant to the Georgia Bright Communities Coalition and companies that install solar panels in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit legal advocacy groups including the Southern Environmental Law Center and Lawyers for Good Government. Brigit Hirsch, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the suit, citing an agency policy of not commenting on pending litigation. The Solar for All program was not only intended to help low- and moderate-income homeowners. It was also meant to expand community solar initiatives , which bring solar energy to people who don’t own their own homes or otherwise can’t install their own panels. The program was projected to help 900,000 households get access to solar power, according to estimates by the Biden administration . The idea was to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the leading driver of climate change, while also helping to lower electricity bills. The participating households were expected to collectively save $350 million each year on utility costs. Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in August that he was ending the Solar for All program at the behest of Congress. He said that Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill, which Congress passed in July, had eliminated what he called “billions of green slush fund dollars” under Solar for All. “The bottom line again is this: E.P.A. no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Mr. Zeldin said in a video posted to social media. But in the lawsuit, the coalition argued that the bill revoked only climate grants that the E.P.A. had not yet awarded. Under the Biden administration, the agency had awarded the Solar for All grants to 60 state agencies, nonprofit groups and Native American tribes. The claim that the bill rescinded the Solar for All grants is “patently false and legally unsupportable,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government. The Solar for All program was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature climate law. The measure authorized a total of $27 billion in grants for green activities like installing electric vehicle charging stations and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency. Last month, an appeals court ruled against several nonprofit groups that had $16 billion in such grants frozen by the E.P.A. In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the Trump administration had acted legally in its attempts to claw back the funds. Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, said that because the case was essentially a dispute between the government and grant recipients, it belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit filed Monday is unlikely to face a similar setback, legal experts said, since it was not brought by the grant recipients.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/climate/epa-solar-for-all-lawsuit.html,Science,BBC,By Maxine Joselow,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/18/multimedia/01cli-solar-lawsuit/01cli-solar-lawsuit-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-06T14:11:12+00:00,1e10f804acdb2ea96d853d0a4ce9e4a098acbcde
e8c9e1d6c179,"If Your North Star Is Lost, New Techniques Can Point You South","navigation, galaxy, space, books","Long before GPS and magnetic compasses, written maps or even writing, people oriented themselves under the cosmos using rules of thumb. Orally transmitted knowledge has repeatedly shown that Indigenous peoples all over the world have sophisticated understandings of the stars. And in early literature like Homer’s “Odyssey,” the nymph Calypso teaches Odysseus how to sail home by keeping the Great Bear constellation to his left. By now, it should seem like there is nothing new under the billions of suns that make up the night sky that could help people navigate in the dark. But a British author, Tristan Gooley, writes in a new book about following environmental signs throughout the year, “The Hidden Seasons,” that he has identified a new pair of hacks to find one’s way through the world by starlight. The book is published by the independent publisher The Experiment and comes out on Oct. 21 . Mr. Gooley, a proponent of what he calls natural navigation, preaches attention to common patterns in nature like a sommelier describing wine — the shadows cast by the sun here, the tree angled there, the moss greener on this side of the rock. As part of that work he has invented, or perhaps reinvented, a couple of wayfinding methods. For example: After sunset in midwinter in the Northern Hemisphere, dress warm and go outdoors to a spot where you have a relatively unobstructed view to the south. Rolling up to the sky from the southeast, you’ll see a letter “V” made up of bright stars in the constellation Taurus. When two particular stars in that “V” are stacked in an invisible vertical line, let that line drop down to the horizon, where it will point due south. Or suppose it’s a midsummer night instead. You can perform the same kind of trick (in lighter clothing) with a pattern of stars that resemble a teapot inside the constellation Sagittarius. When two of these stars, Ascella and Kaus Media, align horizontally in the sky, you’re in business.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/science/southern-stars-constellation-compass.html,Science,BBC,By Joshua Sokol,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/03/multimedia/2025-10-06-star-alignment-sagittarius/2025-10-06-star-alignment-sagittarius-facebookJumbo-v4.png,2025-10-06T13:45:28.654000+00:00,55a65584ab7abe2307d351cb65d3577ad2fca409

Every October, committees in Sweden and Norway name laureates in a variety of prizes related to science, literature and economics, as well as peace work. Six prizes will be awarded. Laureates will receive their Nobel Prize medals and diplomas in Stockholm in December. Here is a quick guide to this year’s prizes. What are the Nobel Prizes? Six Nobel Prizes are awarded every year, each recognizing an individual’s or an organization’s groundbreaking contribution in a specific field. Prizes are given for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, economic science, literature and peace work, the last of which often draws the most attention because of the fame of the people and groups nominated. This year, there are 338 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize — 244 individuals and 94 organizations, the Nobel committee said . Last year, the institute received 286 nominations.

954256f4fcdd,Wreck of Shackleton’s Endurance Tied to Culprit Other Than Ice,"ernest shackleton, shipwrecks, antarctica, ice, exploration, ships and shipping, polar research, research, your-feed-science","On Oct. 27, 1915, after being caught and crushed by packed ice for nine months in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica, Ernest Shackleton and his crew abandoned the Endurance and their quest to traverse the frozen continent by land. The doomed ship drifted atop the ice for three more weeks before finally sinking. For over a century, experts have put the blame for the ship’s demise on an ice floe overwhelming the rudder and creating a large gash in the vessel. But a study released Monday in the journal Polar Record contends that the ship, not the ice, was to blame. The Endurance was ill equipped for its mission, a flaw that Shackleton was aware of long before he launched to Antarctica. Jukka Tuhkuri , an ice researcher and naval architect at Aalto University in Finland and author of the new study, was aboard Endurance22 with the team that discovered the wreck in 2022 . As a side project, he began analyzing diaries, personal correspondences and the ship’s wreckage to find out why the Endurance sank. A year and a half later he was staring at images of what had been described as the strongest wooden ship ever built in the archives of the Royal Geological Society in London. A hypothesis came to him. “It’s not the ice, it’s the ship,” Dr. Tuhkuri said. He noticed that the hull of the Endurance lacked the beams that would have given it enough brawn to endure an onslaught of crushing ice. As a result, the rudder, stern post and part of the keel were torn apart, causing the ship to fill rapidly with water. While Shackleton wrote in his book “South: A Memoir of the Endurance Voyage” that it was insurmountable ice floes that doomed his ship, the study suggests that he knew otherwise. He wrote to his wife, Emily Shackleton, that “this ship is not as strong as the Nimrod constructionally,” referring to the wooden vessel Shackleton took on his 1908 Antarctica expedition. Endurance, a touring ship built for hunting polar bears and walruses in the Arctic, was “designed to work at the edge of the pack ice but not to be frozen in,” said Walter Ansel , the senior shipwright at Mystic Seaport Museum, in Mystic, Conn., who was not involved in the study. Not only was Shackleton aware of Endurance’s shortcomings, but he also had the expertise on how to fix them. He had helped the German polar explorer Wilhelm Filchner equip his ship Deutschland with the same structural beams that Endurance lacked. Later, in 1912, Deutschland drifted in the ice-packed Antarctic waters for eight months but survived. The paper notes five ice compression events taken from the diaries of crew members, building up to a culminating event on Oct. 17. One crew member, Reginald James, wrote that “the pressure was mostly along the region of the engine room where there are no beams of any strength.” Capt. Frank Worsley described the engine room as “the weakest part of the ship.” Both entries, dated to Oct. 17, describe a ship being crushed by ice because of its structural inadequacies. The American whaling fleet had repeatedly run into similar catastrophes. In 1876, 12 inadequately reinforced ships were lost as a result of compressive ice near Alaska, Mr. Ansel said. Michael Bravo , a professor at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said many polar exploration ships were not suited for their journeys. Such vessels were seldom readily available. “Most of them were purchased second hand and adapted as time and money permitted,” Dr. Bravo said. Indeed, this could have been true of Endurance, suggests Michael Smith, author of the book “Shackleton: By Endurance We Conquer,” who was not involved in the new study. Shackleton may have known that the ship wasn’t ideal for the voyage. But he was restless at home, and struggling with financial debt and a failing marriage. “The scale of this expedition is truly daunting, but he needed something to get his teeth into and he wanted to get away,” Mr. Smith said. He added that Shackleton was competing with other explorers to conquer the Antarctic. Still, Mr. Smith doubts this will change our view of Shackleton. Historians knew already that he was a man who took chances and made big calls under pressure. The grave risks of these missions were known to the explorers. “To be a polar explorer a century ago was an act of faith in itself,” Mr. Smith said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/science/shackleton-endurance-antarctica.html,Science,BBC,By Sara Novak,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/science/06HS-sci-shackleton/06HS-sci-shackleton-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-06T10:00:14+00:00,0bb1a3e5361c2a57bd8072920b4dc6458da34e79
c63b33272945,Diane Keaton’s Unmistakable Look Also Was Key to Her Art,"movies, fashion, actor, personal profile;people story, diane keaton, woody allen, nancy meyers, annie hall, something's gotta give","Diane Keaton’s clothes were cinema. That much is certainly true when she emerges in “Annie Hall” after a tennis match in a wide-brimmed hat, khaki pants and an oversize vest with a tie poking out of it — perhaps the most memorable outfit in the history of movies. That’s the moment when Keaton’s Annie first connects with Alvy Singer, played by the film’s director, Woody Allen, and her styling is so immediately idiosyncratic that it tells you everything you need to know about her character: She’s unique and a little bit askew in her supreme preppiness. She looks like no one you’ve ever seen, a revelation in the tie her “grammy” gave her. Her dialogue seems to match the quirkiness of her clothing as she awkwardly makes small talk with Alvy, chiding herself for saying something “dumb” when he compliments her tennis playing. “La-di-da, la-di-da, la-la,” she says, her hand on her hip. You get the sense that Annie threw on her clothes the same way she utters “La-di-da”: with little thought but complete earnestness, almost magically intriguing. Keaton, whose death at 79 was confirmed on Saturday, was already known for “The Godfather” films by the time she appeared in “Annie Hall” in 1977, but it was the Allen comedy that would define not just her career but also her unmistakable aesthetic. The Diane Keaton look consisted of high necklines and oddball takes on traditionally male looks — hats and blazers; turtlenecks and button-downs; scarves and ties: menswear reimagined for herself. Other women would try to emulate her on red carpets or even in movies, like Meg Ryan in “When Harry Met Sally” (1989), for example. And yet, for the imitators, these ensembles looked like costumes. For Keaton, they were an ethos. As an actress, Keaton could, when she wanted to, disappear into roles, like the unsuspecting mob wife Kay Corleone in “The Godfather” saga or the early 20th-century journalist Louise Bryant in Warren Beatty’s drama “Reds” (1981). But Keaton’s, well, Keaton-ness was also one of her great skills. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

042f9c31ebad,‘A House of Dynamite’ Review: Kathryn Bigelow’s Alarming Command and Control,"movies, kathryn bigelow, gabriel basso, idris elba, rebecca ferguson, tracy letts, anthony ramos","Written by Noah Oppenheim, “A House of Dynamite” is divided into separate sections that advance the narrative from different angles. The first section situates you geographically and otherwise as the story jumps among characters and locations. Dawn is breaking in Fort Greely, Alaska — a missile defense launch site — where Major Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) fields a personal mobile call before settling in to oversee other soldiers intently monitoring screens. It’s the middle of the night in D.C. when the brisk, no-nonsense Captain Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) says goodbye to her husband and toddler before heading to the Situation Room. One of the givens, however simplistic, is that they’re all just doing their jobs and serving the country; the lack of overt partisan politics feels quaintly old-fashioned. With speed and focus, the movie soon pulls you in further, as does the expansive cast. Although Idris Elba has top billing (he plays the president, code name Icon), and some performers have more substantial roles than others, there’s no central protagonist. The first section introduces dozens of characters, some of whom turn out to be relatively inconsequential. A wide-eyed White House newbie (Willa Fitzgerald) seems on hand mostly to look confused by the armed personnel swarming the White House to sweep away to ostensible safety those designated worth saving. The fumbling, humorously tardy deputy national security adviser, Jake (Gabriel Basso), by contrast, is soon on a nerve-thwacking call with Russia. American cinema has long been hooked on disaster, on near-misses and last-ditch saves, epically sized and not; violence is good for business, and so are cheap heroics. That has only intensified over the past few decades, accelerated by the rise of the superhero flicks, with their endless wars and orgiastic violence. Bigelow, a virtuoso of complex action cinema, has directed her share of movies about catastrophes, including “K-19: The Widowmaker” (2002), a nail-biter that revisits a queasily real 1961 accident on a nuclear-powered Soviet submarine. That film flopped, but she continued making movies about extreme situations and characters on the edge, notably “ The Hurt Locker ” (2009), about American soldiers in Iraq. Bigelow’s work here is superb. She puts the many moving parts into coordinated place and keeps them coherently spinning even as she switches out some elements and introduces others; she doesn’t drop a single plate. The script occasionally gets in her way, which sometimes happens in her work, notably whenever the movie tries to personalize the catastrophe with some human-interest exchanges. As the crisis escalates, characters reach out to one another and the secretary of defense (a strong Jared Harris) checks in with his daughter (Kaitlyn Dever) in an awkward, unpersuasive scene. Far more effective are those instances when the camera holds on characters in moments of clenched silence.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/movies/house-of-dynamite-review-kathryn-bigelow.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Manohla Dargis,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/09CUL-HOUSE-OF-DYNAMITE-Pix1-tmhq/09CUL-HOUSE-OF-DYNAMITE-Pix1-tmhq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T15:15:56+00:00,3fbcb54bac9a4b169515d0d45a84e3c5a2862fd8
7b08ebae0c6b,"‘After the Hunt’ Review: Uncomfortable, for the Wrong Reasons","movies, julia roberts, ayo edebiri, luca guadagnino, andrew garfield, after the hunt","Now the die is cast, and Alma is caught in the middle, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Maggie is Black and gay and her parents are wealthy donors to the school. Hank, meanwhile, sees this as a class issue: He’s a self-made scholar who’s fought his way to the top of his profession, only to be taken down by a plagiarizing student who’s had her future handed to her on the shiniest of platters. Race, class, gender, sexuality: Which will win out? Whom should Alma back? And what if her own history gets in the way? This is all dressed up in the usual milieu of the campus tale, with contemporary twists already tried out by shows like “The Chair” and “Dear White People,” and movies like “Master” and “Sorry, Baby.” Campus stories offer their own delectable fantasy of wood-paneled walls and sexually-charged power differentials and success based on how well you play the game to achieve the desired outcome: a degree, a grade, tenure. By the looks of things, Alma and Frederik have played very, very well. They live in the sort of rambling and well-appointed apartment that people imagine professors at Yale get to live in — oh, did I mention, this is Yale? “After the Hunt” is the most Yale, a movie so Yale-y that the first words onscreen are “it happened at Yale,” though the “it,” as it turns out, is nothing to boast about. Alma and Hank are both popular with their students and both obviously into one another. Frederik, also a psychotherapist, behaves like a wife guy — making cassoulet, keeping house, patient as the day is long — but has everyone’s number: He knows both Maggie and Hank adore Alma, and it is why she keeps them so close to her. Frederik’s level of perception is matched by the cluelessness of the movie he is in, which seems bent on driving any academics watching it straight to the local dive bar afterward. How can an assistant professor at Yale and a moderately successful psychotherapist afford this apartment? Why does Yale apparently lack a Title IX office? And even if we take the movie at its insistence that Alma is a brilliant scholar and beloved teacher — there’s very little evidence of this, but OK, fine — how on earth did she land this incredibly competitive job after years away from the profession? Furthermore, why did Alma take time away, and are we supposed to be asking that question? There are other, nerdier questions only a recovering academic might ask — why does Maggie, a doctoral student in philosophy who has advanced to the dissertation stage, not possess rudimentary reading knowledge of German? — but I can’t reveal most of them without spoiling certain plot points. If you’re confused, it’s not just you. This is all very disappointing, given the talent behind “After the Hunt.” Guadagnino is prolific and often divisive, but always interesting; more frequently than not I admire what he’s doing, even when I don’t love it. This role lets Roberts play a beautiful, prickly, enigmatic woman who becomes more unpleasant as the movie goes on, which, somehow, makes her much more likable — tight perfection bursting apart at the seams. It’s a depth of performance I loved to watch, and I hope we see more of, matched well with the stellar Garfield’s spot-on interpretation of the kind of professor who knows exactly what place he occupies in the minds of his students and his peers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/movies/after-the-hunt-review.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Alissa Wilkinson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/09cul-afterthehunt-review1-kgfz/09cul-afterthehunt-review1-kgfz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T13:24:45+00:00,0ab6d2ead16e61c775958e4c9cf87aa13930966c
5a17c8a8e3d1,‘Tron: Ares’ Review: Who Needs Logic When You Have Neon?,"movies, jared leto, jeff bridges, greta lee, nine inch nails music group, joachim ronning, tron: ares","But whatever — bringing logic to a Tron fight is like hauling a set of teaspoons to a shooting range. The story takes off from there, and it’s kind of about artificial intelligence which means, in the end, it becomes about what makes us human. Most movies about A.I. eventually explore this question, which I suppose might be evidence of human narcissism; the answer is usually something like “love” or “mortality” or “fallibility” or “creativity,” all quite nice thoughts to ponder. The movie retains the techno-industrialist-futurist aesthetic of the series, with music by Nine Inch Nails (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are among the film’s executive producers) and sleek neon-rimmed action set almost entirely at night, but with some genuinely delightful nods to the early 1980s milieu of the original. While Leto continues to register undetectable levels of charisma, Peters manifests an excellently calibrated energy of pure evil mixed with callow petulance. So ranked against other “Tron” feature-length installments, while this one fails to capture the adolescent low-fi charm of the 1982 film, it’s appreciably more enjoyable (and, frankly, comprehensible) than “Legacy.” Taken together over the past four decades, the “Tron” movies present an interesting case study in how Hollywood — and, by extension, the average moviegoer — imagines A.I. In some respects, that line from the first film gets it best: A proliferation of thinking machines would result in a lot of people relinquishing the exercise of their critical faculties without much of a fight. But the rest of the film wasn’t really about that, and the following two films aren’t interested in it either. Instead, like many a movie about A.I. (1982 was also the year of Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner,” which set the sci-fi aesthetic template), they conceive of the programs as beings that follow orders, and their main danger as lying in their potential use as killing machines. No doubt this could be, and already has been, a horrifying application of machine learning. But oddly, we haven’t really seen a cinematic attempt to represent the kind of A.I. most of us are familiar with: large language models like ChatGPT, which don’t think at all, cannot read and do not comprehend. What it knows to do is cater to us. And while people have died after using it , it hasn’t been because A.I. is violent; it’s because it was designed to be servile. In the immediate present, in the most mundane everyday applications, artificial intelligence tools’ greatest danger lies in how it tempts us to skip the act of thinking. Once in a while entertainment has gotten near hitting on these ideas: Spike Jonze’s movie “Her” (though it failed to understand the ways corporations would fence in and manipulate their A.I. products), or certain episodes of “Black Mirror.” But if what we see at the movies and on TV tells us what to be afraid of, and what to think about the world around us, then we’re never really going to know what to think about living alongside A.I. Most of the time, it still looks like a blue-eyed super-soldier getting beamed out of a digital realm, in some tech bro’s badly lit lair.

fc82a4638a0c,"‘Roofman’ Review: Robbing McDonald’s, Stealing Hearts","movies, channing tatum, kirsten dunst, peter dinklage, ben mendelsohn, uzo aduba, derek cianfrance, roofman","In Derek Cianfrance’s “Roofman,” an agreeable dramatization of a true story, a springy Channing Tatum plays a McDonald’s spree-robber who escapes from prison and takes shelter in a Toys ‘R’ Us. Pitching camp in a cupboard behind a bike rack, the fugitive becomes a kid in a candy shop. Napping through the store’s hours of operation, he emerges after closing to coast the deserted aisles, munch on peanut M&Ms and jokingly hump an inflatable T-Rex. It’s all gloating, fun and games until he develops an interest in Leigh (Kirsten Dunst, with a Southern drawl), a smiley Toys ‘R’ Us employee who volunteers at a local church. Their budding flirtation puts our protagonist at a crossroads. Should he pursue the romance, or wait out the manhunt in sequestered safety? For a story based on a series of silly true crimes, the decision to center the movie on a rather pedestrian (and liberally fictionalized) relationship with a toy saleswoman seems odd. Why not devote the story to the thefts? This structural choice leaves “Roofman,” an overlong comedy, banking on Tatum’s ability to imbue Jeffrey Manchester — a smart dumb guy, as he’s called more than once — with a charisma rascally enough to hold our attention through crimes, misdemeanors and romantic comedy. Thankfully, Tatum proves up to the task. The movie opens before Jeffrey goes to prison, in an overture introducing his frustration with the status quo. An Army veteran and chronic underperformer who shares custody of his kids with his ex, Jeffrey is eager to change his fortunes, and figures that an influx of wealth will win his family back. Turns out, he’s right: Two years, 45 McDonald’s thefts and a smug voice-over later, Jeffrey is reunited with his family in a comfortably sized abode. But the jubilation has barely set in when he’s tackled by police and given a decades-long sentence — a zippy chain of events that culminates in Jeffrey’s ingenious prison break by means of a delivery van’s undercarriage. Amid an unfocused movie, the escape, which Cianfrance stages as a mini procedural, is a wonderfully engaging section that breezes by a bit too quickly. Its rush makes space for the tiresome second and third acts, in which the movie tracks Jeffrey’s slow burn with Leigh over a series of bits and gags. In one, he flirts with churchgoers by complimenting their footwear; later, he impresses Leigh’s daughters with a joyride. Ben Mendelsohn and Uzo Aduba, as the church pastor and his wife, and Peter Dinklage, playing a crotchety Toys ‘R’ Us manager, add a touch of zest to this mushy middle. “Roofman” raises the stakes of the central courtship by mixing in Leigh’s two daughters (Kennedy Moyer and Lily Collias), onto whom Jeffrey transfers his abiding affection for his biological children, whom he knows he can’t visit. As he ingratiates himself to the three, plying the girls with gifts and performing the role of family man, the movie takes on a tangy complexity, like a version of “The Tinder Swindler” as told by the villain. Jeffrey’s pandering to the daughters helps to prime viewers for his inevitable comeuppance; messing with adults is one thing, deceiving minors is another. So is Jeffrey a good guy or a bad one? At first, “Roofman” makes a compelling case for the former, establishing his politeness as it revels in his antics. But the movie’s success hangs on its power to gradually change our minds about Jeffrey, to position those who turn him in as heroes, and his wrongdoings as deserving of justice. Here is a protagonist who clearly straddles the line between right and wrong; the trouble is that in “Roofman,” that line wobbles, leaving the movie somewhere between a fun-loving caper and a finger-wagging morality tale.

See new episodes in the series on Fridays. You can also watch our collection of more than 150 videos on YouTube and subscribe to our YouTube channel . For the first time in the “Tron” movie franchise, the signature light cycles make their way from a computer grid into the real world. That results in a neon-tinged high-speed chase, light wall streams that split a police car in half and even some intense circular running through a parking garage. In this sequence, Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters), who runs the tech company Dillinger Systems, has created artificial intelligence programs that can be laser printed and operate outside of the grid. But they are only able to function for 29 minutes in the real world before disintegrating. That can all change with access to the permanence code, which allows A.I. creations to exist in real-world space indefinitely. But Julian has learned that Eve Kim (Greta Lee), the chief executive of a competitive tech company, has found the code. He dispatches his programs Ares (Jared Leto) and Athena (Jodie Turner-Smith) to chase down Eve to retrieve it. Narrating the scene, the director Joachim Ronning said, “I put so much pressure on myself and everybody to get this right, because it’s such an iconic part of the ‘Tron’ universe.” That involved spending a year coming up with the sequence, working with the production designer Darren Gilford on many of the elements.

The film tells the story of how the inmates come to understand and respect each other, and follows a previous film adaptation: the 1985 drama with Raul Julia and William Hurt, who won the best actor Oscar for his Molina. Dressed in a black button-down and a gray blazer, Tonatiuh — his friends call him Tona — displayed a blinding white smile and an easy laugh. But when the conversation turned to more serious topics, he transitioned seamlessly. He executes the same chameleonic shift in the film, where his performance is earning him Oscar talk. Elisabeth Vincentelli, reviewing for The New York Times, called him “revelatory.” The role requires a full-bodied, rich voice — Molina buoys Valentín’s spirits by recounting his favorite films, starring a diva played by Jennifer Lopez — as well as a feminine softness and warmth that contrasts with Valentín’s masculine strength. In his audition tape, Tonatiuh, who is nonbinary and uses they/them and he/him pronouns, wasn’t initially sure which aspect of the character to showcase. “I was so dissatisfied with my first take at it that I kept working at it and working at it for hours,” said Tonatiuh, who grew up in the Los Angeles suburb of West Covina, the middle of three sons born to immigrant parents from Mexico. “And finally I sent in two different versions of the same song, ‘ She’s a Woman, ’ one that was more performative and one that was more naturalistic, because I just didn’t know what was the case. “And I didn’t realize it at the time,” he continued, “but in doing that, I actually unlocked one of the hardest hurdles for a performer in an audition, because Bill needed both those worlds to exist within the film.” In a recent interview, Tonatiuh, who will be appearing in Ryan Murphy’s “American Love Story” series for FX and is working to secure the rights to what he hopes will be his Broadway debut, discussed losing 45 pounds for the role, the do-over necessary for his first meeting with Luna and what he hopes people take away from the film. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Your name is being mentioned in the best actor race alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Dwayne Johnson. What has the acclaim been like for you? It felt like I was waiting my entire life for an opportunity like this, to play a three-dimensional character. As we’ve been sharing the film at festivals, the impact it has on people has surprised me. Individuals in the audience sometimes don’t even ask a question, they just share their experience. They talk about the fear, the uncertainty of what’s happening. Some people share that they are walking around with their passports as a precaution. And then people share their coming-out stories. They share their excitement to see a genderqueer character as a protagonist, not marked as a terror. Those are the things that have touched my heart. Where did you start? I had just come off “ Carry-On ,” which is an action film I did with Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman [for Netflix ]. I gained a lot of mass to fulfill the requirements of the role. But when I was looking at Kendall [a closeted magazine assistant also played by Tonatiuh in the film-within-a-film in “Spider Woman”], and Molina, I wanted to tell a story that encompassed the gender spectrum. Kendall is a very traditionally classic Hollywood masculine man. And, without giving too many spoilers, there was an opportunity to find and express femininity. I wanted Molina to live somewhere in the middle of this genderless expression so that people would be less focused on their physical form and more focused on who they are. But I was like, “Oh, man, to accomplish that, I have to lose all the muscle that I’ve gained.” I was 190 pounds, and Molina is in a prison in Argentina. So I ended up losing 45 pounds in about 50 days. How did you do that? I did it the old-fashioned way. I just stopped eating. I started with a 10-day fast as I was getting ready to do our boot camp with some of the best Broadway dancers. And while I was doing the training and learning the choreography, in order to not faint, I switched over to a vegan diet. Then we had a week-and-a-half-long period where we traveled to Uruguay to shoot the prison. And in that period, it was another 10-day fast to get down to 143 pounds, and that’s where you get the snatched little look. Although I did cheat toward the end — it was so difficult to maintain. What was your first meeting with Diego Luna like? It was via Zoom. Bill wanted to hear the two of us just talk. And, embarrassingly, I wanted this job so bad that I had a whole setup. I had lights and two cameras. I was a bit thicker at the time, so I contoured my face. I was trying to show that I could transform and do the job, but I was so wrapped up in the technique of it. Then Diego just stopped. He was like: “Get rid of this second camera. Unplug it. Just look here. I know it’s hard because of the technology, but I really just want to talk to you.” So we did. We just had a conversation, and we laughed. He’s hilarious. Tell me about your coming-out journey. You’ve said you were bullied growing up , but I also saw you recently posted a video on Instagram of your grandmother holding up your Out magazine cover with Jennifer Lopez. I grew up in a barbershop with my mom and my aunt. So I love to talk, and I socialize through storytelling. I was very sweet. And it’s really sad that in certain communities of color, those qualities are marked as feminine, and femininity plus a male gender or a physical form didn’t mesh. I remember desperately asking my mom, “Why does everybody hate me?” I learned to code switch so quick, and I got good at it. I learned how to change my voice, change my accent, change my diction to fit in. But I don’t understand the obsession with putting people in boxes. It’s so boring. In my early 20s, I really wanted to be genderqueer and express hyper-femininity. As I got older, that became exhausting. So then I went the other way and found my more masculine side, and, weirdly, got rewarded for it with projects like “ Promised Land ” and “Carry-On.” But now I’m in this new phase in my life where it’s like, all of that is so inconsequential. If I get invited to a certain party, I’ll dress how I want to dress. If a certain song comes on, I’ll dance how I want to dance. Why are we robbing ourselves of those pleasures? Who are we performing this for? At what point did you drop your last name, Elizarraraz, and become just Tonatiuh? I mulled it over for a long time — my last name is very long. I knew that I didn’t want to change my first name, because I love having an Indigenous name. The mythology behind the name Tonatiuh, which means sun god, is super beautiful. I knew that it would be an uphill battle to brand a non-Anglicized name. But if you can learn how to say Tchaikovsky, then Tonatiuh’s not that hard. William Hurt won an Oscar for playing Molina, but he was not queer. What is the power of being a queer actor cast in this role? There was so much of my own lived experience that I was able to bring to the role. John Kander [the composer of the 1993 Broadway musical] told me that he felt Molina saw himself as a loser in his own life but refused to let anybody else see that. And it wasn’t until he fell in love that he was able to become a protagonist in his own story and discover how powerful he really was. What do you hope people take away from the film? I just hope they feel less alone. It makes me really happy to remind people of the dignity and the beauty and the honor of being queer, of being Latino. By the end of it, a lot of people end up feeling very vulnerable. And I’m like, “Yeah, that vulnerability is the price you pay for connection.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/movies/tonatiuh-kiss-of-the-spiderwoman.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Sarah Bahr,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/spiderwoman-actor-promo-fphv/spiderwoman-actor-promo-fphv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:00:48.398000+00:00,a9f9d4a9a077b636245451947a91faac975238eb
3d09fbb9e8d2,‘John Candy: I Like Me’ and the Challenge of Making a Film About a Nice Guy,"documentaries, john candy: i like me, john candy, colin hanks","It’s not easy to make a documentary about a celebrity everyone seems to have loved. “I wish I had some more bad things to say about him,” Bill Murray deadpans in the opening moments of “John Candy: I Like Me.” With a mock-thoughtful look, he continues, “I hope what you’re producing here turns up some people who have some dirt on him.” It doesn’t. The worst anyone says in the new documentary about Candy, who died in 1994, is that sometimes when he was having an attack of anxiety, he could get a little testy, and he probably should have started listening to the doctor sooner. “John Candy: I Like Me” (directed by Colin Hanks and streaming on Amazon Prime ) is a biographical tribute to this Canadian actor and comedian who rose to fame in the comedy sketch series “SCTV” and movies like “Home Alone,” “Spaceballs” and “Planes, Trains and Automobiles,” which gave the documentary its title. The film covers each milestone in his life, using archival footage and interviews with everyone who loved him: family — like Candy’s widow and children — as well as childhood friends and a huge circle of collaborators, including Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Tom Hanks (the director’s father), Steve Martin, Catherine O’Hara, Conan O’Brien, Andrea Martin, Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Macaulay Culkin and many more. In formal terms, it’s a standard-issue celebrity documentary. Clocking in at nearly two hours, it struggles to maintain momentum, since the main narrative thread is a chronological recounting of Candy’s film projects; there’s not much of an arc other than “this happened next.” There’s some discussion of how childhood trauma probably shaped his personality and his acute anxiety — Candy’s father died at 35, on Candy’s fifth birthday, and his family apparently never really discussed it. Several times, Candy’s sensitivity about his physical size and interviewers’ cringeworthy questions about it come up, underlining darker currents that ran beneath his sunny disposition. But for the most part, this is a movie about a man who was talented, funny and famous, and also generous, beloved and loving, and who believed you could be all of those things at the same time without internal conflict. That’s pretty rare, especially in comedy, and it might be reason enough to watch it, especially if you’re a fan. There’s one other reason. The documentary zone has been flooded with films like this in the last few years, most of which follow roughly the same template. When they’re about a living celebrity, they almost always come off as a glorified puff piece or long-form commercial for a tour or record or project; when the subject has passed away, they usually feel like gentle hagiography. But watching “John Candy: I Like Me,” I was reminded about one other good reason for films like this to be made: They’re a good excuse to dig up and compile archival footage into a narrative — some of which is unlikely to be seen by the public otherwise, or at least not all in one place — and preserve it in a new format. For fans, for the curious and for future watchers, too, that’s a worthy cause.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/movies/john-candy-i-like-me-film-about-nice-guy.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Alissa Wilkinson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10cul-doc-col-zkhp/10cul-doc-col-zkhp-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-10T09:01:09+00:00,17b854e1c304d0964f5419bac6b9d2cc78d2f041
c6a2a7d8151d,Diane Keaton in ‘Reds’: A Remarkable Performance but Also a Returning Point,"diane keaton, reds, warren beatty","By the time Diane Keaton co-starred in Warren Beatty’s 1981 historical epic, “Reds,” she already had racked up an enviable set of credits, including roles in two “Godfather” movies and a fruitful collaboration with Woody Allen that included the 1978 Academy Award for her performance in “Annie Hall.” In New Hollywood’s pantheon of stars, she personified a type: an intelligent, independent and unconventional woman, often portrayed in a relationship with a man but never quite possessed by him. Keaton, whose death at 79 was reported on Saturday , was an aspirational maverick, and her iconic fashion sense reflected that; no matter what music she was hearing, the drumbeat was her own. You wanted to be her. “Reds” came at a career inflection point for Keaton. Her previous film, the 1979 comedy “Manhattan,” would be the last with Allen for a long while, and in 1978 she had become romantically involved with Beatty. He directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in “Reds,” which follows the life and career of the radical journalist and activist John (Jack) Reed from about 1915 to 1920. Keaton plays Louise Bryant, a writer who left her marriage and life in Portland, Ore., to join Reed in Greenwich Village. Through their tumultuous relationship, the pair reported on revolutions and wars and were involved in socialist and Communist politics. It’s a long, thrilling, romantic film about idealism and disappointment and love and war, and it also stars Jack Nicholson as the playwright Eugene O’Neill, with whom Bryant had an affair, as well as Maureen Stapleton as the anarchist writer and activist Emma Goldman. You could say that Bryant was in keeping with the Diane Keaton “type,” and you wouldn’t be wrong. A lot of Bryant and Reed’s tumult comes from trying to navigate the shape their relationship will really take. On the one hand, they’re radicals who believe, at least in the abstract, in ideals like free love, equality and nonconformity. When Bryant arrives in Greenwich Village, she’s ready to be a “real” writer, and has little interest in acting like “a wife” ever again. Conventional American life is not for her. But it’s also the 1910s, and Bryant, fresh out of Portland, is not quite ready for what that means. After cursory questioning — “What is it you do?” they keep asking her, and she seems unprepared to answer beyond “I write” — Reed’s circle dismisses Bryant as a lightweight, just another one of “Jack’s women.” This is where you can start to see what Keaton’s doing with the role. “Reds” is a long movie in which Bryant goes through serious transformation. Of all the characters, her evolution is the most striking, and Keaton’s performance has to tiptoe along a thin edge. Bryant is vulnerable because she is a woman in a world of men who say they believe in equality but are still conditioned to discount most women, especially any who present themselves with femininity — and Bryant’s style, though culturally unconventional for the time, is still feminine, with soft hair and ethereal beauty. Set next to Goldman, who is brusque and forceful, she is easier to sweep aside; she knows it, and it frustrates her. Bryant is also vulnerable because she is in love with Reed, and even when she is angry with him, she is tied to him, and he to her. But that is not always something she’s happy about. In one scene just before intermission — that’s how long it is! — she watches him address a crowd, and you can see in Keaton’s face flickers of every emotion: pride, love, jealousy, resignation, frustration and a bit of awe. She is aware that she is second fiddle to her charismatic and mesmerizing partner (he is, after all, played by Beatty). She might want to be the great writer she believes herself capable of being. But she also knows, if push comes to shove, she’s going to set herself aside for this man, not the other way around. Yet she does become more independent and takes control of her own career, while also growing more weary and saddened, holding in all of that tension. “Reds” is a story of idealism that is met with the full force of historical realism, and while ostensibly Reed is the main character, it’s really Bryant who has to live out the full story: She encounters Reed’s beliefs, lives alongside them, lets them change her and then has to live with the consequences after the heroics have run their course. That’s why her dramatic performance is so remarkable in the movie, and probably why so often Beatty lets the camera follow her, not Reed, through the most dramatic scenes. In one of the most stirring sequences, Bryant is looking for Reed on a train that’s pulled into a station. She does not look like any Keaton we know. She looks exhausted, her eyes enormous and skin pale, her hair unruly and gathered into a kerchief. She walks to the train and simply watches as men get off, one by one. Not one of them is Reed. Her face barely changes expression, somewhere between fear and a tiny hint of hope, a tiny shake of her head whenever a man who might have been Reed turns out to be someone else. She spots a body being carried away on a stretcher, covered in a red blanket and seems almost certain that it must be him. But as she turns to watch the body, she spots Reed in the distance and he sees her. The expression on her face barely changes as she starts to walk toward him, and it is only when her face is buried in his shoulder, and his in hers, that any tears can slip out. As the emotional core of the movie, Keaton’s performance in “Reds” is the bridge for the audience: We might not all be Reed, the charismatic idealist giving speeches, but we might be Bryant, just trying to catch hold as history barrels past and discovering who we are inside of it. She becomes strong, but that also means some thick calluses, and Keaton gives us a woman who has to build up all that armor herself.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/movies/diane-keaton-reds.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Alissa Wilkinson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12cul-keaton-reds-promo-gvjz/12cul-keaton-reds-promo-gvjz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T17:49:05.091000+00:00,3284cd650df649ac1f677a3014a341dc5c5900d7
87dcbb5e7d5b,The Surprising Power of Diane Keaton’s Emotional Transparency,"movies, actor, diane keaton, annie hall, looking for mr. goodbar, something's gotta give, the godfather, women and girls","Meyers tips her hand early the moment you hear Nicholson’s Harry enthusing about the women he dates. “Ah,” he says, “ the sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction of the younger woman, ” as various long-limbed beauties stride across the movie’s bouncy opening credits. Harry is a total horndog, but after assorted comic complications, Erica brings him to heel. First, though, Harry has to nearly die (heart attack) because sometimes that’s what it takes for an older man to notice a woman who’s more in his age bracket. He recuperates at Erica’s house, where they circle each other warily before falling into bed. Things remain complicated and Harry breaks her heart, which she repairs with help from a besotted doctor played by Keanu Reeves. By the time “Something’s Gotta Give” was released, Keaton had played a range of roles, not all of which asked much of her. It’s vital to understanding her career to remember that the same year that “Annie Hall” was released, she had also starred in “Looking for Mr. Goodbar,” in which she played a teacher from an oppressive religious family who’s murdered by a one-night stand; it’s a bleak take on what women risk in an ostensibly sexually liberated world. The critic Molly Haskell rightly praised Keaton, noting her “instinctual delicacy.” Keaton’s ability to show you a character’s vulnerability was as striking as her gift for showing you what can lie beneath such sensitivity, including neediness at its rawest and most acutely exposed. Keaton continued to take on serious roles, both worthy (the 1982 marriage drama “Shoot the Moon”) and not (the 1984 spy intrigue “The Little Drummer Girl”). She made more comedies, too, including “Baby Boom” (1987), which Meyers wrote with her soon-to-be ex, Charles Shyer, who also directed. By the time Meyers and Keaton joined forces for “Something’s Gotta Give,” they were both veterans of an industry that, like Nicholson’s character, was grossly dismissive of women, though particularly older ones. If it took me a while to come around to “Something’s Gotta Give,” it was largely because it seemed too obvious and silly, and too removed from the real world and its problems. And yet, and yet … I kept returning to that film again and again, occasionally just catching it on TV and then happily seeking it out. After watching it more times than I remember, I copped to the fact that I had fallen as hard for it as Keaton and Nicholson’s characters do for each other. Some of my adoration comes just from the pleasure of watching skilled, well-synced performers pretending to fall in love. Years later, I also realized that what else I loved was Keaton, who by the time she made this movie had successfully transcended a male filmmaker’s la-di-da ideal to become a female filmmaker’s avatar: a beautiful, funny, soulful, successful and blissfully independent woman with lines on her face, a penchant for turtlenecks, a blissed-out Reeves as a consolation prize and a besotted Nicholson, ta-da, finally and gratefully at her side.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/movies/diane-keaton-the-godfather.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Manohla Dargis,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/12cul-keaton-dargis-1-kthb/12cul-keaton-dargis-1-kthb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T17:00:07+00:00,f81db3fb8775f946ce7709b7a537de24f2de26ae

News of her death rippled across Hollywood on Saturday, with tributes flooding social media. Colleagues said they admired her work in a variety of dramatic roles and romantic comedies and for the way she related to other people. Bette Midler, who was a co-star with Keaton in the movie “The First Wives Club,” praised her on Instagram as “brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary.” Midler said she was “hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star.” Kimberly Williams-Paisley, an actress who played the daughter of Keaton’s character in “Father of the Bride,” said that working with her “will always be one of the highlights of my life,” and posted a picture of them in a scene from the movie. In a social media post , Marc Shaiman, a composer for film, television and theater, called her a “true original” and an “irreplaceable light.” The movie director Paul Feig, known for the films “Bridesmaids” in 2011 and “Ghostbusters” in 2016 said on social media that Keaton was “an amazingly kind and creative person who also just happened to be a Hollywood legend.” Ben Stiller , the actor and comedian, called Keaton an “icon of style, humor and comedy.” Elizabeth Tulloch, an actress, shared her gratitude for Keaton’s love for animals on what was Keaton’s last Instagram post , a picture of her with her dog Reggie. Keaton was a vocal animal rights lobbyist and endorsed the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would ban the private ownership of big cats. “Thank you for your talent, your animal advocacy, your immeasurable charm,” Tulloch wrote. Piers Morgan, the British television personality who has a reputation for being hard to impress, called her one of “Hollywood’s greatest actresses.” In a group for film enthusiasts on Facebook , Keaton’s fans remembered her legacy and discussed what they thought were her best performances in a career that spanned decades. Among those mentioned were her depiction of Louise Bryant, a feminist writer and activist, in the 1981 movie “Reds”; and the 2003 movie “Something’s Gotta Give,” in which she played Erica Barry, a successful Broadway playwright. “She brought such depth & vulnerability to every role she played,” wrote one fan in a Facebook comment thread. “So glad that I have a lot of her films on DVD.

Ms. Keaton’s character, for instance, learns that the therapist she has come to trust is actually having an affair with her estranged husband. It was a major box-office hit. Her final film was “Summer Camp” (2024), a comedy about three old friends at an eventful reunion. Ms. Keaton’s personal life could at times be fodder for the gossip pages as they tracked her romantic relationships, including with Mr. Beatty and Mr. Allen in addition to Mr. Pacino. She never married and adopted two children , a son, Duke Keaton, and a daughter, Dexter Keaton. Complete information on her survivors was not immediately available. “Getting older hasn’t made me wiser,” she told People magazine, with a typically self-critical eye, in 2019, insisting cheerfully, “I don’t know anything, and I haven’t learned.” Over the years, though, she wrote a dozen or so books — volumes on fashion, art and architecture as well as memoirs. Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 2014, Sheila Weller called Ms. Keaton’s memoir “Then Again” “provocatively honest” and Ms. Keaton “bitingly wry, ironic and tough about herself.” “Then Again” offered Ms. Keaton an opportunity to observe, “I learned I couldn’t shed light on love other than to feel its comings and goings and be grateful.” It also gave her a chance to challenge an adage or two. “If beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” she wrote, “does that mean mirrors are a waste of time?” Nicole Sperling contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/movies/diane-keaton-dead.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Anita Gates,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11Diane-Keaton-obit/11Diane-Keaton-obit--facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T20:25:45+00:00,b59184dd34e90092acbc323c5ce0616b29b039bb
4c1f0a2e0052,"Renato Casaro, ‘Michelangelo of Movie Posters,’ Dies at 89","renato casaro, poster, movies, obituary, art","Renato Casaro, an artist who was called “the Michelangelo of movie posters” and whose work extended from the spaghetti western era of the 1960s through Hollywood blockbusters like the “Rambo” series and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” died on Sept. 30 at a hospital in Treviso, Italy. He was 89. His daughter, Silvia Casaro, confirmed the death. During a career that lasted more than a half a century, Mr. Casaro produced some 2,000 posters, drawing praise from Hollywood heavyweights like Quentin Tarantino and Sylvester Stallone. Yet despite his clout within the industry, few moviegoers knew his name. His work was largely unheralded, aside from a tiny “Casaro” printed in the margins. In a 2021 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Casaro said he believed that the only director who put him in the end credits was Sergio Leone, for the poster promoting the star-studded 1984 mob epic “Once Upon a Time in America.” Mr. Casaro had made his name in the 1960s with Mr. Leone’s Italian productions of classic American spurs-and-six-guns movies, including three that made Clint Eastwood a star: “A Fistful of Dollars” (1964), “For a Few Dollars More” (1965) and “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly” (1966). “Of all the directors I have worked with,” Mr. Casaro said in a 2022 interview with The Guardian, “Sergio Leone was the best collaborator. We were the perfect couple: one heart, one soul.” Mr. Casaro also created posters — sometimes alternates or for international releases — for John Huston (“The Bible: In the Beginning,” 1966), Francis Ford Coppola (“The Godfather Part III,” 1990), David Lynch ( “Dune,” 1984, and “Wild at Heart,” 1990) and Bernardo Bertolucci ( “The Last Emperor,” 1987, and “The Sheltering Sky,” 1990). In his view, a good movie poster was like bait on a fishhook. The challenge, he told The Times in 2021, was to “capture the essential: that moment, that glance, that attitude, that movement that says everything and condenses the entire story.” Before software and digital graphics came to define — and, some would say, ruin — the art of the poster, Mr. Casaro worked in traditional fashion, with brushes and tempera paint, giving his early pieces what he called an “impressionistic” look. He eventually turned to the airbrush, which gave his work a sharper realism but was also “more magical.” His superhuman rendering of Arnold Schwarzenegger in a horned helmet, sword aloft, for “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and his blood-and-guts rendition of Mr. Stallone, rippling with muscles, for the “Rambo” movies, made them look like gods worthy of Mount Olympus. “Schwarzenegger was the perfect man to paint,” Mr. Casaro told The Guardian in 2022. “He had a tough expression. His face was like a sculpture.” And Mr. Stallone, he said, “gave me the freedom to interpret all the images of Rambo I had as I wished. All I had to do was make him look like a hero.” A personal favorite of Mr. Casaro’s was his poster for “Nikita,” a 1990 action thriller from Luc Besson titled “La Femme Nikita” in the United States, about an assassin with supermodel looks and a supersized handgun. The poster “shows a woman with her back turned behind a bathroom door,” he said on the TV show “CBS Mornings” in 2023. “‘What just happened here?’ The viewer goes to see what this film is all about.” Renato Casaro was born on Oct. 26, 1935, in Treviso, where he got his start in the movie business as a teenager, drawing posters for the Garibaldi Theater in exchange for free admission to movies. In 1954, he moved to Rome, taking a job as a staff artist for a prominent advertising studio that specialized in movie posters. Three years later, he opened his own shop. “You learn on the job,” he told The Times in 2021. “You have to be able to draw everything, from a portrait to a horse to a lion.” His big break — creating the poster for Mr. Huston’s sweeping 1966 adaptation of Genesis, starring Richard Harris as Cain and the director as Noah — came through a longtime professional relationship with the Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis, known for big-budget spectacles. As The Guardian noted in 2022, the enormous billboard that loomed over Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles for months functioned as much as an advertisement for the up-and-coming poster artist as it did for the movie. Other notable posters included a bodice-ripper of an image for the steamy 1981 remake of “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” starring Jack Nicholson, Jessica Lange and a kitchen table; a retro, Hitchcockian collage for the 1981 Brian De Palma thriller “Blow Out,” starring John Travolta and Nancy Allen; and an action-packed illustration for “Octopussy” that made the rather forgettable 1983 Roger Moore installment of the James Bond series look like an epic on the order of “Lawrence of Arabia.” During the 1990s, work began to dry up, as the industry turned to Photoshop and other computer software, which made it “very easy to generate a spectacular image,” Mr. Casaro told “CBS Mornings,” “but with no soul.” Not for nothing did a 2021 retrospective of his work in Treviso bill him as “cinema’s last poster designer.” Mr. Casaro’s work was not forgotten, though, by Mr. Tarantino, one of Hollywood’s ultimate film geeks, who sought him out to produce vintage-style spaghetti western posters for the fictional movies starring Rick Dalton, Leonardo DiCaprio’s character in “Once Upon a Time in … Hollywood” (2019). (With his fame dwindling stateside, Dalton defibrillates his career by moving to Italy to star in shoot-’em-ups like “Kill Me Now Ringo, Said the Gringo.”) After production, Mr. Tarantino sent Mr. Casaro a signed photo of Mr. DiCaprio posing for one of the posters, with a note reading: “Thanks so much for your art gracing my picture. You’ve always been my favorite.” A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/movies/renato-casaro-dead.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Alex Williams,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09Casaro--01-gczp/09Casaro--01-gczp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:18:30+00:00,4ec088df8f0a7b44a03039c17823b26a12a479fe
a8782f7f9ada,Five Horror Movies to Stream Now,"movies, bring her back","‘V/H/S/Halloween’ Stream it on Shudder. In recent years, the “V/H/S” found-footage anthologies have offered diminishing returns, mostly because of bloated run times and seen-it-before scripts — a far cry from the knockout first “V/H/S” film in 2012 . So consider me as tickled as a kid on Halloween night when I say that the latest collection is (mostly) a big fat treat. Things kick off spectacularly with “Diet Phantasma,” an unsparingly gruesome comedy from the writer-director Bryan M. Ferguson. Set in 1982, it’s about a group of unassuming test subjects who enlist in taste tests for a new canned soft drink masterminded by an evil corporation. I’ll leave it there, other than to say that a few sips of Tab never made my face melt off. Another standout is the disturbing but nutty “Coochie Coochie Coo.” Written and directed by Anna Zlokovic like a bat out of hell, it’s about two young friends who enter a suburban house looking for Halloween candy, only to discover that they’ve been lured there to be part of a demonic baby shower for a sicko man-baby and his “family.” I also got a kick out of the guy who pukes up eyeballs in the bombastic “Ut Supra Sic Infra” (Latin for “As Above, So Below”), from Paco Plaza, one of the creators of the “REC” franchise. It’s about a police investigation into a deadly Halloween party that itself turns lethal, brutally. I was mostly a fan of “Talk to Me,” the 2023 hit supernatural thriller from Danny and Michael Philippou , the Australian twin brother YouTubers turned horror directors. It moved in overdrive and generously dished out stomach-disrupting gross-outs, but its nonsensical twists left me baffled. I like the brothers’ latest better. Sally Hawkins gives a commanding performance as Laura, a foster mother who takes in Andy (Billy Barratt) and his younger stepsister, Piper (Sora Wong) at her modest but creepy-around-the-edges home where Laura lives with Ollie (Jonah Wren Phillips, exceptional), Laura’s nonverbal, near-feral child. The Philippous direct at a thrilling, breakneck pace that narratively and emotionally almost never flags as Andy realizes his temporary mom is permanently nuts. The violence sears; there are at least two jump scares with gore so shocking, I may never be able to erase it from my memory. (Kids: Knives aren’t toothpicks and tables aren’t for snacking.) Danny Philippou and Bill Hinzman’s script has holes, but all is forgiven by the film’s heart-shattering finale. Amir (Freddy Singh) dreams of cutting his leg off, right near where this twisted film’s title describes. In a locked room at the home he shares with his kindly girlfriend, Kim (Julie Abrahamsen), Amir paints self-portraits that show him seated in a wheelchair sans part of his leg. His plight isn’t only the stuff of fiction: It’s rooted in a real-life condition in which people have an overwhelming desire to cut off a body part. Amir’s work and relationship start to suffer as he becomes obsessed with his rotting leg. (It’s not.) But then he strikes up a friendship with Rikke (Louise Waage Anda), a young woman who confesses in a television interview that she wants to be blind, and who agrees to help Amir with his desire to become disabled. It’s here that the director Viljar Boe starts to really twist his knife, layering juicy “Fatal Attraction” luridness over the sick and unsentimental body horror. Boe mined similar psycho-terror territory in “Good Boy” (2022), his bizarre dark comedy about a man who wants to be treated like a dog. “Above the Knee” is more focused and demented, with will-he-or-won’t-he do it moments to hard pluck your nerves. There’s nothing subtle about Jaume Collet-Serra’s supernatural fairy tale. Grief is literally a woman , ominously dressed in black mourning clothes and veil, sitting in a chair outside the rural home where Ramona (Danielle Deadwyler) is mourning the accidental death of her husband. Not only won’t this damn ghost leave when asked to, but she’s slowly inching toward the front door, freaking out Ramona, who’s hobbling around on a brace, and her kids (Peyton Jackson and Estella Kahiha). The film starts to lose steam when the woman in black stands up and spills the beans about why she’s there and what Ramona knows. But set the movie’s oblique elements aside, and what remains is a taut and affecting meditation on grief and the afterlife. Collet-Serra and the writer Sam Stefanak keep things grounded enough to feel real but unmoored enough to give you the willies. Deadwyler is equal parts tender and ferocious, protective and vulnerable. If you need a break from real-world terror, Vivieno Caldinelli’s horror comedy is your ticket to paradise. It’s got sickening, literal potty humor (the dangling testicles scene is just evil) and a flesh-hungry creature that looks like it was made from a thrift store opera glove and dentures — the kind of stuff that will tickle fans of puerile horror comedies like “Street Trash” and “Butt Boy.” Mark McKinney (one of the Kids in the Hall) stars as a mad scientist who fumbles his nefarious plan to unleash a hungry little monster into the world. When his giant Franken-worm inches its way inside the plumbing system of an apartment complex somewhere in suburban Canada, it’s up to Don (Steven Ogg), a plumber partial to lame dad jokes, and his germophobe son, Sonny (Daniel Doheny), to clear the pipes and save the world. I love how much Canadian pride courses through the film, down to the delightfully knuckle-headed use of Loverboy’s “Turn Me Loose.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/movies/horror-movies-streaming.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Erik Piepenburg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/arts/10streaming-horror-vhs1/10streaming-horror-vhs1-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T15:00:02.447000+00:00,d2dd858c8977c9fd43b456bf0b1a426eec3ea7f3

White and has the “Evil Dead” director Sam Raimi as one of its producers, so it is best for children and teenagers who fall asleep just fine after experiencing jump scares, ghouls and evil witches. It starts on a dark and stormy night with a bespectacled kid named Alex (Winslow Fegley) running away after angrily tearing his movie posters off the wall; he had overheard his parents saying that his obsession with horror is a little odd. Alex is lured into a spooky apartment in his building, where he meets a witch, Natacha (a truly creepy yet still fun Krysten Ritter). Natacha will only let him live if he tells her a scary story each night. She’s also holding another child prisoner, an older girl named Yasmin (Lidya Jewett), and the pair endure all manner of cruelty from Natacha until Alex finds a way to free them. “Nightbooks” does have a great message about embracing what makes you unique, even if the kids at school think it’s “weird.” The bond that develops between Alex and a world-weary Yasmin is sweet to watch, amid all the scares.

aae3dc64db1e,‘Tron: Ares’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"movies, joachim ronning, jodie turner-smith, greta lee, jared leto, tron: ares","Hi, I’m Joachim Ronning. I’m the director of “Tron: Ares.” So this is the scene where Julian Dillinger has discovered that Eve is in possession of the permanence code. So he’s sending his two top programs after her, Ares and Athena. And we get to see them on the light cycles. And Ares obviously being played by Jared Leto, Athena being played by Jodie Turner-Smith and Eve being played by Greta Lee. I put so much pressure on myself and everybody to get this right, this sequence, because it’s such an iconic part of the Tron universe, the light cycle chase, and light cycles. And we spent a year designing this. And here, the police car, obviously, this is the first time we’re going to see the famous Tron light wall in the real world. And boom. We shot this in Vancouver over six weeks of nights. And luckily, Vancouver is a very film friendly city, so we were able to close down the bridge and really, really do this. And then we finally found together with Darren Gilford, the production designer, and we found a look for the light cycles and together with the suits and I’m really happy with them. This is the Akira slide by the way, which is super important for me to get in there. And I remember reading the script three years ago and thinking like, how can we be worthy of a next Tron chapter. And I think I got to page 30 or something like that. And, and I saw the digital assets coming into the real world and the light cycles coming out and creating havoc on the streets. And I felt like as a fan, as a filmmaker, that’s something I really wanted to see. So here we are getting into the parkade, and this is like, I wanted to have a sequence in the middle of this big chase that we just stopped down and we brought it all down and it became more a psychological thriller sequence. “Come on.” With Eve hiding and wondering what the hell is going on here and being resourceful, she ghost rides her Ducati and takes down Athena. And Athena Boom. Falling through the air here. That’s a real stunt woman doing that. And obviously this is in March in Vancouver. So it’s like everybody’s really cold. And it’s not easy. And we did it over so many nights. And you get that 1,000 yard stare after a while. But I’m really happy we did it. I think the audience can feel that this is real. It’s in camera. We built the light cycles, and we’re coming up to this moment now where Eve is about to make a decision and get on one. So I think the big advantages of building these assets the light cycle, we built a couple of them. What that meant was that we were able to put the camera on the light cycles with the actors. Here’s Athena coming T-1000 style, running for her. And here we go. I think this is kind of like a wish fulfillment for a lot of fans, to be able to drive the light cycle in the real world. And it sure is for me. And it was so amazing to be able to do this. And I think when you make these big movies, you have the resources to get it. And here’s Greta Lee escaping Jodie Turner-Smith or Athena actually running behind her. And you get all these things in the same shot. And both Jodie and Greta did so much running on this movie. And obviously Jodie is in that suit.

99dbbe460cd1,‘The Woman in Cabin 10’ Review: When Things Go Splash in the Night,"movies, netflix, keira knightley, ruth ware, simon stone, the woman in cabin 10","When the journalist Laura Blacklock (Keira Knightley) is awakened by muffled noises on a super yacht, she runs to her veranda in time to glimpse a body sinking into the sea. Or does she? The thriller “The Woman in Cabin 10” — based on the novel by Ruth Ware and directed by Simon Stone — isn’t a simple whodunit. There’s a great deal afoot once Blacklock, a well-regarded but burned-out reporter, embarks on a feature about an invitation-only cruise to Norway. A junket on the Aurora Borealis would seem to be off Laura’s investigative beat — and counter to her ethics — but she has an angle. Richard (Guy Pearce), a loving husband and billionaire, has requested that a few deep-pocketed friends join him and his ailing wife, Anne (Lisa Loven Kongsli), on the voyage. Hannah Waddinghamplays Heidi, a gallerist, and there’s also an aging rocker, a flirty influencer, a physician and a photographer who happens to be Laura’s ex. At the journey’s end, they plan to make a splashy announcement about a new cancer research foundation. “It’s a human-interest piece for inhumane times,” Laura tells her skeptical editor (an underused Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The pitch doesn’t make it past the voyage’s first night. When Laura insists that someone plunged into the sea, the gathered treat her as if she’s experiencing some sort of post-traumatic breakdown. While she has been haunted by the death of a source, we’re confident she’s onto something. But that doesn’t mean viewers won’t be increasingly exasperated by the ways the screenplay forces Knightley’s character into a clumsy, fretful investigation. A body isn’t the only thing that goes overboard here. The Woman in Cabin 10 Rated R for some violence and language. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes.

33c5a24a36f8,What Would Elphaba Grow? The Botanical Garden Has Some Ideas.,"design, broadway theater, gardens and gardening, new york botanical garden, bronx, theater, wicked musical, wicked, movies","Visitors to the opening celebration for the Wicked Broadway Garden won’t be able to pluck any magical herbs to concoct a green potion and suddenly acquire the power to defy gravity. But they can take photographs among lush blossoms, hear spirited musical performances, play witchy trivia games and enjoy a slice of Oz in the Bronx. These will all be part of the festivities on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the New York Botanical Garden , which for three weeks is devoting some of its own emerald expanse to the Emerald City. Taking its cues from Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman’s hit musical , which has been adapted into a two-part movie starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, the Wicked Broadway Garden will bloom through Nov. 2 with plants in pink and green, the production’s signature colors. “Our team was inspired by the iconic moment when Glinda gives a pink flower to Elphaba,” said Michael Crowley, the botanical garden’s chief marketing officer, in an interview at the project’s site. “It’s the first real moment of connection between these two friends.” As we head into year 2 of press coverage for the much-hyped film adaptation, it’s unlikely that anyone reading this is unaware that “Wicked” is a revisionist prequel to “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.” Based on Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel , it features the green-skinned Elphaba as the actual heroine. When the flower is bestowed in the Broadway show, Elphaba, who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West, and the perky Glinda, who becomes the Good Witch, are schoolgirl roommates and former enemies. “The other thing that we’re inspired by is the story of empowerment in ‘Wicked,’” Crowley said. “It is very related to our science and horticulture work here in the Bronx. You know, Elphaba’s desire to make the world a better place is really aligned with our work to unlock the power of plants and fungi.” Over the summer, the botanical garden’s staff conceived the “Wicked” display, which will be in its outdoor Home Gardening Center. While the Broadway show fueled the project, it doesn’t hurt that Halloween is coming, Crowley added, or that the second part of the film adaptation, “ Wicked: For Good ,” will debut in theaters on Nov. 21. The finished garden, which will feature more than a dozen plant species in individual pots, is accompanied by over 25 varieties already growing in the soil. “We have the dark purple, almost black, elephant grass, which will kind of add some extra drama to the planting in the containers,” said Tess Kuracina, the botanical garden’s director of living collections. “And then we also have a beautiful ornamental grass called ruby grass, which started blooming a couple weeks ago, with really soft, fluffy pink flowers. And so that obviously will tie in really well to the color story, and also kind of the contrast between the characters of Elphaba and Glinda.” The varieties in pots include ornamental kale and cabbage, Bismarck palms and agave, which evokes “a spiky, kind of mystical plant,” said Brian Sullivan, the garden’s vice president for glasshouses and landscape. Some species will change over the run, he added, becoming deeper in color because of temperature changes, or, like some chrysanthemums, coming into full bloom later. Although this is not the Bronx garden’s first collaboration with the theater world — it devoted its entire Orchid Show to Broadway imagery in 2011 and, most recently, produced an Instagram post revolving around HwaBoon , the houseplant in “ Maybe Happy Ending ” — this is the first time it has featured a Broadway partnership in its Home Gardening Center. The project will offer information to help visitors (even those without Elphaba’s green thumbs) create their own “Wicked” garden. “These are pretty hardy, pretty standard gardening plants,” Sullivan said. Signs featuring flying monkeys will point the way to and from the garden area, which is about 4,000 square feet. Its focal point will be a 10-foot-tall pink-and-green “Wicked” wall, featuring silhouettes of Elphaba and Glinda, where fans can take photos. The graphic designs come from the Broadway production, whose staff eagerly became the garden’s partners, said Diana Salameh, the executive vice president at Serino Coyne , the show’s advertising and marketing agency. “Plants play a subtle but very powerful role in ‘Wicked,’” she said in a telephone interview, symbolizing “growth and transformation.” Salameh noted that the Broadway team had also worked with the New York Restoration Project in 2007, remaking a neglected neighborhood garden in Upper Manhattan into the Wicked Friendship Garden , which remains open to the public. For this Saturday, the show has enlisted alumnae of its second national tour — Natalia Vivino , a standby for Elphaba, and Hayley Podschun , who played Glinda — to sing “Wicked” numbers in the botanical garden’s conservatory plaza. The production is also supplying the trivia contests’ secret prizes. Fans at the celebration can have their faces painted and, while supplies last, take home a free memento: a pink carnation. The Wicked garden will offer new perspectives, Crowley observed. “It is not a quiet space where the lights go down for two hours,” he said. “This is a place where the sun is out, and it’s all about fostering connection between people and plants.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/arts/design/wicked-new-york-botanical-garden.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Laurel Graeber,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09wicked-garden-02-lvwh/09wicked-garden-02-lvwh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T16:42:52+00:00,b763c657bfdd70a985d889c2390d4388ddae5cec
d591cde64072,Why Arguments About Free Speech Don’t Apply to the Riyadh Comedy Festival,"comedy, freedom of speech, saudi arabia, aziz ansari, bill burr, louis c k, dave chappelle, tim dillon, jamal khashoggi, atsuko okatsuka","The Riyadh Comedy Festival is ending Thursday, after setting off a Taylor Swift level of discourse, and the American comics who performed there have been returning home and explaining why they participated. Bill Burr argued that playing for a festival paid for by the repressive Saudi government would improve freedom of speech. Louis C.K. said he had mixed feelings but wanted to be part of stand-up’s effort at “opening up” the Middle East. Aziz Ansari told Jimmy Kimmel he thought hard on it and decided performing would mean “pushing things to be more open.” Call me cynical but I bet money also had something to do with it. It was refreshing to hear Pete Davidson bluntly copping to taking the gig for the paycheck. Jessica Kirson was the only performer who apologized and donated her fee to charity. Ansari said he gave some of his to groups like Human Rights Watch, which released a statement saying it would not accept a donation from him. The organization had called on him and the other artists to demand that the Saudi government release detained activists, but as far as we know, Ansari and the other comics did not speak out. (None of the performances were televised.) The comedians’ best arguments are that no matter who is paying their fees, they are performing for the people, not the state, and that bringing American comedy to Saudi Arabia will lead the government to become less repressive. Kirson said she thought that “being the first openly gay comic to talk about it onstage in Saudi Arabia” would help LGBTQ+ Saudis and start a dialogue. There is merit to these points. Art can be a kind of soft power that spreads American values. And cultural boycotts are often futile. But when these comics talk about their work “opening up” the country, there’s a self-importance and lack of concrete detail that strikes me as willfully naïve. Louis C.K. got closest to spotting the elephant in the room when he praised David Cross for harshly criticizing comics who took part. “You shouldn’t just pretend it’s something it’s not,” C.K. said of the event. What is it exactly? More than any other artists, comedians are alert to how language reveals meaning, and what all the explanations have in common is a maddening vagueness. What does this specific festival represent? If the comics used their sets, or even their interviews back home, to look squarely at the critique of the Saudi government, that would be one thing. But I see zero evidence that they are defending (or even showing respect for) actual dissent. None of these comics mentioned the journalist Jamal Khashoggi , who was killed by Saudi operatives in 2018 after writing Washington Post columns critical of the Saudi government. Atsuko Okatsuka, who said she turned down the festival’s offer (along with other comics including Shane Gillis, Leslie Liao and Mike Birbiglia), posted part of the proposed contract , which forbid making fun of certain topics like the Saudi royal family, and noted: “The money is coming straight from the crown prince, who actively executes journalists.” On his podcast, Burr made a point of saying the royals “loved the show.” And why wouldn’t they? Dave Chappelle told members of his audience, “It’s easier to talk here than it is in America.” That talk-show hosts like Jimmy Kimmel were being pressured by the government in this country certainly helped Chappelle’s case. But even putting aside the vast differences in free speech between the two countries, the Kimmel episode undermines his argument. A cultural boycott here was forceful enough that his bosses changed course. Burr, Louis C.K. and Ansari are making a different case: They’re arguing for the impact of comedians and the power of jokes. But that’s precisely the opposite lesson to take away from the comedian Tim Dillon’s experience with the festival. When he criticized the Saudi government weeks before the event, he was disinvited. The comics who remained on the bill were paid not just to perform, but also to shut up about certain topics. And they complied. Imagine if similar conditions were put on comics in this country. What if a stand-up was told they couldn’t mock the president at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner? They wouldn’t perform. Or what if Andrew Schultz, who performed in Saudi Arabia, was told by an American producer that he couldn’t insult the government? He would surely exploit this by presenting himself as the victim of cancel culture. No word from him yet about being muffled by Saudi Arabia. It’s hard to see Chappelle signing a contract to perform at a university only if he agreed to state his pronouns at the start of the set. It’s fair to wonder if the Riyadh Comedy Festival will result in American values being exported or vice versa. But that doesn’t mean nothing good came from it. If the festival inspires American audiences to treat comedians less as righteous truth-tellers and political gatekeepers and more as flawed artists and businesspeople, that would be a good thing. Also, if the goal of the festival was to quiet criticism of the Saudi government, it backfired. There has been a huge amount of new coverage not just of the Khashoggi killing, but also of the treatment of women in Saudi Arabia, the country’s record of imprisoning dissidents and the surge of executions there. In a fascinating essay arguing that Saudi support of the festival was driven by domestic concerns, a Tulane professor, Andrew Leber, pointed out: “There has been far more discussion of freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia in the past two weeks than when the Saudi government executed a journalist on national-security grounds in June.” It’s a grim point but hard to argue with. And it forces us to think a little harder about where we are directing our attention.

80011933de99,‘Urchin’ Review: The Vicious Cycle and Recycle of Addiction and Hope,"movies, frank dillane, urchin, harris dickinson","“Urchin” doesn’t break the mold, but it’s a confident, quietly affecting drama that strikes above the standard character study. Mike (Frank Dillane), an unhoused addict whom we first meet scouring the busy streets of London, is bouncing back after a desperate act of violence lands him in jail for several months. Wistful, naturalistic scenes spotted with tragicomic humor and surreal visuals depict the aftermath of Mike’s release, when he’s given a lifeline: a few free weeks in a hostel and a gig in a dingy hotel kitchen. Dreamy interludes paired with synth-pop instrumentals show Mike rekindling his spirit through karaoke with his lively female colleagues and later reveling around a bonfire with a hippie-ish Frenchwoman, Andrea (Megan Northam), with whom he strikes up a brief and ultimately disastrous romance. There are shades of David Thewlis’s Johnny, the raggedy charmer of Mike Leigh’s “Naked” (1993), in Dillane’s performance, especially when Mike reverts to his spiky old ways. In his brightest moments, Mike is boyishly gentle, a little wacky, and modestly proud — all in ways that Dillane manages to make feel both pathetic and delightful. “Urchin” is the feature debut of Harris Dickinson (“Babygirl,” “Triangle of Sadness”), who showcases his cinephile bona fides with confidence, even if his efforts feel somewhat conventional by comparison. Frenzied hand-held camerawork and long-lens imagery give Mike’s urban milieu an alienating quality, recalling the Safdie brothers’ films, though Dickinson tempers the chaos with grounded social-realist commentary. This isn’t a poignant story of recovery, nor is it an epic fall from grace. Mike re-enters his destructive cycle with a banal sort of ease — shame, systemic forces and social circumstance all playing into his fated relapse. In one scene, Mike reconnects with Nathan (Dickinson himself), a fellow addict who was once a threat to his sobriety. Now it’s Mike who’s all twitchy and angling for quick cash. The tables have turned, and I bet they’ll continue their flip-flopping. Urchin Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes.

fb9552c51673,"‘Soul on Fire’ Review: After Near Death, Rebuilding a Life","movies, sean mcnamara, soul on fire, john corbett, joel courtney, stephanie szostak","Bad things happen to good people in “Soul on Fire,” whose mix of dire calamity and spiritual opportunity manages to be affecting despite the dashes of unabashed schmaltz. The movie is an adaptation of an autobiographical book by the inspirational speaker John O’Leary, whose experiment with gasoline in the garage left him with third-degree burns over most of his body and, at 9 years old, little expectation of survival. It’s the story of how he soldiered on, bolstered by family, hospital staff and an unexpected guardian angel in the form of a local baseball announcer, played with atypical wholesomeness by William H. Macy. Written by Gregory Poirier and directed by Sean McNamara (who explored Bethany Hamilton’s resilience in “Soul Surfer” ), the feature nods toward the power of faith, but its inspirational gloss is more overtly rooted in baseball — namely, the St. Louis kid John’s beloved Cardinals (complete with a fleeting cameo by the team’s longtime shortstop Ozzie Smith). The action moves back and forth in time, primarily between 1987, when the accident occurred, and 1998, when John as a college student (Joel Courtney) is the life of the party despite his physical scars, but struggling to feel worthy of asking out Beth (Masey McLain), the girl he loves. All the actors, led by Courtney, lend shadings to the ultra-straightforward material, and James McCracken as the younger version of John, playing whole sequences under bandages, makes the boy’s determination and vulnerability evident. Rising to the occasion with unwavering support are John’s siblings, friends, parents (John Corbett and Stephanie Szostak), a no-nonsense burn-ward nurse (DeVon Franklin) and Jack Buck (Macy), offering gentle pep talks during hospital visits and shout-outs during Cardinals games. In terms of dramatic oomph, the problem isn’t that everyone behaves with decency and compassion, but that everyone unfailingly says what they mean, robbing the movie of moment-to-moment friction, dimension and subtext, even as its lessons in gratitude and self-forgiveness hit the mark.

02c24010e5bb,‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ Review: Play Their Favorite Song,"movies, jennifer lopez, diego luna, bill condon, kiss of the spider woman","Central to Bill Condon’s “Kiss of the Spider Woman” is a film within the film titled “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” The inner “Spider Woman” is a shiny, extravagant musical led by Jennifer Lopez , and it stands in stark contrast to its carrier host, a prison drama haunted by torture and betrayal. Alas, neither the parts nor the whole quite work. Linking the two worlds is Luis Molina ( Tonatiuh , in a revelatory performance), a window dresser who was arrested on charges of public indecency with another man. He shares a cell with Valentín Arregui (Diego Luna), a dour leftist revolutionary who was imprisoned for his activities against the ruling dictatorship — we are in 1983 Argentina, at the tail end of an era of brutal repression. Valentín doesn’t want to be distracted from his very important readings about Lenin, but tough: He’s stuck with a friendly chatterbox who has a particular fixation on the golden-age movie star Ingrid Luna (Lopez). Molina is particularly fond of her lavish vehicle “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” whose plot he recounts to Valentín, with the cellmates inserted in the celluloid dreamscape like satellites orbiting La Luna. That nesting-doll structure parallels the lineage of the movie, which is based on a Kander and Ebb musical, itself inspired by a 1976 novel from the Argentine author Manuel Puig. His book also spawned stage dramatizations and an award-winning 1985 film. The biggest change from the stage musical, which opened on Broadway in 1993, is that Condon ditched the songs performed in the prison, thus creating a starker differentiation between reality and fantasy (the cinematographer Tobias Schliessler does a superb job of differentiating between the gritty 1980s and Molina’s Technicolor imagination). But the writer-director, working off Manuel Puig’s novel and Terrence McNally’s book for the musical, has also scrubbed ambiguities that made the story darker. Both Molina and Valentín are now wholly sympathetic, and the screenplay is more sentimental about the relationship between the two prisoners, which was shaded with calculation in the earlier renditions. But who are we kidding? A huge draw of “Spider Woman” is to see Jennifer Lopez set her phaser to “diva” and fire away in numbers designed to look as if they had been made on the old MGM lot. Lopez handles the songs well enough, although she tends to reel out the lyrics as if checking off items on a list — Chita Rivera, who created the role on Broadway, would bite into them with wolfish gusto. At least Condon captures the dancers’ full bodies and emphasizes long, or longish, takes, which helps Sergio Trujillo’s choreography take over the full screen, as it should. Some numbers feel like direct shout-outs to the “Girl Hunt” ballet from “The Band Wagon” and “Broadway Melody” from “Singin’ in the Rain,” with Lopez swanning through the flamboyantly artificial sets. For the most part, though, the X factor of elegance, sensuality and verve that made MGM musicals so memorable is missing here. You want to give an encouraging grade for effort, but effort is also the last thing you want to see in a musical. Kiss of the Spider Woman Rated R for sex, violence and language — it’s a prison movie, after all. Running time: 2 hours 8 minutes.

6b8f4e9eb8b6,Review: How Swedish Television Covered the Middle East,"six-day war, documentaries, israel, israel palestine on swedish television 1958-1989, goran hugo olsson","The title “Israel Palestine on Swedish TV 1958-1989” may not roll off the tongue, but it is a case of truth in advertising. This sprawling, continually engrossing assemblage from Goran Hugo Olsson ( “The Black Power Mixtape” ) is built entirely from material shown on Swedish public television. Its subject is not only the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also how the news was mediated for Swedish viewers by a dominant broadcaster with a mandate for impartiality. So the film offers both a detailed historical account and a running critique of that account. Some early programs around the 10th anniversary of Israel’s founding skew decidedly upbeat, like “Israel — Land of Wonders,” in which an emigrant from Sweden praises Israel’s “day-fresh” groceries and hospitals “built according to the Swedish model.” In 1964, a show airs a contentious debate between an ambassador and an academic from Sweden over the fate of the Palestinians. A 1966 segment on youth in Israel includes a lengthy interview with a Bedouin student. “We are lost because there are Jews here that look at us like war captives,” he says, “and the Arabs look on us like enemies because we are living in Israel.” The correspondent Vanna Beckman emerges as a specialist in reporting from Jordan on Palestinian refugees and resistance ideology, and there is a shift in tone after 1967, when Israel’s victory in the Arab-Israeli war changes the perception of its military strength. Major news events, like the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979, share time with a 1982 visit to the print shop of an Arabic newspaper in the West Bank that we are told is censored from printing local news. There is no single takeaway from Olsson’s film, which — apart from the musical score’s intermittent mood-setting — presents the footage straightforwardly, inviting viewers to reflect on what is in and out of frame. It’s great TV and an excellent documentary. Israel Palestine on Swedish TV 1958-1989 Not rated. In Swedish, English, Hebrew and Arabic, with subtitles. Running time: 3 hours 20 minutes.

76321855bb83,‘If I Had Legs I’d Kick You’ Review: Maternal Duress,"movies, rose byrne, if i had legs i'd kick you, mary bronstein","Barely five minutes into “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” the world — at least, the living-room ceiling — caves in on Linda (Rose Byrne), a stressed-out mother whose daughter is unsuccessfully battling a mysterious illness. Under normal circumstances, the shock would be upsetting; yet this emotionally devastating movie already has us so tightly wound that the rupture arrives with the force of an explosion. Like that ceiling, Linda is breaking down. Caring for a child who refuses to eat and is sustained by a feeding tube is made even more onerous by the cheap motel where they have relocated until the hole is repaired. Almost equally taxing is her job as a therapist, especially the demands of one patient whose delusions about her new baby are particularly concerning. Wherever Linda looks, someone is angry with her and no one seems able to help: not her husband, Charles, a cruise captain on a monthslong trip (Christian Slater, appearing mainly as an exasperated voice on the phone); not her daughter’s vaguely threatening doctor (played by the film’s writer-director, Mary Bronstein), who berates Linda for missing family therapy sessions and questions her competence; and certainly not Linda’s own therapist (a wickedly hostile Conan O’Brien), who does everything but openly roll his eyes at Linda’s distress. “Why don’t you like me?” Linda blurts during a session, and it’s a testament to Byrne’s remarkable performance that the question lands not as a whine, but as a bracing gust of honesty. And as one setback follows another, and Linda’s choices grow increasingly terrible and irresponsible, Byrne — under near-constant scrutiny from Christopher Messina’s assaultive camera — turns her face into an emotional battleground. By the time we see her screaming into a pillow, we’re right there with her. Wrenching and at times suffocating, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” is a howl of maternal desperation spiked with jagged humor. A scene in a car with a vicious hamster is a pressure-relieving treat — even tiny animals don’t like Linda — as is Linda’s eventual appearance at group therapy, an unkempt specter at a feast of perfectly groomed and accessorized fellow sufferers. Even so, some viewers could find the movie’s relentlessness exhausting, while others might feel it’s too relatable for comfort. Bronstein (who explains in the press notes that she wrote the script as a result of her own maternal difficulties) has waited 17 years to follow up on her hugely enjoyable first feature, “Yeast,” and she makes some smart choices, easing the strain on Byrne with supporting performers who cool the film’s feverish momentum. The wonderful Danielle Macdonald, playing a young mother who fervently believes she’s going to harm her newborn, is heartbreakingly believable. But it’s Linda’s barbed interactions with James (ASAP Rocky), the motel’s super, that add texture and shading to Linda’s barely suppressed fury. A gentle, easygoing soul, James is intrigued by this rude woman who repeatedly rebuffs his offers of assistance. Their connection — neither romantic nor entirely friendly — is as random as the mating of mayflies, but James’s low-key overtures (and Rocky’s nuanced acting style) allow us to see the damage inflicted by Linda’s self-involvement. At some point, well before a clip of the child-killer Andrea Yates appeared, I realized I was watching a horror movie. Much like “We Need to Talk About Kevin” (2011) or “The Babadook” (2014) — or Doris Lessing’s gut-churning 1988 novel “The Fifth Child” — Bronstein’s script turns a mother’s anxiety into an almost supernatural force. Returning repeatedly to her destroyed apartment, Linda gazes into the hole, now a shifting void that’s sucking her in, a portal to a reality more soothing than her own. These scenes, along with many others, rely heavily on Filipe Messeder and Ruy García’s disquieting sound design, which expertly melds the rush and roar of the void, the insistent beeping of medical equipment, the cacophony of voices demanding Linda’s attention. These include the child (Delaney Quinn), whose face remains hidden until the end, but whose needs are the movie’s unyielding bass line. And even as the film has some disgusting fun with Linda’s terrifying determination to free her child from the feeding tube, it insists she’s as tethered to it as her daughter. It’s a leash as inescapable as the umbilical cord itself. If I Had Legs I’d Kick You Rated R for substance seeking and rodent wrangling. Running time: 1 hour 53 minutes.

ac1b5cc7304b,‘Mr. K’ Review: ‘The Hotel Is Shrinking!’,"movies, crispin glover, mr. k, tallulah hazekamp schwab","“Mr. K” is a species of European art film I had assumed was long extinct: mannered, self-consciously quirky, with an offbeat sense of humor and a visual style that’s both fusty and surreal, like Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s “Delicatessen” or, what is easily the apex of the genre, Roy Andersson’s “Songs From the Second Floor.” Its title evokes a Kafka character, but in tone, “Mr. K” owes more to Luis Buñuel’s “The Exterminating Angel” or Marco Ferreri’s “La Grande Bouffe.” It’s ironic, highly stylized existentialism, though it requires great skill and care to pull off. A Dutch-Belgian-Norwegian production, written and directed by Tallulah H. Schwab, “Mr. K” is performed in English by its international cast, lead by Crispin Glover, the acclaimed American character actor. This geographical ambiguity adds a certain frisson to the premise, which is situated out of place and out of time: A traveling magician (Glover) arrives at a dilapidated, labyrinthine hotel, and while he intends to stay only one night, he soon finds that he’s not able to leave. Cue dread, paranoia and a descent into madness. In Schwab’s rendering, the corridors are cramped and the rooms are claustrophobic — even more so as the hotel begins to literally contract. The costuming and production design is exaggerated and darkly cartoonish; women have bleach-blonde bouffant hairdos and the hallways have peeling emerald wallpaper. Naturally, the guests are weirdos, though none are very memorable. And since Glover himself is the ultimate weirdo, it all feels a bit much. Mr. K Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes.

71b35f713425,Glenn Close Has Nothing Left to Prove,"glenn close, actor, theater, movies, bozeman montana, sunset boulevard, katharine hepburn, 101 dalmatians, all's fair, personal profile;people story","In May, Close joined a few of her “All’s Fair” castmates at the Disney upfronts in New York, a marketing event for prospective advertisers. It was, one surmises, the opposite of everything she loves about acting. “I can’t wait to get home,” she tells me the next morning. “I’m so tired of all the [expletive] internet.” Before taking the role of Dina Standish, the firm’s matriarch, she wanted to be sure she wasn’t resurrecting Patty Hewes, the ruthless litigator she played for five seasons beginning in 2007 on the FX series “Damages.” To avoid comparisons, Close, who, unusually for her, signed on to “All’s Fair” without seeing a script, asked for Dina to be kind and in a loving marriage. (Murphy, who wasn’t available to comment, took Close’s suggestion that Standish’s husband, played by Ed O’Neill, should have prostate cancer.) At first, Close found it difficult to connect with the material, which could be quite “juicy,” as she puts it, or her co-stars. “I’m sure she told you how hard it was,” says Paulson. “Every set you walk onto is different. In Ryan’s world, you go big or go home.” To prevent the latter from happening, Kris Jenner, the show’s executive producer, invited the cast, which includes Niecy Nash-Betts, Teyana Taylor and Naomi Watts, to her Calabasas, Calif., mansion for a screening of “Fatal Attraction,” which Kardashian, also an executive producer of the show, had revealed she’d never seen. (“We all went around saying our favorite Glenn Close movie. I was like … ‘101 Dalmatians’?” Kardashian says.) The actresses were given matching Skims pajamas to wear, and Jenner organized a candy cart with cookies that had scenes from the movie on them. “It was like being on an acid trip,” says Paulson. When the first season wrapped in March, Close raced back to Mooreland. “All the noise that our culture is now piling on us every single day, all the information, is overwhelming, and it can grind you to a halt,” she later said on Instagram. This fall, she’ll travel to Berlin to shoot a “Hunger Games” prequel, “Sunrise on the Reaping,” playing the malevolent Drusilla Sickle, and then to London for “An Elderly Lady Is Up to No Good,” a limited series based on the Swedish author Helene Tursten’s stories about a woman who ends up killing those who annoy her. After that, she’ll return her attention, as ever, to “Sunset Boulevard.” The latest script, by Chris Terrio, who won the 2013 adapted screenplay Oscar for “Argo,” opens with a montage of Norma at the height of her fame. “You see what she was, and then you [meet] the woman,” Close says. Lloyd Webber, who also hopes it’ll get made, sounds more cautious. “What people have got to remember is that the rights to ‘Sunset Boulevard’ are very jealously guarded by Paramount because they regard the Billy Wilder movie as one of the jewels in their crown,” he says. “She’s tried, I’ve tried, everyone’s tried. Ultimately, it’s going to be their decision.” (A source at the studio, which has undergone multiple regime changes and a merger with Skydance Media since the film was in development, says there hasn’t been any recent movement on the project.) Although she’s far from ready to admit defeat, Close knows that the odds are against her. “I’m now pretty sure that I won’t have enough time to do everything that I want,” she says soberly. I ask if her ambition still includes winning an Oscar. “I don’t dwell on it at all, but I’d like one,” she says. “In some weird way, it changes how people perceive you. And I’m looking at all the women in my peer group — they’ve all got one. Maybe I’ll get rolled out drooling in a wheelchair for some lifetime thing.” She laughs, and we sit for a moment with that image. “Look, I’m still in the room,” she adds. “To me, that’s more important.” Some weeks later, my phone buzzes. Close, who’s spent most of the summer in Bozeman, has texted a video of the Montana sky, inky and menacing. “Something’s brewing,” she says over the recording. “ Something’s brewing .” Since our very first exchange, Close has fully committed to playing an actress being interviewed, generously offering up versions of herself. But as I scroll through all the pictures and videos she’s sent — of Rory discovering his own reflection; Annie sitting with Pip by the creek; a bear in her neighbor’s backyard — I wonder if this is a cleaner take, her way of cutting through the noise. There’s something else she’d wanted to show me when I was in Bozeman: a large oil painting she commissioned decades ago that hangs over the sofa in her living room. In it, a young blond girl sits with a book and two dogs at her feet, looking off at a castle in the distance. I’d assumed that the child was meant to be Close, and imagined that the castle represented the M.R.A. headquarters she’d escaped from. But Close corrected me: “That’s Annie,” she said, who had nearly cried when she first saw it at age 3. “But where are you?” Annie had asked her mother. Picking up her daughter, Close smiled. “Don’t worry — I’m in the castle making you a sandwich.” All she had to do was find her way home. Hair by Joey George at Streeters using Oribe.

c939a23b37bb,"The Greats: Glenn Close, David Henry Hwang and Tyler, the Creator","actor, theater, david henry hwang, the creator tyler, glenn close","Over the years of editing the Greats issue, I’ve noticed something that all our honorees have in common. It’s not that they somehow shifted their artistic genre (though they did); it’s not that they managed to capture, or speak to, the culture of the moment (though they did that too) — it’s the equanimity with which they look back on their earliest creative efforts. Anyone who makes art of any kind has a work (or many works) from when they were just starting to think of themselves as an artist that makes them cringe, but the people we profile tend not to dwell on these nascent attempts. Why? One could, of course, attribute this to arrogance, the belief that all their work was good, or at least meaningful. But I don’t think that’s it. I think they’ve all grown to realize that there is no good work, much less medium-busting work, without bad work; that failure, and lots of it, is essential to the creative process. I always say I appreciate and often admire a “swing and a miss” — a project in which an artist tries something big and even reckless. The fact that it’s unsuccessful isn’t the point; the point is that they tried in the first place. A spectacular miss is always more interesting than mere competence. Dedicating yourself to taking chances is particularly difficult when you’ve had early success, as both the rapper Tyler, the Creator and the playwright David Henry Hwang did. At 34, Tyler is already 15 years into his steadily ascendant career; Hwang got produced at New York’s Public Theater at 22 and won a Tony for best play when he was only 30. For Glenn Close , taking chances has become a kind of artistic signature, over a five-decade career during which she’s played a dog-murdering villainess, a bunny boiler, a wife with a secret, a possessed grandmother, a grieving mother and an aging diva. I doubt that any of these artists would say they loved everything they made — I also doubt any of them would say they didn’t gain something from the experience. Another thing I was struck by is how all three of them have built artistic communities that buffered them from when they were young. Tyler’s, a loose collection of actors, fellow musicians and designers, began coalescing when he was still in high school; Close and Hwang each found companionship in the theater. These bulwarks have, one imagines, allowed them to be adventurous: Close in the diversity of her roles; Hwang in the diversity of his projects (plays, films, musicals, operas); Tyler in the diversity of his extramusical pursuits (fashion design, acting). All of them are hopeful. All of them are looking forward. All of them want to learn something new. Only the very few can make great art. But the rest of us can try to live like a great artist, for whom the pursuit, and the wonder, never ends.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/t-magazine/greats-glenn-close-tyler-the-creator-david-henry-hwang.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Hanya Yanagihara,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/t-magazine/09tmag-edletter-slide-A170-copy/09tmag-edletter-slide-A170-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T09:00:59.925000+00:00,60e08f9ca31708db3b8e330c40599e3162290a8a
1120e8d57bbb,The Strangely Beautiful Realities You Can Discover in a Ken Jacobs Film,"movies, ken jacobs, star spangled to death, nyc;new york city","The old, lost New York is a constant in Jacobs’s work, beginning with “ Orchard Street ” (1955-2015), his first film. Shot with a 16-millimeter camera, it is a beautiful, fascinating look at the lively, pregentrified Lower East Side street of the title back when it was crowded with small, crammed stores and overflowing stalls that sold clothes, shoes, eyeglasses, food and seemingly everything else under the sun. With appreciable sensitivity to color, shape and texture, Jacobs by turns pulls back and narrows in on the street and its surging human flow. He points his camera up at laundry fluttering on a clothesline stretched across the sky and points it down at a child hiding in a cardboard box; he shows you a world. Jacobs continued making movies in the decades that followed, including collaborations with friends and family, notably his wife, Flo. ( She died in June .) His output was prodigious and astonishing. Among his many projects is the seven-hour-plus “Star Spangled to Death,” which is effectively a politically enraged, despairing, at times darkly funny epic-autopsy of American history. In one section, Jacobs cuts from Richard M. Nixon finishing his 1952 “Checkers” speech, in which the future president responded to accusations of misusing campaign funds, to a grinning cartoon character banging on a piano: That’s entertainment, folks! Using a wide range of found and original material, visual and audio, Jacobs began it in the 1950s, tinkered with it on and off, and finished it nearly a half-century later. By that time, Jacobs was also experimenting with cinematic depth in his singular way. Beginning in the 1970s, he and Flo began doing live performances using two side-by-side projectors, identical film strips and a rotating shutter to make optical effects, including an illusion of depth as rich as any lavish 3-D spectacle (without the funny glasses). In 2009, for an article , I visited the Jacobses at their Chambers Street loft where, using a device called the Nervous Magic Lantern, Ken hid behind a black curtain — like a bohemian Wizard of Oz — to create strangely beautiful images from light and shadow. This invention was a variation on a proto-cinematic machine, dating from at least the Renaissance, called the magic lantern. In more recent years, Jacobs began creating what he called Eternalisms, short, trippy digital works that he made using a still camera with two lenses and a computer. Although some Eternalisms look like animated abstract expressionist paintings, my favorites offer glimpses of New York in its glory, from a gorgeous street throbbing with color at night (the word “joyful” pops in one corner) to a daytime scene of people crowding around a street vendor’s wares.

His thick, slightly nasal apparatus was best suited to terrified moans, as on the first track of his band Black Sabbath’s self-titled album, when, facing Satan himself, he protests, “Oh no, no, please God help me.” Music helped Osbourne and his bandmates, including the visionary guitarist Tony Iommi, escape the stifling confines of Birmingham, England, in the 1970s. After a career marked by substantial commercial success and staggering substance abuse, Osbourne was kicked out of his own band. Several career turns followed, including one in reality TV. The Osbourne we see in the often heartbreaking documentary “Ozzy: No Escape From Now,” directed by Tania Alexander, is a genuine pop culture icon. But he’s also a man who is falling apart as he tries to muster the energy to get out of bed. How’s he going to go on a final tour? Or pull off a Sabbath reunion in Birmingham, back where it all started? Watching him try, with the encouragement of his ever-stalwart wife, Sharon, is sometimes inspiring. But it’s mostly painful, as his health issues keep getting in the way. The movie chronicles eventual triumphs that are invariably tinged with sadness. Through it all, Osbourne’s devotion to his family, his fans, his bandmates and, yes, his art is palpable. Ozzy: No Escape From Now Not rated. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.

3d9a8f61d115,"Ken Jacobs, Visionary Experimental Filmmaker, Is Dead at 92","art, movies, obituary, millennium film workshop, ken jacobs, nyc;new york city, suny binghamton","A ghostly tightrope walker treading an invisible line above the madding crowd . People responding on camera to the assassination of Malcolm X at the Audubon Ballroom . Gargantuan rain clouds sputtering in and out of color above roiling seas . These are just a few of the unforgettable images conjured over more than 65 years by Ken Jacobs, the pioneering filmmaker whose experiments with cinematic form led many to consider him the éminence grise of the American avant-garde. He died, at 92, on Sunday at a hospital in Manhattan. His son, the filmmaker Azazel Jacobs, said the cause was kidney failure. Mr. Jacobs began to tinker seriously with filmmaking in 1955, but it was the following year that two experiences helped cement his lifelong dedication to the moving image and his obsession with its plasticity. He began studying with Hans Hofmann , the German-born artist and influential teacher, who offered free painting classes in New York City. Though he wasn’t in Hofmann’s class for long, the painter’s work left an imprint on Mr. Jacobs , who would later describe his filmmaking as “Abstract Expressionist cinema” in homage. It was also in 1956 that Mr. Jacobs met Jack Smith , another key figure in the early days of American underground cinema. The two soon began work on a variety of projects, including Mr. Jacobs’s sprawling critique of American society, “Star Spangled to Death,” a decades-in-the-making epic that was released in 2004; Mr. Smith’s “Flaming Creatures” (1963), another cult success; and “ Blonde Cobra ” (1959-63), a portrait of Mr. Smith and one of the most influential and popular experimental films ever made. Mr. Jacobs would poetically describe “Blonde Cobra” as “a look in on an exploding life, on a man of imagination suffering pre-fashionable Lower East Side deprivation and consumed with American 1950s, 40s, 30s disgust.” Mr. Smith plays the man, among several other roles. Re-editing 16-millimeter footage from an abandoned film by his friend the cinematographer Bob Fleischner, Mr. Jacobs wove an eye-catching bricolage of outré sexual imagery, classic Hollywood references and queer iconography. Jonas Mekas , a pre-eminent champion of avant-garde film, anointed “Blonde Cobra” “the masterpiece of Baudelairean cinema.” It was followed by “ Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son ” (1969), the apotheosis of Mr. Jacobs’s work with found footage and a vital part of a wave of so-called Structural experimentation in American cinema in the 1960s, a movement that included artists such as Bruce Conner , Hollis Frampton and Peter Kubelka . In “Tom, Tom,” Mr. Jacobs rephotographed a salvaged 1905 short film based on an old folk rhyme directed by D.W. Griffith’s favorite cameraman, Billy Bitzer . Mr. Jacobs then manipulated Mr. Bitzer’s images — inverting them, slowing them to a halt, pulling them like taffy — as if to challenge the molecular structure of the ancient celluloid. The resulting 115-minute film is a ghostly, poetic meditation on the alchemical process of filmmaking, the value of forgotten art and what adaptation really means. It became Mr. Jacobs’s signature work and a staple of avant-garde film class syllabuses. In 2007, “Tom, Tom” was added to the National Film Registry in a fitting, if ironic, act of preservation for what was once lost footage. In addition to his son, Mr. Jacobs is survived by a daughter, Nisi Ariana, a multimedia artist and musician who collaborated with her father on many of his works. His wife, Florence (Beth Karpf) Jacobs , an artist who was known as Flo and who also worked closely with her husband on film projects, died in June . The couple were cast by Azazel Jacobs in his film “Momma’s Man” (2008), about a man who abandons his wife and infant, moves back in with his bohemian parents — a couple very much like the Jacobses — in their downtown Manhattan loft, and revisits his life as a child. “That life includes his parents, who belong to a generation of Manhattan artists who have become as exotic as the last of the Mohicans,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review in The New York Times. “These are people who helped create not just a child but also a world.” Kenneth Martin Jacobs was born on May 25, 1933, to divorced parents in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. He was initially raised by his mother, Janice Rosenthal, a writer and artist who was known as Zelda and submitted short stories to publishers as “Z. Rosenthal,” believing that disguising her female name increased her work’s chances of being accepted. She supported her son by working as a typist. Ken was 7 when his mother died, leading to what he called a “ disastrous but typical ” early relationship with his father, Joe Jacobs, a onetime minor-league baseball player. He was introduced to art cinema — including the films of Charlie Chaplin, Jean Vigo and Erich von Stroheim — at the Museum of Modern Art, an experience he later described as “ a revelation .” After serving two years in the Coast Guard, he returned to New York, where he used his earnings to buy a film camera. From 1966 to 1968, he and his wife were instrumental in the founding of the Millennium Film Workshop , a nonprofit filmmakers’ cooperative that offered production equipment, work space, screenings and classes to the general public at little or no cost. By 1969, Mr. Jacobs was at the forefront of the American experimental film movement. At the same time, he began to pursue opportunities to teach. That year, he led a weeklong seminar at what is now Binghamton University in upstate New York as part of a course taught by a fellow experimental filmmaker, Larry Gottheim. The stint proved so successful that students petitioned the administration to hire Mr. Jacobs full-time — which it did, despite his lack of a high school diploma. He and Mr. Gottheim created Binghamton’s department of cinema, the first of its kind in the State University of New York system, and the school became Mr. Jacobs’s professional home on and off for years. His students included the cartoonist Art Spiegelman and the film critic J. Hoberman . Mr. Hoberman later said of the experience , “I had never encountered a teacher who could talk so passionately about art, spontaneously integrating political views and childhood recollections.” Beginning in 1999, he embarked on a multi-decade series of audiovisual experiments he called Eternalisms , in which two-dimensional images were rendered three-dimensional through a complex editing system of his own invention. When these Eternalisms are screened on 2-D surfaces — in theaters, on computers, through YouTube — the human eye perceives an illusory depth previously unavailable without specialized 3-D glasses. His final completed Eternalism, “The Whole Shebang” (2019), revisited a “projection-performance” that he first staged with Ms. Jacobs in 1982. The film centers on found black-and-white footage of Depression-era daredevils jumping through fire as they flicker in and out of perceptibility. “I have a fascination with depth, with the illusion of depth,” Mr. Jacobs said on a return visit to Binghamton in 2012. “The screen has a certain 2-D ambiguity. Things can be where you think they are, and then they’re somewhere else. You can create irrational spaces.” “It’s another way of perceiving the world,” he added.

2f49e54ed997,Honeycomb Wings and Jellyfish: These Costumes Dance Too,"dance;ballet, fashion, costume, new york city ballet, jamar roberts, iris van herpen, foreseeable future","Iris van Herpen held up a light-as-air fabric, constructed in a honeycomb pattern. “Do you mean every one of these squares has a stitch?” Marc Happel, the director of costumes at New York City Ballet, asked. He put his head in his hands. “We did it for Beyoncé,” van Herpen said. “If it’s good enough for Beyoncé,” Happel responded, “it’s good enough for us.” Van Herpen, the Dutch fashion designer known for her dazzlingly futuristic, sculptural inventions, was in her Amsterdam studio in July, walking Happel through her designs for a new ballet by Jamar Roberts. The piece, “ Foreseeable Future ,” had its premiere on Wednesday night at City Ballet’s annual fall fashion gala, which began in 2012 when the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, a board member, suggested commissioning new works that paired choreographers and fashion designers. Over 13 galas and more than 30 collaborations, there have been some hits but also frequent misses. “A lot of the time, choreographers are thinking about the movement,” Happel said, “the designers are busy with their own shows, and the costumes happen at a later stage. Then I have to try to delicately collaborate in coming up with something that is more danceable. But not in this case.” The Concept The first step, Happel said, is talking to the choreographers to discuss whether they have thoughts about designers. “A lot of the time, they aren’t so connected to the fashion world,” he said, “and don’t have strong ideas. But it was totally different with Jamar, who sat down and said ‘I would love to work with Iris van Herpen.’” For Roberts, though not for all choreographers, costume design is an integral part of making a dance. “I think I’m a visual artist in general,” he said. “Dance just happens to be my medium.” A former dancer with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Roberts even took a break when he was with the company to spend a semester at the Fashion Institute of Technology. While the resident choreographer at Ailey from 2019 to 2022, he designed the costumes for all his own works. “For someone like me, into art and fashion and design, Iris’s work is hard to miss,” he said, citing her presence in the world of pop music, movies and the art world. “It’s so cool and out of this world and unique. I thought, why not collaborate with someone like that?” Happel was thrilled. He had worked with van Herpen for the 2013 fashion gala, when she designed costumes for Benjamin Millepied’s “ Neverwhere .” That process, he said, “made me feel that costume-making, which is a very antiquated practice really, moved into the 21st century.” Van Herpen, who studied ballet for 10 years, agreed immediately to the new commission. “My mother was a dance teacher, and I love it so much,” she said in a video interview. “I get so much inspiration out of dancers and choreographers; it’s a lifeline to have that connection.” Roberts sent van Herpen a note, with some thoughts about the dance and his choice of music, by Arca, a Venezuelan-born experimental musician and producer. Then he and van Herpen met online to talk and look at preliminary sketches. That changed his thinking. “I wanted to say something about our relationship to technology,” he said. “But I didn’t know how to turn it into a piece. When I looked at Iris’s designs, they looked like rare species, new creatures, winged and fantastical. It was the missing link: technology and nature, chaos and calm; aspects of our humanity.” The Process Van Herpen sent a number of sketches and samples to New York as well as a video to show how the fabric moves. “There were floor length gowns,” Roberts said, “winged shapes, things that felt almost like jellyfish, fabric so light it hung in the air.” Van Herpen said that she tried to imagine the dancers — and the freedom of their movement — when designing. Roberts had divided the dance into two sections that they informally called calm and chaos. “To translate what Jamar had in mind for the calm sections, it was important to go beyond the shape of the body, to make it more than human, to have a spiritual quality. For that, the costumes are made from a fabric that is so thin it weighs almost nothing and has an aerial quality, like being in a cloud.” For Chaos, she added, the costumes are “more like an imaginary technologically smart armor for the future.” Roberts was thrilled by van Herpen’s vision. “She really brought me out of a head space and into a place of more imagination and theater,” he said. “Of course I chose the ideas that needed couture-technique construction,” he added. “Mark was like, ‘Arrghh, but let’s give the guy what he wants!’” Happel traveled to Amsterdam to meet van Herpen and her team at her studio, which he called “a glorious think tank of design, new ideas and ways to make clothing.” They talked him through the construction techniques. For the four dancers who represent calm, Happel said, they used diaphanous Japanese organzas that are too fragile to be cut in traditional ways. The organzas are digitally printed in an ombré, from the dancers’ flesh color to a vibrant red. They are then laser-cut into pattern shapes that are stitched together to create the women’s honeycomb patterned wings, skirts and bodices, and the men’s sleeves. “When I first saw the sketches, they were pretty incredible, but I was a bit nervous,” Sara Mearns, a dancer on the calm squad, said in a telephone interview. “I was like, ‘Really, I am going to wear these massive wings?’ Then they made a mock-up and I could hardly tell they were on me. They react to the movement, and you aren’t fighting with the costume.” For the chaos costumes, Happel said, intricate computer-printed patterns in silver mylar and very thin reflective rubber were “laser-cut and heat-set twice in our workshop onto net unitards or tulle, which were dyed to match the dancer’s skin tone.” The same mylar was heat-set in patterns on tights, which were then hand sewn to the edges of the women’s ballet slippers. “I was thinking about the evolution of the human body in relation to technology,” van Herpen said. “The patterns in the very reflective material sort of break up the body, and you see it in a disrupted, hybrid way.” When Roberts was working with the dancers in the studio, he kept the costumes in mind. “They really influenced the choreography,” he said. “When you know you have a costume with two-foot-wide wings on each side, you want to create movement that will magnify that.” The Stage Before a stage rehearsal, Naomi Corti, in a metallic-printed short triangle dress, flexed her foot experimentally. “The shoes feel really secure,” she said. “This all fits really well.” Isabella LaFreniere tried out her wings, lifting her arms in sweeping curves, the light glimmering through the honeycomb of the organza, changing its shape and color as she moved. “I can see a lionfish in there,” van Herpen said quietly from the side. After the run-through, Mearns said the real wings “were even lighter than the mock-up.” “They are constantly flowing with your movement,” she said. “There is an in-the-moment spontaneity; they will move differently in every show.” At the premiere, the curtain rose on the four winged dancers in curving, billowing motion, fairy-tale creatures whose bodies kept changing form. Then came the silvery chaos dancers, moving with angular, spiky energy to Arca’s grinding, pounding sounds. Later in the piece, the winged beings and the silver, technological humans mingle in fractured encounters, the contrast between their costumes and movement suggesting two worlds that may not ever be in harmony. In the final moments, Mearns and Stanley crumple to the ground, the wings forming a vivid shell around their bodies. The drama of the mutating shapes of the winged dancers set against the sharpness of the metallic silhouettes had created the contrast she was hoping for, van Herpen said after the premiere. “They came alive onstage exactly as I had imagined and hoped they would.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/arts/dance/nyc-ballet-iris-van-herpen-jamar-roberts.html,Culture,BBC,By Roslyn Sulcas and Nina Westervelt,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12cul-jamar-iris-tgzl/12cul-jamar-iris-tgzl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T14:59:23.863000+00:00,5dc3066393c0a8f8824c76d6593269f9373a7ed9
7ad616b87106,Zora Neale Hurston’s Play Comes Alive for the First Time,"theater, writer, black people;african american;african-american, books, archives, spunk, zora neale hurston, tamilla woodard, yale repertory theatre, library of congress, new haven ct","Zora Neale Hurston’s Play Comes Alive for the First Time “Spunk,” a fable weaving together music and movement, is getting its first full staging since being rediscovered in 1997. Published Oct. 11, 2025 Updated Oct. 12, 2025, 12:27 p.m. ET Like her groundbreaking novel, “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Hurston’s 1935 play, “Spunk,” has lively Black southern vernacular, a self-actualized heroine and witty, folk humor. But, even after that book became canonized, “Spunk” remained essentially unknown for years. That’s because, until its rediscovery in 1997, the play had languished in the Library of Congress ’s drama collections. But that only partly explains its absence. To mount a production as colorful and layered as her script envisioned, the play required not just critical will and patience but also a creative team capable of delving deeply into Hurston’s archives. Set in the rural, segregated South, the story follows Spunk, an outsider, as he falls in love with Evalina, a married woman, and their attempts to overcome the naysayers, neighbors and even supernatural forces that try to prevent them from being together. When Hurston reimagined it as a play, she transformed it into a comedy, jettisoning its tragic elements and ending. She also incorporated folk songs, sermons and sacred practices, like a conjure ceremony. After the prizewinning short story version of “Spunk” was published in the National Urban League’s journal, Opportunity, Hurston spent the next decade conducting extensive ethnographic fieldwork in the South and the Caribbean, under the guidance of the anthropologist Franz Boas. During this time, she recorded Black folk tales, music and cultural traditions, even documented — and at times participated in — spiritual rituals. It was those experiences that led her to revisit “Spunk” and reshape her story as a play. “You can feel Zora trying to get at what it means to have agency and liberty in your life, and mean not to be bound by what people tell you you’re supposed to do and how you’re supposed to do it,” said Tamilla Woodard, who is directing “Spunk” at Yale Rep. Woodard was a second-year M.F.A. student in Yale’s acting department when Catherine Sheehy, a dramaturg and professor at Yale, heard an NPR story about Hurston’s unpublished works in 2001 and quickly requested a copy of “Spunk.” “I read and loved it,” Sheehy recalled. She “started giving it to friends, sharing it with my students, and passing it along to various directors, artistic directors and choreographers.” “Spunk” was one of 10 Hurston plays rediscovered . (Not to be confused with George C. Wolfe’s 1989 staging of “Spunk,” an adaptation of three of Hurston’s stories: “Sweat,” “Story in Harlem Slang” and “The Gilded Six Bits.”) “The Library of Congress used to hold these scripts for authors who couldn’t have a copyright on them because there was no production of them,” Sheehy said. “Then in the late ’90s, they started going through their files to see what they had.” The plays were written after Hurston moved, in 1925, to Harlem from Eaton, Fla., to pursue her first passion: drama. But only one of her plays made it to Broadway in her lifetime: “Fast and Furious” in 1931. And despite Hurston’s posthumous acclaim, a stage production of “Spunk” wasn’t a given. In 2021, Roundabout Theater Company hosted a virtual reading of the play. But the script itself is highly annotated with stage plans and production notes . “The scripts have these little notations, like ‘Sing song here,’ and then there’s nothing,” said Jean Lee Cole, who, in 2008, edited with Charles Mitchell, “Zora Neale Hurston: Collected Plays,” an annotated volume of Hurston’s forgotten plays. “That was our biggest challenge. Another challenge was finding a creative team to stage the play. In the years since Sheehy first requested a copy of “Spunk,” Woodard graduated and built her own career as a director. She is now the chair of the acting program at David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University the resident director at Yale Repertory Theater. “She was the right person” to lead it, said Sheehy, who gave Woodard a copy of the play in 2021. “It was the fullness of time that made the best possible outcome for this play.” For Nehemiah Luckett, the composer and music supervisor for the production, it also meant listening directly to Hurston’s own voice, and the music she and the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax collected during her travels in the South. “The first source material was the Library of Congress-filled recordings that we had of Zora, in which we have the opportunity to hear Zora singing, which is phenomenal,” Luckett said. “I spent a lot of time listening to those recordings to get into the mood and the zone and the era.” During a visit last month to a rehearsal at the Yale School of Drama, I witnessed J. Quinton Johnson (Spunk) and Kimber Elayne Sprawl (Evalina, a.k.a. Lina) give a marvelous rendition of the song “Halihmuhfack,” a song Hurston learned while traveling along the Florida coast. But it was through Woodard’s detailed research that another important discovery occurred. “ There is a photo from that time period of Zora on the porch with [the musician Rochelle French] and a well-known blues artist, Gabriel Brown, holding a guitar,” she said. “He might have been the origin of Zora’s Spunk character.” And given their similarities, also the muse for the bluesy, freedom-seeking turned heartbreaking Teacake, in “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Hurston, far left, with Rochelle French and the blues artist Gabriel Brown in Eatonville, Fla. Credit... Library of Congress Luckett added, “For the songs where we have lyrics but did not have music, it was actually just a very exciting journey of trying to write something that felt like it was of that time, but that would not be too unfamiliar to our ears today.” As enriching as the music is, the choreography possesses its own electrifying dynamism, particularly in the movement featured in a work song set on a railroad track and a subsequent number at a juke joint, where the lovers first meet. To create that meeting, the choreographer nicHi douglas also turned to Hurston’s research. “There is a field research video that depicts what I think is a version of a song and dance that we call ‘Baby Child’ on the show,” Douglas said. “And the way that the children were playing the circle game, all of the physicality in that specific video really anchored my approach to the world of the movement throughout the show.” Building these moments for the stage entailed leaps of imagination and acts of faith among the collaborators. “I’d say to the team, ‘Trust Zora.’ It’s in the play, it’s in the script, we just have to be able to see it,” Woodard said. She noticed, for example, the reappearance of certain phrases as well as the likeness between the awakenings of Janie in “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” and Lina in “Spunk.” For the conjure scene, “part of the research was looking at the spell book and asking, ‘What’s the earth candle?’ and collectively reading every book at this point that she wrote, or like ‘Dust Tracks on a Road’ and ‘Their Eyes Were Watching God,’ that happened around the same time or directly after the play.” When Hurston arrived in New York during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of unprecedented creativity for Black artists, she hoped to create what she called a “new Negro play company.” “What people don’t know is that she was a theater person. She loved theater. She was even a drama teacher for a short time,” said Charles Mitchell, who, with Cole, edited “From Luababa to Polk County: Zora Neale Hurston Plays at the Library of Congress.” “And she was always trying to get her works produced. So there’s kind of a what-if universe that she actually had gotten the opportunities, she could have written the great folk musical, which didn’t really exist during that time.” Instead, she hit up against the competing demands on Black performers. The first was the popularity of vaudeville, in which Black actors often continued the racist stereotypes perpetuated by white actors performing in blackface minstrelsy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The second, espoused by Black intellectuals such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, argued that the purpose of Black theater was to dismantle racism and serve the cause of political progress and uplift. Hurston’s vision was a stark contrast to those. As she asked Langston Hughes in a letter in 1928: “Did I tell you before I left about the new, the REAL Negro art theater I Plan? Well I shall, or rather we shall act out the folk tales, however short.” (She and Hughes later wrote the play “Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life,” in 1930, which led to the dissolution of their friendship.) Today, her celebration of the ordinary speech and otherworldly beliefs of early-20th-century Southern Black communities seems even more original. And now that “Spunk” is onstage, her omission from the American theater canon feels even more glaring; the absence of her voice marks an even greater void. “Hurston’s deft ability to weave together humor and melodrama, music and movement, and bold statements about the vibrancy and complexities of Black life despite Jim Crow tyranny are utterly distinctive and set her apart,” said Daphne Brooks, a scholar of music and Black Studies at Yale University, comparing Hurston to her contemporary Southern playwrights DuBose Heyward, Carson McCullers, Tennessee Williams. “Her work exists outside the standard ways in which critics have defined ‘Black drama’ since the Harlem Renaissance. American theater critics and audiences largely weren’t ready for her then, and I’m not sure if they are now.” Produced by Laura O’Neill and Josephine Sedgwick.

abe9b975224c,‘S.N.L.’ Trots Out Amy Poehler and Tina Fey for a Senate Judiciary Grilling,"saturday night live, comedy, amy poehler, tina fey, seth meyers, charli xcx","On the occasion of the actual 50th anniversary of the first broadcast of “Saturday Night Live,” the show turned back the clock this week with an opening sketch that featured its former cast members Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. Poehler, who was hosting this week’s show, played Attorney General Pam Bondi in a sketch lampooning her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee , while Fey made a surprise appearance as the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem. Kicking off her remarks, Poehler declared to the committee, “What’s up, nerds? Furious to be here.” Asked if she would affirm that her testimony was the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, Poehler gave a derisive laugh and said, “No.” She explained that she spelled “Bondi” “with an ‘I’ ’ cause I ain’t gonna answer any questions” and said that the Justice Department had many ongoing operations “moving like Kash Patel’s eyeballs, very quickly in multiple directions at once.” Poehler went on to roast various members of the Senate including Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut (played by Mikey Day). “Even people in Connecticut go ‘damn, that guy’s white as hell,’” she said. Asked why U.S. troops were needed to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, Poehler deferred to Noem, played by Fey, who burst into the hearing at the mention of her name, armed with a large automatic weapon. “Hold my gun,” she said, tossing it off-camera. Fey said that she spelled the name “Kristi” “with an “I” ’ cause that’s how I thought it was spelled.” She added that she was “the rarest type of person in Washington, D.C., — a brunette that Donald Trump listens to.” Told by Day that Democrats were more eager than Republicans to end the government shutdown, Fey said, “Ha, that makes me laugh more than the end of ‘Old Yeller.’” “When the dog gets shot?” Day asked, horrified. She replied, “Dogs don’t just get shot. Heroes shoot them.” After Fey gave an impromptu recruitment ad for I.C.E. — (“Do you like to use zip ties because people in your life don’t trust you with keys?”) — Poehler said to the committee, “Does that answer your question?” Jeremy Culhane, playing Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, replied, “No. Not even a little bit.” “Then our work here is done,” Poehler said. Opening monologue of the week Returning to host “S.N.L.” for the first time since 2015 (when she and Fey were co-hosts), Poehler got nostalgic about her years in the cast, saying it was at the show that she said she found her first love: “Being famous.” She added: “I’m still on some of the amazing medications they put me on, so I will be forever grateful.” Poehler said that as a child, she would watch “S.N.L.” and dream of becoming an actress one day, “at least until they invent an A.I. actress who’s funnier and willing to do full frontal.” But what’s special about the age of 50, she said, is that “you start to not care about what people think.” “And that’s what’s so great about ‘S.N.L.,’” Poehler said. “She’s obviously stopped caring.” Commercial parodies of the week Supporting Poehler, her former co-star on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation,” Aubrey Plaza, popped up in a fake trailer for a new season of the steamy Netflix drama “The Hunting Wives,” where everyone is free to seduce and make out with everyone else. (At least until Plaza’s character reveals that she has a girlfriend and the other wives pull their guns on her.) Or, if you prefer the classic style of the “S.N.L.” parodies touting nonexistent products, there’s also the ersatz commercial for Non-Non-Alcoholic Beer, “ the first non-alcoholic beverage that’s over 96 percent alcohol. ” Cheers! Weekend Update jokes of the week Over at the Weekend Update desk, Colin Jost and his co-anchor Michael Che continued to riff on the Gaza cease-fire deal. Weekend Update guests of the week Though “S.N.L.” cashed in most of its celebrity chips for its anniversary celebrations earlier this year , it still found a few more stars to appear on the night it actually turned 50. The pop singer Charli XCX ( a past host and musical guest ) danced onstage for Role Model during his performance of “Sally, When the Wine Runs Out.” And it brought back the former Weekend Update anchors Poehler, Fey and Seth Meyers (now the host of NBC’s “Late Night”) for an appearance at their old desk. They all participated in a game-show-style lightning-round “joke off” with Jost and Che, trading punchlines over a report about a woman in Tennessee who gave birth to a 13-pound baby. Among the highlights: POEHLER: The baby “was so big, he slapped the doctor on his ass.” FEY: “and the new baby’s name is ‘Ahhhhhhhhh!’” MEYERS: “Damn, did she give birth to it or did it drive out?” CHE: “The second the baby was out, the woman zipped around the room like a deflated balloon.” JOST: “The baby’s nickname is Magician because it basically sawed his mother in half.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/arts/television/snl-recap-amy-poehler-tina-fey.html,Culture,BBC,By Dave Itzkoff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/arts/12CUL-SNL-RECAP-PIX1/12CUL-SNL-RECAP-PIX1-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-12T13:10:35+00:00,4406830ad57bedfa2647111384f9ec09844f9dbe
d8893c8df957,"The Shutdown Closes Smithsonian Museums, Shutting Out Tourists","museum, closings, travel;tourism;vacations, zoo, smithsonian institution, washington dc","The 21 museums operated by the Smithsonian Institution, many of them top tourist attractions in Washington, were closed as of Sunday morning as the federal government shutdown stretched into its second week. The Smithsonian had warned since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 that it would most likely have to close its museums as well as its 14 education and research centers and the National Zoo, if Congress did not reach an agreement on funding soon. For most of the last week, a bright red banner across the top of the Smithsonian website advised visitors that the museums would close to the public starting on Sunday. By Sunday afternoon, the steps outside some of the country’s most popular museums, including the National Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of American History, were filled with disappointed sightseers, many of them caught off guard by the closings. Josh Cain, 30, who was in town from New York to visit his girlfriend, stared bleakly out onto Constitution Avenue near the American History Museum on Sunday. “It’s almost like getting turned away from Disneyland,” he said. “It feels almost symbolic, like we’re trying to go learn about American history and we’re getting stiff-armed at the door.” Neil Shelley, a father of four from Chattanooga, Tenn., said he and his family had planned to see exhibits on spaceflight, the moon landing and the cosmology of the universe at the Air and Space Museum. “It’s pretty disappointing, a bunch of adults pitching temper tantrums,” Shelley, 44, said, referring to both sides of the congressional aisle. “I expect more from our leaders, to be more responsible and actually represent the people and not just your own vested interests.” The Smithsonian Institution, which was founded in 1846 and calls itself “the world’s largest museum, education and research complex,” operates some of the most-visited museums in the United States. Most are on the National Mall in Washington, though two are in New York, and admission is generally free. They logged nearly 17 million visits in 2024. The Smithsonian receives more than 60 percent of its annual funding from the federal government. It had announced two days after the shutdown began that it would rely on prior-year funds to remain open to the public until at least Oct. 6. In a post on Instagram on Friday , the organization said it would update the public on its “operating status” as soon as “the situation is resolved.” After Instagram users expressed concern for the animals in the National Zoo, the Smithsonian added, “The shutdown will not affect our commitment to the safety of our staff and standard of excellence in animal care.” Within days of the start of the shutdown , after Democrats and Republicans had entered a standoff over government funding that centered on health care spending , several important tourist sites in Washington, including the Library of Congress, the National Archives Museum and the National Arboretum, had closed. The National Gallery of Art shut its doors on Oct. 4. Tours of the Capitol and the Pentagon were suspended, and while the national parks have largely remained open , many have limited their services. Last week, a statue of George Washington that belongs to the National Park Service was installed in the White House Rose Garden after being removed from the grounds of the Washington Monument, which is closed because of the shutdown. Roughly 600,000 federal workers have been furloughed, and President Trump has seized on the impasse to reduce the civil work force. By Friday, more than 4,000 employees across seven federal departments, including the Treasury Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, had received layoff notices . Mr. Trump said on Saturday that he had “identified funds” that would permit the government to pay members of the military during the shutdown, even though Congress had not approved additional money to do so. But to many tourists in Washington on Sunday the nuances of the government shutdown felt remote. Mun Joshi, 28, was in the city for the first time, hoping to see the Museum of Natural History. A graphic designer and Army reservist from Portland, Maine, he had come with his wife and her parents, who were visiting from Kathmandu, Nepal. “It’s confusing. It’s very unpredictable,” Joshi said. “I hope everything gets better soon.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/arts/smithsonian-museums-shutdown.html,Culture,BBC,By Derrick Bryson Taylor and Darren Sands,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12cul-smithsonian-close-kqwc/12cul-smithsonian-close-kqwc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T13:29:39+00:00,f8fa04d9f48c25b8fb33dacb0348d6d2f8dc815e
6b75ae2c5cfd,Master of a Thousand Satisfied Soaks,"architecture, hot springs, bathing;showering, japan, nudity, office for metropolitan architecture, yuval zohar","It’s not every architect who braves four hours at sea on a sporadic ferry to a Japanese island with a smoldering sulfurous volcano and then bikes through a jungle to reach the object of his desire: a rocky outcropping of emerald green hot springs that turn striated turquoise when the ocean laps over the edges. But Yuval Zohar, an Israeli American now living in Japan, is not every architect. Call him the nude dude: His passion for hot springs, or “onsen,” as they are known in Japan, and the public bathhouses known as “sento,” drew him to the island of Iojima, a sparsely populated speck of land in the East China Sea, to the eye-grabbing Higashi Onsen. His obsession unfolds in dramatic detail in his recent book, “ Towards a Nude Architecture: A Visual Compendium of Japanese Hot Springs .” The title is a nod to Le Corbusier’s classic 1923 “Toward a New Architecture.” Japan is one of earth’s most volcanically robust places, with nearly 30,000 naturally occurring hot springs of varying temperatures, hues and mineral compositions, from milky white to bubbling black. They are typically accompanied by what Zohar , 38, calls “temples of steam and sweat” — vernacular architecture that “dignifiedly performs its duty free of frills, as naked as the people it serves,” he said. Over the past decade, he has lolled about in single-bather barrels (or tara-buro); indoor baths (uchiburo); outdoor baths (rotenburo); male baths (otokoyu); mixed-gender baths (konyoku); foot baths (ashiyu); hand baths (tayu); waterfall baths (utaseyu); cave baths (gankutsuboro); and even sleeping baths (neyu). Although he is hardly the first writer to wax eloquent about onsen, Zohar’s visual collages and impressionistic essays on notable hot springs include schematic drawings and site plans and wonky notations on the chemical and mineral compositions and temperatures of each one (Higashi Onsen: H20 Sulfuric Acid/pH1.7/47-55.8 °C). He started making what he called “methodical” trips to Japan as a young architect. Zohar’s family left Israel when he was 4, and he grew up in Baltimore (his father is a professor of marine biotechnology and his mother, an architect, worked with the urban planner and architect Moshe Safdie). Spying a “glinting sword” during his campus orientation at the University of Maryland, he found himself drawn to a modern form of wushu , or Chinese martial arts. He gravitated to China after architecture school, intent on honing his wushu skills, learning Mandarin and landing a job. He wound up in Shanghai “at a golden moment of architectural fervor,” he said, leading up to 2010 World Expo, where he contributed to the U.N. Pavilion with the firm Tektao . Zohar eventually connected with the architect Julien De Smedt , an alumnus of Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture. (OMA). Zohar led projects for De Smedt’s firm JDS in Shanghai at a time when China’s first budget airline began offering cheap round-trip flights to Ibaraki — onsen territory — about 50 miles northeast of Tokyo. Zohar’s first hot spring pilgrimage was to a spring known as Hell Valley on Hokkaido , Japan’s northernmost island. “It was a full sense experience, with the hissing and cracking of steam,” Zohar recalled. “There was a visceral feeling of nature, architecture and the human body.” He was utterly hooked. He continued his work for JDS in Brussels, where he led the firm in a competition organized by a developer for a residential tower in Helsinki, in which he proposed swapping saunas in private apartments for a large public one on the roof. To sell the idea, he rigged an architectural model to emit small puffs of birch-scented steam — mimicking the steam produced in Finnish saunas. The firm didn’t win. But the experience solidified Zohar’s zeal for communal bathing culture, down to the onsen tamago , in which eggs are slow-cooked in hot spring water. Japanese bathing culture goes back to at least 300 B.C. and the Shinto custom of bathing while praying or making a wish. The practice is thick with tales of cranes and other animals, not to mention warlords and soldiers, who used the springs to recuperate from injuries. “Towards a Nude Architecture” romps through secluded bathscapes like Aoni Onsen , also known as Lamp-no yado, which has no phone signal or internet on site and is lit entirely by kerosene lamps. It’s become a go-to place for digital detox. Traditional sento (the bathhouses) are made of hinoki wood, a fragrant Japanese cypress with microbial properties, or fire-resistant Izu blue stone, prized for its softness and deep marine color. Some built after the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 were constructed by temple carpenters and resemble Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. After eight years in China, Zohar joined OMA in Hong Kong and then in New York. He stayed in the city as a senior architect with Diller, Scofidio + Renfrow . At the Japan Society recently, he talked about “hadaka no tsukiai,” or “naked friendship” — the camaraderie that develops when people bathe naked together and social hierarchies are stripped away. In New York, where making eye contact with strangers is a no-no, some in the audience found the prospect of getting naked with strangers — especially in mixed-gender onsen — unsettling. “In Japan, naked bodies are nothing to be ashamed of or feared,” Zohar said. “When you grow up accustomed to this, it’s not an issue.” He began writing the book in a studio apartment in Greenwich Village. One day in 2022 he dashed downstairs when the building started shaking. It turned out to be a steam pipe explosion. The accident arose from Manhattan’s vast underground steam network, the country’s oldest and largest, seen in the orange steam funnels, that sometimes dot the streets. In Japanese, Zohar pointed out, “nuu yoku” means “to enter a bath.” He and several colleagues are developing a plan to create a “Nuu Yoku”/New York sento with a rooftop bar and a wooden water tower bath, ideally tapping into Con Edison’s steam system. In large part, Zohar wrote “Towards a Nude Architecture” to bring attention to historic sento. In 1968, Japan had about 20,000 sento; today there are about 3,000. Quaint neighborhood soaks are giving way to two extremes: individual home baths and giant commercial “super sento” — among them, Hakone Kowakien Yunessun in Kanagawa , an onsen water park with water slides and themed baths with added ingredients like wine and coffee. Zohar said that public bathing culture is eroding because of shifting societal tastes and generational preferences around privacy. The result, he said, is “a hollowing out of authentic tradition.” In the 1960s, Tokyo alone had more than 2,600 bathhouses; now its has fewer than 500, with one or two closing every week, according to the World Monuments Fund , which placed the prewar landmark Inari-yu sento on its 2020 “watch list.” The fund is collaborating with Sento & Neighborhood , a local nonprofit, to restore the building as a community space. Bathhouses flourished in Tokyo after the 1923 earthquake as rural migrant workers flocked to crowded urban tenements without baths. The sento “formed the center of a little urban microcosm, along with a tofu shop, a fishmonger and a place to share beers and have a bite to eat,” said Sam Holden, a founder of Sento & Neighborhood, in an email. The decline, he added, has to do with the wear and tear on the structures and equipment, inheritance taxes and fewer customers as neighborhoods gentrify. “They represent significant sites of intangible cultural heritage, embodying centuries-old practices,” said Jonathan Bell, the fund’s vice president of programs. Zohar now lives in Yugawara , a hot springs town about 1 ½ hours by train from Tokyo. He is working with the firm EXP.is to renovate traditional Japanese dwellings, called kominka, into lodging. and developing augmented reality games to go with them. His new hometown is famous for its annual water-splashing festival , in which huge wooden platforms carrying the guardian deity of hot springs and health are hoisted onto bearers’ shoulders and paraded through the streets while spectators pelt them with a thousand barrels of onsen water. Zohar was a shrine bearer for the first time last year. The following day, he and his fellow shrine bearers compared shoulder bruises — marks of basking in what Zohar’s book calls “the tectonic gifts of nature.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/arts/design/nude-architecture-yuval-zohar-japan.html,Culture,BBC,By Patricia Leigh Brown,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12cul-nude-architecture-wftb/12cul-nude-architecture-wftb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:48+00:00,9b3798a3d86bff7f6a69c95b604b3a428b069528
37c8febada1f,Manga Is a Pop Culture Phenomenon. It’s Also a Singular Art Form.,"comic strip, art, animated films, cartoons, museum, m. h. de young memorial museum, san francisco, japan","A demonic half-dog, half-man in a Japanese Heian-era outfit called a suikan watches from one corner of a wall. Elsewhere a young pirate boy grins so broadly that the bottom half of his face is enveloped in a perfect semicircle of teeth. Images like these are consumed by millions of people worldwide in comic books and graphic novels. But these particular ones were on the walls of San Francisco’s de Young Museum as part of “The Art of Manga,” the first North American museum exhibition dedicated entirely to the form. The exhibit arrives at a moment when manga has finally come to be regarded as a prominent part of mainstream culture, even outside of its native Japan. One of the top-grossing movies in America in September was the anime film “ Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle ,” based on a popular manga series. Many of the anime series that have become international streaming hits are based on manga titles. It is a phenomenon right now, but it’s even more than that. When Nicole Coolidge Rousmaniere, the curator of the de Young exhibit, sees manga, she sees where storytelling forms are leading. “I think that’s the future,” she told me during an advance preview of the exhibit. It might very well be. Manga has proved to be an influential force across culture as not just art and literature, but also as a mirror to contemporary trends and politics. It’s a kind of art that has stood the test of time and is only increasing its cultural relevance. The term “manga” — its translation is “pictures run riot” — first appeared in Japan in the late-18th century, but what people have defined as manga has changed across the centuries. The simplest definition would be that they are Japanese comics, a combination of text and image, that employ a specific visual vocabulary — a “transdiegetic” vocabulary, as Eike Exner calls it in his recent book “Manga: A New History of Japanese Comics.” Despite its long history, only in the last few decades has it started to be seen as a form with cultural history and value. Studies show that reading is trending lower in our age of social media, artificial intelligence and relentless digital distractions, but the popularity of manga has been growing across the globe, appealing to readers of different ages and backgrounds. The “Art of Manga” exhibit prominently features several artists who represent a variety of different styles and subject matter that show how manga crosses countless genres. The most popular titles are often longform narrative stories like “Naruto,” “Bleach,” “One Piece” and “Demon Slayer.” These are epic tales of underdog protagonists questing, adventuring, traveling this world or to other worlds, gaining new abilities along the way. There are gradually ascending boss battles and myriad side characters. There’s often cool outfits, power-ups and odd, gravity-defying hair. While the covers of these comics are in vivid color, the inner pages are in black-and-white, written in Japanese (or in translation), and read right to left and top to bottom. Even a manga novice would be able to identify the components of its extended vocabulary: exaggerated expressions, motion lines, pain stars, phonetic humor in the text. They all work together to help readers understand the action in more ways than through just words alone. “Akira” and “Astro Boy” are manga that helped shape the broader genres of sci-fi and cyberpunk across literature, TV and film. Some of the most memorable images of grotesque, visceral terrors come from the horror manga of Junji Ito, including “Uzumaki” and “Tomie.” But manga can just as flawlessly depict the charms and hiccups of everyday life. Jiro Taniguichi’s highly detailed “The Solitary Gourmet,” which appears in the exhibit, follows a traveling salesman as he searches for new restaurants and cuisine, and features real Japanese foods and locales. Many of these popular manga series have been adapted into beloved TV shows, expanding those franchises’ already extensive fan bases. One of the most memorable images in the exhibit is a drawing of a boxer hunched over, eyes closed, and smiling in a corner of a ring. The paper itself is torn and taped over — a far cry from a pristine canvas — and yet the illustration still seems to command the room. Rousmaniere calls it perhaps the most important page in manga history. The page is from Tetsuya Chiba’s popular work “Ashita no Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow,” a sports manga about a poor, young orphan named Joe Yabuki who finds purpose through boxing. It had great resonance with the working class in postwar Japan. In fact, the radical group the Japanese Red Army even adopted the slogan “We are Tomorrow’s Joe,” referring to the manga, during a 1970 plane hijacking . This wasn’t the first or last time manga fans interpreted their favorite works through the lens of politics. Just as Joe Yabuki became a symbol of resilience across Japan, similarly today the pirate flag from Eiichiro Oda’s “One Piece,” the best-selling manga in history, has been taken up by Gen Z protesters across Asia , in Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines. And several manga artists have been instrumental in bringing L.G.B.T.Q. visibility to mainstream Japan through their work. The award-winning series “My Brother’s Husband,” by renowned erotic manga artist Gengoroh Tagame, also featured in the exhibit, became a significant text in a culture where queer sexuality was not often discussed and certainly not very visible within the media. The story addressed homophobia, bigotry and grief, and was adapted into a live-action TV drama in 2018. But beyond the history, storytelling and cultural weight of manga, there’s the actual artistry — the very reason pages of manga illustrations have found their way onto the walls of a museum like the de Young. “This deserves to be in any art museum,” Rousmaniere said of the wild illustrations and paintings of Hirohiko Araki, best known for his popular long-running shonen series “JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure.” Heavily inspired by the sculptures of Michelangelo, Araki’s manga is remarkably geometric, his characters’ faces and bodies recalling the chiseled detail work and silhouettes of Italian sculptures. They’re larger than life and pulsing with drama, and even in the black-and-white pages of the comics, each of his characters wields an arresting stare that seems to pierce the fourth wall and attack the reader. And it’s not just the characters’ static poses, but also the way Araki moves them through space — or, rather, how he moves the space around them — that gives his work that extra spark of imagination. In one image from the exhibit, a character climbs out from a zipper that has opened a rift in space, as though the solid walls around him were just as easily manipulated as fabric. “Dali would be very happy to see these,” Rousmaniere said, admiring Araki’s panels. “It’s playing with space, perception, movement.” Manga in general is an art style that takes advantage of the limits of the frame, using the tension between the images and the blank spaces around them and pushing perspective to create a dynamic, immersive feel. In one “One Piece” panel from “Art of Manga,” the skilled swordsman-pirate Roronoa Zoro crouches in the forefront of the image, having just drawn his weapons. The illustration’s perspective is from the ground up, so Zoro towers overhead while his opponent falls to his knees in the background, seen from the gap between Zoro’s legs. The white page around Zoro and his opponent contains occasional splatters of blood, so there’s a sense of violence, evidence of the act, while the image focuses on the calm, steady exterior of the victor. “One Piece” is one of the more prominently featured series in the exhibit; one room breaks down the manga production process, using the series as an example. The walls of the room are plastered with every page of “One Piece” just past the 100th issue, to show the evolution of the pirate story. And yet “One Piece” also serves as an example of manga’s reach beyond the page; the anime adaptation of the series premiered in 1999, has run for over 1,100 episodes and is still ongoing. In 2023, Netflix released a well-received live-action adaptation of “One Piece,” the second season of which is due next year. And across the globe the series has also inspired animated films, card games, video games, live stage shows and immersive experiences. The world of “One Piece” continues to expand nearly three decades after Oda first began publishing the black-and-white tale of the Straw Hat Pirates in print. As more manga characters can be found everywhere from 4D movie theater screens to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, this exhibition is a welcome reminder that it’s still an art form with humble roots. Images and speech bubbles, boldfaced exclamations: Manga has always been art that one can borrow or buy and take with them. And the “Art of Manga” shows just how much these comics have always had to offer — and will continue to offer fans in the future.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/arts/manga-exhibition-de-young.html,Culture,BBC,By Maya Phillips,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11cul-manga-qcjk/11cul-manga-qcjk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:01:23+00:00,0fe43699293ce7ea41d7fdd19fa05cf0569f1f59

And real storms, big 12-, 14-, 15-foot waves. Having to buckle into the mast, full rain gear. Dangerous. That was certainly a pivotal experience for me as a young man, and the culmination of my reverence for the ocean. Barefoot in the Grass I love to be in nature and particularly I love to be barefoot.

30241c8deace,In the Wake of the Edmund Fitzgerald,"shipwrecks, the gales of november, music, books, gordon lightfoot, john u bacon","On a perfect blue-sky day in late July, the SS Wilfred Sykes was on northern Lake Michigan, approaching the pristine shore of Wisconsin’s Door County peninsula. It gave a horn blast, shimmied through a narrow canal and soon was gliding placidly past the raised bridges and marinas of Sturgeon Bay. Then, suddenly, a faint strain came floating up from a passing pleasure boat. A keening guitar line. A stoic beat. And that rich baritone relating the familiar tale of a mighty ship loaded with iron ore, a captain “well seasoned,” the gales of November and 29 men lost in the ice-water depths of Lake Superior. New England has “Moby-Dick.” The Mississippi has Mark Twain. And the Great Lakes have “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.” Or so it can seem to those who grew up on Gordon Lightfoot’s 1976 folk-rock shanty, a surprise hit that has had a long afterlife not just on the airwaves, but also through bumper stickers , beer labels , Lego kits and memes . Many who hear the song, with its opening invocation of Chippewa legend, assume it’s about a 19th-century shipwreck, or perhaps a fictional one. But it was a real disaster and one much closer to our own time. It happened on the evening of Nov. 10, 1975, when the Fitzgerald, one of the biggest and most modern freighters on the lakes, lost contact during a sudden ferocious storm and then vanished beneath the waves. Today, the Fitz, as many call it, is a touchstone of regional identity and tourism around the Great Lakes, where the 50th anniversary of the wreck will be commemorated in multiple locations next month. It’s a kind of Midwest Titanic — the largest of the more than 6,000 ships swallowed by the lakes over the centuries. But it’s also a disaster with no survivors and no obvious iceberg, which has inspired a long string of books, articles, documentaries and online debates about exactly why and how the celebrated steamer sank. I was on the Sykes with John U. Bacon, the author of the newest entry, “The Gales of November: The Untold Story of the Edmund Fitzgerald.” The book, drawn from extensive interviews and archival research, considers various theories. But Bacon deliberately avoids what he calls a “whodunit” approach. “Yes, I wanted to find out what happened, but I wanted to find out about the 29 people on the boat,” he said. “Who were they? What were their lives like? I wanted to return them to their full-fledged humanity, instead of just being victims.” For Bacon, a veteran journalist from Ann Arbor, Mich., the “untold story” is also the beauty, danger and sheer scale of the lakes. “Why was I surprised to learn the five Great Lakes are bigger than all New England, plus the state of New York?” he said. “I grew up on these lakes, and I did not know that.” In the Fitz’s day, there were more than 300 Great Lakes freighters on the water. Today, they are fewer than half that, including the Sykes, which I rode for a week across nearly 1,000 miles and three lakes, to see how the reality of Great Lakes shipping intersects with the mythology of its most famous wreck. The Sykes, which turned 75 last year, is one of only a half-dozen steam-powered lake freighters remaining. For Fitz fanatics, it’s also what Bacon calls a V.I.B. — a Very Important Boat. It loaded up alongside the Fitz at an iron ore dock outside Duluth, Minn., on the unseasonably warm and sunny afternoon of Nov. 9, 1975, and was hit by the same sudden storm, with winds that whipped as much as 100 miles an hour. And after the Fitz vanished from the radar, the Sykes joined the search effort. Today, the 678-foot Sykes offers one of the closest approximations to the Fitz and, for passengers, a surprisingly comfortable ride. It’s a throwback not just in the engine room, but also in the guest quarters, a midcentury-modern time capsule from the heyday of the American steel industry, when shipping companies regularly wined and dined executives and their wives. The bulky stereo cabinet in the lounge still holds 8-tracks of Guy Lombardo and Mantovani. There’s also a buzzer, sadly defunct, for summoning another martini. These days, the boat is dry, and the occasional guests eat — very well — in the galley with the crew. The current kings of the Great Lakes are the newer 1,000-footers , introduced in the 1970s and ’80s. But the Sykes, with its elegant curves and distinctive front pilot house, is beloved by both boat nerds and the mariners who keep it humming. “It’s a privilege to sail on a boat like this,” said Billy Geoffroy, the boatswain, or head of the deck crew. “You can ride on the footers all day. But there ain’t nothing like an old steamer.” In Fitz Country In the spring and from late fall into early January, the Sykes hauls pelletized iron ore from mines around Lake Superior. Summer is limestone season, with runs between huge quarries in northern Michigan and steel mills along the lower lakes. Bacon and I boarded early on a Monday morning in Burns Harbor, Ind., near Chicago. The plan was to sail up Lake Michigan and pass through the straits of Mackinac, loading up at two quarries. Then we would head down Lake Huron — as the Fitz would have — and across Lake Erie to Cleveland. Great Lakes freighters are long and skinny, designed to maximize loads while being able to pass through rivers and locks. As we waited to set off, Bacon stood at one end of the deck and described how 30-foot waves would have swept across it during the storm that sunk the Fitz. That all seemed very far away as we steamed up Lake Michigan, nothing but sunshine and calm, cobalt-blue water. But an unexpected layover in Sturgeon Bay gave us a chance for an overnight road trip five hours north to the western edge of Lake Superior, where the Fitz began its fateful voyage. Duluth, Minn., with its sister city of Superior, Wis., is one of the largest inland ports in the world, and, at 2,300 miles from the Atlantic via the St. Lawrence Seaway, the farthest accessible to oceangoing vessels. It’s also Fitz country, where you’ll find tributes in parks, restaurants, bars and the local Best Western, where a 10-foot scale model of the boat looms near the swimming pool. At Split Rock Lighthouse, about 50 miles from Duluth on Superior’s northern shore, Hayes Scriven, the site’s manager, walked us to the edge of the 130-foot cliffs. Next month, nearly 2,000 people are expected to gather there for the annual commemorative lighting of the beacon. Scriven estimates that 75 percent of annual visitors to the lighthouse arrive already knowing about the Fitz. “About once a week, I’ll find someone up here playing the song on their phone,” he said. Among locals, however, thoughts about the song vary. “A lot of people up here will say they’re sick of it,” said Tom Byrnes, a retired bartender, told us during a stop at the town bar in nearby Silver Bay, a regular watering hole for crew members on the Fitz. “It was pretty cool for a while, but it’s gloomy and doomy and it just goes on and on and on.” Byrnes was a few months out of high school and working at the bar on Nov. 10, 1975, when someone came in from the driving rain to say the Fitz was in trouble. He compared it to his school principal announcing that President Kennedy had been shot. “It was just one of them days you remember,” Byrnes said. Bacon, whose 13 previous books include one about a 1917 maritime explosion that killed nearly 2,000 people in Halifax, Nova Scotia, spent almost four years researching and writing “The Gales of November,” He tracked down and interviewed more than 100 people, including some family members and others connected with the crew who had never talked about their experiences with a writer. The book includes a dramatic reconstruction of the storm, based in part on recent high-tech research. One computer model drawing on historic weather data, shows how frigid air coming down from Canada collided with storm system coming from the southwest, creating hurricane-like conditions that turned the water “from calm to ferocious in just minutes,” as Bacon writes, with waves that may have spiked to more than 50 feet. The wreck prompted multiple investigations and lawsuits. But it was Lightfoot’s song, which hit No. 2 on the Billboard charts , that drove it deep into cultural memory. Bacon interviewed the journalist who wrote the short Newsweek article that inspired Lightfoot and gave him some of the song’s phrases and beats, from the opening invocation of Chippewa and “the big lake they called Gitche Gumee” to the winds that came “slashing” to the church bell that rang 29 times at Mariners Church in Detroit. Bacon also talked with two musicians who played on the song. The song was recorded in one take — which also happened to be the first time Lightfoot (who died in 2023) had ever played it with a band. Bacon was relieved to learn that Lightfoot was a stand-up guy, who formed close relationships with family members. When Jimmy Fallon wanted to use the song for a comedy routine, he said no. And when performing the song live, Lightfoot changed some lyrics, like one about the main hatch “caving in” that echoed a theory (later disproved) that the crew had failed to properly clamp it. “Gord really wanted the families to have peace,” Rick Haynes, the bassist, told Bacon. The shipping company, Oglebay Norton, was another story. Initially, Bacon writes, it offered victims’ families only their final paycheck, plus $750 for personal effects. And when Bacon went searching for the archives of the company (which went bankrupt in 2004), he learned that the boxes relating to the Fitz had gone missing. “How is that not fishy?” he said. Bacon, for his part, avoids definite conclusions about the wreck. He paraphrased the mother of Bruce Hudson, a 20-year-old deckhand from Cleveland who, along with the rest of the crew, still rests 530 feet below the surface of the lake: “Thirty know, 29 men and God. And nobody’s talking.” A Floating Antique After we got back to Sturgeon Bay, the Sykes resumed its journey, steaming toward the northern reaches of Lake Michigan, past forested islands ringed with beaches and no sign of habitation beyond the occasional lighthouse. There were no icy winds blasting in from Canada, just wildfire smoke, which turned the sun into a reddish orb. At twilight, we passed under the Mackinac Bridge, which connects the upper and lower peninsulas of Michigan, one of the longest suspension bridges in the Western Hemisphere. On the rear top deck, a deckhand played the beat-up boat guitar. In the pilot house, the Butthole Surfers came on the satellite radio. Around 2 a.m., we reached Drummond Island, near the Canadian border, where we would pick up half a load of dolomite limestone the next morning. Geoffroy and Sean Erhardt, the second mate, prepared to drop the anchor. “Get ready for seven seconds of controlled violence,” Geoffroy said, passing out earplugs. In the late 1960s, the Fitz was known for its “D.J. Captain,” Peter Pulcer, who liked to announce baseball scores, play Mozart and tell stories over the ship’s loudspeaker when passing through rivers and locks. Those days are long gone, but in populated areas, boats like the Sykes can still draw a crowd . “This is one of the only jobs where people like to watch you work,” Erhardt said. “You don’t get that at McDonald’s.” Tom Wiater, the president of Central Marine Logistics, which operates the Sykes, grew up in Detroit, where he was fascinated by lore of the sea, and not eager for a life of holdups at the family liquor store. After graduating from the Great Lakes Maritime Academy in Traverse City, Mich., he started on the Sykes as a deckhand. “Today, when I come aboard the boat, the faces are different,” Wiater said. “But the personalities and the sounds and the vibe is the same.” Wiater is a passionate advocate for the old steamers, and the history they represent. In the pilot house, he explained the mixture of old and new navigational tools: paper charts and the original brass Chadburn (the telegraph system used to send speed instructions back to the engine room), alongside GPS and electronic charting systems. The Sykes “is a floating, operating antique,” he said. “And it wouldn’t be running without the dedication of everyone involved.” The Fitz disaster, which ushered in widespread safety reforms, was the last major shipwreck on the lakes. For today’s sailors, it stands as a symbol of the inherent dangers of the job. Erhardt recalled how at his graduation from the maritime academy, the cadets all sang “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” at karaoke. But on our trip, a passenger who started singing a line in a jokey voice one afternoon was shushed. Talk turned, and not for the first time, to “the blackout”: an incident last January, on one of the last runs of the season, when the Sykes lost power on Lake Superior, not far from where the Fitz went down. The emergency lights came on, but the boat was left with limited controls (and no heat). A cellphone video shows it rocking in big swells, the deck full of snow, as a crew member swore like, well, a sailor. Another ship arrived and lashed itself to the Sykes lengthwise, towing it into a cove for safety. And now it’s just another story. “A good sea story is one where everyone survives, but it was terrifying going through it,” Mike Helmer, a mate’s assistant from Mackinac City, Mich., said. Lake Huron Rolls Today, both shipping and shipwreck tourism are big business on the lakes. After we loaded at Drummond and headed to another quarry, Wiater pointed out remnants of rusted wrecks poking up above shallows in the DeTour Passage, one of more than a dozen diving preserves in Michigan waters, encompassing some 2,300 square miles and 200 wrecks. We picked up more stone at Calcite, an open-pit quarry covering more than 8,000 acres near Rogers City, Mich., so big it’s visible from space . And then we were headed, as the song puts it, fully loaded for Cleveland. (The Fitz was actually headed to less rhyme-friendly Detroit.) As we headed down Lake Huron, Saturday night steaks as big as your face were grilling on deck. Down in the engine room, where it was hotter than 100 degrees, Al Oswald, a Navy veteran with an exotic New Jersey accent, pointed out a faint breeze coming from one corner. “You have to live like a cat,” he said. “You find the warm spots in winter and the cool spots in summer.” After sunset, we entered the St. Clair River. Around 3 a.m., just south of Detroit, we passed the now-closed steel mill at Zug Island , where the Fitz would have unloaded, and crew might have stopped at some of the more memorable sailor bars described in Bacon’s book. (“The Honey Bee was for country alcoholics,” one retired sailor recalled, “and the Hinky-Dink was for psychotic alcoholics.”) On Sunday morning, a week after leaving Burns Harbor, we entered Lake Erie and headed to the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, where the crew would navigate 13 tricky turns through downtown Cleveland. The captain, Mike Grzesiek, who started 30 years ago on the Sykes washing dishes, plans to retire next year. During the trip, he had been a man of few words. But after breakfast on our last full day, he talked about the merits of various boats he has worked on, the ups and downs of the industry, and his matter-of-fact approach to weathering storms that had left more panic-prone mariners “curled up in a ball.” “You just deal with it, and get through it,” Grzesiek said. He laughed. “But you know, looking back, nothing’s ever been that bad.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/arts/edmund-fitzgerald-gordon-lightfoot.html,Culture,BBC,By Jennifer Schuessler and Erinn Springer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/01/-xx-CUL-FITZGERALD-WRECK--63102-cover/-xx-CUL-FITZGERALD-WRECK--63102-cover-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-10T09:01:02+00:00,4a86e52a42df5b6a40ecbbb13acc8aa39f1c8c19
22522742e9dc,Allison Janney and Bradley Whitford Just Can’t Quit the White House,"tv, the diplomat, allison janney, bradley whitford, debora cahn, netflix","While Bradley Whitford and Allison Janney were shooting a scene for the new season of “The Diplomat,” the hectic Netflix drama of political intrigue, Whitford had a revelation. “We have no range,” he told her. Janney agreed with him. “We have been arguing in fake government buildings for over 20 years,” she said. Janney, a seven-time Emmy winner, and Whitford, not so shabby with three, met in 1999, in an ersatz version of the White House’s Roosevelt Room. The occasion was a table read for “The West Wing,” the NBC political drama created by Aaron Sorkin. Janney played C.J. Cregg, the president’s press secretary; Whitford was Josh Lyman, the deputy chief of staff. Cast as colleagues, they became friends and have remained so. After “The West Wing” ended in 2006, she guested on his NBC series, “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.” He guested on her CBS sitcom, “Mom.” But they had never had another chance to play opposite each other for long until “The Diplomat.” Janney joined the show in Season 2, playing Grace Penn, a steely vice president unexpectedly elevated to the presidency. For Season 3, Debora Cahn, the creator of “The Diplomat” and a former writer on “The West Wing,” decided to add Todd Penn, Grace’s husband, to the scheme-heavy mix. She immediately thought of Whitford, then rejected the thought as silly. “I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Aaron Sorkin, but we’re not looking to be a tribute band,” she said of “The Diplomat” during a recent video call. “We want the show to have its own identity.” Still, the thought persisted, and soon enough Whitford was on set. “It was [expletive] delicious,” Cahn said of watching him with Janney. Janney thought so. “It makes my heart happy to be around him,” she said. She was sitting by Whitford’s side on a recent morning, in a conference room, a few weeks before the Oct. 16 premiere of Season 3 of “The Diplomat.” She had her feet up. He was slouching in a rumpled suit jacket. They looked the part — old friends, delighted that a volatile industry had brought them together again. On the show, their relationship is uneasy and Todd, whose career has been derailed by financial malfeasance, is patently jealous of Grace. (At one point Todd introduces himself as, “an increasingly insignificant house husband married to a supernova.”) But during a scene in which they were arguing, Whitford found it difficult to find that rancor. “Hopefully when you’re acting, you’re thinking thoughts that correspond to the scene,” he said. “I was just totally out of it, thinking, ‘Oh my God, I get to act with Allison again.’” He’ll have other chances: “The Diplomat” has already been renewed for a fourth season, and Janney and Whitford have been promoted to series regulars. In an affectionate hourlong video chat, they discussed relationships, politics and how it feels to play their first sex scene. (Political shows make strange — and very funny — bedfellows.) These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How would you describe Josh and C.J.’s relationship? ALLISON JANNEY Combative. Loving. BRADLEY WHITFORD Siblings. JANNEY They’re on the same team. They’re working together. They love each other. They exhaust each other. It’s siblings. Siblings in the White House. WHITFORD Actors’ lives are episodic, you’re in these very intense, short-lived relationships with people. “The West Wing” thing was so intense and really familial. JANNEY We really spent more time with each other than I ever did with my family. Did you keep in touch once the show ended? JANNEY We have private texts, we also have a big “West Wing” group chain that we’re on. There’s some really funny texts in there, especially between [ the actor Joshua Malina ] and Brad. They have a notorious hate thing going on. WHITFORD A mutual castigation competition. Allison, you came on to “The Diplomat” in Season 2. When did you learn that Bradley would join as your husband? JANNEY Debora texted me. She asked me how I would feel about that. I didn’t even have to think: I was, like, “Yes, that makes absolute sense. It would be the best casting ever.” Did you worry that it would make “The Diplomat” feel, to use Debora’s words, like a “West Wing” tribute band? JANNEY I didn’t. The relationship is different. We’re different. Maybe when first people hear the casting, they’re like, Oh my God. But then when they see the show, they won’t be thinking of C.J. and Josh. There’s very little in the script about the Penn marriage. Did you have to have a conversation where you worked out their back story? JANNEY I went with what was on the page. The back story that we have together was enough for me. The weight of a relationship that’s been there, that’s all I needed. I’m not a fan of back stories anyway. They don’t help me as an actor. WHITFORD There is a freedom in that. It was really fun playing these scenes. Look, it’s a really challenging, interesting time to be in a show about a female American president. JANNEY We filmed the scene where I was sworn in soon after the election results. It was one of the saddest, most moving days, everyone was sobbing as I was being sworn in. Do they have a good marriage? JANNEY Like any marriage that is a long marriage and is now complicated by these new power structures, it’s difficult. You want to be in it and work through it, but it’s not easy. I mean, hell, I’ve never been married before, but I’ve been in long-term relationships. There are a lot of compromises. It’s never 50-50. I think Grace loves being in this position. She knows it’s going to be difficult with him. She’s frustrated that he’s being a little pouty bitch, but these two really love each other. They can bicker and argue, but they’re there for each other. WHITFORD [Deadpan] I have never personally struggled with relationships. I think they do have a good marriage. I loved how impossible he was, irritating her, trying to protect her. I found those things true of a balance in a relationship, especially under pressure where someone’s fulfillment professionally can make the other person insecure. I love his insecurity, because there’s a bite to him. This guy is snarky and wronged, tender and jealous. The contradictions are what make it fun. What’s it like to play opposite each other now? What’s changed? WHITFORD Well, the color of my hair. JANNEY He keeps getting better looking. It’s annoying! WHITFORD Men get celebrated. But it feels like home. It feels comfortable. JANNEY Like putting on an old comfortable shirt. Was this your first sex scene together? JANNEY It was. I was so freaked out. I was like, I can’t believe I’m having sex with Brad. He’s like my brother. Not that he isn’t incredibly sexy. But it made me really nervous. I said, “Brad, you’ve got to help me with my stomach. My stomach’s not great.” And then he just made it fun. It didn’t turn out to be awkward at all. I was like, I could do this all day. Were you disappointed that you weren’t in more scenes together? WHITFORD Part of the problem was I was still working on [the Hulu series] “Handmaid’s Tale.” JANNEY I was working on [the Apple TV+ series] “Palm Royale.” WHITFORD We drove them nuts. JANNEY Logistically, it was a nightmare. I was flying back and forth doing both shows, New York, L.A., New York, L.A. Well, you’ll have more scenes in Season 4. What would you like to see? JANNEY More messy things in both the personal relationship and the work, a perfect storm of crazy, crazy stuff happening on both sides of the bed and podium. WHITFORD We have both been blessed beyond our wildest dreams by letting brilliant writers write. I’m not in the writers’ room going, “Here are my notes.” But if you did have notes, what would you want for Todd?

As we see in the Guggenheim show, his paintings from the ’90s, by which time he was using digital technology to transfer photographs, can feel overly familiar. As the years passed, his work did not turn reflective or introspective. But I’m not sure that Rauschenberg would regard this as a criticism. He was totally American in his devotion to the possibilities of the present moment, and remarkably free of grievance or depression. He remains a celebrated figure in the 21st century because he gave license to succeeding generations of young artists to think about art in a new way, not as an expression of draftsmanly skill or inner torment, but rather as a playful process that begins when you pause to notice the concrete things that fill this world, words included.

da29f1d53d49,The French Revolution’s Instrument of Terror Goes on Show,"museum, capital punishment, mucem, pantheon, robert badinter, marseille, paris france","During the French Revolution, executions by guillotine were a gruesome public spectacle, and an estimated 17,000 people lost their heads during its Reign of Terror phase from 1793 to 1794. Yet the use of what became known as the “national razor” isn’t just a distant memory. Its curtain call in France was actually in 1977, when Hamida Djandoubi , a Tunisian man convicted of murder, was executed in Marseille. Now, just seven miles away, a guillotine is being showcased at the city’s most prominent museum — in the same week that Robert Badinter, a lawyer and justice minister who persuaded France to abolish the death penalty in 1981, was inducted into the Panthéon, Paris’s illustrious burial place for French notables. The two public displays are reminders of justice in France — then and now. “Robert Badinter wanted the public, long after abolition, to be able to face up to this machine that cut men in two,” said Pierre-Olivier Costa, the president of the Museum of the Civilizations of Europe and the Mediterranean, known as Mucem , where the guillotine is on display through April. When Badinter entered the Panthéon on Thursday, the law’s 44th anniversary, he became the 83rd person to be inducted there. His coffin joins the likes of Marie Curie and Victor Hugo, who, incidentally, wrote the anti-capital punishment novel “Le Dernier Jour d’un Condamné” (“Last Day of a Condemned Man”). Mucem is paying its own homage to Badinter’s crusade by putting the guillotine in the spotlight. Set in a circular gallery on the museum’s first floor, the wood and metal decapitation machine towers over museum-goers at nearly 15 feet high. I am struck by the Angel-of-Death-like shadow of its 88-pound blade on the wall behind it. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Its exterior was all black with large pictures of Black actors and the words “ Harlem Stage Presents FREEDOM RIDERS .” The bus transported 63 people, including the actors, musicians and production team for “Freedom Riders,” a theatrical concert featuring monologues about law enforcement harassment and violence endured by Black people mostly going about their everyday business. After the show’s tour through the South, a limited run begins this week at Harlem Stage . The troupe played at Montgomery’s Alabama First Baptist Church, one of the nation’s oldest Black houses of worship and a gathering place for Ralph Abernathy and others during the civil rights movement and bus boycott. They received applause at Atlanta University Center, the consortium for four historically Black colleges and universities that incubated generations of students. They filled seats at Greensboro’s Harrison Auditorium on North Carolina A&T State University’s campus, near the Woolworth building where the sit-ins of 1960 helped begin the civil rights movement. “Our history is rooted in this very journey,” said Indira Etwaroo, Harlem Stage’s chief executive and artistic director.

d51b0568ac05,"John Searle, Philosopher Who Wrestled With A.I., Dies at 93","john r. searle, obituary, philosophy, artificial intelligence, college, sexual harassment, metoo movement, university of california, berkeley, new york review of books","John R. Searle, an uncompromising and wide-ranging philosopher who was best known for a thought experiment he formulated, decades before the rise of ChatGPT, to disprove that a computer program by itself could ever achieve consciousness, died on Sept. 16 in Safety Harbor, Fla., west of Tampa. He was 93. His son Tom confirmed the death, in a hospital, adding that Professor Searle’s health had declined since a bout with coronavirus last year. Professor Searle, who taught at the University of California, Berkeley, for 60 years, was the rare philosopher who could proudly declare, “I’m not subtle.” He brought ironic humor and bluntness to subjects as diverse as the politics of higher education, the nature of consciousness and the merits of textual deconstruction as a philosophical style. In a 1999 profile, The Los Angeles Times called him “the Sugar Ray Robinson of philosophers,” after the boxer who fought in different weight classes. Professor Searle’s most prominent intellectual battleground was The New York Review of Books, to which he contributed from 1972 to 2014. It was where he labeled one book, by the esteemed philosopher David J. Chalmers, “a mass of confusions.” In a debate on another subject — the argument that computer programs function like minds — he described his aim as “the relentless exposure of its preposterousness.” His thinking about artificial intelligence became widely known thanks to an article he wrote in The Review: a takedown of a book of essays in which, remarkably, his own work appeared. Another piece of his inspired “The Hard Problem,” a 2015 play by Tom Stoppard, who thanked Professor Searle in a foreword to the script. At least 15 books by other authors have been devoted to Professor Searle’s work and its critics. Informed once that the listing of an introductory philosophy course featured pictures of René Descartes, David Hume and himself, Professor Searle replied , “Who are those other two guys?” Not everyone was charmed. Critics often complained about, as one antagonist put it , “his pretense that difficult issues are easy.” The philosopher Daniel C. Dennett told The Los Angeles Times, “He just can’t take the other side seriously enough to see what they are saying.” Professor Searle accused Jacques Derrida of “deliberate obscurantism”; Professor Derrida called him “serenely dogmatic.” Professor Searle did stick fiercely to his positions, but he was also thrilled by hard problems. He spent decades writing about the nature of consciousness. “What you’ve got in your skull is about a kilogram and a half, three pounds of this gook,” he told Harry Kreisler, the host of the U.C. Berkeley interview series “Conversations With History.” “How can that have all these thoughts and feelings and anxieties and aspirations? How can all of the variety of our conscious life be produced by this squishy stuff blasting away at the synapses?” Professor Searle sought to solve the long-running debate over the division between the mind and the body by dispensing with the duality altogether. He argued that mental experiences like pain, ecstasy and drunkenness were all neurobiological phenomena, caused by firing neurons. Consciousness is not, he said, a separate substance of its own: It is a state the brain is in, like liquidity is the state of the molecules in a glass of water. That view underpinned his thought experiment about what he called “the Chinese room,” which he made the centerpiece of provocative articles in the early 1980s that interpreted nascent research into artificial intelligence. Suppose, Professor Searle wrote , that he, who did not know a word of Chinese, was locked in a room with boxes full of documents in Chinese script as well as a rulebook, in English, explaining how to match the various Chinese symbols together. It does not teach Chinese; it just says, in effect, “squiggle-squiggle” goes with “squoggle-squoggle.” People outside the room pass more Chinese documents inside, and Professor Searle sends other documents back, following the rulebook’s instructions. The people passing him documents call them “questions.” The symbols he gives back they call “answers.” The rulebook they call “the program.” And Professor Searle they call “the computer.” That situation is equivalent to the workings of A.I., he said. Both involve manipulating formal symbols to simulate understanding. “No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down,” Professor Searle wrote in his first paper on the subject, published in 1980. “Why on earth would anyone suppose that a computer simulation of understanding actually understood anything?” Professor Searle concluded that psychological states could never be attributed to computer programs, and that it was wrong to compare the brain to hardware or the mind to software. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , an internet reference source, the Searle thought experiment “has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear since the Turing Test,” the mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing’s 1950 procedure for determining machine intelligence. Nevertheless, some comments of Professor Searle’s read differently in the current era of newly advanced A.I. In a 2014 New York Review article , he argued that “superintelligent computers rising up and killing us, all by themselves, is not a real danger,” because A.I. has “no intelligence, no motivation, no autonomy and no agency.” But could A.I. lack consciousness, as Professor Searle argued, while still exhibiting autonomy or agency? In June, the A.I. firm Anthropic released a report describing “agentic misalignment”: the tendency, in testing, of models from every major A.I. developer to engage in blackmail or worse when their goals or existence seem threatened. We will never know what Professor Searle’s biting rejoinder to the word “agentic” would have been. A sexual-harassment scandal ended his public career shortly before A.I.’s recent breakthroughs. John Rogers Searle was born in Denver on July 31, 1932. His mother, Hester (Beck) Searle, was a pediatric doctor. His father, George, was an electrical engineer and executive at AT&T. At 19, Mr. Searle earned a Rhodes scholarship and transferred from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, to the University of Oxford in England, where he received bachelor’s and master’s degrees as well as a doctorate in philosophy. In 1958, he married a fellow young philosopher, Dagmar Carboch. She later worked as a lawyer and closely edited her husband’s work. Nearly every book he wrote bears a page that reads, “For Dagmar.” Professor Searle joined the Berkeley philosophy department in 1959. He was an early supporter of the campus protests of the 1960s but soon turned against student radicals, determining that their “moral outrage” was “essentially a middle-class luxury,” as he later told Mr. Kreisler of Berkeley. In 2016, Professor Searle was granted his own campus institute, the John Searle Center for Social Ontology. The next year, an article in BuzzFeed reported on a lawsuit filed against him by a Searle Center research assistant, who said he had sexually harassed and assaulted her. A subsequent BuzzFeed piece recounted a number of other complaints made by female students against him. A lawyer representing Professor Searle told BuzzFeed that he denied his research assistant’s claims and that “any and all” previous allegations had been handled “appropriately” by Berkeley. The episode, which preceded the #MeToo movement by about seven months, came to be seen by many in philosophy as a call for needed changes in the discipline’s culture. A petition started by a Berkeley alumna demanding that Professor Searle lose his emeritus professorship garnered tens of thousands of signatures. The Searle Center quickly closed. The lawsuit against Professor Searle was settled in 2018. The next year, Berkeley announced that he would be stripped of his emeritus status, following a determination that he had violated university policies against sexual harassment and retaliation in the case involving his former research assistant. The statement did not mention other incidents. After Professor Searle’s death, Jennifer Hudin, the former director of the Searle Center, stated publicly that she had faced related accusations, but that both she and Professor Searle were innocent of all charges. A spokeswoman for Berkeley declined to comment on the post. Professor Searle’s wife died in 2017. In addition to his son Tom, he is survived by another son, Mark; a half sister, Melanie Searle; a granddaughter; a step-granddaughter; and a great-granddaughter. Professor Searle often said that “self-confidence” was necessary for philosophical argumentation, and for universities to uphold scholarly elitism as their mission. In one 1990 article on the subject for The New York Review, he wrote proudly of an intellectual buccaneer among his forebears who had “set out on his horse for what was then Indian Territory, carrying Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’ and the Bible in his saddle bags.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/books/john-searle-dead.html,Culture,BBC,By Alex Traub,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Searle--qpkm/10Searle--qpkm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T19:09:57+00:00,2730bf8967e2268c2179fcab80d7174c363fa751
23971b9be67c,Diane Keaton Was the Definition of a Style Icon,"fashion, oscars, movies, actor, diane keaton, your-feed-fashion","Diane Keaton, the Oscar-winning actress whose death at 79 was revealed this weekend, was one of the last movie stars to arrive in Hollywood before big brands changed the celeb dressing game. She never used a stylist, but came with an aesthetic so clearly and compellingly formed that she shaped fashion, rather than allowing fashion to shape her. As a result, her penchant for men’s suiting, for layers, for turtlenecks and coats as evening wear and accessories — bowler hats, glove, belts, glasses — is as much a part of her legacy as her indelible roles in “Annie Hall” — the film that first introduced the Keaton aesthetic to the world — and “Reds.” And it’s a reminder, in a time when it often seems that movie stars have outsourced their own taste and traded away wardrobe decision-making for financial security in the form of brand ambassadorships, that personal style can be its own powerful currency. Ms. Keaton inspired not just her early director (and one-time boyfriend), Woody Allen, who famously asked Ms. Keaton to dress herself for “Annie Hall,” but also designers such as Ralph Lauren, Jenna Lyons and Thom Browne. It was the impetus for two books from Ms. Keaton herself: the 2014 essay collection, “Let’s Just Say it Wasn’t Pretty” about finding and staying true to your own style, and the 2024 coffee table tome, “Diane Keaton: Fashion First.” Mr. Lauren wrote the introduction for that one, noting “I am often credited with dressing Diane in her Oscar-winning role as Annie Hall. Not so. Annie’s style was Diane’s style.” And when it came to that style, he wrote, it was “not defined by the moment. It’s not about trends. It’s authentic and forever.” It was what people now call a “personal brand,” before anyone thought to categorize it that way. That’s why decades after “Annie Hall,” Ms. Keaton also became a muse for the director Nancy Meyers, the avatar of the “coastal grandma” look, and as recently as last year created an eyewear collaboration with Look Optic. The Keaton aesthetic (let’s call it that) was sourced, at least in the beginning, from Goodwill stores , where her photographer mother used to take Ms. Keaton shopping (a lot of Ms. Keaton’s costumes in “Annie Hall” came from her Goodwill wardrobe), and was rooted in the sort of physical insecurity almost anyone could understand. Ms. Keaton wanted to be Raquel Welch, she wrote in “Fashion First,” but when that clearly wasn’t happening — wrong body, wrong hair — she zeroed in on Cary Grant as a role model and took his dressing axioms to heart. “I had no doubt I could be the person I wanted to be if I applied Cary Grant’s concept that ‘clothes make the man,’” Ms. Keaton wrote in her book of essays. “Or, in my case, ‘clothes make the woman.’” Hence her affinity for ties, for pleated trousers, the occasional vest — clothes that both put Ms. Keaton in the tradition of stars like Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn who refused to conform to gender or social expectations, and covered up what she viewed as her flaws. She wore hats, she said, because she didn’t like her hair. Turtlenecks because they hid the neck and framed her face. And so on. All those layers — even two skirts to the Oscars in 1978, when she won — ironically, gave her freedom because they gave her security. “You could call a good two-thirds of my wardrobe an impenetrable fortress,” she wrote. Her approach to red carpet dressing was effectively the rebuttal to today’s naked dressing trend , though it got just as much attention. Another point worth considering. She never shied away from discussions of fashion, or dismissed the role it played in her life; for her it wasn’t frivolous, it was a deep-rooted part of her identity. Onscreen and off. It wasn’t just about her characters, it was about her own character. Which didn’t mean she couldn’t poke fun at herself and her choices. For her, the faux pas were part of the process. In 2023, she posted a series of photos on Instagram , where she had 2.6 million followers, with the note “Here lies my endless fashion mistakes … May they rest in peace.” She said she admired Joan Rivers, despite Ms. Rivers’s tendency to make her a target for her Fashion Police. She appreciated any women with the courage of her own dressing convictions. Her goal, Ms. Keaton wrote, the whole point of getting dressed, was “finding whatever works for you to get out the door every day.” She found it, and she encouraged other people to find it too by being her own best example. Accordingly, though she often sat front row at shows during fashion week, it was as inspiration, rather than advertisement. Her style wasn’t for sale, and that made it priceless.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/style/diane-keaton-style-icon.html,Culture,BBC,By Vanessa Friedman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12ST-DIANE-KEATON-STYLE-gtjl/12ST-DIANE-KEATON-STYLE-gtjl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T17:30:41+00:00,5f80a93827f0e294ed5d653dc0747dfbc2c76848
c9434786937b,"Susan Griffin, a Leading Voice of Ecofeminism, Is Dead at 82","susan griffin, obituary, books, poetry, environment, women's rights;feminism, writer","Susan Griffin, an influential poet, playwright and prolific feminist author who pioneered a unique form of creative nonfiction, blending propulsive, poetic prose with history, memoir and myth in books like “Woman and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her,” a touchstone of ecofeminism, died on Sep. 30 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 82. The cause was advanced Parkinson’s disease, her friend Nina Wise said. Ms. Griffin’s themes were the pernicious effects of a Western belief system — a patriarchal system, in her view — that explored how capitalism, science, religion and even the porn industry have subjugated the natural world to its detriment and ours, and how that subjugation is a gendered one. Like other feminists of her generation, she saw discrimination and violence against women as akin to the ravaging of the environment, through strip mining, agricultural practices, the clear-cutting of old-growth timber and pollution. Hence the term ecofeminism, of which she was a leading voice. She was also a Berkeley personage, among those who contributed to the city’s intellectual life through their writings, activism, bookstores (like Cody’s Books, a hub for the counterculture and free-speech activists) and restaurants (Alice Waters’s Chez Panisse, among others). Ms. Griffin wrote for Ramparts, the provocative leftist magazine that published Susan Sontag, Angela Davis and Noam Chomsky, and for Scanlan’s Monthly, the even scrappier muckraking periodical that lasted less than a year but managed to irritate President Richard M. Nixon by calling for his impeachment two years before Watergate. For Ramparts, Ms. Griffin wrote a lengthy essay on rape ; for Scanlan’s Monthly, she interviewed women who had had illegal abortions. Ms. Griffin was among the first poets published by Shameless Hussy Press, the upstart — and possibly the country’s first — feminist press run by Alta , a salty poet who was herself a Berkeley fixture. And in 1975, Ms. Griffin won an Emmy Award for “Voices,” a play about the experiences of five women that was presented on public television and later staged around the world. Yet it was “Woman and Nature,” out in 1978 and consistently in print ever since, that made her a feminist rock star. The main theme of Ms. Griffin’s 1978 book,“Woman and Nature,” is the violence that men have perpetrated on the natural world, and on women, and how it would benefit the planet to rethink the more dangerous advances of modernity and technology. Credit... HarperCollins The book almost defies description. Composed as a work of poetic prose, it traces the evolution of the human species, and the roles of men and women, through the creation of the modern world. Ms. Griffin uses all sorts of literary pyrotechnics to embed into this narrative what feels like the entire Western canon, along with many, many other sources, including: texts on agriculture and animal husbandry; data on the number of women burned at the stake as witches in various locales during the 16th century; religious pamphlets and biblical passages; manuals on the proper disposal of nuclear waste; quotes from Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the Marquis de Sade, Sigmund Freud, John Keats, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx and Emily Post; and information on scientific discoveries relating to heat and motion. (The footnotes fascinate.) It is a hypnotic and confounding read. The main theme of “Woman and Nature” is the violence that the male of our species has perpetrated on the natural world, and on women, and how it would benefit everyone, and the planet we inhabit, to rethink the more dangerous advances of modernity and technology. Ms. Griffin dedicated the book to her friend Adrienne Rich , the noted feminist poet, who called “Woman and Nature” “perhaps the most extraordinary nonfiction work to have emerged from the matrix of contemporary female consciousness, a fusion of patriarchal science, ecology, female history and feminism, written by a poet who has created a new form for her vision.” Rebecca Solnit , the feminist author and activist from the generation that followed, said in an interview that Ms. Griffin was “one of the senior public intellectuals of Berkeley.” She added: “I can’t think of anyone else who brought that kind of poetics and visionary quality to writing about intensely political subjects.” Ms. Griffin was very sensual, Ms. Solnit said, citing her 2001 study of the lives of famous courtesans : “She wrote a book about courtesans — and was, in person, this very pretty queer woman who wore silky, vivid clothing. She liked to dress up. Because she’s pigeonholed as a feminist, I don’t think she gets enough credit as a literary stylist, for breaking out of category and genre.” Ms. Griffin’s 1982 book, “Pornography and Silence,” argued that porn was anti-sex and anti-desire, in essence an abnegation of the truly erotic. Credit... Harper Colophon Books In her 1981 book “Pornography and Silence,” Ms. Griffin argued that porn — mechanistic, running on violent tropes — was anti-sex and anti-desire, in essence an abnegation of the truly erotic. “In affirming the fundamental goodness and wholeness of the erotic impulse, and connecting sexual repression with the subjection of women,” Ellen Willis wrote in her review of “Pornography and Silence” for The New York Times in 1981, “Susan Griffin boldly allies her feminism with the cultural revolutionary tradition of William Blake, Emma Goldman, Wilhelm Reich.” “A Chorus of Stones: The Private Life of War” was published in 1992 to critical acclaim, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in general nonfiction the following year. The book is a powerful synthesis of personal and public history, and the ways in which trauma is passed down from generation to generation. Ms. Griffin interwove tales of her own chaotic childhood — a grandfather’s secret sin; her mother’s alcoholism and her father’s denial of it; her father’s sudden death when Ms. Griffin was a teenager — with the personal histories of those who participated in the worst horrors of 20th-century warfare: the pilot who dropped an atomic bomb; a police officer in occupied France; British soldiers playing soccer before the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Ms. Griffin’s 1992 book, “A Chorus of Stones,” is a synthesis of personal and public history. One critic wrote: “She enters the psyches of people known to her only through books and photographs, getting everything somehow just right.” Credit... Doubleday Richard Restak, in his review of the book for The Times in 1992, called it “magnificent.” “With this imaginative recreation of wars and warriors — while writing graphic and haunting descriptions of battle — Ms. Griffin sets a standard few authors could meet,” Mr. Restak wrote. “She enters the psyches of people known to her only through books and photographs, getting everything somehow just right, and yet she retains a firm grasp on her own singularity.” Susan Griffin was born on Jan. 26, 1943, in Los Angeles. Her parents, Sarah (Colvin) Griffin and Walden Griffin, a fireman, divorced when she was 6. Because of her mother’s alcoholism, Susan lived with other family members until her first year of high school, when she moved in with her father. When Susan was 16, he was hit by a car and killed, and she was adopted by a friend’s parents, Geraldine and Morton Dimondstein , artists who lived nearby in the San Fernando Valley. After high school, she attended the University of California, Berkeley, and then San Francisco State University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in creative writing in 1965 and a master’s degree in 1973. She married John Levy, who was studying linguistics at Berkeley, in 1966; they divorced in 1970. Ms. Griffin’s first job after graduation was as an editorial assistant at Ramparts; she stopped working, and started writing, when her daughter was born in 1968. The isolation of motherhood, she often said, was an engine for her nascent feminism. In “ The Bad Mother ,” one of her early poems, she wrote: The bad mother wakes from dreams of imperfection trying to be perfection. All night she’s engineered a train too heavy with supplies to the interior. She fails. Despite her literary acclaim — Ms. Griffin was the author of 21 books and a popular speaker — she struggled financially. Among her many jobs, she was employed as a waitress, a house painter, an artist’s model and a Teletype operator. She also worked for much of her life as a creative writing teacher, which she loved. She struggled for years, too, with chronic fatigue syndrome and was often unable to work at all; she wrote a book about it, “What Her Body Thought: A Journey into the Shadows” (1999). Ms. Griffin is survived by her daughter, Chloe Andrews, and two grandchildren. Poetry is “like music,” Ms. Griffin told The Times in 2024. “It expresses things you haven’t quite integrated into your rational mind. It’s the cutting edge of social change. Things would come out in poetry that later could be articulated in policy or ideas.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/books/susan-griffin-dead.html,Culture,BBC,By Penelope Green,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Griffin--03-kqvt/10Griffin--03-kqvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T17:24:36+00:00,44056c91a95cd53364b388ec22eb8ea23b1d37d6
c1dcc59249e9,"Danny Thompson, Bassist Who Defied Folk Conventions, Dies at 86","danny thompson, obituary, folk music, pop rock music, jazz, pentangle, kate bush, nick drake, john renbourn, bert jansch","Danny Thompson, a genre-warping bassist who transcended sideman status to become a centerpiece of the eclectic British folk group Pentangle, as well as a sought-after accompanist to a long list of musical innovators, including Nick Drake, Kate Bush, Tim Buckley and Eric Clapton, died on Sept. 23 at his home in Rickmansworth, England. He was 86. His death was announced on his official Instagram account . No cause was given. With his intricate, free-form style on standup bass, Mr. Thompson crafted lines that were as inventive as those of any lead guitar solo. “You never just worked with Danny,” Ms. Bush wrote in an appreciation after his death. “You also worked with his double bass he called Victoria. The two of them were joined at the hip, and together they were the most fascinating storytellers — earthy and of the wild.” Mr. Thompson brought drama and depth to Ms. Bush’s songs “Pull Out the Pin,” from her 1982 album, “The Dreaming,” and “Watching You Without Me,” from her 1985 release, “Hounds of Love.” He began his rise in the mid-1960s as a member of Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated, a talent factory that produced the star drummers Ginger Baker (Cream, Blind Faith) and Charlie Watts (the Rolling Stones), among others, and also as the leader of a trio that included the guitarist John McLaughlin, who would become known as a jazz fusion pioneer. Pentangle, originally known as the Pentangle, formed in London in 1967 as something of a folk supergroup, with its rising-star bassist joining the guitar virtuosos John Renbourn and Bert Jansch ; the Alexis Korner veteran Terry Cox on drums; and the vocalist Jacqui McShee. Like Fairport Convention, founded the same year, which included the brilliant guitarist and singer Richard Thompson (no relation to Danny Thompson, with whom he would later record many albums), the band vaulted beyond the pastoral traditions of British folk with a highly eclectic — and, at times, electric — approach. Critics tried in vain to pigeonhole the group’s sound, which blended elements of jazz, blues, country, classical and rock oldies, sometimes in the same song. The band members themselves didn’t bother. “None of us are into one thing,” Mr. Thompson said in a 1971 interview with New Musical Express. “If someone asked me, ‘What’s your kind of music?,’” he added, “I’d say, ‘I have no idea.’” Despite the band's idiosyncrasies, it sold out the Royal Festival Hall in London in May 1967 and notched two Top 50 singles on the British charts: “Once I Had a Sweetheart” (No. 46 in 1969) and “Light Flight” (No. 43 the next year). Its 1968 debut album, called simply “The Pentangle,” made it to No. 21, followed by “Basket of Light” (No. 5) in 1969. The original members split in 1973, although they regrouped to perform and record in various incarnations over the years. Faced with constant pressure to record and perform, the group “didn’t tell the business, ‘Hold on, you’re destroying the thing that brings in the money,’” Mr. Thompson said in a 1991 interview with the British music magazine Q. “It all became very tired, and I still had a raging enthusiasm to play.” Daniel Henry Edward Thompson was born on April 4, 1939, in Teignmouth, on the southwestern coast of England. His father was killed in submarine action during World War II, and his mother moved the family to London when he was 6. Growing up in Battersea, a working-class area on the east side of the River Thames, he was skilled at soccer and eventually played as a junior for Chelsea Football Club. He was also an avid musician; at 13, he made his first bass out of wood from a tea chest. “I always wanted to be the best at whatever I did,” he said in an interview last year with the music site Louder. “When I was a kid, I wanted to be the best footballer. When I first got my bass when I was 16, I was living on my own, and I put up a sign above my door which said ‘PRACTICE.’” The hard work paid off. He was soon gigging in Soho clubs, and after two years of national service he toured with Roy Orbison , making a rare excursion into electric bass. In addition to his work with Pentangle, Mr. Thompson played on Donovan’s album “In Concert” (1968) and Tim Buckley’s “Dream Letter: Live in London 1968.” Mr. Thompson began a longstanding collaboration with the folk-jazz singer and guitarist John Martyn when he played on Mr. Martyn’s 1971 album, “Bless the Weather.” He also made notable contributions to Nick Drake’s haunting 1969 debut album, “Five Leaves Left,” including a suitably flowing bass line on the indelible “River Man.” Among his countless session gigs with top acts, he contributed to Rod Stewart’s chart-topping album “Every Picture Tells a Story” (1971) and Eric Clapton’s “461 Ocean Boulevard” (1974). In the 1990s, Mr. Thompson made forays into pop, recording with Everything but the Girl and Johnny Hates Jazz. He is survived by his wife, Sylvia, and his son, Dan Jr. In 1978, Mr. Thompson overcame a long history of substance abuse, an activity he had approached with characteristic competitiveness. “When I drank, I was going to be the best drinker in the bar, or take the most drugs or whatever,” he told Louder last year. “When I did give up the drink I was going to be the best at that.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/arts/music/danny-thompson-dead.html,Culture,BBC,By Alex Williams,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Thompson--02-lmht/10Thompson--02-lmht-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T15:52:59.749000+00:00,9bf61abede44dc4e9e5c1c4682aaa0aea13906c3
1e11e06441a7,He’s Cuing a New Era at One of America’s Oldest Orchestras,"classical music, cincinnati symphony orchestra, cristian macelaru","Cristian Macelaru’s first weekend as the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra wasn’t without its fraught moments. The night before his first concert, the orchestra’s principal trombone, Cristian Ganicenco, died from cancer, and the ensemble quickly put together a tribute encore. Then, during a break in the performance on Friday, a freak misstep sent a harp crashing into the orchestra’s associate concertmaster, who sat out the remainder of the performance with dizziness. Through it all, Macelaru, 45, led from the podium with undaunted assurance, beating in a new era for one of the oldest orchestras in the United States. And, despite his cosmopolitan career, he is trimming his portfolio to focus on Cincinnati. Earlier this year, he stepped down from directing the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne in Germany, and at the end of next season, he will depart the Orchestre National de France. “An American orchestra is very different than a European orchestra, not in how they perform or in their artistic level, but in what they represent to their communities,” Macelaru said during an interview in early October, while a bus with his face on it drove by. “The work is a lot more complex and challenging here, but it’s also much more rewarding,” he said. “I’ve always had such strong beliefs about what I would do if I were a music director of an American orchestra.” Macelaru’s arrival, which came after the Cincinnati Symphony welcomed a new chief executive early this year, comes at a moment of artistic development and financial strength for the ensemble. “This,” he said, “was really attractive to me.” For example, the orchestra is in discussions with several European festivals about a return to international touring. There are also talks of recording projects; there, Macelaru’s output includes a Grammy Award-winning account of Wynton Marsalis’s Violin Concerto with soloist Nicola Benedetti and the Philadelphia Orchestra. Macelaru’s primary goals in Cincinnati, he said, are to develop the orchestra’s ability to play in different cultural styles to energize their performances, and to continue to emphasize works by living composers in his programming. “He presents new music very confidently,” said the composer Anna Clyne, who first met Macelaru at Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music in Santa Cruz, Calif., which he also leads. “He gives it the same weight and presence as standard repertoire.” Additionally, several key seats in the orchestra are open, and hiring musicians is one sure way to leave a lasting impression on an orchestra’s sound. Macelaru jumped in on associate principal trumpet auditions during his first week as music director. He is taking over from the well-liked Louis Langrée , whom the orchestra’s musicians credit with bringing a French lightness to their playing after years of heavier Germanic interpretations. “Now, Cristi is asking how to use those different parts of our palate more for different works,” said Patrick Schlecker, the orchestra’s principal timpani. “He’s already drawing out our best musicianship.” Macelaru was born in Timisoara , Romania, the youngest of 10 children. He picked up the violin at 5 and soon began performing in the amateur orchestra conducted by his father. Although he sat in the concertmaster’s seat, so his father could keep a close eye on him, his older sister quietly led the section next to him, as the associate concertmaster. When he was 17, Macelaru came to the United States to study at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan, where he fell in love with conducting. Larry Rachleff, from the Shepherd School Symphony Orchestra at Rice University, told Macelaru that he would teach him only if he earned a master’s degree in performance and won a job with an orchestra first. Macelaru won positions in the Miami Symphony Orchestra and the Houston Symphony before beginning to study with Radcliff at the age of 28. “I started quite late,” Macelaru said. “But there are so many moments in my conducting life that I am able to return to the feeling of playing the violin and being in an orchestra.” A breakthrough came in 2012, when he stepped in for Pierre Boulez at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Then, after a stint as an assistant and then associate conductor with the Philadelphia Orchestra, as well as his job at the Cabrillo Festival, he returned to Europe for his posts in Germany and France. “His best performances with us,” the WDR Symphony principal bassoon Mathis Stier said, “were of Eastern European repertoire, composers like Bartok and Rachmaninoff and Ligeti and Tchaikovsky.” Stier is a friend of Macelaru’s family, and participated in the premiere of a bassoon quartet by Wynton Marsalis that Macelaru had commissioned to celebrate the 50th birthday of his wife, the bassoonist Cheryl Macelaru. The couple and their two children have been based in Paris, but Cristian has also purchased a condo in the Over-the-Rhine area of Cincinnati, where he can live and cook for himself while in town. “It’s probably the most European neighborhood in the city,” said Robert McGrath, the orchestra’s chief executive. Macelaru first led the Cincinnati Symphony a decade ago, in a Cincinnati Opera production of Verdi’s “Il Trovatore.” He returned over the years as a guest conductor, then in 2024 received a nod to succeed Langrée. “Cristi seemed like an old friend to the ensemble, even though he’d only conducted us a couple of times,” said Stefani Matsuo, the orchestra’s concertmaster. “He really draws out the best in everybody.” During the final rehearsal before his debut as music director, Macelaru dispatched critiques with deft politeness. He’d pause to make balance adjustments, and double back to ask the strings for more dig and stylized playing — “Like raindrops, here!” — in Clyne’s “Abstractions.” “I am totally comfortable never being remembered for my own interpretation,” he said in an interview, “but what I would trade that for is someone listening and being able to understand distinct voices that composers will have of the same orchestra.” True to his word, his podium mannerism is simple. At the concert, tight, mechanical motions in Gershwin’s Piano Concerto in F kept the orchestra in lock step with the soloist, Hélène Grimaud. His baton work in a suite from Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier” was fussier at first, but later relaxed in the sweeping elegance of its waltzes. “Back in 1904, Richard Strauss came onstage to conduct his own music here,” McGrath said. “Elgar came and conducted the May Festival in 1911. There’s an awareness of that history, a pride in this orchestra and this in this community.” McGrath oversees a $42.5 million budget, and in a field where structural deficits have become common, the Cincinnati Symphony is a debt-free organization. Still, it isn’t immune to the challenges faced by other orchestras, like rising expenses without ticket sales to make up the cost. Programs of films with live soundtracks or music from video games are popular with audiences, but attendance and subscriptions for traditional classical programs have not fully recovered from the pandemic. To attract audience members, Macelaru said, “we need to go into these communities with the humility and the respect of trying to learn something that is really, truly valuable.” That is hardly a new idea, but his twist is that he seems to genuinely want to create more of a musical exchange with Cincinnati’s neighborhoods, and adapt and learn from the city’s artists. “I remember him saying in an interview during the search process, he drew a line in the sand and said that he would not specialize in any repertoire,” said Schlecker, the timpanist. “I remember we were like: ‘Is that going to hurt him?

7e53791bc3d8,‘The Chair Company’ Review: He’s Not Taking This Sitting Down,"tv, hbo, the chair company, tim robinson, zach kanin","In his breakthrough Netflix series, “I Think You Should Leave,” Tim Robinson plays a lot of characters. But really, he plays one. He’s That Guy — a placid-faced, slouchy suburbanite man-child who, beneath his ordinary exterior, is a roiling cauldron of weird obsessions and resentments. Sometimes he runs a cable channel ; sometimes he wears a hot dog suit . But he is always That Guy. You may think this a criticism — it is not. Most comic performers would dream of creating a single character as distinctive, as recognizable, as evocative of the odd, rage-y times we live in. Tim Robinson zeroed in on That Guy, rendered him in many walks of life and turned him into an army. In “The Chair Company,” beginning Sunday on HBO, That Guy gets his own conspiracy serial. The series, which Robinson created with his longtime collaborator Zach Kanin, is sometimes as absurdly funny as “I Think You Should Leave” and sometimes deeper — although sometimes, it just feels longer. At first, you might believe that Ron Trosper (Robinson) is exactly as mild-mannered as he appears. He’s a thriving middle manager overseeing the development of a new mall in Ohio. He has a daughter (Sophia Lillis) about to get married; a son (Will Price) readying to graduate high school; and a wife, Barb (Lake Bell), starting her own business. Ron wears a pair of wire-rimmed glasses that have a Clark Kent-izing effect, suggesting that Robinson might, for some reason, be playing a man who has managed to fully grow up. Ron’s That Guy-ness slips out while he’s at dinner with his family and his waitress mentions that she hasn’t been to a mall in years. He insists she must have — malls are “just more naturalistic now and less intrusive” — but she is sure she hasn’t, and he doubles down. “This is kind of a mall!” he says of the restaurant, which is not in fact a mall. He is insulted, he is embarrassed, and he is embarrassing to others, but, like all That Guys before him, he cannot let it go. Like a human Yelp review, he burns with the agony of a grievance unsatisfied. That sort of impulse drives “The Chair Company,” whose instigating incident has been deemed a spoiler. This is just as well, since to describe the plot’s surreal turns would make me sound like a 3-year-old recounting a dream. Suffice it to say that the event leaves Ron humiliated and outraged, and it sends him on a quest for justice that reflects his inner belief that the world is conspiring against him. The twist, such as it is, is that Ron may kind of be right. The strings that he begins pulling, at the expense of his work and his personal relationships, lead to a netherworld of bogus companies, false identities, inept thugs and weirdly specific porn. In one sense, Ron is a familiar figure from antihero TV — the man in a midlife crisis seeking purpose, the kind of guy who watches a Jim Croce video on YouTube and ends up hammering out a maudlin comment about how life has let him down. But there is also, in Robinsonian style, something unformed about him. In an early scene, he retreats to his office, crawls under the desk and begins spasming in frustration, like a toddler who hasn’t learned to emotionally self-regulate. Ron’s detective quest leads him to numerous character types and environments familiar from Robinson’s sketches. He partners in his investigation with Mike (Joseph Tudisco), a sad-sack tough guy who nurses secret heartaches. There are the co-workers with poor senses of boundaries, the devotees of unusual shirt stores . Everyone is a bit off and over-reactive, like people who, after the Covid lockdowns, seemed to have forgotten how to be around other humans. Robinson’s work also understands the connection between comedy and existential horror. (Take the “I Think You Should Leave” sketch in which a man is terrified by a pig in a Richard Nixon mask into believing there are “ monsters on the world .”) “The Chair Company” seems to be trying to pry open the skulls of Robinson’s characters and get a closer look at the boogeymen hiding inside. The show is still bizarrely funny, but there are hints of a richer emotional register and an otherworldly eeriness, as in “Twin Peaks: The Return” or “The Curse.” “The Chair Company” doesn’t deliver entirely on this approach (though it could yet pay off in the season’s final episode, which HBO did not send for review). For some stretches it feels like a series of “I Think You Should Leave” premises joined by a connective tissue of plot, and the greater length makes the thinness of the supporting characters more conspicuous. Still, I was drawn in, wondering what strange, sleazy alley this shaggy dog would lead me down next. That Guy, it turns out, can still surprise you.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/arts/television/the-chair-company-review.html,Culture,BBC,By James Poniewozik,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12chair-review-phfw/12chair-review-phfw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:01:10.200000+00:00,e7e5200cab77ab2bc2d0b309736032b880cac1f3
535cf1a25755,San Francisco Wants to Destroy a 96-Year-Old’s Defining Artwork,"armand vaillancourt, sculpture, art, fountain, san francisco","The Vaillancourt Fountain, a tangled web of concrete tubing that once belched 30,000 gallons of water a minute from a plaza near the San Francisco Bay, has been called many names. Often, it is called ugly. Herb Caen, the San Francisco Chronicle’s leading columnist of the 20th century, thought the fountain resembled a collapsed structure, calling it a 10 on the Richter scale. In San Francisco magazine, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Allan Temko nearly ran out of adjectives when he harrumphed that the fountain was “incredibly ugly, brutal, pretentiously simple-minded and literally insipid concrete blocks” that resembled excrement “deposited by a giant concrete dog with square intestines.” So one might think the city’s proposal to replace the maligned fountain with native landscaping, picnic areas and other amenities would be met with applause. But this is San Francisco, where every action generates a reaction. Destroying the Vaillancourt Fountain, its supporters say, would be erasing history and modern architecture, and counter to the city’s reputation for being weird. Bono spray-painted “Rock ’n’ Roll Stops the Traffic” on the fountain, which was completed in 1971, during a free U2 concert in 1987; the sculpture’s steps and ledges made it a skateboarding mecca in the 1990s. “It’s weird and unusual,” said Ted Barrow, a skateboarder and art historian. “It’s a symbol of San Francisco.” Armand Vaillancourt, 96, said in a video interview from his Montreal studio that his most famous work belongs to the people. “I think people love it,” he said. “It’s been neglected but it’s still alive.” He called himself a joyous man who continues to create but added, “I’m very badly hurt.” His long white hair gave him the look of a prophet as he warned, “It’s going to be the shame of the city of San Francisco if they demolish it.” In the fountain’s prime, people wended their way into the 710-ton sculpture whose water drowned out noise from the double-decker freeway that wrapped behind it. Two years after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the damaged freeway was removed, exposing the fountain and stripping some of its meaning. Today, padel courts are shoved against the fenced-off fountain, which no longer spews water in Embarcadero Plaza. One side of the fountain has become a small gathering place for people with shopping carts who have nowhere else to go. The fountain, on the northeastern edge of the city at the foot of Market Street, sits near the sparkling Bay where ferry boats carry passengers to Sausalito, Angel Island and beyond. Every Saturday, thousands of shoppers descend on the Ferry Building, drawn to the kaleidoscopic farmers’ market for black Mission figs, lemon verbena, Lion’s mane mushrooms and other Bay Area essentials. At noon on a beautiful Saturday in late September, there was no one near the fountain, not even the people with no place else to go. San Francisco has proposed a $35 million renovation of the plaza in a public-private partnership. The city’s Recreation and Park Department asked its Arts Commission in August for permission to deaccession the fountain, calling it “a design constraint.” Recent city-sponsored reports determined that the fountain’s mechanical and electrical systems have failed, and that it is a seismic risk with hazardous materials and is not in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. The fountain is technically not beyond repair, the reports said, for the cost of $28,951,519. “When the water was flowing, I thought it was really cool,” said Kat Anderson, the president of the department’s seven-member commission. “But it was designed to be a fountain and it’s not a fountain anymore.” In the late 1960s, city officials held a design competition for the fountain that was won by Vaillancourt, a well-known Canadian sculptor. Over his 74-year career, he has crafted pieces from metal, wood and concrete that are in museums and public spaces throughout Quebec. Although his San Francisco fountain is included in “The Atlas of Brutalist Architecture,” he said in the interview, he “didn’t know about Brutalist and all that.” The fate of the Vaillancourt Fountain raises questions about unpopular public art. “It’s not a masterpiece, but it captures a moment so distinctly and with such verve,” said John King, a former architecture critic at The Chronicle and the author of “Portal: San Francisco’s Ferry Building and the Reinvention of American Cities.” “It’s one of urban America’s truly bizarre works of public art” and “a reminder of midcentury mistakes,” he said. Those are precisely the reasons he wants to save the fountain. In the 1960s, architects and city planners believed that grand spaces could be catalysts for people to gather, King said, but often “those spaces turned out to be voids.” At an Arts Commission meeting this month, speakers were almost evenly divided about the fountain. “What may appear to some as an odd sculpture speaks directly to anyone who ever felt like they didn’t fit in and why they make San Francisco their home,” said Liz Waytkus, the executive director of Docomomo US, which works to preserve modern architecture. The next speaker called it “an eyesore.” Julian Lake, an executive with Bay Area Council, which represents major employers working to improve the Bay Area, said he walked by the fountain every day and thought it had passed its time. “It can be replaced by something equally weird but inspiring,” he said. In an interview, Charles Birnbaum, the chief executive of the Cultural Landscape Foundation, blamed the city for the plight of the fountain. “We’re looking at more than a decade of deferred maintenance and also a complete lack of programming,” he said. “People don’t feel welcome.” The message, he said, is that the city does not care. “It wasn’t neglect,” said Tamara Aparton, a spokeswoman for the Recreation and Park Department. “It was an aging, unsafe system that simply couldn’t be maintained anymore.” Vaillancourt learned about the threat to his fountain from his children in April after they read the news on their phones. “We were shocked the city never tried to reach my father,” said his 33-year-old son, Alexis Vaillancourt, who is also a sculptor. In May, the Vaillancourts traveled to meet with city officials, accompanied by representatives from Quebec and the Canadian embassy. “They were polite,” Alexis Vaillancourt said. “Our feeling was that they wanted to demolish the sculpture.” Public fountains are sometimes dismantled or relocated when “people with power think that they’re ugly or offensive,” said Michele Bogart, an emeritus professor of art history at Stony Brook University and an expert on public art. In August, a lawyer for Armand Vaillancourt sent San Francisco a cease-and-desist letter, warning that any effort to destroy the fountain would violate Vaillancourt’s “moral rights.” But once an artwork becomes part of a city collection, Bogart said, the artist has little to no control over the work. While the city’s Arts Commission prepares to vote on the future of the fountain, Vaillancourt is still designing, at work now on his diamond-shaped black granite tombstone. The fountain should outlast him, he thinks. “She’s very young,” the artist said. “It should be good for a few hundred years.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/arts/design/vaillancourt-fountain-san-francisco.html,Culture,BBC,By Carol Pogash,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10cul-fountain-fight-mzwq/10cul-fountain-fight-mzwq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:30.651000+00:00,ff5d5dceacb7bbe756a1b2c153cd4c4e3da4bf25

b538b99e9d97,‘Krapp’s Last Tape’ Review: Stephen Rea’s Duet With His Younger Self,"theater, off broadway theater, skirball, samuel beckett, stephen rea, vicky featherstone, krapp's last tape","An actor prepares, as Konstantin Stanislavsky’s classic book spells out. But there is preparation and then there is long-term, above-and-beyond readiness. About 13 years ago, the actor Stephen Rea had no idea whether he would ever perform the title role in Samuel Beckett’s short play “ Krapp’s Last Tape ,” in which a solitary 69-year-old man listens at length to the recorded voice of his decades-younger self. In performance, that gulf of years was the bit that Rea never really bought, because vocal quality changes with age. So, with the help of a radio producer, Stephen Wright, and a sound engineer, Bill Maul, he recorded the younger Krapp’s dialogue. Just in case. And in Vicky Featherstone’s neat and handsome staging at NYU Skirball, that is the Rea we hear coming from Krapp’s old reel-to-reel machine, more muscular of voice and speaking from the past. For the audience, there is no hitch of disbelief. “Thirty-nine today, sound as a bell,” the Krapp on tape reports, reflecting on his year. He notes, too, because his audio library is already a favorite indulgence, that he has been listening to a recording of himself from his 20s. “Hard to believe I was ever that young whelp. The voice! Jesus! And the aspirations!” Whoever Krapp once meant to be, the man he became is the scampering creature before us, with the magnificent mane of hair, the natty white ankle boots and the weakness for bananas and alcohol. Also the phlegmy cough — and the regrets, of course, because mortality is encroaching, and the sum of his life is not as rich as it might have been. Love has gone missing, for one thing. He made the choice to shut it out. Rea — who spent time in the rehearsal room with Beckett in the 1970s, when he played Clov in a Royal Court production of “Endgame” in London — brings a wonderful humanity to Krapp. It is extraordinarily easy to imagine this character out in the world: eccentric, yes, but not wildly so. Home alone, though, he talks to himself freely — to keep himself company, to indulge his love of language, to have some solitary fun. The word “spool” in particular amuses him, and his tapes give him reason to use it. He rolls the letters around in his mouth, and they emerge elongated and high-pitched, like a bird call. “Spooool!” The play is constructed as a kind of solo duet, between the live actor and his audio, but Rea gives this production an amped-up sense of the older Krapp regarding the man he once was. He nods along or shakes his head as his younger self monologues; he listens with a personal, rooting interest, or refuses to listen, out of anger or pain. If he could will himself back to the moment in his 39th year that sounds in retrospect like a romantic idyll, he might do things differently. Because this is where Krapp is as he picks up the microphone to add a new tape to his collection. “Just been listening to that stupid bastard I took myself for 30 years ago, hard to believe I was ever as bad as that,” he says. Then, scrabbling for developments worth mentioning: “Nothing to say, not a squeak.” It is a strange play, modern and moving, and impeccably designed: the set by Jamie Vartan, costume by Katie Davenport, lighting by Paul Keogan and sound by Kevin Gleeson. Beckett wrote the play in English in 1958, when he was in his early 50s, somewhere between the younger and the older Krapp. Its technology is rooted in that time, when tape recorders first became popularly available, so he set it “in the future,” as his script notes — because Krapp needs to have been recording himself for most of his life. Our technology is different now, our tendency to self-tape completely out of control, but mortality still threatens. This lean-in contemplation of it is timed just right for our too-short attention spans: 55 minutes, at the end of which you’ll have added a classic to your day. Do.

873c0497f00f,"Boulez by Salonen: Roots, Branches and Family Ties","classical music, new york philharmonic, david geffen hall, la dance project, pierre-laurent aimard, bela bartok, pierre boulez, claude debussy, benjamin millepied, esa-pekka salonen","In a 2010 interview , the composer Pierre Boulez, then 85, shared a frustration. As music director of the New York Philharmonic in the 1970s, he had disarmed audiences with “rug concerts” that replaced auditorium seats with floor cushions. But with age, he told me, he grew less satisfied with the stage itself and with conventional arrangements of musicians, which produced a sound “in front of you and which remains there.” Increasingly, he said, “you want the sound to go everywhere.” I kept thinking of that conversation during the Philharmonic’s two-program centenary tribute to Boulez, who died in 2016, both designed and conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. With Boulez’s interest in the spatial liberation of sound, he would have especially loved the second program (through Saturday), which culminates in his “Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna.” With players spread out across balconies in David Geffen Hall, the space was enveloped in voluptuous volleys of sound cut through with jagged, awe-filled silences. Onstage, dancers from the L.A. Dance Project, choreographed by Benjamin Millepied, extended the music into human form with flickering gestures, ritual enactments of violence and knots of sculptural stillness. As a composer and conductor of equal stature, Salonen is a natural heir to Boulez. In an essay on these two roles, Boulez once skewered the “artificial” separation of creation and interpretation that has become the norm in classical music. He argued that this rupture blocks the two-way flow between past and present, in which new music unearths fresh meaning in old works, and music of the past finds genetic continuity in those of the present. Together, the two meticulously composed programs, which included works by Debussy, Stravinsky and Bartok, formed a moving meditation on transmission — of both sound and legacies. One such legacy came through vividly in Salonen’s first program, which explored connections between Debussy and Boulez, and featured the incisive pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard. The first half of the concert braided together selections from Boulez’s 1945 “Notations” for solo piano — crystalline Serialist miniatures, each 12 bars long — with their later orchestral metamorphoses, vast and explosive canvases that Boulez built decades later. In between, Salonen inserted movements from Debussy’s “Images,” written from 1909 to 1912. In this context, Debussy’s orchestral canvases seemed to point to the generative force of individual sounds independent of harmony. Listening to “La Mer,” which closed the concert after a lustrous performance of the rarely heard “Fantaisie” for piano and orchestra, I was struck by the way the movement “Jeux de vagues” (“The Play of Waves”) could be read as a study of the physicality of music — waves as the stuff of sound. Salonen, conducting with relaxed economy of movement, his cues simultaneously precise and soft, drew sensitive, fluid playing from the Philharmonic. In the first half of the second program, the communication between conductor and instrumentalists wasn’t as seamless. The concert opened with a performance of Stravinsky’s tart Octet for Wind Instruments that was metrically precise but struggled to balance the sounds of the woodwinds with those of the trumpets and trombones. In Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra, which ended in a fizzing, brilliant Finale, there were passages in the middle movements where the players seemed slow to respond to Salonen’s tempo manipulations. What came across clearly, though, were the points of connection between the two composers, including their debt to the Baroque fugue, approached with speculative detachment by Stravinsky, and theatrical intensity by Bartok. “Rituel,” Boulez’s memorial to a friend and fellow modernist, assigns the conductor a role more like a celebrant presiding over a prescribed rite. In a theatrical touch that also helped project his cues to monitors in the balconies, Salonen donned gloves, one red, one blue. The orchestra is divided into eight ensembles, each with its own percussion, so that the music unfolds in successive waves of incandescent, complex sound and solemn silence. At its core is a dialogue between order and mystery, with an intermittent clanging that marks the passage of time against massive sound clouds, blooming with the resonance of temple bells and gongs. From the podium set up on the stage across from the largest and most brass-heavy group, Salonen presided over the ceremony with occasional stylized gestures that gracefully connected to Millepied’s choreography. At the close, one dancer draped herself across Salonen’s feet, remaining motionless as the last volley of sound dissipated. It was an embodiment of the performance as an offering, not only to Boulez and Maderna, but to the lineage of composers seeking to extend music not just into space but into the future.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/arts/music/pierre-boulez-esa-pekka-salonen-new-york-phil.html,Culture,BBC,By Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10cul-esa-pekka-pghv/10cul-esa-pekka-pghv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T19:09:32.601000+00:00,0952ba26b3978f0bbe79f155d4aeea1f2f8f703a

acb5e2923e13,"John Lodge, Singer and Bassist With the Moody Blues, Dies at 82","john lodge, rock and roll hall of fame, obituary, music, r&b, england","John Lodge, who brought supple bass lines, soaring falsetto harmonies and deft songwriting to the British rock group the Moody Blues as it moved from its R&B roots toward a lush, symphonic sound as pioneers of progressive rock, has died at 82. His family confirmed the death in a statement on Friday but did not cite a cause or say where or when he died. The statement said Mr. Lodge “has been suddenly and unexpectedly taken from us.” During their creative peak, starting in the psychedelic era, the Moody Blues helped redefine the parameters of rock with sweeping experimental albums like “Days of Future Passed” (1967), which is considered one of rock’s first concept albums. The Moody Blues formed in industrial Birmingham, England, in 1964. Moving to London, they notched their first hit, “Go Now,” which the American soul singer Bessie Banks had recorded that same year. Boosted by the kind of promotional film that would later be known as a music video, the song soared to No. 1 in Britain and cracked the Top 10 in the United States. The momentum did not last. Discouraged by lackluster sales of the group’s 1965 debut album, “The Magnificent Moodies,” and wearying of a crushing touring schedule, the guitarist and singer Denny Laine (later of Paul McCartney’s band Wings) and the bassist Clint Warwick eventually peeled off. They were replaced in 1966 by Mr. Lodge and Justin Hayward, to round out a lineup that included Mike Pinder on keyboards, Graeme Edge on drums and Ray Thomas on flute and vocals. It was an auspicious era for the musically ambitious. The Beatles, with their inventive album “Revolver” (1966) and their boundary-shattering follow-up, “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” (1967), had opened the floodgates for rock ’n’ roll experimentation. The Moody Blues were swept along, swapping R&B covers for expansive originals with their second album, “Days of Future Passed.” “It was exciting when it was our own songs — we weren’t playing a song someone had written for us,” Mr. Lodge once told the music site The Strange Brew. “We wanted to play each part exactly right and new, and like no one else had ever played that particular part to a song before,” he added. “That was exciting about ‘Days of Future Passed,’ creating something that no one else ever created before.” A groundbreaking release, “Days of Future Passed” offered elaborate arrangements, lush contributions from the London Festival Orchestra and the plaintive sound of Mr. Pinder’s Mellotron , an electromechanical keyboard that plays samples of different instruments. The follow-up album, “In Search of the Lost Chord” (1968) — which featured Mr. Lodge’s propulsive hit “Ride My See-Saw ” — leaned even more heavily on the Mellotron. The band was riding high. Starting with “On the Threshold of a Dream” (1969), four out of its next five albums made it to No. 1 in Britain; the exception, “To Our Children’s Children’s Children,” barely missed, reaching No. 2. With fame came its rewards. In a 1971 Rolling Stone interview, Mr. Lodge recounted responding to one negative review with a pointed joke: “I’ll run over the reviewer in my Rolls-Royce.” John Lodge was born in Birmingham on July 20, 1943. As a teenager, he was enraptured by American rock ’n’ roll, finding particular inspiration in Buddy Holly, who wrote his own material. At 16, Mr. Lodge bought his first bass, a Fender Precision model with a sunburst finish. (He would later play it with the Moody Blues.) By that time, his friend Mr. Thomas had formed a band called El Riot & the Rebels , which was soon performing throughout England’s Midlands. He had enrolled at Aston College of Technology (now Aston University) in Birmingham when the offer came to join the band that would make him famous. “I said, ‘ Have bass, will travel ,’” Mr. Lodge recalled in a 2015 interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph. “We went to a village in Belgium and wrote songs, which became our stage show and album ‘Days of Future Passed.’” As a valued songwriter for the Moody Blues, Mr. Lodge also contributed, among other songs, the wistful “Isn’t Life Strange,” off the chart-topping 1972 album “Seventh Sojourn,” and “Gemini Dream,” a danceable collaboration with Mr. Hayward that rose to No. 12 on the Billboard chart in 1981. The Moody Blues went on hiatus in 1974 but regrouped in 1977 — the same year Mr. Lodge released his first of many solo albums, “Natural Avenue.” It was a new era for the band, in which they steadily toured and recorded through the 1980s and beyond, undergoing various personnel changes while producing several minor hits and another Top 10 one with the perky, MTV-friendly “Your Wildest Dreams” (1986). In 2018, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame . After the Moody Blues stopped touring in 2019, Mr. Lodge continued to perform live, including with his son-in-law Jon Davison, a member of the current lineup of the progressive band Yes. Mr. Lodge’s survivors include his wife, Kirsten; a son, Kristian; a daughter, Emily; and a grandson. Mr. Pinder, the last surviving founding member of the Moody Blues, died in 2024 . Mr. Lodge recently released “Days of Future Passed — My Sojourn,” a recording that he said represented his “reimagining” of the group’s most famous album. It was a reminder of the heady era that long ago gave the Moody Blues license to explore to their limits. “It was a huge time of looking for things,” Mr. Lodge said in a 1990 interview with the British music magazine Q. “We used to spend night after night sitting in hotel rooms with people we’d never met before discussing everything, flights to the moon, which hadn’t even been conceived, looking for all the different religions and the mystical things, the astrology and Christianity, everything. Everything was there, you know, and you were looking all the while, and this had to reflect in the songs you were writing.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/arts/music/john-lodge-dead-moody-blues.html,Culture,BBC,By Alex Williams and Christine Hauser,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/10Lodge--tfgm-print3/10Lodge--tfgm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:11:02+00:00,71198e0156044936251e9ea299fd8f8028a438f9
8c61ce5d6df1,‘Kavalier & Clay’ Hears an Unusual Call From the Met: Encore!,"opera, metropolitan opera, the amazing adventures of kavalier & clay","“Kavalier & Clay,” which was commissioned by the Met, is based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and incorporates electronic music and swing into the score. With its heavy reliance on eye-catching video projections, comic book imagery, and changing sets, it is an ambitious production , intended to resonate with younger audiences. (Notably, the Met is advertising this opera at the New York Comic Con this weekend.) The Met said that 87 percent of the paid seats, not counting complimentary tickets that are set aside each performance, were sold over the course of all seven shows, significantly higher than the number of seats sold at most operas. Of those, 35 percent of the attendees were new to the Met, and 30 percent were 40 or younger. But if history is any guide, reviving “Kavalier & Clay” is a bit of a risk. Since the pandemic, the Met has not fared well in bringing back new operas. The company was quick to revive “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” by Terence Blanchard, and “The Hours,” by Kevin Puts. Both had done well in their opening season, and both foundered in their revivals. Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said he did not think the same thing would happen with “Kavalier & Clay,” arguing that reviving it this season builds on the momentum of recent weeks. “Each performance,” he said, “sold better than the previous one.” Februarys have been quiet at the Met since the 2021-22 season, when the company began to take the month off from performance. That made this last-minute scheduling change somewhat easier. But retrieving cast members who might have conflicting engagements — opera stars tend to book appearances years in advance — was complicated. Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Met’s music director, will lead only the final performance of the revival, on Feb. 21. The other three performances will be conducted by Michael Christie, making his Met debut, on Feb. 17, 18 and 20.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/arts/music/kavalier-and-clay-met-opera-revival.html,Culture,BBC,By Adam Nagourney,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10cul-kavalier-extend-gjht/10cul-kavalier-extend-gjht-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:00:04.969000+00:00,aa198eb3f3c62d6d819f22ac5b23797167ca1f7e
bfc9d7532c40,Review: Paris Opera Ballet Unrolls a Lackluster ‘Red Carpet’,"dance;ballet, paris opera ballet, new york city center theater, hofesh shechter","Classic French style is usually so understated, so chic, so less is more. It was curious then that the Paris Opera Ballet, in its first company tour to the United States since 2012, would bring with it a dance called “Red Carpet”— too often a place where imaginative fashion goes to die — and showy costumes by Chanel (not, alas, Coco). In place of tweed suits, there were sequins, at least at the start. At the Paris Opera, contemporary repertory is an important part of the company’s output. One example is this full-length dance , performed in socks and choreographed by the Israel-born, London-based Hofesh Shechter, who also designed the set and composed the music. With an onstage quartet and 13 dancers, “Red Carpet” begins with the sight of a red velvet curtain that weighs heavily on the stage. And it’s not the only one. As more curtains part the stage at New York City Center, a cluster of dancers stand beneath a chandelier — a reference to the one that hangs at the Palais Garnier in Paris — as a Middle Eastern melody plays. The musicians, including the drummer Yaron Engler, Shechter’s musical collaborator, perform on a raised circular platform at the back of the stage. With a mix of cello, double bass and wind instruments, they deliver, at times, a throbbing, danceable beat. At other times, the sound descends into meditative droning. The stage is shadowy as dancers group together and splinter off into duets, trios and quartets — undulating in unison or crouching or squirming — before finding their way back to the pack. The opening was forceful: The dancers rocked, swaying hypnotically as they wound an arm back and then stretched it forward to softly clap the other hand. Their arms (always the arms!) stretch high with fluttering fingers and swirling wrists. Shoulders swivel. The legs get action, too. At one point the dancers walk stiffly, kicking one leg and then the other like lithe monsters. The lighting, by Tom Visser, produces a haze that renders the atmosphere slightly vampiric. That is fitting in this “Red Carpet”: With sparkle comes decay. Overrun with starts and stops and, on the part of the dancers, an angsty kind of effort both in motion and stillness, this is a dance that aims to be raw yet lands in a place of slickness. “Red Carpet” lasts only 75 minutes, but the looping predictability stretched it thin — like a commercial dance disguised as its concert equivalent. In one video-worthy moment, the chandelier lowered, and the performers gathered around it, breaking in and out of a disjointed folk dance that sent them walking quickly in relevé, hips pushed forward, like models prancing on a runway. But the choreography’s development felt uneven, building and then descending to the silly side of stunted. Music is important to Shechter, who once played drums in a band and has said that the work is as much a concert as a dance. But as a whole, the evening fails to transport in the way a rock show might. After the energetic early section, the work became monotonous as performers, thrashing their limbs with slippery spines, arched their necks like serpents straining to bite. When the cast left the stage and returned wearing not their festive clothes but beige leotards and unitards that matched their skin, the transformation seemed less about exposing a bareness or a vulnerability than about creating uniformity. The glitter was gone, truly, and with it a stasis took over — including periods of slithering slow motion. While “Red Carpet” hinted at rave culture, it lacks the wildness, the explosive, out-of-control dancing that makes a stage pulsate with life. This production landed more in the space of a watered-down cabaret with dancers worshiping — or, perhaps, lamenting — the centerpiece looking down at them: that giant chandelier. Near the end, the lights brightened suddenly, washing the stage in blood red and then a screaming purple. But it was little more than a light show — another sizzling out — and eventually, the dancers took their place under the chandelier. Standing together, they gazed up. The curtain fell. It was a long goodbye.

3a2f0821844d,"In This Restaurant, the Crabs Are Part of the Art","art, restaurant, aquarium, amant, fish, pollution, pierre huyghe, brooklyn","The French artist Pierre Huyghe was in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, last week, peering into a plastic bucket of water containing small horseshoe crabs. Little did they know, the scuttling crabs were “unconscious actors,” in Huyghe’s words, about to get supporting roles in his large new aquarium artwork, “Satellite.” A construction crew was moving around Huyghe, trying to complete Zoli, a restaurant opening later this fall adjacent to Amant, a contemporary art center that opened in 2021. Amant was founded by the collector Lonti Ebers , who also commissioned “Satellite,” which separates Zoli’s bar and the main dining area. Huyghe, who comes across as a friendly intellectual, was wondering how many crabs to put in the three-tank aquarium, a triptych of sorts. He was questioning whether the lighting on the tanks was just right, typical finishing-touch questions from the notoriously detail-oriented artist. “I am a perfectionist, sadly,” said Huyghe, 63, a former New Yorker who now lives in Santiago, Chile. His work includes elaborate installations, as well as videos , sculptures and other media, and he has been making aquarium works since 2009; “Satellite” is his biggest and most complex to date. Huyghe was surprised that the bright yellow, genetically modified GloFish in one side tank were not greener in color, as he had been expecting, but he decided to roll with it. “It’s not a big deal,” he said. “I wanted a color that instantly reads as artificial.” Unlike some restaurant fish tanks, the swimmers were not placed there to be eaten later, or even to conjure the idea of appetizing dishes — quite the contrary. The sludgy-looking bottoms of the tanks, complete with generic-looking detritus made for the work, were fashioned to resemble the depths of the famously polluted East River offshoot Newtown Creek, about two blocks away from Amant. In this case, “site-specific” refers to an official Superfund site . “I think they call it ‘black mayonnaise,’” Huyghe said of the unsettling nickname for the toxic stew. Ebers, who is on the board of the Museum of Modern Art and is married to Bruce Flatt, the chief executive of Brookfield Asset Management, owns other works by Huyghe, so she knew she was getting a provocation. “It has this eerie ecology, but it is totally captivating,” she said. The perversity of people eating so close to his work made Huyghe giggle occasionally during his visit, a reaction that fits with his longstanding approach — making high-minded Conceptual artworks about technology, nature and what it means to be conscious and alive, but with sardonic edges. “He’s the ultimate contrarian,” said Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where Huyghe had a retrospective beginning in 2014 . The center tank of the Zoli installation has a large floating volcanic rock, meant to be the satellite of the title. Both side tanks have slowly rising and falling liquid levels, as if the central rock were a moon creating tides. (Huyghe collaborated with the Brooklyn-based City Aquarium company on the project.) “On one side, you have living fossils like anemone, horseshoe crabs, arrow crabs,” Huyghe said, noting that they have existed for hundreds of millions of years. “The other side is genetically modified organisms. It was important to me to have GloFish, because it’s a brand” — thus heightening the artificiality. The glass of all three tanks can be made transparent or opaque, and the system is programmed to alternate between clear and not-clear, sometimes flashing for just a second, sometimes lasting longer. When the glass was opaque, the shadows of the fish were almost more mesmerizing than the real thing. Huyghe compared the effect to a curtain coming down briefly on a play between acts, and said that the switching on and off kept the work from being static. “I do like the idea that there is something not always visible, that is concealed, and that there is a rhythm to visibility,” Huyghe said. Huyghe lived in New York for more than a decade, over three separate stints, and once had a studio in Greenpoint, not too far away from Amant. He recalled seeing a Chinese restaurant on the Lower East Side late at night, with a lit-up fish tank glowing against an otherwise pitch-black background. “I thought, ‘Oh, what a beautiful, strange situation,’” he said. His aquarium works have included the “Zoodram” series, one version of which included a sculpture meant to look like a head by the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, into which a crab could crawl, as well as a 2015 project on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Huyghe said he relished “Satellite” partly because a restaurant setting meant that viewers would look at the work much longer than they would in a museum: “You’ve got everybody’s attention.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/arts/design/pierre-huyghe-amant-art-center-satellite.html,Culture,BBC,By Ted Loos,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10cul-huyghe-aquarium-cfbt/10cul-huyghe-aquarium-cfbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T15:00:08.905000+00:00,24b4251974dfeb905d35124a68a3e8d9fdb619a3
986dabf2b513,Why Is Taylor Swift So Polarizing? And Other Big ‘Showgirl’ Questions,"audio-neutral-inquisitive, pop rock music, taylor swift, the life of a showgirl","Looked at one way, Taylor Swift’s new album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” is already a record-smashing success , on track to sell more than 3.5 million copies — including more than one million on vinyl — in its first week. Our critic, Jon Caramanica, called it “a catchy and substantive but unflashy album” that “takes the songwriting intimacy of her ‘Folklore’/‘Evermore’ era and renders it with more clarity and oomph.” From another angle, “Showgirl” — Swift’s ninth full-length release since 2020, counting her rerecorded albums — is being received more coolly: Professional reviews are decidedly mixed and the social media conversation can skew exhausted, if not downright dismissive. With some additional time to digest after initial impressions , Popcast’s Jon Caramanica and Joe Coscarelli returned to the album this week with a wider panel of Swift experts from The New York Times music team, including Jon Pareles, Caryn Ganz and Lindsay Zoladz. In addition to a round table discussion of the “Showgirl” themes and emergent controversies, the group took listener questions about Swift vs. Charli XCX; the critical reception so far; some of the album’s cringey lyrics (and their clean versions); and where Swift can go next.

0b6fff0b2ed0,‘Dancing on the Loom’: Weaving Creativity With Indigenous Tradition,"carpets and rugs, handicraft, portland oregon, teotitlán del valle","One sweltering day in the summer of 2003, the year they arrived in the United States, Francisco and Laura Bautista donned heavy backpacks and walked three miles to the nearest light rail station, where they caught the train to the Portland Saturday Market. The couple found an open space when they arrived and rolled out their colorful handwoven rugs, as they would at a market back home in Mexico. (They were born and raised in Teotitlán del Valle, a Oaxacan village whose Zapotec people have been weaving for centuries .) But that was not how vending worked in the United States. A security guard quickly kicked them out. “We didn’t really understand what he was saying,” Mr. Bautista said. “We were so embarrassed.” The Bautistas struggled for years after the run-in. They knew little English, and they lacked a support system for their baby. Ms. Bautista worked at a Carl’s Jr. restaurant, Mr. Bautista on a farm. Weaving, which had been a part of their lives for as long as they could remember, fell to the side. After six years, they returned to the Portland market, this time with the proper permits and two young children in tow. Though it was freezing outside, they managed to make about $100. The Bautistas were thrilled until they returned to the car and realized they had locked the keys inside. The money they had just made went to the locksmith. The couple, who are in their 40s, live in a white farmhouse surrounded by green fields at the base of Mount Hood. In their garage turned studio, they often start weaving as early as 5 a.m., their German shepherd lying at their feet. As a boy, Mr. Bautista helped his grandfather and father make bobbins, dye wool and tie fringes. He still uses the loom on which his father taught him to weave. Ms. Bautista, whose mother was part of Teotitlán del Valle’s first generations of female weavers, learned the craft as a teenager. The Bautistas work, live and raise children together but still find time to simply enjoy each other’s company, bantering in a mix of Zapotec, Spanish and English. They say that they hope their love comes through in their weavings, which are bright and ornate. Some have geometric shapes, while others depict salmon or hummingbirds. The couple tries to make each piece unique, at most doing a similar design a handful of times. They produce roughly 50 pillowcases and 30 rugs each year. Their pieces range from a few hundred dollars to more than $15,000, depending on their size and complexity. Big, elaborate rugs can take six months of working afternoons and weekends. (Mr. Bautista still supplements their income with farm work.) Mr. Bautista is endlessly jovial, while Ms. Bautista is on the shyer side. She’s also meticulous: Her bobbins are lined up perfectly, while his are often a jumble. But one thing they have in common is they don’t usually start weaving on one of their three looms with a particular pattern in mind. They just crank up the music — anything from cumbia to the Rolling Stones, depending on their moods — and weave. “We call it ‘dancing on the loom,’” Mr. Bautista said. “Whatever we feel at that moment, whatever we think in that moment, we just go and create it.” For many years, the Bautistas stuck to traditional Zapotec patterns . Then, in 2010, a woman stopped by their booth at a Christmas bazaar. Impressed by their skill, she gave them an invitation to join the Portland Handweavers Guild . Mr. Bautista misplaced the meeting info, but the woman found him again the next year to extend the invite once more. “That’s when everything changed,” Mr. Bautista said. The guild’s members mentored the Bautistas, encouraging them to enter juried art shows, where they could charge higher rates, and to sign their work — something they had never considered. “When they called us artists, I was feeling super weird,” Mr. Bautista said, “because nobody called me that before.” The guild members also pushed the Bautistas to think bigger with their designs. The couple started incorporating Bauhaus and Pacific Northwest influences into their work. “We’re trying to blend our traditions and where we are right now,” Ms. Bautista said. The Bautistas hope to build a bigger studio where they can host their own workshops. Their goal is to fully rely on the weaving business — and, along the way, share their ancient craft with as many people as possible. “Weaving helps a lot to heal all things in life,” Mr. Bautista said. “If you find that momentum and joy, everything flows.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/style/zapotec-couple-rug-weaving.html,Culture,BBC,By Susan Shain and Erin Schaff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10artofcraft-rugmaker-PROMO-kcml/10artofcraft-rugmaker-PROMO-kcml-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:01:45+00:00,adf8675bb95f090f79a73f26d1ed0ad96a2f816b

0b73f0d42114,"Jim McNeely, Innovative Composer for Jazz Big Bands, Dies at 76","jim mcneely, music, carnegie hall jazz band, vanguard jazz orchestra, stan getz quartet, obituary","Jim McNeely, a Grammy Award-winning musical artist who played piano with prominent ensembles like the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, the Stan Getz Quartet and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, but who was best known for his invigorating big-band compositions, died on Sept. 26 at his home in Manhattan. He was 76. His daughter Clare McNeely said the cause was bile duct cancer. “He transformed the art of writing music for big bands,” the composer Darcy James Argue said in an interview. “He writes so fluidly for big band, creates these wonderful colors and textures and makes the structures feel so natural and inevitable.” To critics, Mr. McNeely was as deft at arranging other people’s music as he was at composing his own. Reviewing the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra’s album “Lickety Split: Music of Jim McNeely” in 1997, the critic Gene Seymour wrote in Newsday, “McNeely shows an enviable gift for unexpected yet logical paraphrasing and harmonic change-ups.” A year later, when the keyboardist Chick Corea performed at Carnegie Hall with the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, Jon Pareles of The New York Times singled out Mr. McNeely’s arrangement of Mr. Corea’s “Matrix” as the concert’s highlight. “The tune is a witty line for a 12-bar blues that Mr. Corea recorded in 1968,” Mr. Pareles wrote. “Thirty years later, he and Mr. McNeely kept turning it inside out: placing it in a one-chord meditation, having the band play parts of Mr. Corea’s original solo as he improvised comebacks, finding new implications in the harmony.” Mr. McNeely received 12 Grammy nominations and shared one for best large jazz ensemble album, for the Vanguard orchestra’s 2008 recording “Monday Night Live at the Village Vanguard.” The release featured performances of several composers’ works, including Mr. McNeely’s, from the band’s Monday dates at that storied Manhattan jazz club. In a posthumous tribute to Mr. McNeely in the publication Jazz Times, the pianist and composer Ethan Iverson wrote, “He created the paradigm for bringing fresh new ideas about line, harmony, rhythm, sound and musical architecture into the vocabulary of large-ensemble jazz.” James Harry McNeely Jr., was born on May 18, 1949, in Chicago. His father sold advertising. His mother, Jeanne Marie (Cronin) McNeely, was a secretary before she married and later oversaw the home. Jim began taking piano lessons at 6 and began studying with a teacher, Bruno Michelotti, who taught him theory “and how to read a lead sheet so I could look at music with chord symbols and play a song,” he told The Star-Ledger, of Newark, in 2010. “Bruno laid the foundation for everything that happened after that.” When he was 13 and was turned on to jazz by listening by Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and other artists, he said, “I found that from Bruno’s lessons, it clicked.” He attended Notre Dame High School for Boys (now Notre Dame College Prep) in Niles, Ill., because it had a big band. There, he wrote his first arrangement, for a blues number by the saxophonist Ernie Wilkins . During a rehearsal, Mr. McNeely t old the music website Jazz Composers Present, “The first time the sax broke into the five-part harmony I had written, I thought to myself, ‘This is the coolest thing I have ever heard in my life.’” He attended the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he wrote music for the school’s big band. After dropping out a few times to play in jazz groups, he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in music in 1975. In New York City, he played with the trumpeter Ted Curson’s septet and formed his own quartet before joining the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra (which would evolve into the Vanguard orchestra) in 1978. He stayed with the group for six years, believing he would remain a pianist, but he began to write music, influenced by Mr. Jones and by the valve trombonist and arranger Bob Brookmeyer , the band’s musical director. “While I may have moved into many different areas as a composer/arranger,"" Mr. McNeely told Mr. Iverson in an interview in 2011 on the website Do the M@th, “I still find myself asking, when confronted with a compositional question, ‘What would Bob do here?’” Mr. McNeely’s busy, peripatetic career included stints performing with Mr. Getz as well as the saxophonist Phil Woods . In addition to serving as composer-in-residence with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, he composed for jazz orchestras throughout Europe and was the chief conductor of the Frankfurt Radio Big Band from 2010 to 2022. He was also musical director of the BMI Jazz Composers Workshop for 14 years, mentoring young writers. Besides his daughter Clare, Mr. McNeely is survived by his wife of 40 years, Marie (Dempsey) McNeely; two other children, Grace and Peter McNeely; a brother, Tom McNeely; a sister, Connie McNeely; and a grandson. Last month, Mr. McNeely attended a sold-out celebration of his music by an 18-piece big band at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music in Manhattan. “He had spoken with the producers about ideally who he would like to play on each piece — and they all showed up!” Clare McNeely wrote in a text. The roster of musicians included the guitarist John Scofield and the saxophonist Chris Potter. Mr. Argue, one of the organizers, said that while he found it overwhelming to watch Mr. McNeely’s reaction during the concert, “I stole a few glances.” “He had a smile on his face,” he recalled. “His wife, Marie, told me afterward that he was humming along with the melodies.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/arts/music/jim-mcneely-dead.html,Culture,BBC,By Richard Sandomir,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09McNeely--gtbh/09McNeely--gtbh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T22:27:50+00:00,6f691d30b627342c5fd7a93e9c0d5c41167ceca2

A federal judge in New York on Thursday dismissed the defamation and harassment lawsuit brought by Drake , the Canadian superstar born Aubrey Drake Graham, in January, calling “Not Like Us” the “metaphorical killing blow” in “perhaps the most infamous rap battle in the genre’s history,” while ruling that its lyrics constituted “nonactionable opinion,” meaning it could not be found to be defamatory. “The issue in this case is whether ‘Not Like Us’ can reasonably be understood to convey as a factual matter that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with minors,” the judge, Jeannette A. Vargas, wrote. “In light of the overall context in which the statements in the Recording were made, the Court holds that it cannot.” Initially released in May 2024, “Not Like Us” became the defining and deciding song in a rapid flurry of back-and-forth attacks by the rappers, who released eight tracks targeting one another with what the court called “increasingly heated rhetoric, loaded accusations and violent imagery.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/arts/music/drake-kendrick-lamar-not-like-us-lawsuit-dismissed.html,Culture,BBC,By Joe Coscarelli,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09cul-drake-lawsuit-ltqm/09cul-drake-lawsuit-ltqm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T21:47:34+00:00,6df7f956030e28dc6d97a0fe688042abf40dd5d0
ff2eb9b96a5a,Review: Is Dylan Mulvaney ‘The Least Problematic Woman in the World’?,"theater, dylan mulvaney, the least problematic woman in the world, lucille lortel theater, abigail barlow, toby marlow, ingrid michaelson, lucy moss, mark sonnenblick, off broadway theater, transgender, tiktok","This is a wink to the operatic fallout of “Beergate,” and Mulvaney’s stories and original songs boomerang between the serious and salacious. The opening number, which imagines a previous earthbound life of her founder-angel who fatally drowned “in the Jacuzzi on Epstein island,” seems apposite for this onetime cast member of “The Book of Mormon.” The show’s polished, witty pop songs were written by a gold-star collective of Abigail Barlow (“The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical”), Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss (“Six”), Ingrid Michaelson (“The Notebook”) and Mark Sonnenblick (“The Devil Wears Prada”). The upbeat numbers — with the occasional reflective ballad — track a roller-coaster story of timid self-questioning and raucous self-discovery. Mulvaney is variously tough, vulnerable, hilarious (her stricken expressions are pure screwball-comedy heroine), horny, done-in and all-conquering. Her Roman Catholic faith is a quiet constant in the show. We see her seeking guidance as a “mature” 4-year-old (who knows God has “put me, a girl, into what appears to be a boy’s body”), then in a school uniform (“very Diane Keaton”) and as a teenager working in a Lush store where her nemesis is an older gay man. We also observe her conflict-marked relationship with her mother (a W.W.E.-style parody, “Mother and Gay Son Wrestling”), her embrace of her previous identity as a gay man and, after transitioning, her farewell to that self (“Kill the twink,” she proclaims, in a glittering pink church robe). Her reflections on the boycott are the most powerfully realized and acted part of the show — particularly set against the backdrop she describes of a second Trump administration focused on curtailing trans rights . The irony of the political and cultural firestorms that have raged around her is that Mulvaney would rather be a performer and ham than trans activist and spokesperson. As a small-scale, showy show, “The Least Problematic Woman in the World” is impeccably styled, featuring exuberant costuming by Enver Chakartash and a very pink apothecary-meets-purgatory set by Tom Rogers, with astute lighting by Cha See and video design by Caite Hevner.

She was 101. Her death, in a hospital, was announced by the nonprofit organization Ruth Weiss Gesellschaft, founded in Germany by Ms. Weiss’s friends to promote her work. Her long life and the hundreds of articles and many books she wrote were shaped by twin experiences of discrimination: first, as a girl, when her life was upended after the Nazis came to power in 1933, and then, three years later, when her family immigrated to Johannesburg on one of the last refugee boats allowed into South Africa. From being an object of exclusion and persecution, she became a witness to it. And like many other refugee Jews, she became a determined opponent of apartheid. “Blacks under apartheid — Jews under the swastika. Was it all that different?” she asked in a lecture in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1979, as she recounted in her 2014 memoir , “A Path Through Hard Grass: A Journalist’s Memories of Exile and Apartheid.” In her 2014 memoir, “A Path Through Hard Glass,” Ms. Weiss recounted with repugnance the brutal treatment of Black people that she witnessed as a young woman in South Africa. Credit... Basler Afrika Bibliographien, Namibia She concluded that it was not. Her discursive memoir is shot through with repugnance at the brutal treatment of Black people that she witnessed as a young woman in her adopted land. Her friend Nadine Gordimer , the Nobel Prize-winning South African novelist, lauded Ms. Weiss’s “natural modesty” in her introduction to the memoir. It was that self-effacing quality, paradoxically, that launched Ms. Weiss’s career in journalism: her willingness to write on behalf of someone else. During the 1950s in Johannesburg, she was married to a fellow-refugee journalist named Hans Weiss, who, though a correspondent for German newspapers, was often unable to work because he suffered from depression and other illnesses. Ms. Weiss wrote some of his articles for him, under his name — initially the ones dealing with economics, as she had worked for a large South African insurance company — and, in the process, she became a journalist. She also took over his other journalism work, she wrote in her memoir. “This became the pattern of our lives.” When their marriage began to founder in the early 1960s, she blossomed as a journalist — but now under her own name. She became the business editor of the fortnightly South African magazine News Check and later was a correspondent for the country’s leading business weekly, Financial Mail. She accepted overseas assignments for both publications, traveling throughout Africa and Europe. “It was an exciting and busy time for the media,” she wrote. “We covered the emergence of MK” — the military wing of the African National Congress, the oldest liberation movement in Africa — “the arrests and detentions, and the government’s decision to leave the Commonwealth and turn South Africa into a republic on 31 May 1961.” But the pressures on Ms. Weiss and her liberal friends were intense. “I never parked in front of certain houses,” she wrote, referring to the houses under surveillance by the Special Branch, South Africa’s secret police. “Telephone calls were kept short and to the point. The multiracial parties of the fifties were a thing of the past.” She recalled meeting Nelson Mandela. “I was having dinner at a friend’s house when her cook came in and whispered something to her,” Ms. Weiss wrote. “She excused herself and returned a few minutes later, asking if I could help her in the kitchen. A large man was sitting at the table, enjoying a plate of soup. He smiled at us. Nelson Mandela. At that time he was on the run.” Through it all — even before she began working as a journalist — Ms. Weiss’s hatred of apartheid was unwavering. “I don’t like your system,” she told her astonished employer at the insurance company, a nationalist Afrikaner named Chris Bischoff. “I think it’s unjust and must be abolished.” In 1966, after the birth of her son, she was offered a job by The Financial Mail as bureau chief in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe). With the situation in South Africa growing increasingly untenable, she eagerly accepted. But she soon ran afoul of the government there — and of Prime Minister Ian Smith , who had declared the country’s independence from Britain — by reporting on its strenuous efforts to evade crippling sanctions imposed by the United Nations. By 1968, she was living in London and had taken a job at The Guardian. “I was not allowed to return to Rhodesia, nor indeed to South Africa,” she wrote. “I received the order forbidding my entry with the threat of instant arrest if I as much as set a foot on Rhodesian soil while I was working at The Guardian.” Still, the decision to write about the evasion of sanctions had been an easy one, once she received the tip from several businessmen, although she knew it would mean the end of her time in the country, and of a job in which she had thrived for two years. “As an economic journalist, I could not simply let it go,” she wrote. “I had to find out what was happening.” Ruth Löwenthal was born on July 26, 1924, in Fürth, Germany, the younger of two daughters of Richard Löwenthal, who worked in the toy industry in nearby Nuremberg, and Selma (Cohen) Löwenthal. (One of her sister Margot’s classmates at the town’s Israelitische Realschule was a certain Heinz, later known as Henry Kissinger.) In 1933, when the Nazis took power, Ruth’s idyllic childhood ended. “I no longer had any friends,” she wrote. “Everyone sat as far away from me as possible. During the break, no one came near me.” After her father lost his job, relatives in South Africa invited him to immigrate. The family joined him in Johannesburg three years later. “We had the right skin color, even if we had the wrong religion,” she told an interviewer for the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Ruth graduated from Parktown High School for Girls in 1939. Her father ran a small grocery store, and her parents could not afford to send her to college. Instead, she joined the youth group of the Independent Jewish Cultural Association, where she met Mr. Weiss. That was “my university,” she told the German newspaper Die Zeit last year. She worked for the bookstore Mr. Weiss owned, and then for a law firm and in the insurance industry, where she became a company secretary and held positions of increasing responsibility. After her stint at The Guardian, Ms. Weiss left London and returned to Africa in 1970 as business editor of The Times of Zambia. Five years later, she moved to Germany to serve as the Africa expert at Deutsche Welle, in Cologne. By the late 1970s she was back in London, working as a freelance journalist. She went on to train journalists in the newly independent Zimbabwe in the 1980s; there she witnessed Robert Mugabe ’s rise to power, first as prime minister and later as president. She also helped found the Zimbabwe Institute of Southern Africa, a discussion forum intended to help prepare the country for the end of apartheid that met at Cold Comfort Farm, a farm outside Harare. Ms. Weiss spent much of the 1990s living on the Isle of Wight in England, where she wrote novels, children’s books and nonfiction. Among her books translated into English are “Zimbabwe and the New Elite” (1994); “Sir Garfield Todd and the Making of Zimbabwe” (1999), written with Jane Parpart; and “Peace in their Time: the Peace Process in Northern Ireland and Southern Africa” (2000). In her final decades, Ms. Weiss was in great demand as a lecturer in Germany because of her role as a so-called Zeitzeugin, or witness to history. She and Mr. Weiss divorced in the 1960s. She is survived by their son, Alexander, whom she joined in Aalborg in 2015, and a grandson. In the introduction that Ms. Gordimer wrote for “A Path Through Hard Grass,” she praised Ms. Weiss’s “innovative intelligence, political acumen and courage to take risks.” Ms. Weiss, she wrote, was “the most humane woman I have ever met.” Addressing the state Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany in 2023, Ms. Weiss said : “Racism, antisemitism and misanthropy know no borders. These are injustices that must be fought everywhere.” Kirsten Noyes contributed research.

4518608ad072,‘Boots’ Is a Sensitive Military Dramedy,"tv, boots, netflix","In the first episode of “Boots,” arriving Thursday on Netflix , a Marine recruit named Cameron Cope spots a list posted at boot camp. “The following will result in penalty,” reads the heading on that list. The second item on it: Homosexuality. The year is 1990, and Cope, played by Miles Heizer (“Parenthood,” “13 Reasons Why”), is a young gay man terrified of being outed in this aggressively homophobic environment. That’s the setup for this sensitively crafted military dramedy based on the memoir “The Pink Marine” by Greg Cope White, who is also a writer of this adaptation. It’s hard to imagine a more timely moment for these eight episodes to land. Last week Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told senior U.S. military leaders to reconsider any training or standards enacted since 1990, which have included measures to protect the rights of women, people of color and L.G.T.B.Q. people in the armed forces. “Boots,” created by Andy Parker and executive produced by the late Norman Lear, focuses on anti-gay prejudice in particular but also does a thoughtful job of highlighting the wider inequalities of the era. All the usual hallmarks of stories about Marines-in-training report for duty here: the obstacle course montages, the apoplectic drill sergeants, the shouts of “oorah!” But the show also burrows into the demanding day-to-day realities and sacrifices of military life in fresh, nuanced ways. Heizer is wonderfully vulnerable in the role of Cameron, a “weakling” who slowly begins to discover his own strength in a place that wouldn’t want him if his true identity were known. His brothers in arms bring their own baggage to serving their country, teased out in flashbacks that explain what motivated them to enlist. Vera Farmiga, the best-known member of the cast, plays Cam’s mother, a fascinating if underdeveloped character who is simultaneously warm, calculating and negligent. When Cam tells her he has signed up for boot camp, she thinks he has joined some sort of club. “Just stop for milk,” she says when he says he is leaving home for good. Without being heavy-handed, “Boots” consistently undercuts macho clichés about the Marine Corps. Even some of the needle drops, including “Fast and Frightening,” a 1990 scorcher by the all-female alt-rockers L7, emphasize that toughness is not synonymous exclusively with masculinity. The show demonstrates that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds potentially have a place in America’s military and, by extension, America itself.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/arts/television/review-boots-netflix.html,Culture,BBC,By Jen Chaney,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06watching-bqzg/06watching-bqzg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T18:33:57.401000+00:00,b6312abf0146e8864ce3b8c4805c87b3c817a4a4

Koch Theater at Lincoln Center for the New York City Ballet’s annual fall gala. “I laid out six dresses on the bed, and this was the last one before I went into a menopausal sweat,” said Bridget Everett , the comedian, “Somebody Somewhere” actress and gala co-chair, who wore a strapless dress with vertical orange and white stripes. The crowd included the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, a vice chair of the ballet company’s board, and her husband, the actor Matthew Broderick; the Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, accompanied by his fiancée, the writer and former ballerina Melanie Hamrick; the comedian Amy Sedaris; the drag king comedian and actor Murray Hill; and the reality star Olivia Palermo. But there was one notable group missing from the red carpet: the company’s dancers. In a letter sent to management, signed by the entire company, the dancers said they would boycott the red carpet and dinner portions of the event — though they would perform — because of a “lack of progress” in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement. The previous three-year agreement, negotiated with the American Guild of Musical Artists, expired Aug. 31. The dancers have continued to work under the terms of the previous agreement while negotiations proceed. According to the A.G.M.A./N.Y.C.B. negotiating committee, the dancers fulfilled their contractual obligations to perform at the gala. “We made the collective decision not to attend the dinner or walk the red carpet because we wanted our absence to be felt,” the group said in a statement. “We hoped to demonstrate, respectfully but unmistakably, how essential the artists are to this company — and how undervalued we currently feel.” The company has argued that its dancers need pay raises that keep pace with the rising cost of inflation in New York City. According to the letter , “their proposed percentage increases fall far short of what A.G.M.A. artists at nearly any other dance company nationwide have secured over the past 12 months.” And the current proposal “does not reflect the value, dedication or professional expertise that N.Y.C.B. dancers and stage managers bring to this institution.” Diana L. Taylor, the chair of the New York City Ballet’s board of directors, said in an interview at the event that the dancers “are going to do what they want to do.” “It is what it is,” said Ms. Taylor, who in 2021 became the first woman to lead the organization in its 73-year history. “We’re sad that they’re not here, but they did an amazing job tonight.” The gala performance began with “Composer’s Holiday,” featuring choreography by Gianna Reisen, music by Lukas Foss and costumes by Virgil Abloh, the Off-White designer who died in 2021. It was followed by “Herman Schmerman Pas de Deux,” performed by Tiler Peck and Roman Mejia. The piece was choreographed by William Forsythe, with music by Thom Willems and costumes by Gianni Versace and Mr. Forsythe. The program closed with the world premiere of “Foreseeable Future,” choreographed by Jamar Roberts and set to electronic music by the Venezuelan musician Arca, with costumes by Iris van Herpen. After the performances, about 800 attendees, excluding the company’s dancers, spread out at candlelit tables in the promenade for a dinner of black cod, forbidden rice and cassis cheesecake. Scattered around the room were several of the gala chairs, among them the actress Nicole Ari Parker, the actress and model Julia Fox, and the actor Hugh Dancy, as well as philanthropists including Georgina Bloomberg. The event raised about $3 million for the New York City Ballet. Sarah Jessica Parker wore a giant pair of black wings throughout the evening, including the performance and dinner. “They don’t detach!” Ms. Parker, dressed in a black-and-beige gown by Ms. van Herpen, said during dinner. “But I sat next to my husband, so he was forgiving. And they come down, so I wasn’t blocking anyone’s view.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/style/sarah-jessica-parker-new-york-city-ballet-fall-gala.html,Culture,BBC,By Sarah Bahr,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09ST-BALLET-FALL-FASHION-GALA-01-mwhg/09ST-BALLET-FALL-FASHION-GALA-01-mwhg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T17:04:45+00:00,bed024ab24c1ae7557fc64ef28400432f1a98e8e
bb7c09e405e0,"At City Ballet, Jamar Roberts Brings Fresh Air to a Fashion Gala","dance;ballet, new york city ballet, arca;alejandro ghersi, brandon stirling baker, william forsythe, roman mejia, tiler peck, gianna reisen, jamar roberts, iris van herpen, foreseeable future","Last spring, a small group of climate change activists disrupted New York City Ballet’s opening night performance , which led to the curtain coming down a few minutes into a performance of George Balanchine’s “Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.” The choreographer Jamar Roberts recognized it was jarring for the dancers, he said in a podcast. But he also understood the reason behind the protest, which was on Earth Day. In his “Foreseeable Future,” which premiered at City Ballet’s fall fashion gala on Wednesday night, he reclaims the sentiment of that protest — distress about a planet in peril — in a dance. And as dances go, it seems like it might last. The members of the company staged a protest of their own by refusing to appear on the red carpet or at the gala dinner because of a delay in their collective bargaining agreement with City Ballet. Roberts produces a beautifully tragic melding of worlds in “Foreseeable Future,” where nature exists alongside technology and where the dancers, split into two groups, are, in a sense, possessed. One squad is swept by a gently persistent breeze; the other by a stern pulse, twitching with steely precision. This ballet, Roberts’s third work for the company, has a point of view and feels the most like it comes from his choreographic voice. It’s sensitive yet tough. Formerly the resident choreographer of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, where he performed for many years, Roberts has scored his ballet to Arca, a celebrated Venezuelan-born experimental electronic musician and producer who has collaborated with artists like Björk and FKA twigs. The ballet begins on an abrasive note as the sound of a growling motor slowly fills the space. It glides between crackling noises and a softer, more plush sonic landscape that reverberates as if notes were bouncing around the quiet vastness of a forest. In “Foreseeable Future,” Roberts seems to find ways to show how a dance can be as sincere as nature. The costumes are by the daring Iris van Herpen , a former dancer whose sculptural designs mirror or bounce off elements found in nature; she is an artist, too, who doesn’t just make clothing but also finds ways for a body to become something else within it. “Foreseeable Future” uses fabric as a means of storytelling. It’s an uncanny pull between peace and conflict. The curtain opens on four dancers whose costumes feature wings that waft around their bodies and float with undulating life. The dancers raise a leg to the side with a bent knee and a flexed foot — over and over, it reads like the awkward leg of a butterfly — and point their elbows in ways that allow the fabric to undulate, inhaling and exhaling like fish drifting through water. This group — the ghost of Loie Fuller , a pioneer of light and fabric, was felt — features Isabella LaFreniere and Sara Mearns, their wings dipped in vibrant red; and Taylor Stanley and Ryan Tomash, whose wings flutter in light beige. The other group, highlighted by a luminous Emily Kikta, wears short dresses and unitards in shades of silver detailed with patterns of scales. Their movement, more vigorous, has a driving energy in its mix of angular, jutting arms and legs that buckle and straighten like pieces of machinery. This arrangement of dancers moves with tight precision whether closely knit or spread across the stage. But for all of the stuttered positions of arms and feet, Roberts’s choreography never becomes hectic, the kind you see in more formulaic contemporary ballet. Instead, it gives off a pristine sense of control as bodies work as one to create a greater whole. As the winged group, with its breezy silhouettes of flora and fauna, converges with the more robotic contingent, there is disintegration, too, and the ballet ends with Mearns and Stanley on the floor as the others form a semicircle around their bodies. They stretch their arms in a V; they lower them simply and somberly as the curtain slowly falls. It feels as if the two worlds have come together, but a moment too late. Brandon Stirling Baker’s lighting is exquisite, giving the ballet a glow as it moves from one section to the next as it sculpts the air around van Herpen’s designs and Roberts’s choreography. The lighting, washing the stage in cool greens or a hint of saffron, feeds into the ballet like atmospheric pressure — you sense it before you see it. Usually, commissions for City Ballet’s fashion gala result in rushed works with little connection between the dance and its designer. Gianna Reisen’s “Composer’s Holiday” (2017), the program opener, was part of a previous gala. It has youthful, vivacious energy, but is more memorable for its chic costumes by Virgil Abloh of Off-White. The cast was good, and the ballet gave Mia Williams, in a debut, a chance to stand out. But contemporary ballets shouldn’t always be lumped together, and “Composer’s Holiday” paled next to William Forsythe’s “ Herman Schmerman Pas de Deux” (1992). Tiler Peck and Roman Mejia, a real-life couple who can actually dance together — onstage chemistry is never a given — brought a whimsical blend of casual wit and technical wizardry to the stylish duet. Or they gave it style. It doesn’t always look this sleek. “Foreseeable Future” uses style in a different way. Its elements converge to create, strangely, a calming effect because its subject matter is less about an attitude and more about real life. Roberts shows how ballet can reveal a darker side of human existence, just as Alexei Ratmansky’s “Solitude,” also at City Ballet, did with its unsettling, stark look at the war in Ukraine. Here, Roberts values what collaboration can bring — costumes and lighting aren’t mere decoration, they serve a purpose. It was striking that there were no speeches at the gala. The only interruption was a f i lm exploring the process behind “Foreseeable Future.” These mini movie breaks are common at fashion galas, but the films usually lean into sentimentality or jokey banter. This time, it was serious and straightforward. Roberts created a world full of tension, full of shared tolerance and humanity — a real world that we, all of us, are just renting. The art spoke for itself. New York City Ballet Through Oct. 12 at the David H.

0535ee6cd60f,"In ‘Mary Page Marlowe,’ Susan Sarandon Is One Part of a Woman in Pieces","theater, old vic theater, susan sarandon, andrea riseborough, london","People are vast and contain multitudes in Tracy Letts’ play “Mary Page Marlowe,” in which five actors play the title character at different stages of her troubled life. The inventory of her travails — encompassing alcoholism, multiple failed marriages and struggles with parenthood — is recounted in 11 nonchronological fragments that add up to a portrait of embattled womanhood. Offloading to her therapist, Mary Page says she has been merely “playacting” the roles of wife and mother, and has had little agency in her life: “Like a migrating bird, I just did what seemed natural,” she says. “Mary Page Marlowe,” which premiered in 2016 at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago , had a successful run at Second Stage Theater in New York . Now, a new production directed by Matthew Warchus is running through Nov. 1 at the Old Vic in London, featuring the screen superstar Susan Sarandon as the oldest Mary Page. Sarandon, making her London stage debut, renders the character with a controlled grace, dismissively ribbing her know-it-all husband and bantering with a nurse as she processes a terminal illness diagnosis. But this is no star vehicle: Sarandon appears in only three scenes, and it’s Andrea Riseborough , the British actress who was a surprise 2023 Oscar nominee , who puts her stamp on the character. The play begins with Riseborough’s Mary Page in middle age, informing her two children that she intends to leave their father and move from Ohio to Kentucky, taking them with her. (They are alarmed at the prospect of living among “hillbillies.”) We then see Mary Page as an adolescent (played by Eleanor Worthington-Cox) at a slumber party with her girlfriends, one of whom teases her for being obsessed with Paris and Audrey Hepburn — the first of several clues to Mary Page’s lifelong, restless ennui. In her 20s and 30s, she’s a nonchalantly adulterous vixen, played with a knowing glint by Rosy McEwen. She maintains a cool distance as her married lover tries to get to know her better. This, presumably, is what she’s getting at when she tells the therapist that she sees her life in “compartments.” The various Mary Pages leave a trail of hapless husbands and lovers, who remonstrate with her in exasperated American accents of varying consistency. A poignant scene involving her 12-year-old self (Alisha Weir) offers another clue: She misses her absent father and is obliged to fix drinks for her mother, who breezily demands an old-fashioned. The emotional timbre is signposted by Rob Howell’s gloomily abstract set. The only furniture is a set of tables and stools, and a handful of props — a ’70s Dr Pepper bottle and a typewriter in one scene; a digital TV remote control in another — situate the action in historical time. Risebrough’s weary, washed-out pride is the closest thing to an anchoring presence amid the cold visuals and choppy storytelling. After hospitalizing a man while driving under the influence, she accepts a prison term with self-loathing equanimity. When she discovers her teenage son’s drug stash, Mary Page’s parental dismay is tempered by her own hedonistic disposition. She thought acid had fallen out of fashion, but “he had this beautiful sheet!” — anger gives way to hungry envy midsentence. This is a plangent tale of ordinary human woes, told with a disarming nonjudgmental candor. But if Mary Page’s story had been unfolded in a conventional, linear way, would it still have been interesting? Perhaps not: Though she is relatable in her flaws — stubborn, willful, prone to self-pity — her troubles can seem generic; at times, the piece feels like a deconstructed soap opera, where the challenge of piecing together the puzzle stands in for the pleasures of drama. When Mary Page tells us that accountancy is more interesting than it looks, because you can extrapolate a detailed picture from a handful of receipts, we can sense Letts winking at the audience. It’s a neat touch, but the point is needlessly labored in a closing segment involving a quilt made up of patches depicting the lives of multiple women. We get it, Mr. Letts! In one respect, the play succeeds too thoroughly for its own good. Using multiple actors for a single character produces an estranging effect that feels true to the what memories feel like: When we reflect on past selves, they can indeed seem like entirely different people. The downside is that the five-fifths of Mary Page add up to less than a whole person onstage, and if we can’t know her, we can’t buy into her. The result is a strangely clinical melodrama that, rather like its protagonist, never really lets us in.

I’ll Take It!,"text messaging, careers and professions, social media, computers and the internet, tech industry, fraud, draftkings, walter isaacson, linkedin, bluesky, substack, swagbucks","It’s not, by many measures, a good time to be looking for work. As The Wall Street Journal put it succinctly on Oct. 8: “The Unofficial Jobs Numbers Are In and It’s Rough Out There.” Things are so bad that even the person who puts out the federal government’s employment numbers got fired . It’s even worse for me. As a professional magazine writer, my career prospects are not what they used to be. And yet, about six months ago, I started getting deluged with offers. Sometimes multiple times a day. Instead of coming from personal connections, these exciting opportunities were coming unbidden via text. At first, I thought this was weird, but everything happens to me through my phone now. It makes sense that my next job would come from a text that began, “Hi there! 👋 I’m Angelina from Swagbucks.” This new era of opportunity seemed friendly. Plus, this was an opportunity at Swagbucks. Unlike my employment experience, which was largely at corporations with ridiculous 20th-century names such as Tribune Company and Time Inc., this sounded like the type of cutting-edge company I need to be part of. Finally, I would have something to brag about to buddies on LinkedIn who are the head of gamification pipelines at DraftKings or the chief disruption facilitator at Kraken. The best part of the job, according to Angelina — but definitely not me — was that I could work from home. Another aspect of the job that she mistakenly thought I would enjoy was that it would take me only an hour a day. For that hour, I’d be compensated $100 to $500, which seemed like a pretty wide range for a job that didn’t sound like stripping. Best of all, Angelina was willing to train me. I’d be learning the important skills required to “test and review products or services.” The only job requirement was that I be 21 or older, which implied that most of the products I would be testing would be alcohol. It was starting to make sense why I’d be working from home. The competition for the job wasn’t that intense, since it consisted of only one other person on the group text. And over three days, that stoned loser couldn’t even get it together to reply “yes” or “no,” as Angelina from Swagbucks so clearly instructed. Look, did this offer seem a little sketchy? Not really, given that everything seems pretty sketchy now. Product testing for Swagbucks doesn’t sound like a crazier occupation than TikTok food influencer, meme coin trader or ICE agent. In order to prepare for my Swagbucks interview, I did some research into these job offers by text. I learned what I already knew: that it’s a scam. The fake company would have me perform some incomprehensible, mindless, macrodata-refinement-type tasks like on “Severance.” Then I’d watch my earnings accrue in an account on the corner of some website before finally being asked to use my own money to buy Bitcoin to open an account in order to have that large sum sent to me. Which never would happen. It’s the Spanish prisoner con, only much crueler because it forces its victims to figure out how to buy crypto. “We’re seeing this more now, mostly because the job market is slowing and people are feeling the pressure. Scammers know how to take advantage of that distress,” said Matt Schemmel, the senior director of trust for Indeed, which is the largest job website in the United States and one that definitely does not employ “Evelyn from the Indeed hiring team,” who in June texted me an offer for a job “helping businesses on the Indeed platform manage and refresh their listings to improve visibility.” Which, oddly, is what is happening in this paragraph. Evelyn is good. I asked Mr. Schemmel to look over my Swagbucks offer to see what tricks it was using that companies utilize for real job listings. He said none of them. “The sender is using a generic email address that isn’t tied to any company, which is a red flag. Another warning sign is they ask you to follow up with a completely different phone number,” he said. “On top of that, the offer itself sounds suspicious — up to $500 a day for just an hour of work?” He clearly has no idea how long it takes to write an article. Using Mr. Schemmel’s advice, I did some due diligence on Swagbucks. The results were far more dispiriting than I had assumed. Swagbucks, it turns out, is a real company. It’s a 17-year-old California outfit that is the web’s most popular consumer rewards program, recommended by this very newspaper of record in an article headlined “4 Free Apps That Can Earn You Extra Cash. ” Swagbucks has partnerships with Disney, Walmart, Amazon and Home Depot. It’s owned by Prodege, a company near me in Los Angeles that also owns Sodahead, Bitburst, Tada and Upromise. I am 54, reaching an age when I can be easily scammed. An age when the difference between a fake world and a real one that I don’t understand is too subtle to perceive. When the slowing down and loneliness that come from not being needed make me so eager to participate that I will fool myself about opportunities. This will cost me, I know. I’d better accumulate as many Swagbucks as possible while I still can.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/opinion/culture/a-scammy-job-offer-over-text-ill-take-it.html,Society,BBC,By Joel Stein,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/opinion/12stein-image-snake/12stein-image-snake-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-12T13:00:07+00:00,18b93f17a001be68367bf08dc30bcf1b086cee3b
93be2dfb8e7e,Trump Is Pitting Us Against One Another in Chicago,"illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, police brutality;police misconduct;police shootings, black lives matter, civil unrest, black people;african american;african-american, george floyd protests;minneapolis protests, immigration detention, immigration, immigration and customs enforcement;ice, republicans, donald trump, chicago, the chi","The fragrant steam rose from the plates of pasta like mist from a hot spring as the famished Venezuelan newcomers lined up to eat on a frozen Chicago November afternoon in 2023. Many arrived in shorts and flip-flops. I had partnered with local restaurateur Eldridge Williams to help feed and clothe the group, who had been bused up to my hometown along with other “sanctuary cities” run by Democrats by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas as part of an inhumane political stunt. Chicagoans stepped up to aid these people in need. It was a strain, as Mr. Abbott knew it would be. The newly elected mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, had to reallocate already tight resources to help. Much of the responsibility of providing for the Venezuelans ended up being shouldered by Chicago’s Black community: Shelters were placed in our neighborhoods, and services were diverted away from our most vulnerable. Having to take care of the needs of the new arrivals would quickly stir up resentment in a population that was already hurting. Just as Mr. Abbott had hoped, many Chicagoans wondered why the migrants’ plight had to be our problem to solve. The apparent chaos of these arrivals, hyped by the right-wing media, helped re-elect Donald Trump. And it led directly to what happened this past week, when the federal government began treating my city like enemy territory. Rappelling out of helicopters like in a scene from “Black Hawk Down,” federal agents raided an apartment building in the predominantly Black community of South Shore, knocking down doors, separating children from their zip-tied parents and detaining people barely clothed. Many people in Chicago assumed the targets of this action would be limited to immigrants, some of whom were, according to Trump administration officials, engaged in criminal activity. But the effects rained down on Black citizens who were caught up in the raid, too. Some Black Chicagoans expressed indignation and disbelief at seeing us be brutalized by Mr. Trump’s deployments, with one young brother exclaiming as he watched federal agents appear to choke a Black man on the street, “Y’all supposed to be choking Mexicans.” At its heart, his comment speaks to Mr. Trump’s success in dividing us from one another and our humanity: a nagging devil on the shoulder of struggling Americans barely scraping together the rent and telling them someone else is to blame. It also reflects the divisions within the African diaspora, where it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that—like my own father—many Black people are also immigrants, experiencing their own traumas at the sight of these cruelties. I visited the apartment complex on 75th Street and South Shore Drive after the raid. A friend of mine who is a journalist, Maira Khwaja of the Invisible Institute , had been one of the first on the ground and warned me of the wreckage that had been left behind by the mayhem, but seeing it in person was shocking. Tension loomed in the air even days later. A child’s soiled pink unicorn toy seemed to cry out for help beneath a broken headboard and an uprooted mattress. My heart breaks for the lessons of worthlessness being taught to these children. Conversations with the victims of ICE’s South Shore raid reveal a people divided. One man expressed love for his new Venezuelan neighbors, one of whom helped him fix his car. Others burn with contempt, like a hot coal in weathered hands. These are hands that all too often can’t find work and are perfectly primed for pointing the finger. “I don’t agree with how they did it, but they needed to get them out,” said one disgruntled neighborhood resident. And I get it: Not long ago, I welcomed a friend home from prison with the help of Gov. JB Pritzker. I was hopeful he’d be eligible for subsidized housing through the state’s re-entry programs, only to find that many of the opportunities had been siphoned off to the Venezuelan immigrants, and nothing was available. A crisis of conservative design, this desperate scramble for scarce resources is a rife breeding ground for ethnic animosity. The reality of the Black American experience is that being at the heel of a racially unjust society means that the oppression of anyone invariably affects us. Chicago has real problems and festering resentments. As industrial jobs shriveled up in the 1970s and redlining created hypersegregated neighborhoods, poverty was highly concentrated into Black communities on the South and West Sides, and along with it all of the symptoms of unemployment. Huge public housing projects were built, neglected, then torn down. Some criminal activity that had been concentrated in the projects became more dispersed . Meanwhile, the police weren’t always exactly there to protect and serve. Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs. This is the city of the disgraced detective Jon Burge, who, after leaving the military police, joined the Chicago Police Department and deployed what have been likened to military black sites to torture what has been estimated to be over 100 Black men in the 1970s to early ’90s, causing the city to pay out over $100 million in settlements. After Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014, protests erupted downtown over his death. Then, after George Floyd, as in other cities full of people fed up with police brutality, many of us took to the streets. Some protesters vandalized property in that heated moment. The question now is: How will Chicago’s residents respond? The protests started small, but as the stakes of the federal incursion ramp up, with Mr. Trump ordering Department of Homeland Security agents in and attempting to deploy the National Guard as well (which has been blocked , for now, by the courts), the crowds have gotten bigger and the mood more defiant. The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls. All of this could eventually provoke peaceful demonstrators into revolt, which would also turn Chicago into the “war zone” Mr. Trump and his administration keep saying our city is, as a justification for his sending in his forces in the first place. In Season 7 of Showtime’s “The Chi,” a show on which I appear as the character Jamal, there’s a moment when he’s shot in an attack meant for someone else and he has to wrestle with how to respond. In my creative exploration for the role, I contemplated the enormous weight of forgiveness and restraint. I sat in silence with Jamal’s gnawing, burning urge for revenge. I thought of the damage and the destruction it would do to his family, to his younger sister, who was left abandoned during Jamal’s previous incarceration. And ultimately, for the greater good of himself, and his loved ones, my character decided against it. “The Chi” is fiction. In no way am I asking the people of Chicago to forgive the thuggish tactics of the Trump administration and other Republicans, but perhaps to consider, in our response, the damage that can be done to ourselves by a lack of organization, unity and intention in our action. If anything positive is to come from this moment, I hope it can be a reminder that we must stand up for the human rights of everyone if we expect to continue to have those rights ourselves.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/opinion/mensa-ice-raids-chicago-black-citizens.html,Society,BBC,By Vic Mensa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12mensa-mkfh/12mensa-mkfh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T11:00:20+00:00,618bc0cb9f1415ea1a3524c36ab6e802226fd4b0
9575c3715b23,The Uncomfortable Truth About Netanyahu’s ‘Victory’,"israel gaza war, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, gaza strip, rafah, west bank, israel, donald trump","Questions linger about whether the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas will hold, and how — or if — the parties will move on to the far thornier issues in the U.S.-sponsored plan that led to it. Still, it’s clear that this breakthrough signals the beginning of the end. That is, it is clear to most except the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is minimizing the deal’s scope while selling it as a diplomatic, moral and security triumph: Israel keeps troops in most of Gaza even after freeing the hostages, with no firm timeline for further withdrawal. The government voted to approve the first phase of the agreement — the hostage and prisoner exchange, the military pullback in Gaza, increased humanitarian aid to the strip, and the cease-fire. It did not address the harder issues: the full withdrawal to the security perimeter, Gaza’s governance and “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” as later phases of the deal called for. Journalists close to Mr. Netanyahu were blunt: “There’s no phase two. That’s clear to everyone, right?” Amit Segal wrote on social media. “What we have now is a hostage deal, and a cease-fire while talks continue in good faith.” The working assumption in Jerusalem, it seems, is that while full-scale combat won’t resume, the Israeli military may keep striking wherever it detects threats. Yet here’s the uncomfortable truth: This “victory” is actually a defeat — a necessary and blessed defeat — of this government’s messianic vision. In fact, the agreement directly contradicts what the government has sold Israelis for two years: the promise of total victory and the destruction of Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu repeatedly rejected cease-fires, calling any pause a surrender to Hamas and terrorism, demanding total victory . Ministers vowed to obliterate Hamas’s military and end its governance permanently. The government painted an alluring picture of Gaza’s transformation. Mass evacuations would relocate Palestinians. The Defense Ministry set up a Gaza “voluntary” emigration directorate and in September Mr. Netanyahu reportedly met with defense officials and cabinet ministers and discussed plans to start moving Gazans out. Officials hailed the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-overseen aid organization that supplanted U.N. and other relief efforts. Israeli settlements in Gaza would be rebuilt and Gaza would turn into a “real-estate bonanza.” West Bank territory would be largely annexed . The Palestinian Authority would have no role in Gaza’s postwar governance. Reality has demolished nearly every promise. Hamas survives. Under the entire plan President Trump proposed, which Mr. Netanyahu agreed to, the group would disarm but not disappear, with leaders offered amnesty or exile. The organization would still have some control even as it theoretically surrenders power. Indeed, within hours of the Israeli military’s withdrawal, Hamas began deploying security personnel to Gaza City and instructed the public to obey them. Based on previous cease-fires, the organization will quickly show more signs of governance by providing municipal services, managing hospitals and running aid distribution. The hard truth is that Hamas is part of the Palestinian polity. It should have never become the de facto sovereign of a territory with independent international relations and control over international crossings, but it was Israel’s policy over the past four decades that turned Hamas into the monstrous organization it has become — allowing the Muslim Brotherhood, the group from which Hamas derived, to operate with relatively little oversight in Gaza in the early 1970s as a counter to the Palestine Liberation Organization and later facilitating the transfer of billions of dollars from Qatar to the Hamas government. Containing Hamas, mitigating its negative influence and even disarming it are reasonable aspirations, which might be achieved through a long-term effort. But contrary to the Israeli government’s vows, Hamas is not going anywhere. Neither are the people of Gaza, despite pressure from the far right to claim the territory for Israel. Mr. Trump’s plan makes explicit that it “will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.” The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is excluded from the current humanitarian coordination structure, which is for now — surprise, surprise — back largely at the United Nations. The idea of Israeli settlements in Gaza? Abandoned, according to the plan. West Bank annexation? Shelved after Mr. Trump said on Sept. 25 that he would not allow it. The government’s limited view of the agreement — whether calculated or delusional — is at odds with Mr. Trump’s vision. It ignores his commitment to more than a pause in fighting. “This is more than Gaza. This is peace in the Middle East, and it’s an incredible thing,” he said on the Fox News program “Hannity” on Wednesday. The government must also reckon with the determination of other interested nations. Seeking to bolster their leadership in the region and standing with the Trump administration, Arab states are reportedly open to pushing Hamas toward disarmament, however unsatisfying the results may be to Israeli eyes. The Gulf states, Egypt and Turkey are backing a multinational stabilization force, pledging funding for reconstruction and promising to push the Palestinian Authority into genuine reforms so it can govern Gaza again. What made Mr. Netanyahu make a decision against his natural inclination to kick the can down the road, as well as agree to pretty much everything he said he opposed? Simply, Mr. Trump. Israel’s botched attempt to assassinate members of the Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar, began a cascade of events that led the president and his Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish counterparts to pressure Israel on one side, and Hamas on the other, into signing onto a framework agreement and apparently negotiating the details later. Saying “No,” or “Yes, but,” and playing for time was not an option. It is understandable why Mr. Netanyahu’s government celebrates the agreement but at the same time winks that the cease-fire may be temporary and a strategic achievement. Admitting otherwise means acknowledging an unbearable truth. That is that Israel’s longest major war in history, hostages held captive for over two years in unbearable conditions and many dying in captivity, some 2,000 Israeli casualties, more than 67,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, Gaza reduced to rubble, Israel’s international isolation — all of it led not to the promised vision but to a negotiated settlement resurrecting the very ideas Mr. Netanyahu spent his career opposing. Their defeat is a victory for Israelis, Palestinians and others in the region who seek an alternative to prolonged bloodshed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/opinion/israel-palestinians-gaza-netanyahu-peace-deal.html,Society,BBC,By Shira Efron,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/12efron-vkbh/12efron-vkbh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T11:00:12+00:00,80b1a4aed6dbc2232ff3e060bf3b2e4f7e8f4d80
e0650dd8cfbe,How a Trump Judge Exposed the Trump Con,"us politics, social media, presidential power, judiciary, federal courts, alien enemies act, immigration and customs enforcement;ice, national guard, portland oregon, oregon, us","Earlier this month, a federal judge appointed by President Trump in 2019, did the worst thing you can do to Trump in a court of law: She took him seriously. She read his words, found them disconnected from reality and acted accordingly. For a very long time, Trump and his supporters have gotten away with a double game. First, they’ll cheer anything and everything that makes him a thoroughly unconventional president — from his bizarre social media posts to his extreme use of executive power — as necessary, absolutely necessary, to save the country and drain the swamp. But when Trump’s unprecedented behavior meets with an unprecedented response, MAGA is aggrieved. How dare you treat him differently from other presidents, they say. The most obvious example is the sense of grievance around the former special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment of Trump for his role in trying to steal the 2020 election. Trump orchestrated a fraudulent campaign to change the outcome of an election. Instead of admitting that extraordinary actions can lead to extraordinary reactions, MAGA was furious that Trump was the first former president to face a federal indictment. Time and again, the pattern repeats. When Trump is on offense, he’s celebrated as a president like no other. But when he has to answer for his actions in court, he demands that he be treated as a president like any other. Trump’s National Guard deployments represent another example. He’s posting wildly false statements about American cities online, and then he’s directing that soldiers be sent to cities governed by officials he sees as his political enemies, even though none of the historic circumstances that have justified military deployments in the past — like widespread unrest — are present.

5f56d15ef3fc,Why Americans Disagree on Everything,"philosophy, us politics, buddhism, jacques derrida","Jacques Derrida, the philosopher (and antiphilosopher), recognized the problem with binaries. He was an enemy of simple, dualistic thinking. His deconstruction often attempted to show how one side of a binary pair was actually informed by many of its supposed opposite’s values and assumptions. Mr. Derrida worried that compulsive binary thinking, in which one seeks opposition everywhere, could readily lead to violence. I agree with him. If Mr. Derrida’s writing gives you a mild headache, you can try a quote from the fictional character Ted Lasso: “Be curious, not judgmental.” Mr. Derrida’s curiosity led him to affirm the free play of the interpreting mind. He called for a form of thinking that was not based on the tension of opposites but resembled an ever-expanding web of rich associations. Freud, one of the most Western of thinkers, thought that there was a natural hostility between people. He believed that most of the people he passed on the street did not wish him well. A person influenced by the great Eastern texts, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita , would be likely to see it differently. The best state of mind is one in which you can look out on all creation, other people in particular, and say to yourself: That, too, I am. We are all part of one being; we all possess the same soul. This way of seeing does not cultivate opposition or conflict. It accepts what comes its way without picking sides and initiating strife. Jeffrey Hopkins, a scholar of Buddhism and a translator of the Dalai Lama, suggested that we approach people with a simple truth in the forefront of our minds. Not: Who is this stranger? Not, as Bertrand Russell said he spoke to himself when he met a rival philosopher: Can I take him or can he take me? No, Mr. Hopkins’s Buddhist approach was to whisper: This person is suffering. He wishes to be happy. I’m not saying we need to give up binary thinking. It’s helped us in the West to achieve a great deal. In a trial, the two sides contend in a contest that often yields justice. The scientist brings his findings to his community and invites accord or rebuttal. But binary thinking shouldn’t be the only way we think. Mr. Derrida and the Buddhist sages can teach us that there are times when we should loosen up, take a breath, stop judging. We might even go as far as to look at our supposed foes, whether they be Mr. Kirk or Mr. Trump, and say to ourselves: That, too, I am.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/opinion/derrida-trump-ted-lasso-binaries.html,Society,BBC,By Mark Edmundson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/opinion/08edmundson-still/08edmundson-still-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-12T11:00:06.148000+00:00,5d1c696073363fdceabb69ca086b8e0a76e4b384
191a51bc74d0,Why I Had to Kill Family Dinner,"cooking, recipe, children, work-life balance, family, gourmet, parenting, motherhood, fatherhood","For 18 years my family ate dinner together almost every night. We talked, we laughed, we fought, we told stories. Sometimes someone left in a huff. But still we gathered every night, most of the time at 6 o’clock, all of us in our same seats at the same table. In other words, family dinner was family life. I made dinner for my family because I wanted to and because the world told me I had to and then, three years ago, I just stopped. I didn’t want to anymore, and I’m here to tell you that you can stop, too. Your family will remain connected and whole; your kids will still grow up to be well-adjusted humans. And you might even enjoy one another a little more. I learned to cook the summer I was trying to become pregnant. My wife and I were on a vacation on Cape Cod and the house we rented had an entire bookcase of Gourmet magazines. I was 29 years old and more of a Moosewood Cookbook kind of girl. But those cooking magazines spoke to my overwhelming desire to nurture, to grow and feed a baby, a family. I must have read 20 issues during that week, and by read I mean studied. I learned how to truss a chicken, how to bake custard in a water bath and how to sear steak in a cast-iron pan. When we returned home, I started cooking. Tagines and chili, pilafs, ratatouille, salmon in parchment. In a family, the person who learns to do a job well becomes the person who does that job. It’s a simple law of domestic life, one I didn’t know when I was copying those Gourmet recipes into my journal. By the time our first daughter was born, I was officially the family cook. Over the years I kept recipe books and files, a dinner diary, master shopping lists. I amassed an enviable collection of pans and bakeware, cloth napkins, candles. I loved all the objects. But did I love family dinner? Did it feed me? These were the questions I asked myself a few years ago when my older daughter was heading off to college. Yes, I did love family dinner, sort of. Sometimes. But I didn’t love the work. I didn’t love the daily obligation, the repetition. I didn’t like waking up in the morning when I should have felt the whole day ahead of me, full of promise, but instead thought about dinner. I didn’t want to do it anymore, but I felt terrible about giving it up. The messaging on family dinner is intense! I would like to get the PR machine behind family dinner working for the end of gun violence in America. Family dinner will make your children smart! It will keep your children off drugs! Your children will learn languages, turn away from vaping and join model U.N. if you just sit together at the table for 15 minutes every evening, a plate of food in front of you. It seems like such a light lift for such enormous payoff, and the alternative — well, the alternative is so terrifying, so dire you don’t even want to consider what might happen. But family dinner is an extraordinary amount of work, ill timed to coincide with the one period of the day when no one wants to do any work. Which is why we have the family dinner industrial complex, which began with the Crock-Pot and now includes all manner of fryers, sheet pans, foodstagrammers, viral TikTok recipes and cookbooks with names like “What to Cook When You Don’t Feel Like Cooking” and “I Dream of Dinner (So You Don’t Have To).” But none of these contraptions actually put the food on the table. And the endless recipes just add to the burden, giving home cooks too many possibilities, too much to live up to. I wish I could say what it was exactly that released me from the weight of family dinner, what inner voice or higher power calmed my fear of letting my kids down nutritionally and spiritually. I’m not even sure I was released so much as I simply surrendered to the truth that it was over. I just couldn’t bring myself to make dinner anymore. “I can’t make another dinner,” I told my mother, my sister, my best friend. “I’m quiet quitting dinner,” I told people I barely knew. “You’re on your own for dinner tonight,” I told my wife and kids. “Great!” they said. We were all tired of family dinner. Now, I make simple meals a few times a week, and on other nights we rely on takeout and cereal. Often we don’t eat the same things or at the same time. I go out to dinner with friends more often or to an evening weight lifting class. Sometimes my wife and I eat cheese and crackers while we play mahjong on the porch and our daughter eats a burrito in her room after tennis practice. I love the ease and relaxation of those nights. I wish we’d done this sooner. The best part of giving up family dinner is finding new traditions. For some families this might be a walk around the block, an evening bike ride. For our family — for so many families, I’m sure — it’s TV. Every evening, we gather in the living room and decide, together, on a show to watch. We eat toast or ice cream or potato chips, and occasionally I make pancakes. Sometimes I roll out my yoga mat and do a little stretching, although mostly I just lie on it with the dog. And we talk. Oh, how we talk! “Guess what?” my daughter will say, walking into the room as I queue up an episode of “Gilmore Girls” or “Parks and Recreation,” or anything we’ve already seen dozens of times, the show’s familiarity allowing it to fade into the background of our conversation. “What?” I’ll ask in anticipation of her news, sure to be more delicious than any Gourmet dinner. Now our time together is about everyone’s pleasure, everyone’s sense of well-being and connection and relaxation, including mine. There is no work, there is no planning, and there’s no cleanup. There is just a family being together, sharing our lives.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/opinion/family-dinners-parenting.html,Society,BBC,By Erin O.

The Dilemma of Severe Mental Illness.,"transplants, mental health, disability, liver, ethics misconduct malfeasance, doctor, hospital, alcohol abuse, suicide","You walk into a room in the intensive care unit and find a man in his 30s, skin yellow and abdomen swollen with the fluid that accumulates in liver failure. He smiles, even though he is almost always uncomfortable, even though he has not left the hospital in more than a month. Family members sit anxiously at the bedside. The nurses stop by just to say hello. Without a liver transplant, he will die. Imagine that you are on the committee charged with deciding who gets a transplant. Would you add him to the list of patients waiting to receive organs? Now open the chart. This is what you’ll see: an unemployed man with a history of untreated anxiety and depression and a recent descent into alcohol abuse. Months of binge drinking have destroyed his liver. Your job on the transplant committee is to determine whether the patient will realistically comply with the rigorous post-transplant regimen and remain healthy enough for a transplant to be worthwhile. Would you list him now? My hospital declined to add this patient — my patient — to the waiting list for a transplant, but another hospital said it would consider doing so. Transplant committees regularly face complicated cases like these, and they also regularly come to different conclusions. These decisions can be especially thorny when the patient has a mental illness. Whom we choose to list for a limited resource, and whom we choose not to, reveals our biases about who is worthy of lifesaving care. My first experience grappling with such questions occurred many years ago, during my residency. I was on my I.C.U. rotation when we admitted an older teenager who was in liver failure because of a Tylenol overdose. I had never seen anyone that sick. Her blood would not clot. As the toxins that her liver could no longer filter accumulated, she became more and more confused. Her kidneys failed. It was clear that without a new liver, she would die.

The New York Times Opinion editor Kathleen Kingsbury highlights one thing you shouldn’t miss: After President Trump tried to send the National Guard into Portland, Ore., a federal judge blocked him. Watch Kingsbury explain why the president’s actions defy the fundamental principles of the U.S. Constitution. A lot has happened this week. “He addressed a ceasefire deal.” “Protesters outside of the ICE building.” “Government shutdown. No end in sight.” “Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted.” Here’s one thing you shouldn’t miss. At some point this year, you’ve probably seen President Trump send troops into Democratically led cities against the wishes of state and local officials. Then he set his sights on Portland, Oregon to quell a longstanding protest outside of an ICE facility even though in the days leading up to the order, fewer than 20 people were participating in the protest each night. “As of right now, there’s only about a dozen protesters.” What do these protests look like? “One hop this time.” “How ridiculous, the notion that we are violent.” Federal officers describe these protests as “low energy.” And how was Portland affected by these small protests? And so Portland sued President Trump. And last week, a federal judge appointed by Trump himself blocked the use of the Oregon National Guard. The judge said President Trump’s decision was untethered to facts and likely violated the Constitution. President Trump, however, found a workaround. He sent National Guardsmen from California into Oregon. The judge wasn’t having it. The next day, she called an emergency hearing where she blocked President Trump from using National Guardsmen from any state. Trump has been furious at the reaction to his orders. So why does any of this matter? By trying to get around this judge’s order, President Trump is chipping away at democracy on two crucial levels. First, the president is defying the judiciary, which is designed to be a check on executive power. And second, President Trump is using the military to go after American citizens he sees as his political opponents. And President Trump is going about this in a fundamentally un-American way. Remember, one of the reasons that the American Revolution was fought was because King George III decided to send troops into British colonies. The king was also doing this to quell dissent. So when they won, the founding fathers made sure to enshrine in the Constitution a high level of states’ rights, free speech, and the principle of civilian control over the military. At the end of the day, the president alone doesn’t get to decide when he uses the military against his own people. And if the courts say no, he must listen. That’s the American way. This Is Un-American A lot has happened this week. The New York Times Opinion editor Kathleen Kingsbury highlights one thing you shouldn’t miss: After President Trump tried to send the National Guard into Portland, Ore., a federal judge blocked him. Watch Kingsbury explain why the president’s actions defy the fundamental principles of the U.S. Constitution.

4d9e5c32f1c7,Big Football Is Ruining College Sports,"college sports, college football, ncaa men's basketball;march madness, finance, ncaa, atlantic coast conference, southeastern conference, big ten conference, big 12 conference, us","This fall, millions of Americans will gather on campuses to participate in the pageantry and tradition of college football. The level of fan dedication football inspires, and the amount of money it generates, is unmatched, making it unique among intercollegiate sports. In recent years, that pre-eminence has created a troubling imbalance in college sports. There are about 1,100 schools in the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the largest governing body for college sports, and more than 660 have football teams. But the clout lies with only a few dozen: the 68 schools that belong to the four conferences known as the Power Four. These conferences — the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Southeastern Conference, the Big Ten and the Big 12 — are so dominant that they effectively control the N.C.A.A., forcing it to shape its policies and protocols to meet their needs, to the disadvantage of smaller sports programs. As a university president and former vice chair of Division I athletics at the N.C.A.A., I have witnessed how this inequity has mushroomed, and it is clear to me that nothing less than a fundamental reordering is required: The football programs in the four major conferences should withdraw from the N.C.A.A. entirely and create a stand-alone association. That would allow these programs to reap the benefits of their popularity while not setting the course for the rest of the member schools, like a tanker pulling a line of rowboats. Why is this drastic step necessary? Consider one common misconception about major college football — that it generates much of the funding for lower-level football programs and for other sports. In reality, the massive revenue that the top football conferences generate from TV deals goes directly back to them. The rest of the N.C.A.A. membership relies almost exclusively on the revenue from the Division I men’s basketball tournament, known as March Madness. Yet the wider Division I membership shares the burden of paying for the lawsuit settlements that the Power Four schools either largely created or would benefit the most from. For example, it is expected that the biggest winners in the recent $2.8 billion settlement reached as part of the House v. N.C.A.A. lawsuit — which compensated former players and paved the way for universities to make direct payments to athletes — will be football stars from the big four conferences. However, all N.C.A.A. Division I members had to contribute to the settlement. And the Power Four dominance continues to grow out of control. This summer, the N.C.A.A. set up a new weighted governance structure that gives 65 percent of the major voting authority to the big football schools — a structure that favors those colleges. The reason? These schools invest a significant amount of money in the collegiate sports system, especially football, enhancing the attraction of all college sports, so they claim they should get to see the benefits of their investment by shaping what happens within the N.C.A.A. The problem this new structure presents is that the N.C.A.A. will now be even more focused on the demands of football and less on other sports. This could damage smaller schools’ sports programs and will most likely diminish opportunities for women and players in Olympic sports such as golf, tennis and volleyball. Deference to football has also created conference realignments that are illogical for other sports. For example, Berkeley and Stanford belong to the A.C.C. That means that Berkeley student-athletes fly from California to North Carolina to play Duke. In football, this isn’t a big deal since teams usually compete once a week, but for other sports it means flying across country back and forth multiple times in a week, creating new costs for schools and keeping athletes out of the classroom. Separating the Power Four football programs from the N.C.A.A. would help eliminate the inequities. Create a football association run by professional sports administrators, with its own rules, revenue distributions and scheduling. Some have suggested a relegation model similar to that of English Premier League soccer, where teams move among different levels of competitiveness based on their success, or lack of it. All other Division 1 football programs could remain in the N.C.A.A. and play non-scholarship football as we do at my college, the University of San Diego, which is a member of the Pioneer Football league. This would bring about a more democratic form of governance in the N.C.A.A. and support regional conferences for all other sports. It would level the playing field, bolster Olympic sports programs and lead to more competition — which is a part of the joy of watching sports. What makes the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament so exciting is that colleges and universities from dozens of conferences have an opportunity to play in the tournament, get national exposure and potentially win it all. The David-versus-Goliath nature of the tournament helps make it one of the most exciting events in college sports. In contrast, no team outside of the Power Four conferences has won a national championship in football in this century. The major football schools argue that because they earn and invest more money, they should have bigger control of the N.C.A.A. With my proposal, they can continue to exercise this power and make their own rules — just in their own elite grouping. Even without football in the mix, the N.C.A.A. can continue to run high-caliber championships in other sports since it is funded mostly through college basketball anyway. In fact, if the football programs did separate as I am suggesting, I think we would see another major realignment of athletic conferences, with schools opting for ones closer to their campuses for their other athletes. This would save those schools money and reduce time out of class as well as renew traditional rivalries. While this would be a big change, it isn’t unrealistic. For example, the West Coast Conference, in which my university plays 15 sports, doesn’t sponsor swimming or football, so we play those sports in other conferences with different rules and regulations. This would be a similar idea. As the president of a university with competitive sports teams outside of the Power Four, I think this solution is the only way to allow a level playing field for all student-athletes, nurture other non-football sports programs, support more opportunities for women and focus more attention on Olympic sports. Power Four football has always been in a league of its own. It is time to stop treating it like any other sport.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/opinion/college-football-ncaa-conference.html,Society,BBC,By James T.

cdc5ccc95423,Peace in Trump’s Time — Except Here,"us politics, presidential power, federalism, us foreign policy, us military, israel gaza war, nobel prize, donald trump, gaza strip, israel","This is one piece of gold that President Trump is never going to get his short, stubby fingers on: an 18-karat gold medal with three naked men embracing, awarded to those who promote peace, democracy and human rights. The Nobel Peace Prize has been given to some beauts — like Henry Kissinger, for helping end the Vietnam War he perpetuated to aid Richard Nixon’s re-election. But the prize was not designed for someone like Trump. The Norwegian Nobel Committee would no doubt discontinue the award before it would give it to him. His longing is partly inspired by his jealousy of Barack Obama, who absurdly got a Nobel Peace Prize after only eight months in office for just being a cool dude. Our 79-year-old president admitted recently that he also envies Obama for the way he airily bopped down the stairs of Air Force One, while he himself has to slowly creep down, grasping the railing, worried that he’ll fall and look as unsteady as Joe Biden. I’ve always thought we were lucky that Trump was not more prone to invasions, à la his fellow draft dodger Dick Cheney, given his belligerent persona, vengeful nature, fascination with military trappings and U.F.C. macho bluster. He insisted on having a military parade here in June and he’s planning a U.F.C. fight next June on the White House South Lawn for the country’s 250th birthday. Even though most liberals have tried to paint Trump as a deranged hawk at heart, the former real estate developer always seemed, blessedly, more drawn to the art of the deal than shock and awe. While he bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities, threatens Venezuela and strikes alleged drug boats off its coast, he more often seems to consider war a waste of time and money that could be better spent building a beachfront property in North Korea or Gaza.

a3a17d346716,Why Can’t Trump’s Domestic Policy Be More Like His Foreign Policy?,"us politics, us foreign policy, israel gaza war, peace process, jared kushner, donald trump, russell t. vought, steven witkoff, benjamin netanyahu, gaza strip, europe, ukraine, russia","When Donald Trump was first elected president, foreign policy seemed like the zone of greatest danger, the place where a political novice promising to remake the world order was most likely to blunder into true catastrophe. Instead, Trump’s first-term foreign policy was broadly successful, with more stability, fewer dramatic stumbles and more breakthroughs than his domestic policy efforts. And it was much more successful than the rolling crises and debacles of the Biden presidency, a contrast that was one of the underrated cases for Trump’s restoration. Now, with the provisional deal to end the war in Gaza, the pattern of Trump 1.0 is reasserting itself. As a domestic leader the president is powerful but unpopular, with a scant legislative agenda and an increasingly vendetta-driven public image. But on the world stage he is currently much more successful (allowing, yes, for strong skepticism about the administration’s China strategy). If peace in Ukraine remains elusive, Trump has induced Europe to bear more of the burden without yielding to the Russians, as many critics feared. The Iranian nuclear program and terror networks have been hammered without major blowback. And now there is the possibility of a real breakthrough in Israel and Palestine, an achievement that’s clearly the result of the White House’s strong-arming diplomatic efforts. All of which raises a question: What if Trump’s domestic policy were more like his foreign policy? Yes, presidents stymied at home often find it easier to maneuver overseas; that pattern is hardly unique to Trump. But there are still a few keys to his success on the world stage that, if applied at home, might make his domestic efforts more popular. First, float above ideology. Trump’s first-term foreign policy team was staffed by traditional Republican hawks; his second has been divided between hawks and would-be realists, who have often feuded viciously with one another. But in both periods Trump himself has moved easily between different orientations — sometimes behaving like a conventional hawk, sometimes like a realist or a dove, going hyper-Zionist one moment and putting extra pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu the next, and generally refusing to let any single ideological camp rule his agenda. On key domestic issues, by contrast, Trump has never quite shaken free of the pre-existing G.O.P. consensus, which is why his populist presidency has repeatedly delivered unpopular tax-and-spending legislation, overweighted to the interests of corporations and the rich. Meanwhile, various potential projects that might break this mold, from infrastructure and industrial policy to family policy, have been disappointing or stillborn. That’s partially because Trump has never found a consistent way to make deals with his political opposition, a contrast to the second key to his foreign policy success: Be open for dealmaking with everyone. Iran’s mullahs, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, the Taliban … even when nothing comes of it or the whole thing ends in bombing raids, Trump is eager to have the conversation, to look for the unexpected bargain, the outside-the-box deal. Critics will say that this is because Trump likes strongmen like Kim and Putin more than he likes fellow Americans who happen to be Democrats. But he’s also made deals with overseas figures whom he definitely doesn’t love, from left-leaning Eurocrats to now the leaders of Hamas. It’s only in domestic politics that he’s been unable to consistently execute the pivot from insulting rivals on social media one day to making important bargains with them the next. And despite all the “America First” talk, it’s only in domestic politics that he’s been a true unilateralist, exploring the frontiers of executive power in ways that a future president could reverse — as opposed to a situation like the Gaza deal, where the hopes for its durability rest on Pan-Arab commitment, not just American power. One reason for this difference is that in foreign policy he has followed a third rule: Let business-oriented outsiders run your negotiations. The fact that figures like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have seemingly done better — or at the very least no worse — than credentialed diplomatic professionals has striking implications for how we think about expertise in foreign policy. But it also contrasts with Trumpian domestic policy, where in the first term outsider figures like Kushner and Steven Mnuchin played notable roles, but where more second-term power is in the hands of committed partisan fighters like Stephen Miller and Russell Vought. It is Trump who has given them that power, to be clear, and many of the differences I’m describing have clearly been consciously chosen by the president. Foreign policy is for grand achievements and the pursuit of Nobel Prizes, it seems, while the domestic front is where he hopes to get revenge for years of investigations and prosecutions. If there’s anything that Middle Eastern politics should teach the president, though, it’s that true success lies somewhere outside the cycle of vengeance — if, that is, you want your victories to last.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/opinion/trump-foreign-policy-domestic.html,Society,BBC,By Ross Douthat,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12douthat-jgcz/11douthat-jgcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T11:03:26+00:00,12046005fd2450a13b332e0404dd25f0a3ca3a27
e2f3f11fa634,"This Isn’t Crisis Response, It’s Crisis Construction","illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, us politics, deportation, immigration and customs enforcement;ice, donald trump, us","Nearly nine months into President Trump’s second term, immigration enforcement has become the administration’s primary political weapon — not to solve problems, but to manufacture fear, provoke outrage and stage an illusion of control. This isn’t a crisis response. It’s crisis construction. The president’s team vowed to target gang members, murderers and rapists, but we’re not just rounding up violent offenders. We’re arresting working parents, students, asylum seekers and even U.S. citizens, to create made-for-TV crackdowns. I served as chief of staff at Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President Joe Biden and spent over a decade working in homeland security. I knew that national security requires focusing on threats — not turning law enforcement into a spectacle. Despite President Trump’s promises to go after the “worst of the worst,” in the past few months the administration has deported a preschooler who is a U.S. citizen and who has stage 4 kidney cancer and his family. A raid on a Hyundai plant where South Korean nationals were rounded up triggered an international incident and threatened future investment in Georgia. Those scenes appear to be part of a deliberate strategy of political theater. Over the next three years, detention space will be multiplied. Due process will likely be further sidelined. The broken legal immigration system won’t be fixed — it will be abandoned. The One Big Beautiful Bill signed in July will inject agencies at every level — federal, state and local — with funding for immigration enforcement. That will entrench removal as the singular goal of our law enforcement at every level of government, while focusing away from terrorism, transnational crime, cyberattacks and foreign adversaries. Federal, state and local law enforcement are already being deputized to support ICE endeavors. Nearly 14,500 law enforcement agents have been pulled off their investigations to do civil immigration work, including agents taken off the border. Nearly 3,000 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were reassigned to civil immigration enforcement, instead of focusing on their mission of national security and public safety. This is allowing fentanyl traffickers, child predators and foreign intelligence threats to operate with less scrutiny. Federal prosecutions for drug violations have dropped significantly .

Dionne thinks America’s founders made a mistake. In this round-table conversation for “The Opinions,” he tells David French and Michelle Cottle why the Constitution doesn’t fit today’s Congress. I think the biggest mistake the founders made — and they realized it pretty quickly, because they’re the ones who started the first party system — they wrote a Constitution as if political parties didn’t exist because in principle they didn’t believe in them. And so they thought the branches of government would be so jealous of their own rights, would have a kind of institutional patriotism, a phrase my friend Norm Ornstein likes to use, that that institutional conflict would be enough for one branch to check the other. In this circumstance, there is no institutional patriotism going on in Congress at all. It’s a party spirit that, for the moment, seems prepared to support President Trump on everything. And it’s clearly — and maybe David will disagree with me on this — but I think that is clearly infecting the United States Supreme Court as well.

And a lot of MAGA looks at some of the cancel culture heyday of the late 20-teens and says: Oh, we can do that, and we’ll do it better, and we’ll do it more effectively, and we’ll do it from the Oval Office down. But the pro-free speech position over the long term in American history is a very majority position. Any given individual moment, you might be cutting against the grain. But over time, the pro- free speech position is a majority American position.

I mean, he’s already axed billions of dollars of energy projects, mostly located in blue states. E.J., what do you make of all this? Dionne: There’s a terrible and kind of crazy irony to the fact that we’re having this conversation at a moment when the news has been dominated by a peace deal, or at least a cease-fire deal in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas and the release of the hostages. And if it comes off, it will be a major Trump achievement, and yet you have this talk of peace there, and then an escalation of the political war at home, as you suggest. It’s a very odd thing to be treating the outside world one way and our own country in another way. I grew up in Massachusetts. I’m accustomed to political patronage — you try to help your side when you’re in power and all of that. But the degree of punishment happening here is very hard to find any precedent for in our history. It’s really antithetical to how you operate in a constitutional republic: not persuasion, but pressure; not conversation, but intimidation; and not even a little something for everyone, but a total “I win, you lose” approach. This bodes very badly, not just for how we get out of this shutdown, but also for how we’re going to govern ourselves going forward. I’ve spent a lot of time lately reading about the 1850s, the period leading up to the Civil War, when we were really bifurcating as a nation. In this case, the leadership of the country clearly seems to be trying to deepen those divisions, which is really dangerous for a free republic. French: It’s like you have the anti-Lincoln in the White House. Dionne: Yes. French: If you’re looking at Lincoln’s first Inaugural Address, he very eloquently, eloquently sort of begged and pleaded that we must not be enemies, we must be friends. We must remain friends. And of course, that fell on deaf ears. But now you have the exact opposite going on right now in the White House.

They just — there was a priest who was praying outside an ICE facility, and it was on video, and they just shot him in the head with a pepper ball. He was doing nothing. He was a priest. He was praying. Like, we might not want American politics to be about this, but American politics is about this. The Trump administration has decided to make American politics about this, and they have used the federal government to make sure that American politics is about this. Am I surprised that the median voter, that the average American isn’t as concerned about this as they are about their own premiums? No, of course not. Because if it’s not happening in your city, and if it’s not happening in your apartment building, and you’re not paying as close attention to the news as political junkies like us, you are of course going to care more about your premiums. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not important. And that doesn’t mean that if we let this slide and we just ignore it, that Trump is going to stop at deployments in Portland and Chicago.

And now Chicago seems like the one city where he is getting more of the reaction that he wanted, because ICE’s tactics have been so militarized and so aggressive. And so the question is, we get to 2026 and the midterms and are there troops stationed by the polls? Are there paramilitary ICE agents running around the streets around the election?

No, of course not.

633e8dcc6825,Leave Us Alone,"us politics, us military, civil unrest, george floyd protests;minneapolis protests, tv, journalism;journalist;news media, federalism, portland oregon, donald trump, murders and homicides","“Portland is burning to the ground,” President Trump warns, and he has helpfully explained that it is a “war-ravaged” hellscape where even the mayor and governor are “petrified for their lives.” Trump purports to be trying to rescue us Oregonians by dispatching National Guard troops to use “full force if necessary” against the “enemy from within.” We asked an intrepid photographer, Rian Dundon, to brave the flames and firefights to capture the mood in this war zone. Here are scenes he captured in what Trump called a “burning hell hole”: So what explains the gulf between Trump’s rhetoric and the reality? Why did a Trump-appointed U.S. District Court judge, Karin Immergut, pause the deployment of troops to Portland and conclude , “The president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts”? Oregon officials have argued , in that court case and publicly, that Trump appeared to have been misled by Fox News. “Portland is unbelievable, what’s going on,” Trump told reporters on Sept. 5, recounting scenes of chaos and destruction. “That was not on my list, Portland, but when I watched television last night, this has been going on.” On the previous evening, Fox News had aired a segment portraying Portland as out of control and included video from actual riots in 2020 in the aftermath of the George Floyd killing. There have been some clashes this summer, especially in June, but nothing like the rioting of 2020 — and more recently the situation has mostly been calm: In late September, protests were small and “ uneventful ,” “energy was low” and people were “ sitting in lawn chairs,” law enforcement reports said . Let’s acknowledge that Portland has significant challenges. It’s not burning to the ground, but homelessness, addiction and crime are serious problems, and office vacancy rates are high and rising . The homicide rate in Portland last year was more than twice that of New York or Boston, but less than half that of Atlanta or Indianapolis (and homicides in Portland so far this year are down 41 percent ). If Trump wanted to help Portland deal with its challenges, there are many ways he could do so with the $10 million that was the estimated cost of his deployment of the Oregon National Guard. He could help with treatment for substance use, with emergency housing, with education. But the worry here in Portland is that troops won’t address any of the city’s actual challenges and will instead provoke unrest. Immediately after his announcement, larger numbers of protesters began turning out. And a Portland police official noted in July that federal officers have been “instigating and causing” some of the disturbances. In 2020, Trump outmaneuvered Portlanders. As the George Floyd protests were waning , he sent in federal law enforcement officers, provoking leftist protesters who responded with riots that did nothing for racial justice but damaged the local economy and bolstered the national Republican narrative of standing up for law and order. In retrospect, the city was so caught up in outrage at Trump that it didn’t focus enough on self-care. Oregonians don’t want to fall into that trap again, and it’s frustrating to hear a beautiful and placid city like Portland — for all its problems — falsely described as a war zone, presumably to distract voters from Jeffrey Epstein and economic weakness. One meme calls Portland the “Epstein Distraction City.” If you’re not going to help us, Mr. President, just leave us alone.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/opinion/portland-trump-troops.html,Society,BBC,By Nicholas Kristof and Rian Dundon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11kristof-czhj/11kristof-czhj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T11:00:21+00:00,31f06506340bc46a8ef7141884f081e17303f4bd
939ef3da640a,Voting for Mamdani Taught Me Why Trump Won,"mayoral races, presidential election of 2024, us politics, polls, voting, democrats, republicans, zohran mamdani, donald trump, nyc;new york city","Over dinner with a politically sophisticated college friend, I explained that I was planning to vote for Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor. In full Gen X snark mode, she asked, “Because vibes?” She was alluding to the fact that some of Mr. Mamdani’s most meme-able campaign slogans are impossible as actual policy. A few are not even good ideas to begin with. Take “Freeze the rent,” his rallying cry, understood to refer to the city’s million or so rent-stabilized apartments. Freezing the rent has been tried; it helps in the short term, but it exacerbates many long-term problems. Low-income renters would be better served by a laser focus on increasing housing supply. I’m voting for him anyway. Or take free buses. Mr. Mamdani has said little about how he’d deliver on this promise, since New York’s mayor does not control the city’s mass transit system and the institutions that do are most likely to hate the idea. I’m voting for him anyway. I’m doing it because he’s freaking out the business-as-usual power elites and driving establishment members of his own Democratic Party bananas. Because things have gone dangerously wrong in this country, and like a lot of other New Yorkers, I’m ready to tear the whole playhouse down (metaphorically speaking!). That is the same spirit that motivated a great many people to vote for Donald Trump. You can see the irony: There may be no two politicians further apart on the ideological spectrum. Or two who are less personally aligned: Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to destroy the “Communist” Mr. Mamdani — and beyond him, New York — if Mr. Mamdani is elected. But the appeal they make to voters, and the way voters respond, is uncannily similar. Trumpism is more than politics. It’s an emotional gas-main explosion, from people who felt unheard, patronized, left behind. The Mamdani phenomenon is a pressure valve, too, an outlet for voters to make a statement against the Democratic burghers who claim to represent “the people” but who are compromised by PAC money and conventional thinking. The entire political establishment should be scrambling to adopt the lessons of these two men’s candidacies. Instead, many of its members seem to be assiduously ignoring them. Kamala Harris, now on a finally-free-to-be-me truth-telling book tour, recently endorsed Mr. Mamdani in the most tepid way possible — “As far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported” — before lauding candidates running elsewhere in the country. Politicians, stop talking this way! In a recent essay , “Bringing a Survey to a Gun Fight,” the progressive communications specialist Anat Shenker-Osorio contrasts two approaches to politics. One, which she dubs “pollingism,” is dominant in Democratic circles. It assumes that voters are rational beings who make decisions based on a tempered analysis of policy. Their preferences, the argument goes, should be discerned and quantified, then duly regurgitated by politicians. The bland mush that results is increasingly maladaptive to a world dominated by social media algorithms. Prudent, temperate messaging disappears into the ether. It is one reason Mikie Sherrill, the cautiously centrist Democratic candidate for governor in New Jersey, is in an even remotely close race with a Republican who is running in part on bringing back plastic shopping bags. The alternative to pollingism, Ms. Shenker-Osorio writes, is magnetism, “the notion that if you want people to come to your cause, you must be attractive .” Magnetism contains the possibility that a candidate might change the power equation, that ideas once thought impossible — like Mr. Mamdani’s push for free child care — suddenly become plausible. Mr. Trump and Mr. Mamdani are both magnetists. People like Mitt Romney and, oh, say, Chuck Schumer are not. Democrats have been pulling their hair out trying to figure out how to win back young men, who voted for Mr. Trump in droves. In a post-primary survey of likely New York voters, Mr. Mamdani was polling at 85 percent among men 18 to 34 . That’s not just Brooklyn hipsters and aura-farming nepo babies. It’s a whole city’s worth of young dudes, from small business owners in Queens to warehouse workers in the Bronx. Soon after the 2024 election, when Mr. Trump gained ground in Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s district, people on social media told her they saw no contradiction between voting for him and for her. “I feel you are both outsiders compared to the rest of DC, and less ‘establishment,’” one person wrote. “It’s real simple,” wrote another. “Trump and you care for the working class.” Centrist Democrats have nonetheless insisted that Mr. Mamdani’s approach would be political suicide anywhere outside New York. Do you really think, they ask, that a democratic socialist has half a chance in Arkansas? What made Mr. Mamdani broadly popular isn’t his party affiliation; it’s the fact that he actually listened to New Yorkers, including those who voted for Mr. Trump. They told him what they cared about most — the insane cost of living — and he built a hyperlocal campaign around that, all while resisting pollingism’s suburban-strip-mall blandness. Do I think that approach would work in Arkansas? I sure do, and in Cedar Rapids or Sioux County, Iowa. (Paradoxically, the one position on which mainstream Democrats seem immune to pollingism is support of Israel’s actions in Gaza. Mr. Mamdani’s opposition to that has aligned him with most Democratic voters.) Of course, there is more to Mr. Mamdani’s appeal than his focus on the cost of living; otherwise, the “ rent is too damn high ” guy would have been elected president by now. This is a febrile, statue-toppling time, one with some parallels to the politics of previous moments of authoritarian ascendancy, when hard-left movements sprung up in response to the right. But it’s not quite a “horseshoe” moment, either. That’s the theory that far-left and far-right ideologies often converge around similar ideas in times like these. As we watch Mr. Trump lay waste to multiple generations of conservative dogma, it starts to become clear that ideology of any kind is inadequate to capture what is happening in the electorate. Perhaps it’s time to turn the lens from horizontal to vertical and start looking at politics not through the prism of left/right, but instead, top/bottom: the elites versus everyone else. There is another way, however, that the horseshoe metaphor seems quite apt. Democratic sages have for eons warned progressives that we must respond sensibly to MAGA extremism. After all, it was our supposed excesses (D.E.I., college debt relief, campus speech codes, trans rights) that allowed the right to triumph, they say. The Mamdani phenomenon says the opposite. What is inspiring all those volunteers — some 75,000 by one count — to join his cause? I suspect it is the promise of finally going on the offense and forcing the other side to respond. Call it vibes, if you want, but they put Donald Trump in the White House and will very likely put Zohran Mamdani in Gracie Mansion.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/opinion/mamdani-trump.html,Society,BBC,By Michael Hirschorn,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/opinion/11hirschorn_3/11hirschorn_3-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T11:00:10+00:00,3cd76e9cf0923af58e1558ff367ec1738c57851a
2291a87a865d,Debating the Dangers of a Pesticide,"hazmat, defoliants and herbicides, chemicals, pesticide, monsanto, bayer","To the Editor: Re “ MAHA Is Focused on the Wrong Pesticide ,” by Michael Grunwald (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 3): “There is no Roundup crisis,” Mr. Grunwald writes. But there is, and the crisis is epistemological: The scientific record has been skewed to the point that a credible risk-benefit analysis of glyphosate cannot be conducted with confidence. One telling case is a glyphosate safety review published in the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology in 2000. Litigation documents released in 2017 revealed that it was conceived and drafted by Monsanto staff members, yet it circulated as an independent review . Twenty-five years on, it still anchors the conversation: heavily cited, invoked in policy debates and embedded in Wikipedia and, by extension, A.I. models — shaping how the public encounters “the science.” Against that backdrop, proposing the development of alternative herbicides simply doubles down on a contaminated pipeline. The first step must be to repair the knowledge base with transparent authorship and funding, independent replication and regulatory re-review that discounts conflicted work. Fix the pipeline, and only then can “better” truly mean “safer.” Alexander A. Kaurov Naomi Oreskes Cambridge, Mass. The writers are the authors of a paper on the 2000 glyphosate safety review cited in this letter. To the Editor: Michael Grunwald expounds on the benefits of the herbicide Roundup without mentioning the detrimental environmental effects of its active ingredient, glyphosate. He correctly points out that Roundup is an effective weedkiller, but fails to mention its impact on milkweed, an essential component of the monarch butterfly’s life cycle, and a major factor in the species’ demise across North America. Of course, the deforestation of the monarchs’ overwintering habitat of the oyamel forests in Michoacan, Mexico, is another serious threat. We need to start recognizing that milkweed and other flowering wildflowers are not noxious weeds but actually beneficial plants for the beloved monarchs and myriad other insects. Brian Houseal Brunswick, Maine The writer facilitated the trinational North American Monarch Conservation Plan on behalf of the NAFTA Commission on Environmental Cooperation. To the Editor: Michael Grunwald’s defense of glyphosate misses the forest for the food crops. The most dangerous toxicity of glyphosate, the main active ingredient in Roundup, is ecological. When it is sprayed on crop fields it enters the environment, where it wipes out nontarget plants that provide critical habitat for birds, butterflies, reptiles and amphibians. The now-endangered status of monarch butterflies is due in large part to Roundup’s killing all the milkweed that formerly grew at the margins of agricultural fields, and that is critical to monarch egg-laying and caterpillar growth. There are many more examples; please do not restrict discussion of health to humans when there is a whole planet full of life that we are actively poisoning with chemicals like glyphosate. Liza Ryan San Rafael, Calif. To the Editor: I am a board-certified pediatrician. In 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical report that didn’t condemn genetic engineering but cautioned that its main use, engineering crops to survive repeated sprayings of Roundup, means the herbicide ends up in our food. The report cited studies linking glyphosate exposure to cancers and endocrine disruption. Michael Grunwald notes in his essay that glyphosate blocks an enzyme that is found in plants, but is “nonexistent in animals,” and he states that it “can kill weeds without harming anything else.” He overlooks, however, the fact that this enzyme exists in the bacteria that make up our microbiome. Glyphosate’s antimicrobial effect can upset the balance of the trillions of beneficial bacteria that live in and on our bodies. Bacterial imbalances are increasingly linked to poor health. Glyphosate use has surged over the last three decades, while our nation’s health has deteriorated. Many peer-reviewed studies now document the adverse health effects of glyphosate-based herbicides. That evidence suggests that Roundup is far from completely safe. Lee A. Evslin Kapaa, Hawaii To the Editor: Michael Grunwald’s defense of glyphosate is less science than spin. He frames the debate as wellness warriors versus regulators, but sidesteps a deeper truth: Science in agriculture is not neutral. It has long been politicized by the corporate sector. Regulators lean on industry-funded studies while dismissing independent, peer-reviewed evidence that threatens profits. Mexico’s own national science dossier on glyphosate and genetically modified corn is rigorous, peer-reviewed and alarming, and documented real risks to health and biodiversity. Instead of reckoning with that research, the United States and agribusiness lobby waved it away in favor of science for hire. Both the MAHA movement and corporate apologists erase the real crisis: a food system captive to agribusiness, where what counts as sound science is dictated by those with the most to lose. If we cannot tell the difference between independent science and corporate propaganda, then we’ve already surrendered the future of our food — and our health — to industry. Loren Cardeli Mexico City To the Editor: Michael Grunwald’s piece essentially parrots chemical companies’ talking points about Roundup’s health effects and misleads readers about its importance for the future of food. Roundup may be largely safe for consumers, but there are enough questions about its health effects on farmers and pesticide applicators that Roundup’s manufacturer, Bayer, has paid out more than $10 billion to settle lawsuits for human health effects. Bayer sells most Roundup as a weedkiller for genetically modified corn and soybean crops that produce vast amounts of biofuels, cattle feed and ultraprocessed foods. That is not what we need to fix a food system that leaves roughly two billion people around the world with food insecurity, including one in seven Americans, many of them hungry or malnourished, and that contributes to rates of diabetes and obesity that cost trillions globally. What we do need is a food system that nourishes people without destroying the planet. Agroecology, an approach to agriculture that integrates social and ecological principles to create sustainable farming and food systems, provides a framework for getting us there. In a debate with Mr. Grunwald in April , I explained how agroecology interweaves multiple fields of science with the wisdom of farmers past and present. We have decades of evidence that it is working all over the world. What we haven’t had is the political will to make it the foundation of our food system.

b82e7316cfc1,Who Can Stop a President Deploying Troops?,"us politics, national guard, donald trump, democrats, republicans","Guys, welcome. How’s it going? Great joy to be with you both. Well, it’s great to be with you, Michelle. I missed you last week. Well, I am ready to dive back in and get all of the goodies that I missed. I gotta say, I leave town for a week to visit family. And you two let the government shut down and the National Guard invade Memphis and Chicago. I feel this is extremely irresponsible. It’s kind of unexcusable inexcusable. In a previous era of era of honor and duty, we would just resign in shame, Michelle. But we’re not in that era anymore, so we’re just plowing on through in spite of our failure. I always feel a sense of guilt about everything, Michelle. So now you’ve just added to my heavy burden. This is just another service that I provide. Thank you. So that said, both developments have me itching for us to talk about President Trump doubling down or I mean, I guess at this point, it’s more like quadrupling down on treating the U.S. like two different even disunited countries. There’s red America, which are his friends and his fans. And then there’s blue America, his enemies, the people who deserve retribution and the boot of his administration on their necks. Metaphorically speaking, of course, at least so far. For instance, the government shutdown, where he has vowed to use this opening to target agencies and areas that Democrats favor. I mean, he’s already X billions of dollars of energy projects mostly located in blue states. And Russell Vought, the head of the OMB, said that they were freezing $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City. EJ, what do you make of all this? Well, there’s a terrible and kind of crazy irony to the fact that we’re having this conversation at a moment when the news has been dominated by a peace deal, or at least a ceasefire deal in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. The release of the hostages. And if it comes off, it will be a major Trump achievement. And yet you have this talk of peace there and then an escalation of the political war at home, as you suggest. And it’s a very odd thing to be treating the outside world one way and our own country in another way. And I grew up in Massachusetts. I’m accustomed to political patronage. And yeah, you try to help your side some when you’re in power and all of that. But the degree of punishment that’s going on here, I think it’s very hard to find any precedent to this in our history. And it’s really antithetical to how you operate in a constitutional Republic. Not persuasion, but pressure, not conversation, but intimidation, and not at least a little something for everybody to a total I win, you lose kind of approach. And this is bodes very badly for how we get out of this shutdown, but also how we’re going to govern ourselves going forward. I’ve spent a lot of time lately reading a lot about the 1850s preceding the Civil War, when we really were bifurcating as a nation. And this is a case where the leadership of the country clearly is trying to make those divisions deeper. And it’s really dangerous to a free Republic. It’s like you have the anti-Lincoln in the White House in the sense that if you’re looking at his first inaugural address, he very eloquently eloquently, begged and pleaded that we must not be enemies. We must be friends. We must remain friends. And of course, that fell on deaf ears. But you’ve got the exact opposite going on right now in the White House. I think if you’re wanting to look for historic parallels, you’re going to go to Red Scare one and Red Scare two, Red Scare one after World War I, Red Scare two after World War II. However, this is not a Red Scare. Undersells it. This is blue scare. In other words, what he’s essentially saying is it’s not the communists that we’re after, it’s blue America. It’s the whole superstructure of blue America, which they are putting in that category of the equivalent of Communist Marxists, and they’ll use that language. It’s very strange to me how much they will say that if you call us a fascist, you’re instigating violence. But if we call you a Marxist or a Communist, well, that’s just. Just delivering the truth. Good and hard. And so it’s turning all of the engines of government against his political opponents. Justifying it to his base, basically by saying these people are the ultimate threat to the American experiment. This is Stephen Miller’s constant rhetoric, constant rhetoric. And that’s that. In that way, it makes the Red Scare. It’s worse than the Red Scare because it’s like Red Scare metastasized. I agree with that. And I think there’s again, to go back to the metaphor in the pre-civil war Civil War era, the Conservatives have always talked about limited government and states’ rights. But as our colleague Jamelle Bouie pointed out recently, when you look at the period of 1857 and the Dred Scott decision. You really had one part of the country, in this case, the South, trying to impose its regime on the entire country. Northerners who didn’t want to cooperate at all with slavery were being forced under the Fugitive Slave Act to help return slaves to the South. And so what you got now is, again, this total contradiction of claims by conservatives to believe in local control or states’ rights and claims by conservatives to believe in limited government. This is unlimited executive power over all the parts of the country you just don’t like, because they don’t seem to you. So what are the states that are being targeted. What can they do. What should they at least attempt. Michelle, you’re raising a really good question. Heavy sigh. That was a very, very heavy sigh. And the reason for the heavy sigh is we’re in a tough spot here and we’re in a tough spot here, in part because Congress over generations helped put us in this tough spot. So if you look at and I wrote this piece before the Trump administration that we have to reform America’s most dangerous law, and what is the most dangerous law in America. It’s the Insurrection Act, because if you read this, act carefully. What you will see is that it places the deployment of troops into cities at the president’s discretion. And this is what this is an incredibly dangerous statute. What could go wrong? What could go wrong? What could possibly go wrong? And this is, though what this is the legacy of generations of trust, of basic background trust placed in presidents that they are going to be given authority that they’ll need in case of emergency, break glass in case of emergency authority. And we just trust them not to abuse it. And there are a lot of reasons in years past for invoking the Insurrection Act, for example, in Reconstruction Era, to try to deal with, neo-confederate violence and militia violence in the South, post-reconstruction to help federal troops have been used Insurrection Act and non Insurrection Act contexts to help desegregate schools, for example and to prevent violence during the Civil rights era. But this is fundamentally different. This is the president deploying troops. And he has not invoked the Insurrection Act yet, but employing troops under a different Title X authority with the Insurrection act in his back pocket, fully knowing that even if the courts block this use, he can pull out that trump card. It is deeply grievous that we did not do anything about the Insurrection Act before Trump came back into power, and we may very well pay for that. And so the answer to your question, what can governors do. There’s not a lot. There’s not a lot, because the elected president of the United States has been given for generations the authority to call out troops at his own discretion by the language of the statute. He hasn’t used that. Yet he’s used other statutes. But that’s lurking back there. And it means that the options that are available to governors, options that are available to state legislatures, are very limited. Congress right now should be rising up. Congress should be responding to this moment. And, we know how that’s going. Yeah I mean, EJ, I would think that if we’re depending on this Congress to do anything to short circuit this, we’re probably in a lot of trouble. That’s absolutely right. I think since we’re going back into history, I think the biggest mistake the founders made, and they realized it pretty quickly because they’re the ones who started the first party system. They wrote a Constitution as if political parties didn’t exist, because in principle, they didn’t believe in them. And so they thought the branches of government would be so jealous of their own rights, would have a kind of institutional patriotism, a phrase my friend Norm Ornstein likes to use, that institutional conflict would be enough for one branch to check the other. In this circumstance, there is no institutional patriotism going on in Congress at all. It’s a party spirit that, for the moment, seems prepared to support President Trump on everything. And it’s clearly and maybe David will disagree with me on this, but I think that is clearly infecting the United States Supreme Court as well. And so you really have a kind of party unity on the Republican side that allows Trump to do this. And I just want to underscore, by the way, that I agree with David. I think Democrats, when they control the Congress in ‘21 and ‘22 and had President Biden in the White House should have at least repealed or at least clarified the terms of the Insurrection Act and placed some limits on the president. I suspect that there are a lot of members who deeply regret they didn’t try to do that. So, David, there is a legal fight brewing over Trump’s attempts to send troops to Portland. I mean, where do you see all this going. You traditionally are the voice of optimism about the courts. Let me put it this way. Here’s a shorthand way to make sense of the court’s jurisprudence. The court where Trumpism intersects with traditional originalism. He tends to win. When it doesn’t, he tends to lose. It’s really pretty. It’s that simple. What I would say is, let’s wait until the end of this term, because a lot of stuff got kicked into this term. We’ve got tariff cases. We’ve got, fit. We’ve had the Federal Reserve. We have the extent of the president’s authority to fire and employees without being blocked. We’ve got a lot of things coming. And I think a lot of people overread these emergency docket decisions. But I’ll tell you right now, what makes me very nervous is for years, Congress pushed a ton of power into the executive branch and tried to put limits on it. And if the theory is, well, you can’t put limits on the executive’s exercise of executive authority, then we’re in for a rocky ride. We’re in for a rocky ride, unless Congress can pull some of that authority back. And so they don’t seem inclined to do it, though, which they don’t seem inclined to do at all. EJ I wish I could have David’s confidence in the Supreme Court. Maybe he doesn’t take this view, but I don’t see a shred of originalism in the immunity decision that the court issued that went against our understandings of presidential power and the limits on it going back to the beginning of the Republic. And every assumption we had is to summarize, the president is not above the law. I think that immunity decision broke all sorts of New ground. The notion that the president could just tell the Justice Department, do this or do that, and it’s O.K. And thus we have the indictment of Jim Commey. I’m not sure I see that as originalism. Correct me if you think I’m wrong, David. Oh, I think the immunity case was not originalism. And I wrote that and I think the headline was, where is the originalism of the originalists when it comes to the immunity case. I absolutely think that. But I will say the immunity case is a rounding error on a rounding error compared to the magnitude of the problems that we’re facing. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Before we go too far down the Supreme Court path. I want to shift us in a different direction with these questions about these deployments, especially sending one state’s National Guard into another state. Texas National Guard troops have been sent into Chicago, which has led to some pretty nasty exchanges between the governors of Texas and Illinois. And, at least as of Thursday when we’re taping this, that’s the situation is still pretty tense. What does this do to the psyche of the country. Like what impact does this have on voters and the way that Americans think about the country. It’s very troubling, especially if you’ve spent time abroad where when you were in certain other countries and you saw troops on the streets routinely, you said, well, this is the way I guess things work here. Thank God it doesn’t work like that in the United States. You’re not accustomed to seeing troops on the ground. It’s hard to escape the notion that this isn’t to. This is an effort to routinize and get us accustomed to people on the streets. And Governor Pritzker in Illinois is very worried that this is a prelude to having troops on the streets during the 2026 election and maybe on election day. Now, we don’t know if that’s true yet, but I think that statement a year ago, someone would say that’s a kind of paranoid statement. I don’t think it looks so paranoid now. I think it’s the idea of having troops on the streets routinely to solve problems that are incredibly ill-defined. And at a moment when actually crime rates are going down and almost all the places he is sending troops to. Well, Chicago had the lowest murder rate since, I believe, 1965, before the troops came. I mean, so no one would say that everything is fine here in Chicago. And one mistake that people make is try to argue that National Guard troops are descending on some utopia. No, no. Chicago has problems. There’s no question about it. But those problems, many of them have been on the mend, and I don’t think it’s hard to discern what is happening. I think what is happening, it’s not nothing about this is subtle, and especially when you look at the conduct of some of these federal officials, the conduct in particular of a lot of these ICE officers and agents, they’re being deliberately provocative. In some cases, they’re just committing outright assault on camera that someone’s talking to them and they’ll just spray tear gas straight into their face. This is the kind of thing I guarantee you. If I was walking down the street and you were arguing with me, Michelle and I just pulled out some bear spray and put it in your face. What I just assaulted you. That’s assault. I should be arrested. And so I think what you’re seeing here is deliberate. The use of the military as a deliberate provocation. I think you’re seeing the use of the aggressive use of ice having ICE agents walking in and shows of force. I can literally see out of my window where they were walking several days ago. What you’re looking at here is a provocation. It’s in many ways, it feels as if the desired end state here is conflict, so that conflict can be met with a harsher response and a harsher response. And it’s being sustained in part by the fact that a lot of people in red America, through a lot of years of rhetoric, literally believe when someone says cities are burning, Portland is a war zone. That’s not to say that there aren’t parts of Portland where there hasn’t been violence, but the picture that is being painted is of Fallujah. It’s the picture that’s being painted is of Gaza, of Mosul, of just conflict zones. And, and it’s just remarkable. Well, what you guys are talking about is this kind of trickle down effort to divide. So you have red state America being told that cities, blue cities are a hellscape. And blue state America is told that red areas are marching toward fascism under MAGA or whatever. And this has to have an imprint on America, right. It was like when you have primed your populace not to view each other as disagreeing so much as evil, that’s going to linger after Trump is gone. Oh, Trump arose in part because of it. In other words, when Trump got came down the escalator in 2015, he did not come down the escalator into a harmonious political society. He came into one where negative polarization had already become a big part of American politics. And then he just came in and made it all so much worse, to the point where for an awful lot of Americans, you’re viewed with suspicion and anger if you don’t hate the other side. And I know that our politicians get this all the time, that when they go home and they go home to their home districts, they’re exposed to a constant barrage from the most radicalized members of their community. Fight, fight, fight I hate them. I hate them. Fight, fight, fight. And so this sense of hatred, this mutual hatred and the numbers are scary if you interview committed partisans on either side, the amount of hatred they have for each other is very terrifying to the point where going back to some of the dysfunction about Congress. Yes, Madison thought that, say, Mike Johnson would say, hey, I’m the Speaker of the House. I’m not a potted plant. I’m not Donald Trump’s subordinate. But even if he had that thought, he also knows that even the Speaker of the House will lose his primary if he defies the president, and that that’s how committed partisans are to this level of combat. And in Republican land, where I’m most familiar, if you are not opposing the Democrats 100 percent of the time and supporting Trump 100 percent of the time, your electoral track record over the last 10 years is abysmal. And so that long process has purged the G.O.P. of almost anyone who, at least for the time being, is willing to resist Trump. Stand up for the humanity of their political opponents. It’s a very dark time, a very dark place to play out that tape. What happens is Trump keeps polarizing us for the next three years. I agree, obviously, with a lot of what David has just said about what’s happened inside the Republican Party. But would you both forgive me if I brought up at least some positive news, or at least some moderating news. Please, please, always. Because I think one of the striking things about the polling that you’re seeing is even among Americans who may agree with some of Trump’s objectives, they consistently think he’s gone too far, that he is. They don’t like these methods. You see that in attitudes on immigration where people are happy. The Southern border is essentially closed, but they say negative things about his immigration policy. They don’t like troops in the cities. And so you’ve got substantial majorities. You’ve only got about 25 percent who strongly approve of Trump. What that tells you is that out in the country, there is this real uneasiness with the radicalism of many of these steps, such as the troops in the city that Trump is engaged in. And I think that’s why you’re seeing governors like Pritzker taking a very strong stand against what Trump is doing in Chicago, because I think he knows, sure, the MAGA base will denounce him, but I think there are a lot of Americans who, when he says these troops don’t belong here, they’re quietly nodding their heads. Even if they’re not Democrats, I don’t know what price the president will pay for this and whether the price will not be paid until 2026. If then. But I think he is paying a price in public opinion for the radicalism. So here’s what I worry about because I am I am the skunk at the garden party consistently is that the partisans are really engaged, but that big mushy group that tunes out politics and doesn’t really pay attention. The nastier it gets, the more likely they are to just tune out the noise altogether. Stay home and so that just leaves the entire country at the mercy of the extremists. I think, Michelle, you’re exactly right. There is such a thing as the exhausted majority. This is a supermajority of Americans, more than 60 percent of Americans who are disgusted with politics as they exist. The problem is they’re very hard to mobilize because the key word in the phrase exhausted majority is exhausted, and the current moment only makes them more exhausted, more willing to push back. I mean, to step back. I feel their pain. I do. I feel it. Oh, I totally do as well. But what that means is the highly partisan wings essentially just dominate all discourse until each election cycle. And I think that what MAGA is going to learn is that the MAGA is going to learn something that the far left learned in the late 2010s, moving in the early 2020s, that a lot of your success in an online aggression and shaming and mobbing and attacking and an intolerance is very temporary and illusory because the majority of people don’t like those kinds of tactics, and they’re going to over time, punish a side that they see as bullying people as being extremely cruel and intolerant, and a lot of MAGA looks at some of the cancel culture heyday of the late 2010s and says, Oh, we can do that, and we’ll do it better, and we’ll do it more effectively, and we’ll do it from the Oval Office down. But the pro free speech position over the long term in American history is a very majority position. Any given individual moment you might be cutting against the grain. But over time, the pro free speech position is a majority American position. And I think MAGA is making a giant mistake in taking the old the whole cancel culture discourse of 2019, 2020 and saying, oh, we’ll just do this more and more aggressively, and that’s going to work for us. I am joining you from a conference on national service where a lot of good people, including people from both parties, Governor Spencer Cox of Utah is here. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, a Democrat, is here, and they reflect a kind of civic life in the country. People who do good things in local communities and in neighborhoods. And the idea is to try to have a much to revive the service movement, to have more people engaged in solving local problems and lifting people up around the country. And that’s why I think the notion that all our discourse will inevitably be dominated only by people with very extreme views, I think that will turn out to be wrong. And it’s even turning out to be wrong right now. Sure, if you go on parts of social media, that is what you’ll see. But thank God we are not yet at the point where real life is like social media. I think there is civic life out there in the country that is trying to figure out how do you move, make some progress in this awful climate. I hate being like this because you sound pollyannaish. I am as worried as I’ve ever been in my life, but I haven’t given up on the civic sense that exists among an awful lot of Americans across a lot of our political lines. Not all, but a lot of them. So you brought up Spencer Cox in Utah, and we’ve talked about some other governors, and I am a enduring cheerleader for governors, who I always think have to be a little bit more pragmatic and bipartisan than their colleagues in Washington. But it sounds like you guys are hopeful that the next president, whether it’s a governor or some unknown or the Washington players can knit us back together, that this is not an irretrievably broken situation. Well, now, I’ll go dark on you real quick and say, we need to make sure that we have free and fair elections in 2026 and 2028. We’ve got a lot of work to do now to keep the Democratic Republic intact. So those options exist. And so President Trump doesn’t run for a third term as some of his people have floated. So I would put that on the table. But then my answer is Yes. I think there are a lot of people out there thinking, how do we repair, not only repair the damage, but to use a phrase that I wish we could use more. It was used by President Biden, but build back better really should be the theme for what happens after 2028. We should not. We should be comforted by history, but not too much. So what would comfort us about history is that we’ve had snap backs. We’ve bounced back after repressive periods in American history. Who was the next president elected after Richard Nixon. Corrupt imperial presidency. A Baptist Sunday school teacher like that’s a zig zag away from the zig zag of Richard Nixon, right. Love that thermostatic electorate. Yeah right. And so we have had snap back times throughout American history. That’s one of the reasons why America is a much better place right now, even with all of our problems than it was in 1925 or what it was in 1825? But we can’t presume from the fact that we always survived before that we will always survive in the future. I mean, think about the Civil War. I mean, arguably, if Joshua Chamberlain doesn’t fix bayonets on day two of Gettysburg on Little Round top, it’s a whole different history. And so the American experiment is a closely run thing, even in certain other circumstances. There was a snap back after Woodrow Wilson jailed a whole bunch of political opponents, hundreds of political opponents. We had a snapback. Even though you wouldn’t put FDR anywhere in the category of a Woodrow Wilson. People were so worried after he won four presidential elections that they amended the Constitution to term limit presidents. We do have snapback moments. I do think we will have one if we can hang on. I believe in those two. I think we usually end up taking more steps forward than back. But sometimes the snapback can take a very long time. And the one that comes to mind is Jim Crow. We had enormous progress toward racial equality during Reconstruction that ended in 1877. It took us. Jim Crow was dominant for about 80 years before we finally successfully pushed it back in the Civil Rights movement. So yeah, I think we need hope in our ability to snap back and remember that we may have to fight real hard if we’re going to snap back quickly. On that cautionary note, let’s land this plane. Before we go, though. I need to get everybody’s recommendations for the week EJ, you were warned to come packing. You got a recommendation for us? I do indeed, I. I have been completely transfixed by a 19-year-old jazz pianist called Brandon Goldberg, who plays as if he is an old master of the genre. If you want to check him out there, he did an album at Dizzy’s Club. here in New York, where I am today. But listening to someone and there were a bunch of young people out there who are doing great things in jazz, and this makes me happy. O.K, David? So I fear I’m going to let listeners down, Michelle, because I’m normally your streaming guru. I’ve got a television suggestion every week because I’m a power consumer. No, I’ve got a book recommendation. What? I’m a sci-fi nerd. I’ve been looking for a good sci-fi series to take my attention after the expanse ended, which was also, by the way, great television show on Amazon Prime and the same folks who brought you the expanse series, which is a near-future sci-fi series set in the solar system, have brought you a new series, and book one is called “The Mercy of Gods,” and it’s set in a humans settled planet encounter with overwhelmingly powerful alien intelligence. And it’s just really good. It’s great world building, it’s great character building. And so if you are I there is a subset of our audience that is sci-fi nerds. I hear from them, they ask me for suggestions, and this is my suggestion. “The Mercy of God” is fantastic. O.K, I’ll wait for the series because I do not read sci-fi. I watch sci-fi. But the reading sci-fi is a bridge too far. So I’m going in a different direction and I’m going with a food recommendation. I think people should dip a toe into the Dubai chocolate craze. You guys know what this is. Yes no clue. No clue, no clue. So I like my chocolate. I am a kind of particular snob about chocolate, and I have to say, this is something that I was late to in 2021. This company in the U.A.E. came up with a chocolate bar. It’s like this chunky candy bar that’s chocolate coating this inside mush of pistachios and crispy shredded pastries. Within two years, it had gone viral on social media and has taken off everywhere. So now you can get it at Trader Joe’s and Walmart. And it started spreading out into other foods. IHOP introduced these as pancakes. There are croissants. Apparently they were all the rage Dubai style Russian Easter cakes. They have caused a pistachio shortage among some according to some pistachio companies. And because this is how committed I am to this show, I bought several different brands. I will be expensing them all. Nice my research is taking that bullet and eating tons of Dubai chocolate, but I want people to get in on this before it jumps the shark and goes all pumpkin spice where you’ve got Dubai chocolate hummus and chili Dubai chocolate. So Starbucks coffee, Skip the Starbucks coffee and the IHOP pancakes that were around and just go out and at least kind of savor the moment, as you were talking, Michelle, I remember I saw those stories and I stopped reading them because I feared. And now you’ve proven it, that I would run out and eat way too many of those things. But Thank you for your dedication to our readers, our listeners, that bullet. So you don’t have to. I am taste testing. I will report back with my grading scale. But I think with that guys we’re going to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us, David. Always a pleasure. I will see you guys later. Thanks, Michelle.",https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010451865/who-can-stop-a-president-deploying-troops.html,Society,BBC,,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/arts/11opinions-roundtable-cover-art/11opinions-roundtable-cover-art-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,2025-10-11T10:55:00.673000+00:00,d5f623132307ba69a413b7a7a610ab5e60e56440
939177799382,A Worthy Nobel Peace Laureate,"nobel prize, democracy, authoritarianism, us foreign policy, politics, maria corina machado, nicolas maduro, hugo chavez, donald trump, venezuela","According to Alfred Nobel’s will , a Nobel Prize is meant to be given to those who “during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.” Note the word “preceding”: Those of us who think Donald Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his part in ending (or at least pausing) the war in Gaza will have to wait until next year’s awards are announced. We shouldn’t hold our breath. In the meantime, the Norwegian Nobel Committee chose well in awarding this year’s peace prize Friday to María Corina Machado, the 58-year-old Venezuelan opposition leader now in hiding from the regime of Nicolás Maduro. By doing so, the committee also indicted that regime and its 26-year record of ruin, carried out in the name of “Bolivarian” socialism with the credulous support of many Western progressives. Machado earned her Nobel last year when, after being blocked by the government from running for president, she rallied behind Edmundo González, a nonpartisan candidate, further helping to consolidate a once-divided opposition camp. González went on to win the vote by more than two to one, according to independent surveys, only to see Maduro ignore the result and install himself for another six-year term, throwing nearly 2,000 political dissidents into prison in the bargain. Machado’s own career as a dissident began more than 20 years ago, after she co-founded an election-monitoring group because of her fears of the ways that Maduro’s immediate predecessor, Hugo Chávez, was systematically undermining Venezuela’s democratic institutions. In 2005, his regime charged her with treason for supporting a recall referendum; in 2014, she faced treason charges again for participating in anti-regime protests. In 2024, she published an opinion essay in The Wall Street Journal that began: “I am writing this from hiding, fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen from the dictatorship led by Nicolás Maduro.” That record of farsightedness and courage stands in sharp and shaming contrast to the credulity of the regime’s fellow travelers in the West. Among them, Naomi Klein, the Canadian writer, who in 2007 lauded Chávez for turning Venezuela into a place where “citizens had renewed their faith in the power of democracy to improve their lives”; Chesa Boudin, the former San Francisco district attorney, who in 2009 cheered Chávez’s “commitment to the democratic process” as the leader opened “the door to his possible life tenure”; and Jeremy Corbyn, the former British Labour Party leader, who in 2013 hailed Chávez for “showing that the poor matter” and making “massive contributions to Venezuela & a very wide world.” Since the catastrophe of Chavismo became evident — skyrocketing murder rates , widespread hunger and starvation , millions of ordinary people fleeing the country on foot, leaders charged with enriching themselves through drug trafficking — these former cheerleaders have, for the most part, gone silent. Klein apparently squeaked out something about the regime’s “petro-populism,” but, to borrow a slogan familiar to her side, when it comes to Venezuela, silence is violence. Choosing to ignore the catastrophe there only serves to perpetuate it. What should be done? In January, I noted in a column that everything that’s been tried so far has failed. Elections: stolen . Sanctions: ineffectual . Arrest warrants and bounties : ditto. Machado’s Nobel will bring some attention to the regime’s repression. But as other dissident winners may attest, the effect is likely to be short-lived and slight. The 2021 peace prize to Dmitry Muratov, editor of an independent Russian newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, did nothing to shake Vladimir Putin’s rule; the 2023 prize, to the Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, did nothing to free her from an Iranian prison. That leaves the option to which the Trump administration seems increasingly inclined: regime change. The best way to accomplish this is by offering Maduro and his inner circle the equivalent of a Bashar al-Assad option: permanent exile to a friendly state, if not Russia then probably Cuba. That could be matched by an offer of mass amnesty to lower-level civilian and military regime officials, provided they swear loyalty to a democratic government under a legitimately elected leader. This seems to be the real purpose of Trump’s gunboat diplomacy in the Caribbean: Induce enough fear, and the bad guys might run. It’s Machado’s view, too: Maduro and his cronies, she told the BBC last week , “won’t go unless he realizes that there is a credible threat, that things are going to get worse every day that goes by for them.” But that in turn requires a willingness by the Trump administration to continue to escalate, up to the point of a full-scale military confrontation. That would entail unquestionable and deadly risks, to Venezuelans and Americans alike. It might also put Trump’s long-coveted Nobel Peace Prize permanently out of reach. Then again, there are greater peace prizes than the Nobel — a prize never won by Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman or other world-historical figures who knew that the path to peace can’t always lie through peace alone. If the sacrifice Trump must make for putting an end to the horror of the Maduro regime is forgoing the prize for himself, he can take solace in the fact that Machado dedicated her prize to “the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support.” Now is the time to act.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/opinion/nobel-peace-prize-machado-maduro-venezuela.html,Society,BBC,By Bret Stephens,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/10stephens-qmbv/10stephens-qmbv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T20:13:05+00:00,b88ea51e36e5d14911b8b6c8ac04e9dcc638b0d5
aedeb3e23411,A Perilous Difference Between the Trump and Nixon Eras,"us politics, presidential power, donald trump, nixon, letitia james, james b comey, donald c alexander, john w dean iii, justice department","Donald Trump has enemies. Richard Nixon had a list of them. The differences in how these presidents’ respective adversaries were treated reveal that the federal government has taken a darker turn in 2025 than it did in the 1970s. The origins of the pending criminal cases against James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, seem clear. In his now notorious Sept. 20 directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on Truth Social, Mr. Trump demanded that the Justice Department bring charges against Mr. Comey and Ms. James, both of whom the president has long despised. Within a few weeks, and over the objections or concerns of career prosecutors, both were indicted in federal court in Virginia. Mr. Nixon’s aides had similar plans for that president’s enemies. On Aug. 16, 1971, John Dean, the White House counsel, wrote a memo for his superiors outlining plans for “how we can use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.” Mr. Dean explained that the government could do so by using “grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc.” There were initially 20 names on the list of enemies, a mix of politicians, business and union leaders, journalists and entertainers. (The White House also compiled broader lists of enemies.) The existence of the Nixon enemies list has long been a familiar part of the broader Watergate story, but the aftermath of Mr. Dean’s suggestion is less well known. The Internal Revenue Service took some preliminary steps to investigate Mr. Nixon’s enemies, but Donald C. Alexander, who was Mr. Nixon’s commissioner of the I.R.S. in 1973, shut down attempts to use audits and other forms of harassment in that way. Mr. Alexander later wrote that he took the step because “political or social views, ‘extremist’ or otherwise, are irrelevant to taxation.” Mr. Nixon stewed about Mr. Alexander’s intransigence, and Mr. Alexander later wrote that the president had tried to fire him, but the I.R.S. commissioner stayed in place for the rest of the president’s time in office. In a similar vein, none of the people on the enemies list were criminally prosecuted by the Justice Department. Mr. Nixon liked to fulminate against his enemies, especially in the private confines of the Oval Office, in conversations that were captured by the White House taping system. For example, on Sept. 15, 1972, in a conversation with Mr. Dean and H.R. Haldeman, the chief of staff, the president talked about unleashing the Justice Department and the F.B.I. in his second term. “They are asking for it and they are going to get it,” he said . “We have not used the power in this first four years, as you know. We have not used the bureau and we have not used Justice, but things are going to change now. And they are either going to do it right or go.” Mr. Nixon was far from a model of ethical leadership. But the larger point is this: It didn’t happen. The indictments didn’t come. Mr. Trump is following through, however. The indictments of Mr. Comey and Ms. James are concrete assertions of presidential power, and they have the most direct, perilous consequences for the targets. The courts will begin to address the merits of the cases shortly; on first impression, the views of the career prosecutors appear to have merit. The cases against both Mr. Comey and Ms. James look dubious — that is, not the kinds of cases that would have likely been brought if the pair had not been perceived enemies of the president. Even if the cases wind up failing — if they are thrown out before trial or are later rejected by a jury — they will have imposed tremendous costs on the defendants. Regardless of what happens later, Ms. James and Mr. Comey will not recover what they have already lost: in reputation, in legal fees, in distraction from other obligations and in overall stress. For this reason, whatever happens later, Mr. Trump has already won a kind of victory over Mr. Comey and Ms. James. Mr. Nixon never won that kind of triumph against any of his enemies. That Mr. Trump has gone this far demonstrates that the system has less resilience to resist him than the one that stopped Mr. Nixon a half-century ago. And only months into his second term, Mr. Trump is just getting started with making his enemies pay.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/opinion/letitia-james-donald-trump-nixon.html,Society,BBC,By Jeffrey Toobin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/opinion/12toobib/10toobib-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T19:00:12+00:00,e88b29feba68833245f3a61375e96378c6cc59b1
cc062794b9b7,Hope and Anxiety Over Israel-Gaza Peace,"israel gaza war, us politics, peace process, palestinians, donald trump, israel, gaza strip, terrorism, hamas, coal, national mining assn, diego velazquez, prado museum, art","To the Editor: Re “ Gaza Cease-Fire Begins, Israel Says, as Thousands Return to the North ” (news article, nytimes.com, Oct. 10): All the breaking news media segments with champagne corks popping and people dancing in the streets in Israel and Gaza to celebrate the cease-fire and the hostages’ apparently imminent return make me more and more anxious. Shouldn’t we wait until all the hostages have been set free? Shouldn’t we wait until there is a cease-fire that we are sure neither side will violate? Maybe we should wait until Hamas does, in fact, surrender its arms and is no longer the governing body in Gaza. Maybe we should hold off on celebrating until there is proof of actual aid being delivered in Gaza. President Trump has a nasty habit of wishful thinking. That, coupled with a very short attention span, often translates into his celebrating a “victory” before it even happens. Let’s not forget that for years he has been proclaiming that he has a health plan that is better than Obamacare, and it will be ready “in about two weeks.” This is what scares me the most. Let’s celebrate when all the hostages are home and safe! Len DiSesa Dresher, Pa. To the Editor: The cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas was a herculean achievement. But there was nothing complicated about the underlying formula for reaching it: Hamas finally agreed to immediately release all of the Israeli hostages under a plan that, if fully implemented, also calls for it to disarm and relinquish power over Gaza. Those were Israel’s demands from Day 1, and they serve the interests of Israelis and Palestinians alike, as well as everyone who wishes to see peace. We didn’t need to wait until Oct. 9, 2025, to reach this deal. Hamas could have agreed to the same terms two years ago. It was always within Hamas’s power to end the war and suffering on both sides, just as Hamas could have chosen not to invade Israel and rape, kidnap and slaughter Israeli innocents in the first place. Responsibility for every life lost in this horrible war rests solely with Hamas. Stephen A. Silver San Francisco To the Editor: When President Trump announced the first phase of a peace agreement between Israel and Hamas on Truth Social, he thanked mediators from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey. Notably absent was any mention of Europe. That omission wasn’t accidental. European governments have sidelined themselves from serious diplomacy in the region. Rather than engaging with the complex realities on the ground, they’ve embraced moral pageantry by recognizing a Palestinian state in the midst of war, condemning a democracy while excusing terrorists and mistaking symbolism for strategy. President Trump, by contrast, approached the region with realism. He understood that peace is not forged through declarations but through aligning interests and managing threats. Today, meaningful diplomacy is driven by those who prioritize security, deterrence and regional relationships — not distant capitals issuing performative rebukes. As European leaders cling to their moral self-image, the actual work of peacemaking is happening elsewhere. Aviva Klompas Waltham, Mass.

To the Editor: Re “ President Trump, You Should Go to Gaza ,” by Samer Sinijlawi (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 10): I am a middle-school history teacher at a private Jewish school in Northern California, and I want to commend Mr. Sinijlawi for his astute plea. Like him, I hope leadership emerges strong and bold enough for both Palestinians and Israelis to move toward peace and reconciliation. As much as I disagree with President Trump on so many issues, it does appear that he and his administration made this agreement possible. Mr. Sinijlawi is absolutely right: Only through day-to-day interactions will the two peoples who have suffered so much begin to recognize their common humanity and desire for peace. Steven Friedman San Rafael, Calif. To the Editor: The Israel-Hamas deal for a cease-fire would have never been possible without the strength, diligence and brokering of President Trump, who has wanted to end the Israel-Hamas war from the get-go. Of course the deal is fragile, but it’s more than we’ve ever had and hopefully a peaceful new beginning for Gaza, Israel and all of the Middle East. JoAnn Lee Frank Clearwater, Fla. The Virtues of Coal To the Editor: Re “ Trump’s Coal Revival Is All Smoke and No Future ,” by Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 9): Whether you like it or not, coal’s greatest virtue is its unassailable reliability. This summer, our grids were tested. Operators in the PJM and MISO regions — two grids that manage electricity across 28 states and Washington, D.C. — issued multiple alerts that electricity demand was close to eclipsing what was available. Time and time again, coal ramped up to keep the lights on when wind power offered negligible contributions because of unfavorable weather conditions. That coal generation, in one case, saved consumers more than $4 million at the meter during an emergency event. With the construction of power-hungry data centers proceeding at full tilt and energy demands increasing in parallel, we’re in an age of energy addition, when we need every megawatt the grid has to offer — and more. All fuel sources have their strengths. Until other technologies are capable of supplying uninterrupted power across large and complex grids, are permitted and are built, coal’s value in providing stable, dependable electricity that can be ramped up when needed for an overtaxed grid is undeniable.

What a plum assignment. Mr. Reyburn’s moment-by-moment appreciation of Diego Velázquez’s genius was disarming and delightful. And he’s right — “Las Meninas” (also known as “The Ladies-in-Waiting”) is like a team photo. Mr. Reyburn asks why Velázquez would paint while “wearing a silk doublet emblazoned with an honorific cross.” Most art historians think that the prestigious cross was added after the canvas was completed and after the Order of Santiago finally deigned to admit Velázquez in 1659. Over the years, I have overheard many museum guides at both the Prado in Madrid and the Picasso Museum in Barcelona tell the story that King Philip IV himself added the red cross. I don’t believe it. The art-loving king had too much respect for Velázquez and his talent to approach his greatest masterpiece with a wet brush. I bet Juan de Pareja, Velázquez’s assistant and emancipated slave, did the deed. Carol Weston Armonk, N.Y.

4c4d801a3379,Trump Disgraces American Justice,"us politics, presidential power, ethics misconduct malfeasance, donald trump, letitia james, james b comey, lindsey halligan, pamela j bondi, justice department","President Trump is once again weaponizing the legal system to fulfill his personal vendettas. Last year, before he could point to a single crime that he claimed she had committed, Mr. Trump called for the prosecution of New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, who was suing him for fraudulent business dealing. On Thursday the Justice Department secured an indictment against Ms. James, alleging bank fraud. The story behind the indictment says it all. A federal prosecutor decided recently that there was not enough evidence to bring charges against Ms. James. In a normal administration, that would have been the end of the case. But Mr. Trump did not take no for an answer. He forced that prosecutor’s resignation and in a social media post last month demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi appoint a new prosecutor: Lindsey Halligan, a Trump ally and insurance lawyer who had never prosecuted a case. He also demanded that Ms. Halligan pursue charges against both Ms. James and James Comey, the former director of the F.B.I. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” At Ms. Halligan’s request, a grand jury indicted Mr. Comey on Sept. 25 and then Ms. James. The charges relate to mortgage paperwork that Ms. James filed when she bought a house in Virginia in 2020. Previous prosecutors did not find sufficient evidence that Ms. James was knowingly dishonest, and legal experts say the charges are flimsy at best. Even if the Justice Department ultimately loses in court, the legal fight will demand Ms. James’s time and money. It signals to politicians and the public that opposing the president has a cost, including the explicit threat of imprisonment. Mr. Trump and his supporters claim that Democrats started this era of “lawfare” with their investigations into him. Yet those investigations were vastly different. Special counsels, chosen to operate more independently than typical prosecutors, carried out the federal inquiries into Mr. Trump. One special counsel during the Biden administration even investigated Joe Biden himself for his handling of classified documents. And the investigations into Mr. Trump came in response to his alarming actions, not dubious claims of mortgage problems but efforts to overturn the outcome of a presidential election. The investigations followed a potential crime, not a personal vendetta. America is now in a dangerous period, in which the president can order investigations and indictments against his enemies. Mr. Trump is criminalizing Americans’ ability to challenge their leaders. In the popular imagination, the state’s infringement on individual liberty is usually the work of spies or the military. But few branches of government have the power to take away our freedoms that the Justice Department does. It can ask courts to put you in prison, mark your life with a criminal record and, even if you are found not guilty, tie you up in yearslong legal battles that drain your finances and destroy your personal standing. “The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty and reputation than any other person in America,” Robert Jackson, the former Supreme Court justice, said when he served as attorney general. Cognizant of these concerns, presidents since Watergate have mostly tried to insulate the Justice Department from politics. The system has not been perfect, but it has mostly worked. Americans have generally trusted the federal government to avoid sham prosecutions. Mr. Trump has eroded this system from within. His replacement of a career prosecutor with a crony is only one example. He has staffed the Justice Department and the F.B.I. with loyalists. His administration has pushed out lawyers who investigated misconduct and corruption. He has tried to punish law firms that represent his political opponents. He has repeatedly warned officials, sometimes in public social media posts, that they should not go against him. He has sent a message that federal law enforcement’s main concern should be not the country’s laws or the Constitution but his personal interests. Just as telling as the cases Mr. Trump’s Justice Department has initiated are those it has dropped. This year the department closed an investigation into Tom Homan, the president’s so-called border czar, even though he was recorded accepting a bag of $50,000 in cash by undercover F.B.I. agents. Many legal experts have spoken out. “These political prosecutions need to stop,” wrote Richard Painter, who was a White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, after Ms. James was indicted. He called for an impeachment inquiry into Ms. Bondi. Most Republicans, however, have remained quiet, fearful of the president. Mr. Comey’s and Ms. James’s indictments may be just the beginning. Mr. Trump has also demanded the prosecution of one of his most prominent Democratic opponents, Senator Adam Schiff of California. He posted on social media this week that Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago should go to jail for opposing his mass deportation efforts. His Justice Department has proved all too willing to turn such social media posts, no matter how baseless, into indictments. The damage is not just to Mr. Comey, Ms. James and anyone else who is prosecuted. It is also to the foundations of American democracy and law.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/opinion/letitia-james-indictment-trump.html,Society,BBC,By The Editorial Board,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/10james-editorial-lpzm/10james-editorial-lpzm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T15:13:04+00:00,af9bed5c76654d9a4674f5ac01dc81599a945600
95e3534e7e51,The Tom Homan Affair Has More Red Flags Than a May Day Parade,"us politics, bribery and kickbacks, ethics misconduct malfeasance, corruption, thomas d. homan, donald trump, pamela j bondi, justice department","The accusations are explosive: That in 2024, Tom Homan, now President Trump’s border czar, met with some businessmen who handed him $50,000 stuffed into a bag from Cava, the fast-casual restaurant chain; in exchange, Mr. Homan would help with government contracts if Mr. Trump were to win re-election. In reality, the “businessmen” were undercover F.B.I. agents who reportedly recorded the exchange. The sting operation was part of an F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Homan that the Trump administration quietly shut down this year. Mr. Homan himself denies any illegal actions. In a hearing on Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to answer questions about the money and said there was no evidence of wrongdoing. I spent years investigating senior-level corruption and misconduct at the Department of Justice. In 2019, Mr. Trump appointed me inspector general at the Interior Department, a position I held until January, when he fired me and many of my counterparts in other departments. I am very worried that the apparent handoff is yet another star in the administration’s constellation of ethics problems. We’ve seen Elon Musk and DOGE’s potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump’s meme coins that foreign business executives purchase to ingratiate themselves. The plane from the Qatari government given to the Trump administration. Suspicious pardons . The government has answered all these concerns with a dismissive wave of the hand. Too often, Mr. Trump’s ethics flare-ups fade quickly. But I see glaring problems in the handling of Mr. Homan’s case that cry out for an independent investigation. The first red flag is apparent enough: Mr. Homan and the White House gave inconsistent responses to the allegations. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Homan never took the money — a flat, categorical denial. Mr. Homan has said only that he did nothing wrong and nothing illegal. Notice the difference. If Mr. Homan did not accept the bag of cash, why not just say so? Why fall back on a narrow denial about wrongdoing or illegality? Whose account is more credible? The second red flag is even more alarming. When Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Homan was under F.B.I. investigation for bribery. And yet he went on to serve as a senior White House official, likely with a high security clearance. How did that happen? Obtaining a security clearance is a rigorous process, particularly for senior officials. Investigators are supposed to scrutinize an applicant’s background, finances and potential vulnerabilities to influence. An active federal investigation for bribery should set off alarm bells, at the very least. It appears that the allegations were known to those conducting Mr. Homan’s clearance and deemed unimportant. But it’s also possible that there was no security evaluation in the first place. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump allowed the White House to give interim security clearances to top officials without vetting them. Who knows how many senior officials didn’t undergo a background check? Both possibilities are extremely troubling. Either the security clearance process failed in spectacular fashion or there’s a dangerous gap in the system designed to protect sensitive government information. The third red flag is less obvious but no less significant: the tax implications. Believe it or not, the Internal Revenue Service requires individuals to report all income , even illegal income such as bribes. It may sound absurd, but it is the law. If Mr. Homan did in fact accept a $50,000 payment, did he report it as income on his taxes? If not, that omission could conceivably constitute tax crime, a serious federal offense in its own right. Just ask Al Capone. Did the Justice Department and F.B.I. ever examine the potential tax violations as part of their inquiry? And if not, why not? Individually, each of these issues — the inconsistent denials, the security clearance gap and the potential tax implications — warrants serious scrutiny. Taken together, they form a picture of misconduct. Democrats have opened two inquiries into the Homan affair. But to get the full picture, government watchdog agencies should begin a nonpartisan investigation. This is not about Democrats or Republicans, Trump loyalists or Trump critics. No one wants a government in which officials accept cash bribes for government action. That is the stuff of banana republics or the type of Beltway swamp that Mr. Trump swore to drain. Most Americans believe that senior government officials must be held to the highest ethical and legal standards. When allegations of bribery and corruption touch the upper echelons of government, the public deserves clarity. Americans’ confidence in our government is at near-historic lows. Now is an opportunity to help restore trust with an unbiased and independent review. Mark Lee Greenblatt investigated misconduct at the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior.

Nate Silver: So let me start this off with a slightly feisty opinion. I’m not sure that winning the shutdown is a thing that matters. And I’m not sure that polling tells us very much about it.

ecece473f488,Academia Is Broken. Trump’s University ‘Compact’ Can Help Fix It.,"college, us politics, freedom of speech, academic freedom, donald trump, federal aid","Last week the Trump administration sent letters to a group of presidents of universities proposing a set of principles that has come to be known as the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” The purpose of the compact is to set forth the minimum standards of conduct and performance that institutions of higher education must meet to benefit from a relationship with the federal government. The compact is not yet final and remains subject to further input and discussion, including from campus leaders. This sort of proposal is not unusual. For more than 20 years, government mandates on a host of issues — including diversity, discrimination and student discipline — have been welcomed on college campuses because they fit within the prevailing partisan ethos. But this government mandate, intended to promote excellence in core academic pursuits and to protect free speech, is being met with prophecies of doom. As someone who played a part in the compact’s initial formulation, working alongside an administration working group, I would like to offer what insight I can into the motivation and need for the compact and to address its detractors. I am the product of and have long believed deeply in the promise of America’s institutions of higher education. At their best, colleges and universities instill curiosity, critical thinking and commitment to bettering ourselves and our communities. American higher education has, moreover, been an engine of opportunity to countless Americans who have acquired the skills to pursue meaningful work, support their families and drive American prosperity. But the system is broken. Over the past year, I have spoken with countless university presidents, directors and advisers; scholars and academics; and lawmakers, policy experts and activists. The one thing they all agree on is that our university system, which was once one of the nation’s greatest strategic assets, has lost its way. The evidence is overwhelming: outrageous costs and prolonged indebtedness for students; poor outcomes, with too many students left unable to find meaningful work after graduating; some talented domestic students and scholars have been crowded out of enrollment and employment opportunities by international students; and a high degree of uniformity of thought among faculty members and administrators, which can result in a hostile environment for students with different ideas. Critics have argued that it is not the place of the federal government to solve these problems. But without government involvement, reform will be difficult. Many colleges and universities, and especially some of the oldest and traditionally prestigious schools, are burdened with archaic governance structures that make self-reform all but impossible. This means that course correction must come from the outside. Given the enormous investment of taxpayer money, it is appropriate that the federal government be involved. The government should not be using public funds — tens of billions of dollars annually in research funding, to say nothing of student aid — to prop up a system that purports to educate American students and serve the public good but is all too often doing nothing of the sort. How do colleges and universities demonstrate that they are making decisions and carrying out policies that serve the public good by promoting excellence in their teaching and research? By agreeing to a few common-sense policies laid out in the compact. These include: selecting students and faculty members based on individual merit instead of group characteristics; holding the line against grade inflation; providing transparency to students about the economic potential of the academic programs on offer; prohibiting discrimination, harassment and intimidation of students; neutrally enforcing “time, place and manner” guidelines for protest activities; refraining from taking institutional positions on political controversies unrelated to a school’s core mission, while encouraging all members of the community to speak out and debate in their personal capacities; reporting and following all applicable rules on foreign contributions; and enrolling and educating primarily American students, so that schools remain U.S. institutions with foreign diversity instead of becoming global institutions that happen to be based in the United States. These are not politically partisan requirements. It is eminently reasonable for the government to expect all this of schools before providing them with public funds. Critics have charged that the compact threatens free speech. It does no such thing. It places no constraints on individual speech, nor does it intrude on academic freedom. The compact does require schools not to punish, intimidate or incite violence against conservative ideas. Those are not speech restrictions. They are restrictions on the suppression of speech. It is also important that colleges and universities remain neutral on hot-button political issues, as the compact requires. As many leading colleges have learned, the alternative is chaos and an environment that stifles rather than promotes individual expression. After all, who speaks for a university in the first place? The president? The provost? The board? Department chairs? When those or other individuals purport to speak on behalf of an entire school or department, those pronouncements chill the speech of students or professors who may think otherwise but who fear reprisal. No school will be forced to adhere to the compact’s principles of fairness, civility, neutrality and transparency. If schools do not want to be accountable to these requirements, they need not accept federal funding. Ultimately, their commitment to these principles may also serve as a signal to donors, parents and others about which colleges and universities deserve their confidence and support. With these reforms, America’s institutions of higher education can return to their proper mission. And in so doing, American democracy, ingenuity and prosperity will be ensured for generations to come.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/opinion/trump-compact-universities-rowan.html,Society,BBC,By Marc Rowan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/opinion/09rowanimg-2/09rowanimg-2-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-10T09:01:52+00:00,c9559dd9dff3886f3d9c30dfb346fbef5a49e473

During the early 20th century, the court repeatedly invalidated laws protecting unions; judges even jailed labor leaders who led strikes. When Congress, during the Great Depression, passed the National Labor Relations Act enshrining the rights to organize, bargain and strike, most observers believed the Supreme Court would deem the law unconstitutional. But workers organized to defend their rights, articulating a bold constitutional vision rooted in the First Amendment’s rights of free expression and association, the 13th Amendment’s promise of free labor and Congress’s regulatory authority. In the face of huge protests and strikes, and a threat from President Franklin Roosevelt to pack the court with more justices, the Supreme Court relented and upheld the statute . When courts close doors, people can open new ones. In the 1910s and ’20s, the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down federal laws protecting children from exploitation. Undeterred, labor advocates demanded that their elected representatives try again. Reformers even pushed a constitutional amendment. Though it failed, the campaign created the momentum for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which prohibited child labor and guaranteed minimum wages and overtime protections. By the time a challenge reached the Supreme Court, its composition had changed, and a majority of its justices no longer viewed such labor laws as unconstitutional. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, voters in Ohio, Michigan, California and other states amended their constitutions to guarantee reproductive freedom. These campaigns not only secured rights for millions, but they also provided a foundation for potential federal change by demonstrating the depth of popular support for constitutionally protected reproductive rights. What lessons should we take from this history now? First, Americans must embrace our collective role in upholding and interpreting the Constitution. This requires shedding the myth of juristocracy, which paralyzes us. The Constitution deliberately disperses interpretive power to Congress, the president and state officials. More important, as the preamble to the document makes clear, “we the people” are the ultimate sovereigns. Second, we must pursue the Constitution’s democratic promise. A Constitution faithful to the ideal that every person should be able to participate meaningfully in self-government should robustly protect voting rights, freedom of speech, equal opportunity and due process for all. It should also empower the government to secure the social and economic conditions that enable equal political participation in practice: labor rights, freedom from oligarchic rule, health care, education and a clean environment.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/opinion/constitution-trump-supreme-court.html,Society,BBC,By Kate Andrias,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10andrias-ghlf/10andrias-ghlf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:01:48.339000+00:00,75cb933fc4b84d26fabacaf6669123a5ccaa7dd5

Prompt That Could End the World,"artificial intelligence, computers and the internet, tech industry, biotech;bioengineering, virus, anthropic, google, meta, openai, x.ai, metr, yoshua bengio, sydney von arx, marius hobbhahn","How much do we have to fear from A.I., really? It’s a question I’ve been asking experts since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022. The A.I. pioneer Yoshua Bengio, a computer science professor at the Université de Montréal, is the most-cited researcher alive, in any discipline. When I spoke with him in 2024, Dr. Bengio told me that he had trouble sleeping while thinking of the future. Specifically, he was worried that an A.I. would engineer a lethal pathogen — some sort of super-coronavirus — to eliminate humanity. “I don’t think there’s anything close in terms of the scale of danger,” he said. Contrast Dr. Bengio’s view with that of his frequent collaborator Yann LeCun, who heads A.I. research at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. Like Dr. Bengio, Dr. LeCun is one of the world’s most-cited scientists. He thinks that A.I. will usher in a new era of prosperity and that discussions of existential risk are ridiculous. “You can think of A.I. as an amplifier of human intelligence,” he said in 2023. When nuclear fission was discovered in the late 1930s, physicists concluded within months that it could be used to build a bomb. Epidemiologists agree on the potential for a pandemic, and astrophysicists agree on the risk of an asteroid strike. But no such consensus exists regarding the dangers of A.I., even after a decade of vigorous debate. How do we react when half the field can’t agree on what risks are real? One answer is to look at the data. After the release of GPT-5 in August, some thought that A.I. had hit a plateau. Expert analysis suggests this isn’t true. GPT-5 can do things no other A.I. can do. It can hack into a web server. It can design novel forms of life. It can even build its own A.I. (albeit a much simpler one) from scratch. For a decade, the debate over A.I. risk has been mired in theoreticals. Pessimistic literature like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares’s best-selling book, “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies,” relies on philosophy and sensationalist fables to make its points. But we don’t need fables; today there is a vanguard of professionals who research what A.I. is actually capable of. Three years after ChatGPT was released, these evaluators have produced a large body of evidence. Unfortunately, this evidence is as scary as anything in the doomerist imagination.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/opinion/ai-destruction-technology-future.html,Society,BBC,By Stephen Witt,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/opinion/12Witt-Cover/12Witt-Cover-facebookJumbo-v2.png,2025-10-10T09:01:43+00:00,f26e725ca5b747493fa5f06bc170a575c84597d7
8ed90533f3f0,A One-Side Peace Plan Still Gives Palestinians Hope,"israel gaza war, palestinians, peace process, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, gaza strip, israel, middle east, west bank","The agreement this week between Israel and Hamas is not a forever peace as President Trump has claimed nor the total victory that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised. As long as Israel pursues its annexationist policies in the West Bank the agreement cannot offer a credible path to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Too much blood has flowed and too many traumas have scarred an entire generation of Israelis and Palestinians for that to be possible, at least for the foreseeable future. But for the first time in two years a U.S.-brokered accord offers a way out of the bloody parade of horrors Israelis and Palestinians have visited on one another since Oct. 7, 2023. With focused and determined leadership, it may be possible at least to imagine a better pathway for Israelis and Palestinians. Under the agreement, Hamas is to release Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, Israeli forces are to pull back in Gaza and Israel is to allow in humanitarian aid. Those are among the few elements that negotiators for both sides actually agreed to in the 20-point plan proposed by the United States last month, a plan that aspires to a comprehensive end to the Israel-Hamas war. With two combatants pledged to each other’s destruction, the pitfalls of an ambiguous plan, much of which remains to be negotiated, are all too obvious. Israel and Hamas both would have leverage over the pace at which provisions would be carried out and could block progress. The plan seems to offer few details about how both sides move from one phase to another; how compliance will be monitored and by whom; and what happens if one side fails to carry out its obligations. The other flaw is that the plan, like so many U.S. initiatives before it, is tailor-made to address Israeli needs and requirements. Of course, extremist ministers in Mr. Netanyahu’s government oppose some elements. The plan does away with any notion that Palestinians will be forced out of Gaza. It inveighs against any Israeli occupation or annexation. And it includes the release of Palestinians who have murdered Israelis. But the plan adheres strongly to Mr. Netanyahu’s goals, including front-loading the return of the hostages, demilitarizing Hamas and ending its governance in Gaza. While mentioning Palestinian statehood, it promises only a vague pathway to that target. It is perhaps the most pro-Israeli component of the plan — the release of the hostages — that offers the best chance of defusing the conflict and benefiting Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Once the hostages are released, the justification and support for Israel’s continuing its comprehensive military operations in Gaza will erode and most likely end under pressure from Washington and key Arab states. Along with the hostage release, Israel is supposed to undertake a limited withdrawal. Battle lines so described in the accord would remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal. Humanitarian assistance would surge “without the interference” as the agreement notes, of either Hamas or Israel. Monitoring and pressure from the mediators — Egypt, Qatar, possibly Turkey but mainly the United States — would be critical in making this happen. Why, at the beginning of the third year of this war, which started with the killing of 1,200 people in Israel by Hamas and has led to the death of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the devastation of Gaza, are we possibly closer now than ever before to ending it? It could be that the military commanders of Hamas on the ground who are responsible for making decisions were under pressure from the external leadership to accept this deal and ensure the political survival of the organization. At the same time, the group may well have determined that keeping the hostages was an increasing liability because it allowed Israel to continue comprehensive military operations and pressure Hamas without end. Arab states almost certainly made this argument. A weakened and isolated Iran, Hamas’s main patron, was evidently unwilling and unable to do much to change the group’s fortunes for the better. But the main driver in this affair was Mr. Trump’s pressure on Mr. Netanyahu. It was evident that Mr. Netanyahu would rather not have done this deal. In an unusual display of U.S. presidential pressure on an Israeli leader, Mr. Trump forced him. As the inestimable Israeli journalist Nahum Barnea noted , Mr. Trump doesn’t threaten Mr. Netanyahu, he orders him. It’s impossible to predict whether the headlines of hope and promise reflected in Mr. Trump’s Gaza initiative will truly bring the war to to an end, let alone create momentum toward a broader peace. Almost every point in the president’s initiative contains a universe of complexity that needs to be negotiated. At its core, the plan, like its predecessors over the past two years, contains a fundamental impasse: how to reconcile the conflicting objectives of Hamas and Israel. That impasse is the reason all previous efforts to defuse the conflict never moved beyond an initial stage. The Netanyahu government wants Hamas to disappear as a military organization and as a political entity capable of resurgence. Hamas clearly wants to retain its weapons, remain the most influential force in Gaza and ultimately dominate the Palestinian national movement. It strains credulity to imagine that any security forces from Arab countries would deploy into Gaza, as the plan suggests, risking killing Palestinians or watching as Israeli forces did the same. Other elements of the plan, including decommissioning Hamas’s arsenal or dismantling its tunnel system are big lifts. Constructing a “board of peace” dominated by international actors has its own difficulties. There’s the issue of the president himself. If he does manage to bring about the release of the hostages, the delivery of humanitarian assistance and reduced Israeli military operations, it may well be that the Gaza situation will become less urgent to him. A president whose attention span is short and unfocused might lose interest in the next phases, which entail enormously complicated negotiations. The past two years have driven home the reality that in a conflict perceived to be existential, or nearly so, from the perspective of the combatants, the influence of outside parties is inherently limited. That said, having been a part of failed Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking efforts for the better part of 20 years, I believe any accord, especially one between Israel and Hamas, is an extraordinary accomplishment. Under these circumstances and in the face of immense human suffering, it was essential to offer a different pathway, however imperfect. Indeed, wherever the path ends, for the hostages, their families and the Palestinians civilians in Gaza, there’s at least some hope and promise of a better day.

c734c219b4a9,My Country’s President Is 92 Years Old. And He’s Not Going Anywhere.,"cameroon, paul biya, election, aging, donald trump, robert mugabe, yoweri museveni","The country’s first president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, ruled with an iron fist. A young Mr. Biya was by his side as prime minister, watching and learning. In 1982, Mr. Ahidjo was apparently convinced by a French medical doctor to resign on health grounds but assumed he would continue to pull the strings from behind the scenes. Instead, he had handed power to Mr. Biya on a silver platter. The former president soon went into exile, where he spent the rest of his life. Mr. Biya has come to embody Cameroon, shaping the country in his image. Though often reclusive, he remains at the very center of the nation. He is head of state, chairman of the Higher Judicial Council and commander in chief of the armed forces. Much like in George Orwell’s “Animal Farm,” where a hen boasts, “Under the guidance of our leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days,” Mr. Biya’s ministers attribute every success or stroke of luck to him. Mr. Biya’s concentration of power is partly a response to the traumas of his early presidency. In his first couple of years in office, he survived two coup attempts. Then came the pressures of the so-called third wave of democracy , sweeping the continent. After some hesitation, Mr. Biya opened up the country’s politics. The first multiparty presidential elections took place in 1992, and many believe the opposition actually won . But the Supreme Court declared Mr. Biya the victor, with the presiding judge admitting that his “hands were tied.” From these experiences, Mr. Biya took notes. Cameroon now has about 300 political parties , many thought to be funded by the government to weaken genuine opposition. As commander in chief, Mr. Biya is in full control of the military and even created what looks like a personal militia, the Rapid Intervention Battalion, notorious for serious human rights violations . He has long relied on the security services to sniff out discontent. Given that over six million Cameroonians live in extreme poverty , despite the country’s vast natural resources, that’s not in short supply. Deep social divisions further entrench Mr. Biya’s rule. The three northern regions are predominantly Muslim and most of the south is Christian, while around 20 percent of Cameroonians speak English and are often at odds with the French-speaking majority. Mr. Biya and his allies ably exploit these divisions , especially along ethnic lines. In the English-speaking regions, what’s more, an armed separatist conflict has been raging since 2017. Once opposition territory, these areas are now too consumed by chaos to pose a challenge.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/opinion/cameroon-paul-biya-election.html,Society,BBC,By Shuimo Trust Dohyee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10dohyee-cmpz/10dohyee-cmpz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T05:00:05+00:00,c169a427f89737cb874c32d3c69629b002d26247
9270a1e373d3,"Give Trump the Nobel for Gaza, if He Does the Harder Parts to Come","donald trump, israel gaza war, peace process, international relations, us foreign policy, palestinians, hamas, palestinian authority","I hope that if the first stage of this Gaza cease-fire, hostage release and prisoner exchange comes off as planned in the next few days that President Trump is showered with praise — for three reasons that could impact the future of both the Middle East and America. First, because getting to this point really was hard. It took a geopolitical bank shot that had to bounce off — and simultaneously win the trust of — Israel, Hamas, Qatar, Turkey, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the U.A.E. before landing in Gaza. On the degree-of-difficulty scale, this was right up there. Good for the president and his team for engineering it. Second, this is just the first stage of a multistage plan. So if Trump owns this early part, has his name on it and wins accolades for bringing it off, it should ensure that he remains engaged to push through the later stages of his peace plan. They are much harder and — I cannot stress this enough — they will require Trump staying fully engaged. Mr. President, you may not be interested in Palestinian or Jewish history, but they are now both very interested in you. I worry that Trump does not fully respect the complexity of the task his administration has taken on with the plan that will bear his name. We are talking about full-scale nation-building in Gaza, which is almost completely destroyed, yet still home to some two million uprooted people. With a national security team that is now woefully small, Trump will have to oversee the disarmament of Hamas, the recruitment and development of a multinational security force to fill the vacuum created when Israel withdraws, the rebuilding of Gaza from scratch and the forging of a transitional government to run the place. And it will all be done under the eye of an Israeli government that is deeply suspicious that Hamas will regroup. Trump told his cabinet Thursday with his usual penchant for exaggeration: “We ended the war in Gaza, and on a much bigger basis, created peace … hopefully an everlasting peace in the Middle East.” I sure hope he does not really believe that, because he will be working on Gaza for the rest of his presidency. That said, if successful, the implementation of the harder stages holds the promise of reviving, over time, the possibility of a two-state solution under a totally new formula — one that combines Palestinian, Arab and international stewardship over Gaza’s future. If it works, the arrangement might one day be extended to the West Bank. I think Trump’s team has come up with an intriguing new model for dealing with the future of both occupied territories, because Israelis and Palestinians can no longer resolve their conflict alone. After the Gaza war, there is not a shred of trust left between them. The gears for collaboration are all stripped bare. They will need permanent U.S. and Arab guarantors for peace. (More on this another day.) If the implementation of all the stages of this peace plan rebuilds a pathway for Israeli-Palestinian peace, that would be worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize. Maybe even two. The third reason I hope Trump gets his due for engineering this peace plan has nothing to do with the Middle East. It’s out of a hope, which is probably in vain, that this might actually inspire Trump to make peace in America as well. “Blessed are the peacemakers,” Trump wrote on social media. Well, they sure are, Mr. President, and now that you have brought a measure of peace to Gaza by showing respect and building trust with all the parties — you even got a longtime U.S. enemy, Hamas, to trust you — please try the same diplomacy at home. Instead of making America as fractured as Gaza, by indicting your political foes on the flimsiest of charges and boasting that “I hate my opponent,” as you did at the Charlie Kirk memorial, why not surprise us all on the upside: Invite the Democratic leaders to Camp David and tell the world you’re not coming out without an American-American peace treaty? Remember, you won. You’re president. Set a positive example and rise above all your personal grievances. Look at all the good you can do in the world by forging compromises. Do that at home and your popularity will soar. Don’t do that — and keep playing the uniter in the Middle East and the divider in America — and this Gaza plan will be a footnote to a failed presidency. To that end, I hope Trump reflects on how he pulled together the Mideast deal. His is a rather unusual diplomatic negotiating style. When it came to seeking peace in Gaza, Trump was not interested in the politics of distributing blame or slinging humiliating nicknames at any of the parties, including Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. He was only interested in getting to yes with those who could make it happen and get him closer to a Nobel Peace Prize. In a region where few leaders do not have blood on their hands or political prisoners in jail (for advocating human rights), Trump is a welcome relief from Democratic presidents. He doesn’t give two cents about the human rights scorecard of any of these players. But he also was not ready to indulge their usual excuses about how their domestic politics would not allow them to compromise. Trump’s approach was: I am not interested in who you are; I will judge you by what you do. If it is what I want and need, you are great; if it gets in my way, I will make you pay. Democrats, generally speaking, are just not as good at combining moral indifference with coercive diplomacy in the name of peace. It comes naturally to Trump. Middle Eastern leaders see him as one of them. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it : “The president had some extraordinary phone calls and meetings that required a high degree of intensity and commitment and made this happen.” Oh, boy, as a Middle East aficionado, I would love to have listened in on those calls! Both Hamas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will find a way to say this result is a great achievement, but it is not the result they were seeking as they fought this war. Hamas launched this war on Oct. 7, 2023, in part to destroy a Biden plan that started with reforming the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank — Hamas’s archrival, which has embraced the Oslo peace accords. This reform of the P.A., in the Biden plan, was then supposed to pave the way for negotiations with Israel on a two-state solution and, in return for that, Saudi Arabia was to normalize relations with Israel, and the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were to sign a security treaty. Hamas, and its regional backer, Iran, did not want to see any Palestinian progress toward a two-state agreement that would be led by the P.A., let alone normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. That would have left both Iran and Hamas very isolated. Now they are both isolated and militarily devastated. At the same time, Netanyahu fought this war — from Day 1, in my view — in a way that he hoped would result in Israel’s controlling Gaza forever, through some kind of quisling local forces that would not include either Hamas — the terrorists who started the war — or the Palestinian Authority — the logical alternative to Hamas. Bibi constantly sought to delegitimize the P.A. because he did not want a single moderate Palestinian negotiating body that could represent the Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza. That would immediately have led to global pressure to negotiate a two-state solution. With Trump Bibi got just the opposite. Trump’s plan doesn’t promise Palestinian statehood, but it stipulates that as Gaza redevelopment advances and the Palestinian Authority reform program is carried out, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.” Netanyahu played into Trump’s hands by putting himself entirely in Trump’s hands. Over the last year, in pursuing his scorched-earth policy in Gaza, Bibi told the world to get lost, Europe to get lost, Democrats to get lost, liberal American Jews to get lost, Israel’s Arab allies to get lost, even moderate Republicans to get lost. He put Israel’s fate entirely in Trump’s hands, thinking that when Trump came up with his first Gaza plan — a cockamamie plan to get all the Palestinians out of Gaza and turn it into a new Riviera — Trump had given him a free pass to raze Gaza. But when the Arabs and America’s European allies, and Tony Blair, weighed in and turned Trump back toward a real peace process — declaring that Israel could not annex Gaza or the West Bank — Netanyahu had no lever left to pull. He had no Trump or Republicans to undermine the president the way he did with Joe Biden. That is what got us here, and why is “here” so important? A member of the Israeli negotiating team at Camp David in 2000, Gidi Grinstein, put it well in an email to me: The 20-point Trump plan offers a pivotal opportunity to not only bring peace to Gaza and free the hostages, but to “re-establish the longstanding fundamental principles of the Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic process since the Camp David Accords of 1978-79.” How so? Trump has established, Grinstein explained, “that there will be no unilateral annexations in Gaza or the West Bank; that an upgraded and reformed Palestinian Authority will be the self-governing body of the Palestinians in the West Bank and, in the future, in Gaza.” And the political horizon, he went on, includes a nod by Trump toward the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which, Grinstein wrote, “effectively means some form of political separation between Israel and the Palestinians.” As I said, just stopping this terrible Gaza war — if it holds — is worthy of praise and the stuff of wonderful headlines. But seeing this whole plan through would be the stuff of history and Nobel Prizes. And getting Trump to realize what made him effective in the Middle East — governing by addition, not division — would actually make him so much better a president at home. That would be the stuff of miracles.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/opinion/trump-israel-nobel-gaza.html,Society,BBC,By Thomas L.

805786a2f213,Why Are the Democrats Increasing Inequality?,"us politics, k-12 education, no child left behind, literacy, every student succeeds, tests, national assessment of educational progress, democrats, income inequality, us","When Democrats are at their best, they are performing one job: reducing inequality and making American life more just. That’s what Franklin Roosevelt did with the New Deal and Lyndon Johnson tried to do with the war on poverty. That’s what Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did with their education reform policies. Both Clinton and Obama ran as education outsiders and change agents. In between those presidencies, Democrats worked with George W. Bush on the No Child Left Behind Act, which passed with a majority of 384-45 in the House and 91-8 in the Senate. No Child Left Behind was all about bringing accountability to America’s schools. Because of those reform efforts, student achievement test scores in reading, math and most other academic subjects shot upward between the mid-1990s and about 2013. In 1990 48 percent of America’s eighth graders scored below basic competency in math. But by 2013 that was down to just 26 percent. The best part of this progress was that the scores of the most disadvantaged students shot up the most. Among Black students, the share of those scoring below basic in math fell from 78 percent to 48 percent. Among Hispanic students, it fell from 66 percent to 38 percent. Student outcomes are rarely just about what happens in the schools. The policies of that so-called neoliberal era helped, too. Economic growth was strong; income inequality decreased. Between 1983 and 2010 the child poverty rate fell from 30 percent to about 17 percent. Then came the financial crisis in 2008. States and families had less to spend on education. That slowed the increase in student achievement scores, but it did not stop it. The turnaround came in about 2013. Ever since then, American student achievement scores have been falling. Scores for students at the top end of the performance distribution are merely stagnant. But the scores of students from less privileged backgrounds are collapsing. Outcomes are becoming more and more unequal, and the life opportunities for American young people are becoming more unequal, too. What happened around 2013? Two things. The first was screens. If you use screens to read articles and books, you are building mental muscles, but if you use screens to passively consume short videos, you’re basically committing intellectual suicide. As James Marriott argued in an essay that went viral several weeks ago, democracy and literacy rose together. The world of print is the world of logical, complex and rational ideas. An avid reader is absorbing disciplined habits of thought. Because of smartphones, global literacy is in rapid decline. The share of American 18-year-olds who say they have difficulty thinking or concentrating has been rising since around 2013. The share of adults who lack basic literacy and numeracy skills is surging. I.Q. scores, which had been rising for a century, are falling in all but one category of the tests. Smartphones are a global phenomenon, and sure enough, student achievement scores and general reasoning abilities are declining in many different nations around the world. But we shouldn’t be fatalistic about phones. They clearly impede intellectual attainment, but what really matters is what individuals, families, schools and nations do in response to them. And in this regard, U.S. performance is particularly terrible. As Nat Malkus of the American Enterprise Institute has demonstrated, the achievement gap in the United States for science and math is growing far faster “than in any country with comparable data.” We have done almost nothing to protect our most vulnerable people from the scourge of the screens. That’s in part because of the second thing that happened around 2013: The American political center collapsed. Populist Republicans replaced Bush-style Republicans. The populists didn’t like the way No Child Left Behind centralized power. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party shifted left. Progressive Democrats never liked the accountability regime in the first place, and since then, progressives have marginalized the moderate education reformers. In 2015 Congress replaced No Child Left Behind with the Every Student Succeeds Act. The age of accountability was over; the age of equity was here. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, states no longer had to produce rigorous report cards on how schools were doing. Most Democratic states watered down the accountability mechanisms. For example, California revised its rating system, and magically, nearly 80 percent of its schools were ranked as medium- or high-performing. George W. Bush had earlier warned of the “soft bigotry of low expectations,” but in the age of equity, schools moved to ease rigor and standards for poorer kids. Many schools stopped assigning whole books and started assigning short passages. What the education writer Tim Daly calls the education depression had begun. Some people blame the Covid-19 pandemic for our catastrophically declining test scores. But the educational depression started before Covid and was only magnified by it. James H. Wyckoff of the University of Virginia estimates that about 47 percent of the decline in eighth grade math scores since the pandemic were “predicted” by trends that were already in place before the coronavirus hit. You probably saw stories on the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress Report. The average 12th-grade reading scores are now lower than at any time since these reports began publishing 33 years ago. Once again, top performers merely stagnated, but scores from the lowest performers fell through the floor. A few paragraphs ago I mentioned that during the accountability era, the number of Black students scoring below basic levels in math had fallen from 78 percent to 48 percent. Well, now that number is back up to 62 percent. My own conclusion is this: The equity approach is supposed to increase, well, equity. But by lowering accountability, rigor and standards, it produces more inequality. We’ve now had 12 years of terrible education statistics. You would have thought this would spark a flurry of reform activity. And it has, but in only one type of people: Republicans. When it comes to education policy, Republicans are now kicking Democrats in the butt. Schools in blue states like California, Oregon and Washington are languishing, but schools in red states like Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Louisiana, traditional laggards, are suddenly doing remarkably well. Roughly 52 percent of Mississippi’s Black fourth graders read at grade level, compared with only 28 percent in California. Louisiana is the only state where fourth-grade achievement levels have returned to prepandemic levels. An Urban Institute study adjusted for the demographics of the student bodies found that schools in Mississippi are educating their fourth graders more successfully in math and reading than schools in any other state. Other rising stars include Florida, Texas and Georgia. Writing in Education Next, the scholars Michael Hartney and Paul E. Peterson report on an interesting turnaround . In 2019 deep blue states tended to have higher average reading scores for fourth graders than deep red states after adjusting for demographics. By 2024 that had flipped: “Red states rank highest, blue states lowest.” The so-called Southern Surge came about because the red states built around a reading curriculum based on science, not ideology. The schools provide clear accountability information to parents and give them more freedom to choose schools. They send coaches to low-performing classrooms. They use high-quality tutoring, and they don’t promote students who can’t read, reducing the bureaucratic strings that used to control behavior in the classroom. They also hold schools and parents accountable. In Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, a child who isn’t reading at the end of third grade has to repeat it. Where the hell are the Democrats? One gets the impression that many of them have spent the last decade deciding that social justice ideology is more important than reducing inequality. What was Joe Biden’s big K-12 education idea? Zippo. In 2024 there was nothing but a howling void where Kamala Harris’s education agenda should have been. Fortunately, there are some bright spots. A few days ago I was scrolling through my phone (yes, I have my own addictions) when I came across an astonishing video. Rahm Emanuel was speaking in Iowa and was asked about school reform. He proceeded to rip through a series of ambitious and credible ideas: Return K-8 to the fundamentals, like phonics, the way Mississippi is doing. Completely reinvent high schools, which haven’t changed in a century. Put a special focus on keeping freshmen on track, because once they are juniors it’s too expensive to try to get them on a better course. Create incentives for students who earn a B average to get books and transportation for free. Bring college into high school with dual credit programs so they can gain confidence and do advanced work. Make high school degrees contingent on students having a letter of acceptance from a college, the armed forces or a vocational training program so they have a plan for the day after. In this video, I saw an impressive and even inspiring Democratic approach to improving student outcomes. It probably helps that Emanuel served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, when the Democrats were a strong reform party. It probably helps that Emanuel was mayor of Chicago. Between 2009 and 2014, Chicago student learning improved from third grade to eighth grade at a faster rate than students in 96 percent of the school districts in the United States, according to a Stanford study. Between 2007 and 2019, Chicago’s high school graduation rates went from around 60 percent to 82 percent. We can’t live in a country in which the party that dominates the rural areas has a proven educational agenda while the party that dominates the urban areas doesn’t. The Democrats lost part of their soul when they lost touch with the working class; they’ll lose whatever is left of it if they can’t be a party that champions equal opportunity. We can’t live in a country that is rapidly losing its basic intellectual abilities, where those who are least privileged get hammered the most.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/opinion/democrats-education-failure.html,Society,BBC,By David Brooks,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/09brooks1-jqfv/09brooks1-jqfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T21:00:08+00:00,17e2610a0a4dfa1bf75ef5e793dc9240ddbddb26
5366f93af62e,These Are the 10 Old Television Series Every Kid Needs to Watch,"tv, youth, comedy","6. “Cheers.” Kids should see a pioneering workplace sitcom, an ancestor of “The Office.” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” was mother’s milk to me, but it was really all about Mary. “Cheers” was truly an ensemble. I found the relationship between Sam and Diane richer than the one between him and Rebecca, but any episode before Shelley Long left will do, especially after the first season, when the show was still getting its sea legs. 7. “The Twilight Zone.” This show, with characters ending up in a parallel universe or confronting an alien sensibility among people they thought were ordinary, packaged a meme: that there is a realm deep down somewhere, beyond what we see and feel. This was Freud and Jung on TV. Plus the cinematography is exquisite, with many of the episodes shot on the same lots that films were made on. I showed my girls “ Walking Distance ,” in which a man tries to visit his hometown but ends up going back in time and getting a surprise. 8. “Mannix.” Weird choice, I know. But my girls should know the conventions of the once ubiquitous hourlong private-eye genre, including the way it reduced female characters to just dolls. I found that weird even when I was a kid, and I want my girls to see what we have gotten at least partly beyond. Plus, the look and sound of “Mannix” were a delight. The fashions, sets and even jazzy three-quarter waltz time theme song are groovy. Especially after the first season, when Mannix has left a detective agency and goes it alone, the episodes are pleasingly interchangeable; choose the one with your favorite guest star. 9. “The Carol Burnett Show.” The kids should catch at least one episode of the grand old genre of variety shows. Burnett’s makes for a useful example for a few reasons: It was in color, she was especially good, and her work still holds up. (I’m not sure how much my girls would get out of Milton Berle.) The musical spots are educational, too, examples of good music that didn’t require screaming, sexual energy or shocking the bourgeois. 10. “Fawlty Towers.” Time was that the Britcom was an exotic bird, with different pacing, humor and language from what Americans were used to. Less so now: “Fleabag,” in its fourth-wall-breaking winkiness, was in a similar universe as “The Office.” “Fawlty Towers” was definitely of the earlier era — weird, brutal and perfect, a great introduction to Brit wit. I’d choose the episode in which Basil tries to venture an American expression and yells at his chef, “I’m gonna break your bottom!” OK, fine, my list is actually a little longer. I have also slipped my daughters the episode of “The Honeymooners” with the “Chef of the Future” sketch and the occasional episode of my very favorite old Britcom, “Are You Being Served?” But to me, the 10 above are Common Core TV.

39b66ad8bf2a,Is America Making God Angry?,"calvinism, douglas wilson, christianity, catholic church","new video loaded: Is America Making God Angry? transcript Is America Making God Angry? Do Americans need to repent for their sins? In this episode of “Interesting Times,” the evangelical pastor Doug Wilson tells Ross Douthat why he believes Christian nationalism is the solution to societal decay and Americans need to “stop making God angry.” Give me just your definition of Christian nationalism. Christian nationalism is the conviction that secularism is a failed experiment, that societies require a transcendent grounding in order to be able to function at all. And as a Christian, I believe that transcendent ground should be the living God and not an idol. That would be my short-form definition of Christian nationalism. Even shorter would be Christian nationalism is the conviction that we should stop making God angry. And so that’s the first purpose of your political project, for America to stop making God angry. Yes. And most people think that when they are confronted with that project that we have, is they think that we want to get our tentacles into everything and start controlling everything. I actually think we need limited government. The government should be significantly smaller than it is, and we need to curtail a lot of the busybodiness that we have. And so that’s why I would call myself a theocratic libertarian. There is a true libertarian element in this. And yet the transcendent grounding for what we’re talking about means that we acknowledge the authority of God, and we have racked up quite a body count of awful crimes. And I believe the only way out is for us to repent and turn to Christ. So, and repentance and turning to Christ would be things like no more Pride parades, no more drag queen story hours, no more abortion on demand, no more legalized same-sex unions.

On this week’s “Interesting Times,” he defends his use of “naughty words” as weapons in his arsenal. Don’t, don’t act demure. You have an entire style, right? And you have defended this style at length where that says basically that it is perfectly Christian to speak the language of insult, to call people — I just wrote down a few — lumberjack dykes, small-breasted biddies, gaytards, and then some other phrases that I’m not going to use on a podcast like this one. And that’s part of the appeal too, right? It is. It is correct. You are in your own distinctive way, very online and speaking some of the language of that kind of world. Yes. Do you want me to defend it? I’m not — I’m not trying to be politically incorrect for the sake of being politically incorrect. And I’m not using the language that you referred to, I’m not resorting to that kind of language because I want to be Ecclesiastical Howard Stern or some shock jock —— That actually was in my notes. I’m not. I’m not joking. Howard Stern, the Howard Stern comparison. So what I’m doing when I use —— I’m a wordsmith. I write a lot, I use words, and when I take certain words out with a sharp, pointy edge or a blade, it’s a weapon to be used in a particular situation for a particular purpose in a particular time. It’s not for, “Ooh, he said a naughty word.” That’s not right. But don’t you think some of your fans take it that way. Yes, yeah, but this is the problem with mass communication of any sort. So if you write for 10,000 people, somebody’s going to misunderstand what you’re saying or what you’re doing or what you’re up to. And it is true that the language that I’ve used occasionally — — so I’ve written millions of words, and you can go through and pick out all the jalapeños, and you can make them into a jalapeño paste, and you can put them all onto one cracker and get a completely different effect than what is happening in real time in these real battles.

be39585f70d0,I Love Watching Yankees Fans Suffer,"baseball, playoffs, yankees","“One belongs to New York instantly, one belongs to it as much in five minutes as in five years,” Thomas Wolfe wrote in “The Web and the Rock.” That was certainly true for me, a small-town boy from the New England side of Connecticut, northeast of the line dividing the Red Sox and Yankees halves of the state. I’ve now lived in New York for nearly 50 years, and I cling to the city like a lifeline. I’ve dedicated a book to this place, thanking it for giving me a home. Even now, as friends weigh ways to flee from the Trump administration, dusting off the former citizenships of their forebears (even to places they fled) or plotting escapes to Costa Rica or Canada, I’ve only dug in. I can’t imagine being anywhere else. But those feelings of belonging go only so far, and vanish when it comes to the Yankees. Watching their fans watch them play, I recognize all those obnoxious stereotypes of New Yorkers which, in every other context, I’m the first to resist — of arrogance, rudeness, impatience, omniscience. These New Yorkers think they’re better than everyone else, more entitled than everyone else and more immune to life’s indignities than everyone else — like losing a ballgame. So I celebrate whenever that happens — as it did on Wednesday night, when the Yankees fell 5-to-2 in the American League division series to the Toronto Blue Jays, ending their season. It was a different game that exemplified the entitled attitude of Yankees fans for me. In early September I went to Yankee Stadium with my pal Howard, who, because he’s from Detroit, bears a chip on his shoulder about the Yankees nearly as monumental as mine. The Yankees melted down just wonderfully that night, yielding nine runs in the seventh inning in a spectacular display of ineptitude — and we just ate it up. The fan reaction that night followed a familiar pattern. The cheering quickly stopped and the booing began, reaching a crescendo when the much maligned manager Aaron Boone dared to emerge from the dugout. And then came the ultimate protest of Yankees fans: thousands of them streaming — storming — out early, leaving the joint to people like Howard and me, those New Yorkers by choice Thomas Wolfe wrote about, people from Baltimore and Chicago and Boston and elsewhere who’d shed their hometowns but never their baseball loyalties. In my mind, we were multitudes. And we basked. Unsurprisingly, such feelings only intensify for me when the Yankees play the Red Sox, especially in the postseason, as they did this year. When that happens, I devolve, like a Rod Serling character, from a semi-sophisticated, aging Upper West Sider to a hick kid in the wilds of rural northeastern Connecticut between Worcester, Mass., and Providence, R.I. Just like that, I’m back in a time when the Red Sox still hadn’t won a World Series since 1918; the Yankees were still U.S. Steel ; and my big brother was still a Yankees fan, his Mickey Mantle mitt still over his left hand. So the psychological stakes were high. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

f59d6bbf128b,A Skeptical Reception for Hegseth’s Quantico Talk,"pete hegseth, christopher caldwell, us military, civil rights movement, us politics, pentagon, diversity initiatives, segregation, quantico marine base va","To the Editor: Re “ Don’t Be So Quick to Dismiss That Hegseth Speech ,” by Christopher Caldwell (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 9): Mr. Caldwell’s essay on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s speech at Quantico, Va., was not about military excellence. It was about selective memory — a wish to forget why inclusion became a value in the first place. Mr. Caldwell claims that diversity efforts have distorted the military’s mission, but history says otherwise. Desegregation didn’t weaken the armed forces. It made it stronger and more reflective of the nation it defends. Nostalgia for an “apolitical” military is really nostalgia for a time when politics didn’t have to include everyone. Mr. Caldwell’s argument rests on a false choice between justice and competence — as though fairness and effectiveness were opposing goods. In reality, exclusion wastes talent and erodes trust. A military that mirrors its democracy is not distracted from its mission. It embodies it. In the long run, it’s Mr. Hegseth’s vision — one that prizes ideological conformity over competence and inclusion — that would most endanger readiness. A military defined by resentment and exclusion rather than merit and inclusion will corrode from within, and in doing so, hasten the very decline in American strength that its champions claim to fear. Samah Tokmachi Los Angeles To the Editor: Christopher Caldwell’s analysis and defense of Pete Hegseth’s recent speech to military leaders echoes history. In 1949, Army Secretary Kenneth C. Royall testified, “The Army is not an instrument for social evolution.” Mr. Royall was responding to President Harry Truman’s two executive orders of July 1948 desegregating both the military and the federal work force. President Truman’s orders were his response, in large measure, to the violence — including lynchings — committed against returning Black World War II veterans. President Truman forced the secretary’s resignation in 1949. The arguments made against desegregation in 1948 — particularly those coming from Jim Crow Southern Democrats — mirror the complaints we now hear about diversity: that it negatively affects cohesion, morale, mission readiness and enlistments. They were wrong about desegregation. Both the military and the country emerged better for it. Kenneth C. Davis New York The writer is the author of “The Hidden History of America at War” and other books. To the Editor: Christopher Caldwell articulates a key premise from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s speech to top military brass gathered in Quantico, Va., when he writes that “diversity initiatives, whatever their merits in civilian life, have changed military culture for the worse.” Never mind that neither Mr. Hegseth nor Mr. Caldwell offers any evidence that diversity in the military has undermined military readiness, or would undermine military fitness on the battlefield. Our all-volunteer military is nothing if not diverse. If you are going to try to limit the military to just the strongest and manliest white guys you can find, or simply make other types of service members feel unwelcome, you are likely to reduce the size and talent pool of the armed forces. I don’t see how that can possibly make for a stronger military. Also, in our current world of drones and A.I. technology, what is needed is not just brawn, but brains as well. To the extent we as a nation embrace Mr. Hegseth’s wrongheaded notions about diversity, we do so at our great peril. Dan Frazier Boca Raton, Fla. To the Editor : It’s almost impressive how much rhetorical contortion Christopher Caldwell used to portray Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s Quantico speech as “nuanced.” The author of this analysis seems determined to find coherence where there was mostly bluster — to elevate a culture-war sermon into a vision for the military’s future. But the harder one works to make Mr. Hegseth’s words sound principled, the clearer it becomes how little principle there actually was. We’re told that beneath Mr. Hegseth’s “raw vocabulary” and “rude provocations” lies a sophisticated philosophy of military purpose. Yet the evidence offered — Mr. Hegseth’s promise that there will be “no more identity months, D.E.I. offices, dudes in dresses” and “no more climate change worship” — reads less like doctrine and more like talk-radio rage. The writer keeps insisting that Mr. Hegseth’s rudeness was “balanced” by some implied respect for fairness — as though tone and substance were equal halves of a moral equation. In reality, the speech’s core message was exclusion, dressed up as purity of mission. This is not analysis so much as translation — from outrage into philosophy. And that’s what makes the whole exercise so revealing. If it takes this much linguistic and moral gymnastics to make Mr. Hegseth sound reasonable, maybe the speech wasn’t reasonable at all. Maybe the only nuance here is in the spin.

f923072997f4,An Invitation to President Trump: Come to Gaza,"israel gaza war, palestinians, peace process, israeli settlement, palestinian authority, mahmoud abbas, donald trump, gaza strip, israel","I say this as a Palestinian who has lived through the worst days of this war from Jerusalem, watching the suffering of my people in Gaza with anguish and helplessness. Two million human beings trapped between despair and survival have long needed a leader, any leader, who could break the cycle of vengeance. Mr. Trump did that. He may have divided opinion around the world for his other actions, but in this moment in the Middle East he united many here into believing in the possibility of life over death. For decades, diplomacy has promised peace to our region and failed to deliver. From Oslo to Annapolis, Md., from Camp David to countless back-channel talks, each effort raised hopes only to leave deeper disillusionment. Agreements were signed, photos taken, prizes awarded — yet on the ground little changed for Palestinians or Israelis who yearned for normal lives. That is why many of us approach this moment with cautious realism. We have seen too many handshakes that led nowhere, too many chances squandered. Even so, we cannot afford to stop believing that one of these deals might finally endure. Peace, if it is to mean anything, must be built from the ground up. It is not written in a treaty; it is written in the rebuilding of homes, in children returning to school, in fishermen allowed back to the sea. It depends on Palestinians and Israelis choosing coexistence over fear. Peace cannot take root amid hunger and humiliation. In Gaza, tens of thousands still face starvation and disease. Basic aid — food, medicine, clean water and shelter — must flow freely and immediately. The cease-fire will mean little if people continue to die from deprivation. The cease-fire will not hold by itself. Israeli and Palestinian leaders must show restraint and vision. For this peace to last, every side must act with courage and responsibility. Israel’s government must halt all settlement expansion and stop the seizure of Palestinian land in the West Bank. Security can no longer be pursued through domination. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority must end political divides among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and agree on a path toward national elections. Our people need leadership chosen at the ballot box, accountable to its citizens and committed to rebuilding, not to ruling by fear. Mr. Trump must remain engaged, ensuring that the terms of the agreement reached on Wednesday are fully put into force — from humanitarian relief to reconstruction and political renewal. The success of this peace depends not only on stopping the guns but also on restoring legitimacy and hope to both peoples. The international community must invest not only in reconstruction but also in reconciliation — in education, dialogue and joint initiatives that rebuild trust after years of hatred. And we, the Palestinian people, must refuse to surrender again to extremism or despair. That means rejecting the politics of revenge, insisting on unity through elections and building a culture of accountability. Peace will not come from slogans or foreign aid alone; it will come from the hard daily work of rebuilding our society on the principles of dignity, democracy and mutual respect.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/opinion/palestinians-israel-gaza-war-ceasefire-peace.html,Society,BBC,By Samer Sinijlawi,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/09sinijlawi-wqhm/09sinijlawi-wqhm-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-09T14:20:31+00:00,489d865844b1930c0f1d7fbffa3ffb0abf6992a8

This is our first conversation about the state of American law — the first in what I hope will be a long, informative (and maybe even a little bit fun) series. Let’s kick off with the big picture. I don’t want to be the kind of person who declares every Supreme Court term (much less every election) to be the “most important of our lifetimes,” but doesn’t this term feel particularly important? And it’s not necessarily because of the classic culture war issues, such as abortion, free speech or L.G.B.T.Q. rights, but rather because of the cases that will help decide fundamental questions about our constitutional order. We’ll find out how much power President Trump has to continue to transform the presidency in his own authoritarian image. Or is that too alarmist? Emily Bazelon: Hi, David! I’m so glad to have this chance to think things through with you. At another moment, we’d spend most of our time disagreeing, I think, about many of the culture war issues you’d mention. But, no, I don’t think you’re being too alarmist. I wish I did! For the magazine, I just surveyed 50 people in the D.C. legal establishment — former top officials in the Justice Department and the White House Counsel’s Office and retired judges. Frankly, I heard a lot of freaking out about how much of a threat they think Trump’s second presidency is to the rule of law. With near unanimity, even though they were evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, they think he is remaking government and effectively daring the courts to stop him. And every single one of them agrees that he is using the legal system to punish his perceived enemies and reward his allies. So far, the Supreme Court has done little to stop him. Very little. Precious little. David: Can I share the executive power case that alarms me the most? It’s called Trump v. Slaughter , and the first question is whether the court will overrule a 1935 case called Humphrey’s Executor , which upheld limits on the president’s ability to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission. The question of the president’s authority over independent agencies or commissions is important (most conservatives, me included, believe Humphrey’s Executor was wrongly decided and that the president should be able to fire the heads of agencies that operate in the executive branch), but there is a second question in that case, and the answer could have enormous implications. The court has asked the parties to brief and argue “whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law.” The implications here are staggering. Could a president really just sweep through the Civil Service, firing everyone at will, and then sit back and wait to be sued for damages? All while he runs wild with something that looks a lot like the old spoils system of the 19th century? Emily: Here’s an argument that Humphrey’s Executor was rightly decided. When Congress established some of the federal agencies we’re talking about (including the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 and the Federal Communications Commission in 1934 and then added more later, like a national health department in 1953 and the Federal Election Commission in 1974), it intended for the agencies’ leaders to have some independence from the executive branch. Congress said the president had to have cause to fire an agency head, meaning that he or she was corrupt or a bum or whatever. That’s how the federal government has functioned for more than 90 years, since the Supreme Court said yes to that structure in Humphrey’s Executor. It’s a basic part of the architecture. Would Congress have delegated all this authority to the agencies without the assurance that the president couldn’t replace their heads to serve his personal or political interests? To move on to your excellent point about the second question in the case, I agree, it’s breathtaking. How is this supposed to work if the whole Civil Service can be canned by any president at any time? Oh, wait, we are finding out what that looks like in real time, with 150,000 federal employees losing their jobs so far, and Trump threatening many more layoffs given the current government shutdown. If the government ranks get refilled in every new administration, a ton of institutional knowledge and skill walks out the door. And who will want these jobs? The honor of a lifetime of civil service helps draw people, many of whom would make more money in the private sector. David: Give a president total firing power and combine it with his pre-existing pardon power over federal crimes, and you’d allow the federal government to be run as a criminal enterprise. That’s not the only risk this term. The tariff cases are important in at least two different directions. First, there’s the core question: Did Congress delegate its tariff power to the president in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act? In other words, can the president really enact tax increases on the American people without any new act of Congress? I’m also wondering how much deference the court will give the president when he invokes his power over foreign policy and international diplomacy. Is that a jurisprudence-free zone, where the court abdicates any oversight? You see the theme here. Who, really, has the power to check a president? Emily: Yes, that’s the huge question the country faces, right? So let’s bring in Congress. For sure, Congress has the power to check Trump or any president. Congress can withhold funding. It can hold hearings with subpoenas for members of the executive branch. It can use its collective authority in many ways. We have seen almost none of that from this Republican-controlled Senate and House. You and I started with the courts because we’re both law nerds (hope you don’t mind; I mean it as a term of endearment). But, actually, we let Congress get away with slinking out of the role the founders gave it if we don’t drag it in here. Congress, where is your institutional and constitutional, as opposed to partisan, loyalty? OK, back to the courts. Tell me what you think of this: Judges all over the country are struggling with a hard and in many ways untested premise. How do courts respond when the president and his deputies act in bad faith — when they dissemble about why the administration is taking unprecedented aggressive actions after ripping out all the internal checks (goodbye, properly functioning Office of Legal Counsel, which used to flyspeck every executive order)? Judges are used to giving the president deference — in effect, the benefit of the doubt. But that becomes a big problem when the president says there’s an emergency over and over again, to justify tariffs, and the deployment of troops to American cities, and, oh, now we’re at war with “narcoterrorists” — except we’re blowing them up without proving anything about them when they’re on boats without enough fuel to reach our shores. The courts have to conduct factual inquiries into the president’s justifications. We are seeing that from the lower courts. Judge Karin Immergut, whom Trump appointed, is offering a great example on the deployment in Portland, Ore. Deference “is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground,” she wrote in blocking Trump from sending the National Guard to Oregon. “The president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts.” So far I see so little appetite for this kind of analysis from the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. My question for you is — why not? Have these justices really drunk the administration’s unitary executive theory Kool-Aid? Are they saving their powder for a big case this term that will actually set the administration on its heels? Are they afraid of a confrontation they think they’ll lose because Trump would defy their order, and he’s the one with an army, not them, and has already shown his willingness to deploy it, including in the city where they work? David: I’m glad you used the phrase “untested premise.” Courts are so used to presuming good faith on the part of the executive branch that there’s even a legal doctrine called the “ presumption of regularity ” — a rebuttable presumption that executive branch officials have “properly discharged their official duties.” These doctrines developed over time because presidents of both parties largely maintained and respected the rule of law and proper levels of independence for federal prosecutors. I don’t think that the Supreme Court has drunk the administration’s unitary executive Kool-Aid so much as it’s struggling to fit a rogue administration into pre-existing legal theories and categories. Most conservative justices have long held the view that the Constitution grants presidents a very high degree of control over the executive branch, but the court has not clearly defined the limits of that control. One thing is already clear, though: If Congress continues to abandon its constitutional role, the courts can’t fully fill that void, even if they consistently rule against the president. They don’t have the jurisdiction, nor the enforcement power. As you say, they’re not the branch with the Army, nor are they the branch with the power to impeach and remove the president. OK, I’ve monopolized the question-asking so far. Sorry! What’s on your mind? Emily: Well, fitting this administration into pre-existing theories does risk real and debilitating blindness to what’s happening on the justices’ watch. I’m a big believer in other institutions not warping themselves in response to Trump by overreacting. But I feel like the Supreme Court is in danger of cowering in the corner, next to Congress, rather than safeguarding our system of separation of powers among coequal branches. On to my questions, sorry for the rat-a-tat, this is surely too many at once. I want to know what you thought of the arguments in the case the Supreme Court heard on Tuesday about Colorado’s ban on conversion therapy to change a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity — in other words, to try making them not gay or trans. Also, will the college student who sued over Idaho’s ban on trans women playing college sports be allowed to drop her case, as she is trying to do at this late date , after the Supreme Court agreed to hear it? There’s also a suit from a trans girl challenging a West Virginia law that barred her from playing sports in middle school. Those are the big L.G.B.T.Q. cases coming up on the docket. David: I think it’s almost certain that Colorado will lose its conversion therapy case and that states will be permitted to reserve women’s sports to biological females . While it’s absolutely undeniable that different forms of conversion therapy have done terrible harm to some L.G.B.T.Q. kids, the Colorado statute was remarkably broadly written. (And I should mention that the Christian counselor who brought the lawsuit in the case is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, where I used to work.) Colorado’s definition of conversion therapy included banning “efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions.” When applied to talk therapy, you’re talking about restricting, for example, a therapist helping a Christian or Muslim kid align his behavior with his own moral values. And if you grant a state the ability to ban a particular kind of talk therapy, then what’s to stop a state from doing the reverse: banning therapy that’s affirming of L.G.B.T.Q. kids? Regarding sports, I sincerely doubt the court will allow the trans plaintiff to moot the case by dropping it, and the court will almost certainly find that it is acceptable for a state to restrict athletic participation by sex. The existence of separate men’s and women’s leagues is rooted in various innate sex differences; it’s not rooted in discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Emily: Here is one problem with striking down Colorado’s ban on conversion therapy. The plaintiff, a Christian counselor, says the ban violates her First Amendment rights because the treatment she provides takes the form of speech. And yes, sure, it’s called “talk therapy.” But it’s still a form of treatment. You don’t pay your therapist to say whatever she wants. You pay her to provide treatment based on the standard of care, which Colorado tried to reinforce with this law. And in that sense, it’s like the treatments for transgender minors that the court allowed Tennessee to ban last summer. At issue then, in the Skrmetti case, was Tennessee’s barring health care providers from offering one treatment — puberty blockers and hormone therapies — to minors who want to transition. Why say no to Colorado and yes to Tennessee? The court will probably answer “because of the First Amendment.” But is the underlying reason that the conservative justices disapprove of puberty blockers and hormone treatments but not conversion therapy? There’s also a line-drawing problem, I think. Lots of professions operate through speech and expression — lawyers and architects and accountants, for example. Are state regulations for them now subject to free-speech challenges and the higher level of judicial scrutiny that brings? Laws should protect patients’ expectations of competent care, and as you say, conversion therapy is harmful. David: Now we’re getting into some of our disagreements! Regarding Colorado, there is a substantial difference between conversation and medication (much less surgery). Issues surrounding sex, sexuality and gender identity are fraught with values-laden questions that deeply implicate morality and religion. For the state to enter into the conversation and essentially block off one avenue of therapy in favor of the state-approved viewpoint is to bring the state into the middle of making these moral and religious decisions for both the kids and their parents. The regulation of talking professions (including lawyers) has always raised First Amendment concerns . Putting speech regulation under the rubric of licensing doesn’t mean that the speech is any less constitutionally protected. But that also doesn’t mean that individual providers are unaccountable. Abusive practitioners are subject to malpractice suits, for example, but the First Amendment should at the very least mean that expansive prophylactic speech restrictions should be subject to strict judicial scrutiny. Emily, we’ve covered some very heavy stuff: the fate of the Constitution’s separation of powers, the conflict between religious freedom and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, equality in sports. Can we close on a lighter note? What’s the best lawyer-themed show that you’ve watched in the last year? Emily: LOL, yes, we can. But first, and forgive me, because I should just graciously let you have the last word, but I have to say I’m still unpersuaded by one answer from the court for treatment-as-speech and the opposite one for treatment-as-meds on the basis of the counselor’s freedom of speech claim. I hear you on morality and religion. So then bring a suit based on freedom of religion for your counseling practice. It’s telling to me that the counselor who is suing doesn’t even clearly say she is doing conversion therapy and that Colorado has not so far actually enforced its ban. A lawyer-themed show. Let’s see. You know what? I often don’t like shows with lawyers that much. Maybe that’s because I watched a lot of “L.A. Law” in the 1980s and can’t move on from it. But I think I also can’t get over the realism bump. So then every episode of, say, “Suits” ends with me turning to my husband with a boring rant about how that would never happen in court, not ever. I mean, come on . You know what show I have loved lately? “Somebody, Somewhere.” Set in Manhattan, Kan. Band of misfits with a genius for both comedy and pathos. In some episodes, almost nothing happens, which feels like the perfect antidote to this moment. Low stakes! How about you? David: I started with the first legal word, so it’s only fair that you get the last. I’ve got the cure for your American legal drama blues — British crime shows! I have no idea whether they’re getting the law right, so I can just sit back and enjoy the ride. I liked the latter seasons of “Broadchurch” more than some folks for that reason. It was enjoyable watching the barristers do their thing (and it made me want a powdered wig). Emily: OK, I promise to watch “Broadchurch” before we meet next. Do you promise to go see “One Battle After Another” so we can talk about that? Of course, no one will care what we the law nerds think. Nor should they. But that movie is still in my head, so any excuse to revisit it, I will take. David: Oh, I definitely intend to watch “One Battle After Another.” I’ve heard great things.

ed82c99bab25,This Is Why Your Energy Bills Are Going Up,"price, energy industry, regulation and deregulation, renewable energy, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, solar energy, wind power, oil and gasoline, windmill, donald trump, us politics","You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests. These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change. President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power . It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result. Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted. Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse. Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels. Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families. Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels. Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves . He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working , creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga. Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China . The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody. We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy. The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening. Under Mr. Trump, Republicans have gone even further. They have become the party that stands in the way of lower energy prices for American households.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/opinion/trump-energy-bills-prices.html,Society,BBC,By The Editorial Board,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/opinion/09cleanenergy-editorial-image/09cleanenergy-editorial-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T09:00:53+00:00,74bdfad60882d938d77774dc8da623e6c9f1255a
9293399ebcba,"Putin Is Escalating His War. If You Are Surprised, You Have Not Been Paying Attention.","russian invasion of ukraine (2022), vladimir putin, international relations, us foreign policy, military, drones, bashar al-assad, ronald reagan, mikhail s gorbachev, poland, russia, us","There is a saying that each U.S. administration discovers Russia anew. Almost every president in recent decades has entered the White House hoping for a fresh start , but the result has always been the same: The more that’s offered to Moscow, the more it demands. In the early hours of Sept. 10, more than 20 drones launched from Russia violated Poland’s airspace. NATO jets were scrambled to shoot them down. These drones did not veer off course. They did not drift into a NATO country by mistake. My government is certain that it was a provocation orchestrated by the Russian regime. Just over a week later, three Russian fighter jets violated Estonian air space for around 12 minutes . These and other incidents are yet more proof that the Kremlin is not interested in peace but in escalation. If you are surprised by that, you have not been paying attention. Since his inauguration, President Trump has tried every diplomatic avenue to achieve peace in Ukraine. He created the position of special envoy for peace missions and nominated to the post someone acceptable to the Kremlin; American diplomats have met their Russian counterparts on neutral ground, and the special envoy has visited Moscow several times; Mr. Trump has personally and publicly asked President Vladimir Putin of Russia to “ STOP! ” the war in Ukraine, and when Mr. Putin ignored the request, Mr. Trump offered to meet him one on one in Alaska. But the arithmetic of war speaks for itself: Russia is not looking for an offramp. Its military spending for 2025 is estimated to reach 15.5 trillion rubles, around $190 billion, up 3.4 percent from 2024. Spending on defense and security in 2026 is projected to consume roughly 40 percent of Russia’s entire budget . And this April — three months after the new U.S. administration took office — Ukrainian officials said that Russia was planning to increase its troop presence in Ukraine by 150,000 by year’s end. Russian bombs have never stopped pounding Ukrainian cities. Now come the brazen incursions into NATO airspace. These incursions are not a sideshow; they are another rung up the ladder of escalation. Mr. Putin may have accepted the invitation to Alaska, but not to negotiate in good faith — he wanted to buy time. His long-term goals have not changed: rebuild the Russian empire, undermine trans-Atlantic security guarantees, divide the West, and — last, but certainly not least — weaken the United States. In 2013, Mr. Putin wrote in an essay in Times Opinion that “we need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in today’s complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos.” Sounds reasonable, doesn’t it? The essay was headlined “A Plea for Caution From Russia” and opposed American plans to intervene in Syria against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, who had attacked his own citizens with sarin gas . Within a year Russian soldiers would be in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and eight years later Mr. Putin would start the deadliest war in Europe since World War II, which has so far left nearly 1.5 million soldiers killed or wounded . No U.N. Security Council mandate was given and the U.N. General Assembly condemned the attack, to no avail. But it is possible to negotiate with Russia. Just do it in two stages: Make a show of force first, and only then have dialogue. The negotiations between President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that helped to end the Cold War could not have taken place had Mr. Reagan not first exploited the weaknesses of the U.S.S.R. by exerting heavy military and economic pressure, including by supporting groups and countries that were challenging the Soviets all over the world, like the Polish Solidarity movement and the Afghan ​​​mujahedeen . This two-stage approach did the trick: When the Kremlin elite realized that they were too weak to break Mr. Reagan’s determination, they began to negotiate. Mr. Putin is not there yet. The only way to bring him to a negotiating table is by making him realize that he cannot kill his way out of the mistake he made on Feb. 24, 2022, when he began the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. To do this, it is essential to continue to support Ukraine financially and militarily, and to undermine the foundations of the Russian war economy. A good beginning would be for the self-described MAGA acolytes in Hungary and Slovakia to listen to Mr. Trump and stop buying Russian oil, and to finally use the more than $200 billion of frozen Russian assets in Europe to give financial assistance to the victims of Mr. Putin’s war. The largest country on earth doesn’t need more land. It should take better care of what is already within its internationally recognized borders. The leadership of Russia must understand that its attempt to rebuild Europe’s last empire is doomed to fail.

5cad83d7fb0c,‘ICE Goes Masked for a Single Reason’,"immigration and customs enforcement;ice, freedom of the press, deportation, immigration detention, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, us border patrol, kristi noem","To a degree, the pattern follows a global trend. The U.N. has been warning about increasing violence and hostility toward the press for many years, with killings of journalists up 38 percent in 2022 and 2023 from the two previous years. More than 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict there — a figure much higher than in previous wars — making it, the Committee to Protect Journalists said, “the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists” that the organization had ever documented. What makes this even more remarkable is that Israel has largely blocked foreign reporters from entering Gaza since the conflict began. It also reflects an increasing porousness about the term “journalist” and what we even mean by it in 2025, when almost anyone holding a phone can claim to be doing journalism, including many of those superficially indistinguishable from protesters (who, it pains me to have to say, should enjoy robust First Amendment protections in the United States, too). That porousness also means that category distinctions can be made pretty arbitrary — not just between observers and activists but also between the groups the online right likes to distinguish, citing Carl Schmitt, as friend and enemy. “There is an authoritarian playbook, and it has different steps,” said Zamora. “And it has started happening here in a very fast way.” At various points over the past decade, nervous Americans sometimes told themselves certain calming stories about the threat of Trumpism — that liberal hysteria was a bigger threat to democracy, that the lesson of his first term was that incompetence stymied ideology, that popularity would be a check and that the courts would be trusted to ultimately hold. ICE’s budget for the 2025 fiscal year is now set to roughly triple from the year before, as is its number of deportation officers, and Mr. Miller, Trump’s top domestic policy adviser, does not appear inclined to defer to surveys of public opinion when it comes to deportations and border enforcement. Democrats have come a long way since “Abolish ICE,” too, with many pivoting pretty hard on immigration in recent years. In certain moments from certain vantages, the proceedings can look like incompetence, with all the Sturm und Drang of Trump’s policies producing far fewer than his desired one million deportations and a high-profile monthlong operation in Chicago yielding just more than 1,000 arrests. On social media, it can even look like farce — someone flinging a Subway sandwich at Customs and Border Protection officers in D.C., someone else cursing the president and then scooting off on his bike as Border Patrol agents chased on foot in downtown Chicago, a crowd surrounding and shaming two agents as they wrestled a man to the ground on the South Side, eventually getting them to flee . But these are not the clips we are meant to see. For that, we have a beautiful, high-production-value hype video full of portentous music, documenting an apartment raid, that Noem posted to social media over the weekend. “Chicago, we’re here for you,” she wrote.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/opinion/ice-masks-immigration.html,Society,BBC,By David Wallace-Wells,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/opinion/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T20:00:03+00:00,0d7bd09b1affffac82b4906c2e2a2467df774cc6
01cd6f4f73b8,The ‘Irony’ of the Government Shutdown,"neera tanden, donald trump","One of the ironies of this fight is that Democrats are shutting the government down to protect and extend tax credits that heavily disproportionately benefit red states, because in a bunch of these red states they didn’t expand Medicaid, and it means more people get the tax credits. So you have more than 10 percent of the population now, in Florida, in Texas, in Georgia, in South Carolina, in Utah, using the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies. Talk to me a bit about both the policy and the politics of that. I mean, the politics of health care has been really odd over the last decade or so, because while we have gotten 40 states to do Medicaid expansions, there are 10 states that have not passed Medicaid expansion. In those states, you do see a much higher percentage of people on the exchange markets, just because they’re so clearly desperate to have health and they can’t really get it. And of course, I think it is kind of insane. We live in a country where you have states where if you’re slightly higher income, you get into the exchange markets, but really low-income people don’t have it. I do think that is very perverted. And I’m glad that over a decade, so many more states have come on. But that does end up being a situation where, as Kaiser Family Foundation has noted, we’re talking about 75 percent of people in these exchange markets, really being in places that Trump won. So it’s just a long way of saying that Republicans who are choosing essentially to make people in their states who already are struggling — I mean, these are not wealthy people — just face, again, not just a slight premium increase but a real premium shock. So this gets to the politics of this in an interesting way. The Kaiser Family Foundation did a poll on whether or not people thought these credits should be extended, whether or not the tax credits should be extended, they did this roughly at the end of September. 78 percent of Americans were in support of extending the tax credits. You don’t get that high of a number for many things anymore, but that included majorities of not just self-described Republicans but self-identified MAGA supporters. It had nearly 60 percent support from people who said they were MAGA. There was a Wall Street Journal story the other day where Trump administration officials were starting to say anonymously that they’re actually worried about this, that they feel that this is actually a tough thing for them to own. It’s not going to be great for them if health care premiums skyrocket for millions of people on their watch. The shutdown fight is a partisan fight. The politics of this, the polling of this, who it helps, who it hurts, are not a partisan issue. It does not break along partisan lines.",https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010441605/the-irony-of-the-government-shutdown.html,Society,BBC,,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/opinion/08eks-tanden/08eks-tanden-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,2025-10-08T19:24:59.240000+00:00,9240e2e067b2d186ca93869864327096d3510da7
46e0d6476460,"The G.O.P.’s ‘Cynical, Ridiculous’ Shutdown Attack","neera tanden, donald trump","The other Republican argument is that what Democrats are really trying to do here is give health care subsidies to, as they put it, illegal aliens. What is that argument they are making? OK, I mean, I just need to say this is like the most deeply cynical, ridiculous thing, but I will —— I watched your shoulders actually fall. Like [laughs]: I can’t believe I have to deal with this [expletive]. I mean, it is just like, I mean, it’s really funny to me. It’s like, you can —— I mean, I worked in the White House, and I could just imagine them dialing up an illegal immigration argument as they have to deal with a confrontation on health care, which, of course, they know that they have to deal with anyway. So it’s just totally odd, but OK. The best case of their argument is that during the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Republicans limited Medicaid coverage to legal immigrants in the United States. It took — they made it more difficult for legal immigrants. No illegal aliens, no undocumented people. Nobody crossing the border. We’re talking about people like Afghan refugees, Ukrainian refugees, people subject to domestic violence who get protected status. So these are all people who have legal status in the United States. Now, they are doing a card trick to call them illegal aliens. They have legal status in the United States. They are not illegally here. They’ve like shown themselves to the government. We know who they are. And Democrats put forward and basically they said: We’d like to undo everything you did in the Medicaid — on your attacks on Medicaid. And this was one part of it. But really, the substance of their argument was: Undo the massive cuts to the Medicaid program. So that is like just false that it is covering illegal aliens. They are not illegal aliens. It is currently illegal under federal law for federal dollars to go to health care subsidies for people here illegally. So that is like the No. 1 point to just say about this, which is the truth is that for those of us who are old enough to remember, and I have some battle scars over this issue, having worked on the legislation, was a big, robust debate about whether people were legally here, illegal aliens, undocumented people could get access to the A.C.A., and there is literally a provision that says, by statute, you cannot receive health care and the premium tax credit cannot go to any illegal aliens, undocumented people, whatever you want to call them, that is illegal. And that is why they’ve had to do this mental gymnastics to get — to basically transform people who are legally here into illegal aliens, like that is just, this is like two different words. They have two different meanings, and they’re just conglomerating them in order to have some shred of making a lie true, but it is still a lie.",https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010441604/the-gops-cynical-ridiculous-shutdown-attack.html,Society,BBC,By ‘The Ezra Klein Show’,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/opinion/08eks-tanden/08eks-tanden-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,2025-10-08T19:22:35.461000+00:00,d4487016bc296c7d35fca96efcdf21552e424fe4
69c211cea6c0,Delaware’s Highest Court Considers Elon Musk’s Tesla Pay Plan,"elon musk, tesla, executive compensation, electric cars and hybrids, state supreme court, decisions and verdicts, stocks;bonds, companies, management, legislation, hnwi;wealth;billionaires;1 percent, kathaleen st. j. mccormick, delaware","A long-running dispute about Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package from Tesla moved a step closer to resolution Wednesday as the Delaware Supreme Court heard arguments in an appeal filed by the company. Tesla is challenging a 2023 decision by a lower-court judge, who found that shareholders had not been properly informed about the plan that helped make Mr. Musk, the automaker’s chief executive, the world’s richest person. The judge, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery, also found that members of Tesla’s board were not sufficiently independent. Besides affecting Mr. Musk’s wealth, a decision in the case could also have ramifications on where businesses are incorporated. Many large American companies have long been domiciled in Delaware because it is widely considered to have strong corporate laws and its courts are seen as efficient at resolving disputes. The state, which has sought to burnish and protect that reputation, relies on the revenue and jobs that come with being the legal home to so many businesses. At an hourlong hearing in Dover, the justices considered Tesla’s argument that Delaware courts should honor a vote by shareholders last year, after Ms. McCormick’s decision. That vote reaffirmed the compensation package, which is worth more than $50 billion. Some of the justices asked questions that seemed sympathetic to Tesla’s argument that the second shareholder vote fixed flaws in how the package was formulated in 2018. Ms. McCormick ruled that Mr. Musk manipulated the negotiations with Tesla’s board and that the company did not disclose some board members’ conflicts of interest. Justice Karen Valihura implied that upholding the lower court decision would leave Mr. Musk with nothing to show for his management of Tesla. “Do you have a case where a court has equitably rescinded an executive’s compensation after years of work?” she asked Gregory Varallo, who represented the dissident shareholder who filed the suit. Charles Elson, a prominent authority on Delaware corporate law, said after the hearing that Supreme Court decisions were nearly impossible to predict based on the questions that justices ask. But he said that the court may want to demonstrate its independence after Mr. Musk attacked Ms. McCormick’s character and integrity on social media and in public statements. “There’s an institutional bias here to support a judge who did a careful job,” said Mr. Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Generally the court takes several months to issue a decision. In a measure of the case’s significance for executive pay, it attracted a large number of briefs from various people and groups. Mr. Musk’s supporters included Sequoia Capital, a prominent venture capital firm; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and a collection of social media influencers focused on Tesla. Sequoia, an early investor in Apple, Google, Nvidia and other technology companies, argued in a brief that Mr. Musk belonged to a group of visionary leaders who “propelled the creation of vast new categories of technological innovation that, in turn, spawned enormous growth beyond just their adjacent technologies.” A decision against Tesla would discourage such visionaries, the firm said. Critics say that affirming Mr. Musk’s compensation would set a dangerous precedent. “It’s the largest package in history, awarded to the richest man on earth and someone who is also one of the most powerful men on our planet,” Mr. Varallo told the justices. “The trial court did its job .” Whatever the court decides, Mr. Musk is likely to receive compensation that is unheard-of in American corporate history. Tesla moved its corporate domicile to Texas after Ms. McCormick’s decisions, and the board of directors has promised to give Mr. Musk the shares he would have received even if the Delaware appeal is unsuccessful. The Tesla board is also asking shareholders to approve a new package in November that could increase Mr. Musk’s wealth beyond a trillion dollars if he achieves a series of milestones during the next decade, including raising Tesla’s stock market value to $8.5 trillion from about $1.4 trillion today. Some lawyers and academics urged the court to uphold the lower court decision. A brief submitted by law professors at Stanford University Law School and several other institutions said that the second shareholder vote was invalid because Mr. Musk had threatened to pursue interests outside the company if he didn’t get his way. “For a stockholder vote to have meaning, it must be uncoerced,” the professors wrote.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/business/elon-musk-delaware-pay-package.html,politics,BBC,By Jack Ewing,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/MUSK-PAY-01-hgvz/MUSK-PAY-01-hgvz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T17:14:18+00:00,c6c4e7506fd075a7008676ff51df4bfafa8320a6
07b6b1db644f,Could a Supreme Court Ruling on Election Maps Affect the Midterms? Timing Matters.,"us politics, supreme court;scotus, redistricting and reapportionment, gerrymandering, donald trump","If the Supreme Court knocks down part of the Voting Rights Act in the coming months, the effects could be felt as soon as the 2026 midterm elections. But it would come down to timing. If Section 2 of the law were to be found unconstitutional, states across the country would be free — though not required — to redraw their congressional and state legislative lines without regard to protecting the voting power of minority communities. But the court often does not issue major opinions until late in its term, often in June or early July. That would be well past many states’ filing deadlines and primary elections for the November 2026 election, and make the introduction of new maps for the midterms all but impossible. The court could move more quickly, however, and issue a ruling in December or January, a rare though not impossible outcome given that the justices have heard the case once before and chose to rehear it early in their new term, which began last week. Were that to happen, state legislatures could work quickly to redraw their maps in time for primary elections next year. “The calendar is the most significant constraint on this,” said Kareem Crayton, a vice president at the Brennan Center for Justice. “And while some state legislators have attempted to try to change that, I think the later a decision arrives, the less likely there’s going to be rethinking of existing maps that are on the books now.” Of course, with the Trump administration pushing states to draw maps with more safe Republican seats ahead of the midterms, it is possible that some states would jump at the opportunity to remake theirs even if a favorable decision arrives late in the calendar. Were the court to rule in a way that allowed states to redistrict to eliminate majority Black districts — which have historically elected Democrats — it would not necessarily be popular with incumbents from both parties. Redrawing majority Black districts would most likely involve dispersing those voters across more districts, potentially endangering Republican incumbents who now represent safe districts. New districts also could face further legal challenges. Such disputes over newly drawn maps, with courts as the final arbiters, could turn on what is known as the Purcell principle.

deeb980f6398,Live Updates: Supreme Court Appears Poised to Upend Key Provision of Voting Rights Act,"decisions and verdicts, voting rights;voter registration;voter requirements, voting rights act, legislation, native americans, supreme court;scotus, samuel a alito jr, neil m. gorsuch, clarence thomas, louisiana","The Supreme Court appeared poised on Wednesday to upend a key provision of a landmark civil rights law by prohibiting lawmakers from using race as a factor in drawing voting maps, which could spark widespread redistricting efforts. It’s not clear how fast any redistricting could happen. The court typically issues major rulings by late June or early July, and the next major vote is the 2026 midterm elections in November. The case examines whether Louisiana lawmakers violated the Constitution when they adopted a new electoral map in 2024, creating the state’s second majority-Black district. It challenges a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During the oral argument, several of the court’s conservative justices appeared focused on whether there should be a time limit for allowing race to be used as a factor in congressional maps, a requirement that stemmed from civil rights era protections aimed at undoing generations of efforts to suppress the power of Black voters. “This court’s cases, in a variety of contexts, have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades, in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who is expected to be a key vote on the issue. “What exactly do you think the end point should be?” Justice Kavanaugh then asked a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who argued to uphold the Voting Rights Act. That question — whether there should be a time limit on using race-based remedies — appeared to be at the heart of the oral argument. The legal battle can be traced back to the 2020 census, which showed an increase in Louisiana’s population of Black adults. While Black Louisianans made up about a third of the state’s population, there was only one majority-Black congressional district out of six districts. After the census, state lawmakers revisited the map and passed a version that still had only one majority-Black district. Two groups of Black voters sued in 2022, asserting that state legislators had violated the Voting Rights Act by packing Black voters into one district and diluting their voting power. The Voting Rights Act, one of the central legislative achievements of the civil rights movement, banned discriminatory practices like literacy tests that had been used to disenfranchise people. A federal judge agreed, finding that the map likely did violate the statute. State lawmakers then proposed another map in January 2024, which included a second majority-Black district — a long, narrow one that wound from the southeast part of the state to the northwest. State lawmakers claimed that they had crafted the map with politics, not race, in mind, protecting valuable Republican incumbents, including Speaker Mike Johnson. But shortly after lawmakers approved that map, a dozen white voters sued, arguing that the new map was an illegal racial gerrymander that had caused them to suffer “unlawful, intentional discrimination based on race.” In April 2024, a divided panel of three federal judges agreed, striking down the new map. Louisiana then appealed to the Supreme Court. The justices paused the lower court’s order, allowing Louisiana’s new map to be used in the 2024 election. Democrats picked up a seat, as voters in the newly created district elected Cleo Fields, a longtime party figure from Baton Rouge. Mr. Fields is Black. The justices heard the case, Louisiana v. Callais, in the spring. But instead of issuing a decision in late June or early July, the justices, in a rare move, ordered new arguments for their next term, which began this month. Rearguments can be a signal that the justices are poised to take a broader action in a case. In 2009, the court called for reargument in Citizens United, a campaign finance case that turned from a minor case into a blockbuster, clearing the way for unlimited campaign spending by corporations. The court offered no explanation for punting on the case, but several weeks later, the justices announced that they would hear arguments on a more expansive question: whether Louisiana’s “intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.” That question suggested that the justices appeared to be considering holding the provision of the Voting Rights Act that has been used to challenge redistricting plans unconstitutional. The court’s conservative justices have long pointed to what they have viewed as a tension between the Voting Rights Act’s goal of protecting minority voting rights and a colorblind conception in the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which requires that the law treat everyone equally. Two years ago, however, the justices rejected an Alabama voting map, finding that it had diluted the power of Black voters. In that case, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who has been a skeptic of the Voting Rights Act for decades, wrote the majority opinion agreeing that lawmakers could take race and other factors into account when redistricting. The new question in the Louisiana case has shaken up the alliances from the first argument. In the months since the justices announced that they would hear arguments again, the Louisiana officials who had defended the map have essentially switched sides, aligning with the white voter plaintiffs. They were joined by lawyers for the Trump administration. In a brief to the court, Liz Murrill, Louisiana’s attorney general, described the structure of the provision of the Voting Rights Act that allows race to be used as a factor in redistricting — Section 2 — as “unworkable and unconstitutional.” The constitutionality of Louisiana’s second majority-minority district was defended on Wednesday by a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Along with voting rights organizations, the NAACP has argued that the case is about whether minority communities continue to have meaningful representation in politics. They have also raised concerns that gains from the civil rights era were at risk.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/15/us/supreme-court-voting-rights,politics,BBC,By Adam Liptak,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15scotus-voting-rights-VRA-other-challenge-topart-ljbm/15scotus-voting-rights-VRA-other-challenge-topart-ljbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:50:52+00:00,f568d232c4aaf831a8e563183922697182dbb7b2
f775e48450c4,Republicans Condemn Racist and Homophobic Texts by Party Officials and Activists,"us politics, republicans, young republican national federation, donald trump, arizona, kansas, new york, vermont, elise stefanik","The Republicans officials who participated in a monthslong racist, homophobic and vulgar text chat are being condemned by some in their own party, and some have lost their jobs or been called on to resign. The 2,900 pages of messages in the chat, conducted over Telegram, involved elected G.O.P. officials and the leaders of local groups for young party activists in New York, Vermont, Arizona and Kansas. The texts were first reported on Tuesday by Politico . According to that report, Peter Giunta, an aide to a New York assemblyman, posted, “I Love Hitler” and wrote, “If your pilot is a she and she looks ten shades darker than someone from Sicily, just end it there. Scream the no no word.” Young Republicans in Kansas exchanged racist and offensive comments about gays and Black people. And in Vermont, Samuel Douglass, a state senator, wrote in a derogatory manner about Indian women. In a text message to The New York Times, Mr. Giunta said he took “complete responsibility” and apologized: “I am so sorry to those offended by the insensitive and inexcusable language found within the more than 28,000 messages of a private group chat.” None of the other officials responded immediately to calls and emails requesting comment. The text messages have been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. The Young Republican National Federation posted on Tuesday that it was “appalled by the vile and inexcusable language” and called it “disgraceful” and “unbecoming of any Republican,” saying the participants should resign. By Wednesday morning, the condemnation had intensified. In Kansas, the state Republican Party disbanded its Young Republicans group. In New York, Assemblyman Mike Reilly fired Mr. Giunta as his chief of staff. And in Vermont, Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican, demanded that Mr. Douglass step down from the state senate. (Mr. Douglass’ wife, Brianna, an official of the Vermont Young Republicans , was also involved in the chat, and posted an antisemitic remark.) The language of these texts seemed to have crossed a line at a time when political discourse has become increasingly vituperative and ugly. In President Trump’s first bid for the White House, he made coarse insults and brazen threats part of his public rhetoric, and others followed his lead. Mr. Trump has said nothing about the chats. Democrats have their own texting issues. In Virginia, Jay Jones, the party’s candidate for state attorney general, has apologized for a series of messages he sent in 2022 comparing the state’s Republican speaker to Hitler and Pol Pot, and suggesting that he deserved to be killed. Republicans have demanded that Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic candidate for governor, withdraw her support for Mr. Jones, who has vowed to stay in the race. Vice President JD Vance , in a post on X, condemned Mr. Jones’ comments and played down the young Republicans’ text messages as akin to “anything said in a college group chat.” He added, “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/young-republicans-texts-backlash-racist-homophobic.html,politics,BBC,By David W.

ebd4276f06b5,U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China,"us politics, politics, us economy, rare earths, metals and minerals, tariff, mining","The Trump administration is seeking to counter new economic measures from China by exerting more control over American companies in key strategic sectors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday. The approach marks a new era of industrial policy in the United States, a contrast to how policymakers have traditionally valued free markets and open investment. But as China’s dominance over the production of rare-earth minerals and battery technology grows, President Trump wants to take a page out of Beijing’s economic strategy. By taking more stakes in American companies that specialize in areas deemed critical to national security, the Trump administration aims to exert more control over what they produce. The goal is for the U.S. to become less reliant on China for sensitive technology that it has been using as leverage in trade negotiations. “When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policies,” Mr. Bessent said at a forum on investing in America sponsored by CNBC. Tensions between the world’s two largest economies have rapidly escalated after the Chinese government last week proposed a new licensing system to cover the global trade in products that contain trace amounts of Chinese rare-earth minerals, or minerals mined or processed using Chinese technology. The rules, which would go into effect later this year, shocked foreign governments and businesses, who would theoretically need to seek licenses from Beijing to trade in products ranging from cars to computer chips , even outside of Chinese borders. The system would also deny shipments to any U.S. and European defense or weapons manufacturers, who are still highly dependent on Chinese minerals. On Friday, Mr. Trump responded by threatening to put an additional 100 percent tariff on products from China on Nov. 1 and cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. After the announcements caused the stock market to plummet, Mr. Trump quickly qualified his statements. He said he might meet Mr. Xi anyway and wrote on social media on Sunday, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” The Treasury secretary pointed to China’s announcement last week of new export controls on rare-earth minerals as a reason the United States must exert more state control over corporations. “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said. The Trump administration has taken stakes in several companies including U.S. Steel, Intel, as well as Trilogy Metals and MP Materials, a rare-earth mining company. Mr. Trump has also demanded cuts of revenue from sales of chips that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices earn from China. The United States has been trying to catch up in the race for critical minerals, which are crucial for advanced technologies including weaponry, airplanes and computer chips. Mr. Bessent noted that the development of a “strategic mineral reserve” is a priority and said that JPMorgan Chase was interested in working with the administration on the initiative. Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration had identified seven industries that it considered of strategic importance where the United States could seek to exert more government control. He pointed specifically to the defense sector, where in some cases the U.S. government is the largest or only customer of certain companies, and said that the administration could insist that companies spend more money on research and less on stock buybacks. “I do think our defense companies are woefully behind in terms of deliveries,” Mr. Bessent said. The United States would use “price floors” and “forward buying” across a “range of industries,” he added, to ensure that China does not dominate other sectors the way it has with the processing and refining of rare earths. The push for greater government control over the private sector is a policy that he has criticized in the past. Last year, Mr. Bessent delivered a speech at the Manhattan Institute deriding the Biden administration’s subsidies of strategic sectors such as semiconductors as “central planning.” At a news conference at the Treasury Department on Wednesday, Mr. Bessent scolded China for deploying similar tactics. “They are a state economy,” Mr. Bessent said. “We are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.” Mr. Bessent and Jamieson Greer, the United States Trade Representative, appeared to escalate trade tensions with China by publicly rebuking their new controls as economic coercion. They accused China of violating the terms of a trade truce reached this year and said that Mr. Trump would not back down from the 100 percent tariffs that he threatened in retaliation even if the trade dispute causes the stock market to tumble. Mr. Bessent, in particular, struck a combative tone, assailing a Chinese trade official, Li Chenggang, in unusually personal terms. He suggested that Mr. Li was a “slightly unhinged” economic diplomat who had gone “rogue” in rolling out the new export measures. The rising tension between America and China comes as global policymakers are gathering in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. While the Trump administration has spent much of the year threatening U.S. allies with steep tariffs, Mr. Bessent suggested that he now wanted to work with those countries to confront China over its economic practices. Mr. Greer criticized China’s new restrictions as “an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world.” Because critical minerals and semiconductors made with them are in so many products, he said, “this rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy and the technology supply chain,” including not only A.I. and high-tech products but also cars, smartphones and even household appliances. Mr. Greer said that the United States complied with the terms of the economic truce it had struck with the Chinese this year. The United States had already drafted its paperwork to add tariffs to Chinese products, and would proceed with that if the Chinese licensing system went into effect later this year. “Our expectation is that this never goes into effect,” Mr. Greer said. The countries have also clashed over a U.S. move to impose fees on Chinese-owned ships docking in American ports, a policy U.S. officials say is geared at revitalizing American shipbuilding. Non-Chinese shipping lines must also pay the fees when they send Chinese-built ships to American ports. Those went into effect on Tuesday, The Chinese government has threatened to hit American vessels with similar fees, and on Tuesday it imposed sanctions on five subsidiaries of Hanwha, a South Korean company that is helping the United States build ships. The order, which took effect immediately, prohibits Chinese companies or individuals from doing business with the Hanwha units. Despite the strident tone from the United States, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi are still expected to meet in South Korea this month. Mr. Bessent also said that there were “working level” meetings taking place between U.S. and Chinese officials on the sidelines of the I.M.F. meetings this week.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/us-government-companies-china.html,politics,BBC,By Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-bessent-01-jfwp/15dc-bessent-01-jfwp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:17:46+00:00,2651504e55ba3a970b75656201ca22ed8bb3b5ed
ff08f743da90,America Is Heavily Reliant on China for Raw Materials in Medicines,"manufacturing, us politics, disesases;health;illness;medicine, international trade, tariff, supply chain, antibacterial, pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, donald trump","For years, Democrats and Republicans have sounded the alarm about America’s dependence on China for medicines. An analysis published on Wednesday shows just how deep that reliance is at the earliest stage of the drug manufacturing process: Nearly 700 U.S. medicines use at least one chemical solely sourced from China. As tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated in recent years, experts fear that this reliance could leave American patients vulnerable, especially if a trade war or future pandemic prompts China to curtail exports. Supply shortages for some generic medicines have already grown common. The new data, from U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit that tracks the drug supply, identified the origins of chemicals used to make medicines. The analysis found that China was the sole supplier of at least one chemical in widely used antibiotics, like amoxicillin, and generic drugs for heart problems, seizures, cancer and H.I.V. One example is the allergy-relief medicine best known by the brand name Benadryl. (Kenvue, the company that sells Benadryl, did not return a request for comment.) There is almost no production of these chemicals in the United States because making them is dirty and labor and other costs make manufacturing them unprofitable. Chinese factories, by contrast, don’t face the same environmental restrictions and can make these raw materials inexpensively. President Trump last week said he would impose a 100 percent tariff on all products from China to retaliate for curbs Beijing announced on rare-earth minerals. If he follows through, it could potentially mean that at least some drugmakers would pay hefty levies on raw materials that they import from China to make their products. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent on brand-name drugs from the European Union and 100 percent from other parts of the world, but he has delayed those. Most major drugmakers have said they will be exempt from any future drug tariffs, because of new U.S. manufacturing investments or drug pricing deals they have negotiated with the administration. The Trump administration has no plans to impose tariffs on generic drugs, an administration official said. This year, with Mr. Trump threatening tariffs, nearly all of the largest brand-name drugmakers have announced plans to spend billions of dollars building or expanding U.S. factories. But these plants will not make raw materials. Instead, they are expected to handle the later stages of drug production for top-selling medicines. Experts who study the drug supply chain said there was no financial incentive for the production of raw materials to return to the United States. Making medicines is a multistep process, with factories in different countries often handling different stages. The process starts with the production of raw materials. A factory, often in India, will import those raw materials and use them to produce active ingredients, which will then be used to formulate the drug. U.S. Pharmacopeia’s analysis showed that even medicines that appeared to have broad geographic production can be reliant on China. Take, for example, amoxicillin, the widely used antibiotic that is sold by many different generic manufacturers. Factories in different parts of the world, including India, Jordan and Canada, handle the later stages of producing it. But two of the raw materials used to make amoxicillin are produced entirely in China, the analysis found. “Our hope is that by having better data and more visibility, that can inform targeted interventions into creating resilience and security for patients,” Carrie Harney, an official at U.S. Pharmacopeia, said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/health/us-drugs-china-production.html,politics,BBC,By Rebecca Robbins,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15hs-china-drugs-tklf/15hs-china-drugs-tklf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:00:06+00:00,dd81d7f338047080ce3181bde7cdf81eb98183bb

But Speaker Mike Johnson is still refusing to seat her while he keeps the House out of session during the government shutdown. So on Wednesday morning, a group of Arizona lawmakers gathered in front of the Capitol and accused Mr. Johnson of protecting pedophiles, obstructing the will of voters and taking an unprecedented political action in refusing to perform the simple ministerial duty of swearing in an elected member of Congress. “This delay is not procedural, it is intentional,” said Ms. Grijalva, who is poised to provide the final signature needed to force a floor vote on whether to demand that the Trump administration release the Epstein files. “He is doing everything in his power to shield this administration from accountability. That is not leadership, that is obstruction.” The Arizona attorney general, Kris Mayes, has threatened legal action against Mr. Johnson for failing to seat the congresswoman-elect, and Ms. Grijalva said Wednesday that she had also been exploring what legal options she has to officially claim her seat. For now, she said, she had to wait for someone to let her into the Capitol complex on Wednesday morning because she could not yet enter on her own. “This is unprecedented, and it’s wrong, and the speaker is doing this purely for political reasons,” said Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona.

d5de340eac5f,The Supreme Court Case That Could Hand the House to Republicans,"redistricting and reapportionment, gerrymandering, minorities, voting rights act, supreme court;scotus, us politics, donald trump, republicans, us states, house races, congressional elections","Republicans have been redrawing congressional districts this year at President Trump’s behest, but so far it hasn’t seemed to be enough to deny Democrats a reasonable path to control of the House of Representatives. That might change if the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act in Louisiana v. Callais, a case the court hears Wednesday. Without Section 2, which has been interpreted to require the creation of majority-minority districts, Republicans could eliminate upward of a dozen Democratic-held districts across the South. Republicans may not eliminate every Democratic-leaning district that they technically could (more on why later), but the party’s aggressive mid-cycle redistricting suggests they would eliminate enough to obtain a significant structural advantage. It’s not clear whether this would occur by next year’s midterm elections, with a court ruling likely next summer, but the new seats would eventually be enough to make Republicans favored to win the House even if they lost the popular vote by a wide margin. With those new seats added to the ones Republicans already seem poised to gain, the House would not be competitive in most election years. Despite all the gerrymandering by both political parties in recent years, neither has been able to obtain a significant structural advantage in the House so far this decade. In two very close elections, the party that won the most votes won the most seats. That’s partly because each side’s gerrymanders canceled the other’s out, but it’s also because the two major legal limitations on gerrymandering — state redistricting laws and Section 2 — have also canceled each other out. While state laws restricting gerrymandering have mostly been enacted by Democrats in blue and purple states, Section 2 is the main legal limitation on gerrymandering in many red states, particularly in the South. It bans voting practices that discriminate based on race, which has been interpreted to require the creation of majority-minority districts in areas with racially polarized voting and where minority groups represent a majority of the population. Without Section 2, many state legislatures would be free to eliminate majority-minority congressional districts, which mostly vote Democratic. It’s hard to say exactly how many districts Republicans would eliminate if Section 2 falls. It’s also hard to say whether Republicans would be able to eliminate those districts before next year’s midterms; the Supreme Court’s decision is likely to come after many state primaries. The full fallout from the decision might not come until 2028 or even after the next census in 2030. But even on the lower end of the estimate, Republicans will probably eliminate around a half-dozen districts: the majority Black districts in otherwise overwhelmingly Republican states and regions of the Deep South. In these reliably red states, Republicans could eliminate every Democratic-held majority-minority district while ensuring that the new districts remain relatively compact and overwhelmingly Republican. With Mr. Trump already pressuring Republicans to undertake an aggressive mid-cycle redistricting effort, it would not be surprising to see Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana and Tennessee attempt to eliminate every Democratic district. Additionally, without Section 2, North Carolina’s current plan to dismantle its First District would pass legal muster. And Florida Republicans might be tempted to target the state’s Ninth District in its coming redistricting push. After those seven or eight seats, things get a little fuzzier. On paper, Republicans could go much further and eliminate another half-dozen seats or more in Texas, Georgia, Missouri and Florida. Republicans might pursue these options, especially with Mr. Trump pressuring them to do so, but other factors would begin to weigh on their calculus. One limiting factor is that Republicans can’t eliminate every majority-majority district without endangering Republican incumbents. This is especially true in relatively competitive states like Georgia or Texas, where Republicans must preserve some number of Democratic districts to ensure that every Republican incumbent represents a safe district. It’s also true in Florida, where Republicans have the additional burden of needing to plausibly follow the state’s not-strongly-enforced Fair Districts amendment. A second limiting factor is the cooperation of Republican members of Congress or even state legislators. It’s not always painless for Republicans to eliminate additional Democratic seats, and Republican officials may not support more aggressive gerrymanders, even if they’re mathematically possible. A maximum gerrymander in Texas, for instance, might require a near total reconfiguration of the state’s congressional map, with outlandishly shaped districts snaking from the center of major metropolitan areas all the way to the border of neighboring states. Republican incumbents might balk at losing their longtime constituents and donors if they suddenly represent a very different area, and they might fear primary challenges in the new districts. State legislators might not want to defend a new map against criticism from their voters. This may not seem like a serious concern. After all, Republicans have attempted many gerrymanders in recent years. But those same gerrymanders have demonstrated that there are limits to how far they will go. This year, there was significant Republican opposition to the efforts to redraw the congressional maps in Missouri and Indiana. In Georgia in particular, the G.O.P. doesn’t have as much room to survive Republican defections. Even the successful Republican redistricting efforts sometimes show the hallmarks of a party running up against the tolerable limits of gerrymandering. The existence of a Democratic seat in Austin is one clear case. Legally, Texas Republicans could eliminate it today; it’s majority white. Mathematically, Republicans could eliminate it by extending even more Republican districts into the city, like a pinwheel centered on Austin. But there hasn’t been much appetite to do so. Still, Republicans wouldn’t need to flip so many districts to deal an enormous blow to Democratic chances. Even in the seven-to-eight-seat scenario, Democrats might need to win the popular vote by five percentage points to merely have a 50-50 shot to win the House. In recent decades, five-point victories in the House popular vote have generally happened during “wave” elections, like in 1994, 2006, 2010 and 2018, when one party ends up winning a large majority. And only once in the past 30 years has it happened during a presidential election year: Barack Obama’s win in 2008. But if Section 2 falls, and Republicans redraw districts across the South, Democrats will be at enough of a structural disadvantage that even with a five-point victory, their chances might depend on upsets in a few heavily Republican districts.

5cc56a1d6301,Trump Rattles Vaccine Experts Over Aluminum,"vaccines immunization, rumors and misinformation, intellectual disabilities, us politics, children, autism, regulation and deregulation, whooping cough, asthma, research, cdc, fda, health and human services, robert f. kennedy jr, donald trump","Federal health officials are examining the feasibility of taking aluminum salts out of vaccines, a prospect that vaccine experts said would wipe out about half of the nation’s supply of childhood inoculations and affect shots that protect against whooping cough, polio and deadly flu. The review at the Food and Drug Administration began after President Trump listed aluminum in vaccines as harmful during a press briefing about the unproven link between Tylenol and autism. Aluminum salts have been in vaccines since the 1920s and are added to enhance the immune-stimulating effect against the virus or bacteria covered by the inoculation. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, has been a longtime critic of aluminum in vaccines, which he has suggested is linked to autism. Vaccine experts said the tiny amount of aluminum salts in vaccines — often measured in the one-millionth of a gram — has a long track record of safety and is essential to generating lasting immunity from disease. Developing vaccines without aluminum salts, they said, would require an entirely new formulation from scratch. Such efforts take years of careful safety tests, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and could potentially expose thousands of infants to deadly diseases, given Mr. Kennedy’s insistence that new vaccines should be tested in humans against placebos . Mr. Trump acknowledged that like mercury, which was removed from childhood vaccines more than 20 years ago, the case against aluminum is limited. “We’ve already taken out and are in the process of taking out mercury and aluminum now,” Mr. Trump said. “And there were rumors about both of them for a long time, but we’re having them taken out.” Dr. Bruce Gellin, who worked in vaccine safety roles at the Department of Health and Human Services for more than a decade, said that rumors were akin to hearing a smoke detector go off. “There might be a fire or maybe you need a new battery,” said Dr. Gellin, who is now an adjust professor at Georgetown University. “Following signals is a good idea, but acting on them without investigating and finding the root cause is not a good idea.” Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for H.H.S., did not answer questions about removing aluminum, but said an influential vaccine committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was “reviewing the body of science related to aluminum and other possible contaminants in childhood vaccines.” (Mr. Kennedy fired that committee’s members this summer and replaced them with numerous vaccine skeptics.) The scientific consensus is that the small amounts of aluminum in vaccines is safe. Aluminum is also one of the most abundant elements on earth; people breathe it in dust and take it in through food and drinks every day. Before Mr. Trump’s latest remarks, Mr. Kennedy had not announced any formal plans related to aluminum removal. During his career as an anti-vaccine activist, though, he supported researchers who published studies trying to link aluminum in vaccines to autism and that were roundly criticized. In 2020, Mr. Kennedy described one such researcher, Christopher Exley, as “the world’s leading authority on aluminum toxicity,” saying his research on aluminum and vaccines has “documented grave toxic effects.” Mr. Kennedy wrote on his former nonprofit group’s website that he tried to donate $15,000 to support Dr. Exley’s research, but his university in the United Kingdom returned the check. Dr. Exley published one study in 2018 that examined the presence of aluminum in the donated brains of five people with autism, suggesting that it could “implicate” aluminum in the development of autism. Asked to elaborate, Dr. Exley said in an email that he did not know the vaccination status of the brain donors because of confidentiality rules. He said in a Substack post on Oct. 1 that he wrote to Mr. Kennedy before Mr. Trump’s briefing to remind the secretary that aluminum “is the cause of profound autism.” In an email to the New York Times last week, Dr. Exley wrote, “Secretary Kennedy asks my advice on aluminium in adjuvants as I am the leading authority on human exposure to aluminium.” In an interview at a National Governors Association meeting in July, Mr. Kennedy said the National Institutes of Health was studying links between aluminum and allergies. A new C.D.C. working group has also stated that it will examine whether there is a link between different aluminum adjuvants and asthma risk. Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, said the N.I.H. had already invested tens of millions in developing next-generation adjuvants, or immune amplifiers like aluminum. He said there have been questions about aluminum’s role in allergies, given how it stimulates certain immune cells. Further study of vaccine safety is always welcomed, he said. “Human nature is to keep making things better, and we should keep making things better,” Dr. Levy said. Companies that make childhood vaccines include Merck, Pfizer, GSK and Sanofi. Representatives from some companies said the aluminum adjuvants, or immune boosters, have a well-understood safety record. Replacements would be novel and need to be evaluated one by one against pathogens for each covered disease, wiping out the use of combination shots that cover several diseases. Several company representatives said they had not heard from federal health officials on the matter. If Mr. Kennedy were to act decisively against aluminum in vaccines, he could try to do so through the F.D.A., which approves them. The agency can remove products from the market if there is strong new evidence of harm or a lack of effectiveness. The process, if contested, can take years. The C.D.C.’s vaccine committee could weaken its recommendation for shots that contain aluminum salts, an effort that would most likely further erode vaccine confidence. It would also very likely lower the use of childhood vaccines, particularly in states that tie their rules or regulations to the committee’s decisions. Dr. Robert Malone, a member of that committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said he would not expect Mr. Kennedy to take steps to take vaccines away from people who want them. The scrutiny of aluminum is in some ways similar to criticism of thimerosal, a preservative that was removed from childhood vaccines about 25 years ago. Yet that was a far simpler effort: It only required shifting from F.D.A.-approved vaccine vials that contained the preservatives to pre-filled syringes that do not. In the intervening decades, a number of large studies refuted any link between thimerosal and autism. And even with it removed from childhood vaccines and phased out for use in pregnant women, autism rates have risen. Taking out aluminum would be a “waste of resources and will expose U.S. children to unnecessary disease in any transition period,” said Dr. Anders Hviid, a Danish vaccine researcher and epidemiologist. Dr. Hviid was an author of a major study published in July that reviewed the records of 1.2 million Danish children over 24 years. It found that as their exposure to aluminum in vaccines increased, their risk of a host of conditions, including asthma, allergies and autism, did not rise. Mr. Kennedy lashed out at the study in a web and social media post, saying it was “deceptive” and downplayed “calamitous evidence of harm.” He urged the Annals of Internal Medicine, which published the study, to retract it. Mr. Kennedy focused on a subgroup analysis in the Danish study of about 50 children younger than 5 who were diagnosed at higher rates with Asperger’s syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. He called the findings for that subset “a devastating indictment of aluminum-containing vaccines.” Dr. Christine Laine, the editor of the medical journal, responded that the set of children was one of about 540 subgroup comparisons. Dr. Hviid said that Mr. Kennedy was “cherry-picking” in singling out the effects on one small group of children because the broader study and analyses of other age groups did not find an increase in autism.

db39df16dd8d,Voting Rights Act’s Impact Has Reached Far Outside the South,"legislation, voting rights act, voting rights;voter registration;voter requirements, civil rights, supreme court;scotus, blackfeet nation, alaska, nyc;new york city, rockland county ny","The Voting Rights Act grew out of civil rights protests in the South, but the law has had far-reaching consequences across the country, from New York City to Alaska. Its impact was mainly through Section 5 of the law, which required states with a history of discrimination at the polls to secure approval from the Justice Department before making changes to their voting procedures, a process known as “preclearance.” In a 2013 decision, the Supreme Court effectively ended the requirement. Some places outside of the South had been required to undergo preclearance, including Alaska and Arizona, as well as counties in New York, California, South Dakota and Michigan. But Section 5 and preclearance are not the only national legacy of the law. Section 2, at issue on Wednesday, has been used in states across the country, largely in cases in which people have claimed that they were discriminated against in voting laws or maps and that their voting power as members of minority communities was diluted. Between 1982 and 2005, Montana and South Dakota lost or settled more than five cases that hinged on Section 2, according to a New York Times study . New Mexico has lost or settled at least three cases. A study by researchers at the University of Michigan found that between 1982 and 2021, there were 439 cases based on Section 2 that resulted in published decisions or opinions available on legal websites. About 200 of those cases came from states outside of the South. “It kind of speaks to the magnitude of the geographic impact that the Voting Rights Act had, because even beyond preclearance, there have been Voting Rights Act suits in lots of other parts of the country,” said Justin Levitt, a law professor and voting rights expert at Loyola Marymount University. While Section 2 cases have been brought against statewide laws and have been used to challenge the boundaries of congressional districts, the provision is often used more at the local level, such as by city councils, state legislatures and school boards. In New York in 2017, civil rights groups incorporated Section 2 by arguing that the system of electing members to the school board of the East Ramapo Central School District in diverse Rockland County prevented Black and Latino communities from choosing members of their choice. In 2020, a federal court agreed. Section 2 claims have been particularly critical for Native American populations. In one case, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Michael Howe, the plaintiffs argue that the North Dakota state legislative map diluted the voting power of Native Americans. (The Supreme Court is now considering whether to accept the case, not on the merits of the arguments, but to weigh whether private groups and people — as opposed to the government — can sue under the Voting Rights Act.) The law has also helped expand voting access. In 2020, the Blackfeet Nation, a reservation in Montana larger than Delaware, successfully brought a Section 2 claim against the state for only having four ballot drop-off locations across the reservation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/voting-rights-act-south.html,politics,BBC,By Nick Corasaniti,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15scotus-voting-rights-legacy-topart-qtgb/15scotus-voting-rights-legacy-topart-qtgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T13:35:04.854000+00:00,fd34ca85dca2a4af55de7bdf622e851e3540dd90
a9fcbbdab96d,Unions to Ask Court to Block Trump Layoffs During Shutdown,"us politics, layoffs;furloughs, federal courts, federal aid, american federation of government employees, justice department, donald trump, california, civil service","A set of unions will ask a federal judge on Wednesday to block the Trump administration from conducting mass federal layoffs during the government shutdown, arguing that the firings would be illegal and motivated by political retribution. The labor groups will present their arguments at a hearing before a court in California, just days after the administration took the first steps toward dismissing about 4,000 workers — the latest in a series of cuts that President Trump has threatened as the fiscal showdown barrels into its third week. At issue is the extent to which Mr. Trump may fire employees simply because federal funding for their positions has expired. The president and his aides have frequently expressed delight in the opportunity afforded by the ongoing shutdown, which began Oct. 1, as they look to continue whittling down government while punishing Democrats who refuse their fiscal demands. The unions, led by the American Federation of Government Employees, contend that Mr. Trump cannot remove civil servants without a clear directive from Congress — particularly at a moment when Washington is supposed to be performing only the most vital services. In a lawsuit filed before the first layoffs even occurred, the labor groups told the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that a lapse in funding “does not repeal, vacate or otherwise have any effect” on the work of federal agencies, giving Mr. Trump no authority to target them with staffing cuts. Unions have also pointed to the president’s repeated threats to slash “Democrat programs” as a sign the layoffs are politically motivated. The administration, in response, has asserted that Mr. Trump possesses vast power to reconfigure the federal work force, reprising a familiar argument in a legally contested campaign that has already ousted hundreds of thousands of civil servants from government. Last week, lawyers for the Justice Department primarily objected to the timing and process by which unions brought their legal challenge. In doing so, the administration sent mixed messages about its own intentions. It described layoffs at times as “hypothetical” while acknowledging the government had started to send out notices to more than 4,000 employees. The arguments scheduled for Wednesday in front of Judge Susan Illston are likely to center on the administration’s tactics and the scope of its layoffs, after it offered only a partial estimate of the agencies that would be targeted for cuts and the number of workers who might be affected. The Trump administration also initially misstated to the court the number of federal employees who had received notices or would be cut, and its timing for doing so. It corrected those issues in an updated filing on Tuesday evening, indicating in one case that the layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services were much fewer than it had initially reported. The agency erroneously sent layoff notices to hundreds of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of those workers later had the notices rescinded .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/government-shutdown-trump-layoffs-unions.html,politics,BBC,By Tony Romm,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-fedlayoffs-ghpq/15dc-fedlayoffs-ghpq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T13:32:10+00:00,8b0f9dc7704d413b735d7965f2e63e0579f210e3
3b681d5d5747,Here’s the latest.,live-detached,"The Supreme Court appeared poised on Wednesday to upend a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a move that could gut a pillar of landmark civil rights legislation and prohibit lawmakers from using race as a factor in drawing voting maps. If the justices determine that lawmakers may not consider race in voting maps, the repercussions for the country’s political balance could be sweeping, allowing Republican state legislatures to redistrict and eliminate at least a dozen Democratic-held House districts across the South. It’s not clear how fast any redistricting could happen. The court typically issues major rulings by late June or early July, and the next major vote is the 2026 midterm elections in November. During the oral argument, several of the court’s conservative justices appeared focused on whether there should be a time limit for allowing race to be used as a factor in congressional maps, a requirement that stemmed from civil rights era protections aimed at undoing generations of efforts to suppress the power of Black voters. “This court’s cases, in a variety of contexts, have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades, in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who is expected to be a key vote on the issue. Here’s what else to know: Voting Rights Act’s impact: The 1965 law was adopted in response to discriminatory practices in southern states, but it has had effects nationwide . The part at issue, Section 2, has been used across the country, largely in cases in which people have claimed that they were discriminated against in voting laws or maps and that their voting power as members of minority communities was diluted. Three groups of voters: This case reaches back to the 2020 census , which showed Black voters made up a third of the state. Lawmakers revisited the congressional map but maintained one majority Black district, out of the state’s six. Two groups of Black voters sued, arguing the map violated the Voting Rights Act. After another map was proposed including a second majority-Black district, a dozen white voters sued, arguing it was an illegal racial gerrymander. Revisiting the case: The justices heard arguments in this case last spring, but instead of issuing a decision, they scheduled a new argument this term. Rearguments of a Supreme Court case are rare, and a characteristic move of the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., one that has often paved the way for major legal changes . Repeated skepticism: The Voting Rights Act has faced legal challenges, and skepticism from the Supreme Court , since it was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. In 2013, the court struck down the heart of the law .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/heres-the-latest.html,politics,BBC,By Abbie VanSickle,https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,2025-10-15T13:00:18+00:00,e00189dffaa6337ebfe1561332cf15d59bedaf3b
d094c17ed9c4,U.S. Says It Revoked Visas of Some People Who Criticized Charlie Kirk,"charlie kirk, us, state department, visas, donald trump, marco rubio","The United States revoked the visas of at least six foreign citizens whom it accused of celebrating the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, the State Department said in a series of social media posts on Tuesday. Since Mr. Kirk was fatally shot last month, U.S. officials have said they were searching for foreigners who had made public comments cheering or joking about his death, called on the public to help identify them and warned they would be barred from the United States. The State Department’s X account on Tuesday posted screenshots of or excerpts from online comments by six people it said had celebrated Mr. Kirk’s death, and said they were no longer welcome in the United States, raising questions about First Amendment protections. “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” it said. The department was continuing “to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk,” it added. The New York Times could not independently confirm the people’s identities, nationalities or U.S. visa status. The department’s posts did not include the individuals’ names, or had them redacted. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning. Mr. Kirk, a prominent right-wing political activist and close ally of President Trump, was killed last month while speaking to thousands of people at a college in Utah. Mr. Trump, who has used the assassination to escalate his effort to stifle political opposition , on Tuesday awarded Mr. Kirk a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom , the nation’s highest civilian honor. Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said : “If you are here on a visa and cheering on the public assassination of a political figure, prepare to be deported. You are not welcome in this country.” Judges have rebuked Mr. Rubio for taking similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and have ordered them freed from detention. Among the examples the State Department listed on Tuesday was an Argentine who “said that Kirk ‘devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric’ and deserves to burn in hell. Visa revoked.” Other examples were a German who the department said had written online that “when fascists die, democrats don’t complain,” and a Brazilian who posted that Mr. Kirk “died too late,” it said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/charlie-kirk-state-department-visas.html,politics,BBC,By Claire Moses,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15trump-news-kirk-visas-blpm/15trump-news-kirk-visas-blpm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T12:33:24+00:00,5304b7db0ade15b0656b7048cf79636a0c3f880f
2a342804d137,Trump Threatens Spain With Higher Tariffs Over Defense Spending,"spain, donald trump, tariff, nato, military, pedro sánchez","For months, Pedro Sánchez, the progressive prime minister of Spain, has walked a tightrope when it comes to dealing with President Trump. He stood up to Mr. Trump on issues important to the American president, solidifying the support of left-leaning members of his fragile governing coalition, but without going so far as to trigger any real retribution. That may be changing. Mr. Trump has seemingly stewed for weeks over Spain’s refusal, alone among NATO partners, to increase military spending to 5 percent of G.D.P., as he demanded. Last week, he called Spain a “laggard” and suggested that partners “throw them out of NATO.” Then on Monday, he urged European leaders to get “working” on Spain, and on Tuesday, he added his own pressure, threatening to single out the country for higher tariffs than the rest of the E.U. “I’m very unhappy with Spain,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “I was thinking of giving them trade punishment through tariffs because of what they did, and I think I may do that.” The threat puts Mr. Sánchez, a consummate political survivor, in a tight spot. Spain’s military spending is only 1.3 percent, less than all other NATO members. Mr. Sánchez has said he would raise it to 2 percent by the end of 2025 in line with an earlier commitment, a position that left-wing partners critical to his government’s survival could live with and that added to his aura as the European progressive willing to stand up to the United States. Mr. Sánchez has depicted Spain as a liberal mirror to Mr. Trump’s America. He has framed its welcoming of immigrants as an economy-boosting alternative to the U.S. crackdowns, taken a leading role in Europe in criticizing Israel over the Gaza war and broken with other European members of NATO by arguing that Russia didn’t pose an immediate threat to Spain. His government contends that the higher proposed military spending demanded by Mr. Trump was instead needed for social welfare programs. But if Mr. Trump seeks to make good on his tariff threat, Mr. Sánchez might have to deal with the economic fallout of a miscalculation. For now though, his government was holding the line, noting its fulfillment of obligations with troop deployments elsewhere in Europe. “We are committed to the defense, to the security of NATO and, at the same time, we are equally committed to the defense of our welfare state,” Mr. Sánchez told Cadena SER radio network after Mr. Trump’s tariff threat. He added that Spain was already doing “more than enough.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-tariffs-spain-military-defense-spending-nato.html,politics,BBC,By Jason Horowitz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15trump-news-spain-tariffs-fmhz/15trump-news-spain-tariffs-fmhz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T12:09:26+00:00,a3f96fa1585ca20fa157e8f10d4b2fde7060f35a

Seth Moulton Announces Run for Senator Markey’s Seat in Massachusetts,"us politics, senate races, politics, election, democrats, senate, congress, house of representatives, congress, joseph p kennedy iii, seth moulton, ed markey, massachusetts, salem mass","Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts announced on Tuesday that he would challenge Senator Edward J. Markey, a fellow Democrat, in next year’s Senate race, with a campaign message highlighting his relative youth. Mr. Moulton is 46, and Mr. Markey, who was elected to Congress almost 50 years ago, is 79. In a news release and video launching his campaign, Mr. Moulton leaned hard into the idea that the Democratic Party must change and embrace fresh leadership in an urgent bid to maintain relevance and power. “Our party has clung to the status quo, insisted on using the same old playbook, and isn’t fighting hard enough,” he said. It will not be the first time Mr. Markey has faced a call to step aside for a new generation. In 2020, he defeated a primary challenge from then-Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, who was 39 at the time, by promoting his progressive bona fides, including his partnership with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, to craft the Green New Deal. “It’s not your age that counts,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a 2020 campaign ad for Mr. Markey. “It’s the age of your ideas.” Mr. Markey’s unexpected victory was a rare defeat for a member of the Kennedy family in Massachusetts and a startling demonstration of the senator’s survival skills. Some of his youthful supporters, who became known as t he Markeyverse, criticized what they called ageism in Mr. Kennedy’s campaign. Four years later, Mr. Moulton’s announcement comes at a starkly different moment, with Democrats still deeply shaken by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s abrupt withdrawal from last year’s race amid concerns about his age, and the subsequent election of President Trump. Mr. Markey, who was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and to the Senate in 2013, said last year that he intended to run again . If he is re-elected next year, he will be 86 at the end of his third Senate term. “We’re in a crisis, and with everything we learned last election, I just don’t believe Senator Markey should be running for another six-year term at 80 years old,” Mr. Moulton says in his campaign video . “Even more, I don’t think someone who’s been in Congress for half a century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future. Senator Markey’s a good man, but it’s time for a new generation of leadership.” Mr. Moulton, of Salem, Mass., represents the state’s Sixth District, north of Boston. A Marine Corps veteran who served four tours in the Iraq War, he has earned a reputation for impatience in his decade in Congress. He briefly ran for president in 2020 and tried unsuccessfully to block Representative Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the House after the 2018 election, saying it was time for her to step aside. He angered some in his party last year with comments about transgender athletes, part of his argument that Democrats had lost support by striving too hard not to cause offense. “I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,” Mr. Moulton told The New York Times the day after the election last November. He stood by his remarks during the ensuing controversy and said he had heard from many Democrats who thanked him for broaching a difficult subject that others in their party had too often shied away from. Mr. Moulton’s campaign video features footage of lobstermen hauling traps and of himself at home making French toast with his children. It also stresses his commitment to the concerns of working people. He pledges to continue his work to address climate change, citing his efforts to expand high-speed rail service as a means of reducing carbon emissions, and to enact a ban on assault weapons. In anticipation of the challenge, Mr. Markey has already begun announcing endorsements, including that of Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. It remains to be seen who else might join the race; among the possible contenders is Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, 51, a progressive Democrat who beat a 20-year incumbent in the primary before winning her House seat in 2018.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/seth-moulton-edward-markey-massachusetts.html,politics,BBC,By Jenna Russell,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15nat-moulton-senate-qtpc/15nat-moulton-senate-qtpc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T11:48:25+00:00,10d20d36b44ec78374eaefe8f5f1830047b2e39e

Ashley Tellis, 64, an unpaid adviser who also works as a contractor in the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment as an expert on Indian and South Asian affairs, was charged after F.B.I. agents searched his home in Vienna, Va., on Oct. 11, the Justice Department said. Agents discovered more than 1,000 pages of documents marked “Top Secret” or “Secret” in two locked cabinets, a desk and three large trash bags in an unfinished storage room in the basement, according to an F.B.I. affidavit. Mr. Tellis was charged in federal court with the unlawful retention of national defense information, according to a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. He appeared in court on Tuesday and was ordered detained pending a hearing on Oct. 21, according to court records. A lawyer for Mr. Tellis did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Tellis was accused of printing, or directing colleagues to print, classified documents over the past month on topics that included U.S. military aircraft capabilities, according to the affidavit. Some of the documents were removed from a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, a secure area used for handling classified materials at the Defense Department’s Office of Net Assessment, according to the affidavit. Surveillance footage showed Mr. Tellis leaving several federal buildings, including a State Department office, carrying a briefcase that investigators believe contained the printed materials, according to court filings. Mr. Tellis is a senior fellow and the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which has not commented on his arrest. A scholar specializing in Indian and South Asian affairs, he previously served on the National Security Council staff as special assistant to President George W. Bush. “The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” Lindsey Halligan , the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. The arrest came amid upheaval inside Ms. Halligan’s office, one of the nation’s most closely watched federal prosecutor’s offices, which in recent weeks has secured indictments against two adversaries of President Trump, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and New York’s attorney general, Letitia James . The office’s previous chief prosecutor, Erik S. Siebert , resigned under pressure from the White House after Mr. Trump grew dissatisfied with Mr. Siebert’s failure to secure indictments against Mr. Comey and Ms. James. Mr. Trump appointed Ms. Halligan, a former White House adviser with no prior prosecutorial experience, as Mr. Siebert’s replacement. The office has faced a wave of firings and resignations, and in recent weeks senior prosecutors have been dismissed, including Michael P. Ben’Ary , the veteran head of the office’s national security section who spent years pursuing major terrorism cases. In a letter , Mr. Ben’Ary accused the department of focusing more on the president’s political opponents than on national security threats.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/state-department-classified-documents-ashley-tellis.html,politics,BBC,By Mark Walker,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15xp-adviser-jbwt/15xp-adviser-jbwt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:49:38+00:00,77546c71a1072e92ac39919f2590c3c7edd60163

Mr. Trump, who will meet with Mr. Zelensky at the White House later this week, said on Tuesday that he knew the Ukrainian leader wanted the weapons. “We have a lot of Tomahawks,” Mr. Trump added. Because of their long range, accuracy and low cost compared to piloted warplanes, Tomahawks have long been seen as a go-to weapon in the Pentagon’s arsenal. The United States has launched more than 2,300 Tomahawks in combat over more than four decades. The most recent versions cost roughly $2.5 million each. What is a cruise missile? A cruise missile is powered by a small jet engine and has wings to produce lift, allowing it to fly like an airplane that guides itself to a target. Is the Tomahawk new? No. According to U.S. government histories , development of the Tomahawk began in the early 1970s. The U.S. military first used them in combat during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and has used them in dozens of conflicts since. How far can they fly? More than 1,000 miles. How far is Moscow from Kyiv? About 500 miles. What are some of the Tomahawk’s advantages? When in cruise mode, they can fly low to the ground, making them more difficult to spot by radar. They also fly relatively fast: 550 miles per hour , or roughly 70 percent the speed of sound. And perhaps most useful for Ukraine, the United States has many hundreds of them. How are the missiles launched? Like any cruise missile, the Tomahawk needs some assistance before it can begin flying to a target on its own. The U.S. Navy’s Tomahawks use a solid-fuel rocket motor to boost the missile up to about 1,500 feet above the surface. The rocket motor falls away, the missile’s wings unfold and the air intake for the jet engine opens, allowing the Tomahawk to begin flying like an airplane. How could Ukraine launch them? In 2024, the U.S. Army deployed a new land-based launcher for Tomahawks and other naval missiles called Typhon , which is essentially a standard 40-foot shipping container concealing four missile tubes that rotate upward to fire. The Army first test-fired a Tomahawk from that launcher in 2023. They would be the longest-range U.S. weapons given to Ukraine thus far. Army soldiers first deployed Typhon to the Philippines in 2024 as a show of force to China . The launchers were later sent to Australia for an exercise in July and to Japan in September . Would Ukrainian troops need a lot of training to use them? Not really. In the summer of 2022, Ukraine’s army quickly learned another American-made mobile launch system called HIMARS , which fires guided rockets to a range of more than 70 miles and ATACMS missiles out to 190 miles. While the Typhon system is different in some respects, it also requires soldiers to input data into a fire control computer before launch. The Pentagon would probably also send the equipment needed to compile the flight-planning information that the missile requires, or would have to supply Ukraine with data packages for targets inside Russia. What do Tomahawks carry? Typically, a warhead with the explosive equivalent of about 400 pounds of TNT. There are also cluster weapon versions of the Tomahawk, the most common of which carries 166 small failure-prone bomblets. That type was most recently used in December 2009 during a secret and botched U.S. attack on alleged Al Qaeda training camps in Yemen. The other variant, which remains classified, is designed to temporarily disable an adversary’s electrical grid by releasing small canisters of carbon fiber filaments that blanket electrical transmission lines and cause transformers and other equipment to short. The Navy’s newest generation of Tomahawk missiles will also be able to attack moving ships at sea. A variant armed with a nuclear warhead was retired in 2013, according to the Congressional Research Service. How do Tomahawks find their targets? The Tomahawk was originally designed to use data fed into its guidance computer before launch — terrain contour maps to verify its location as well as digital photos of the target. Later versions incorporated GPS guidance and radio antennae that allowed the missiles to be redirected to a new target after launch. They are maneuverable weapons that can change course to fly around obstacles like enemy air defenses, buildings or mountains before they reach their target.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/tomahawk-missiles-trump-ukraine.html,politics,BBC,By John Ismay,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-tomahawk01-photo-jtmk/15dc-tomahawk01-photo-jtmk-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-15T09:04:23+00:00,2df43f92ff546a3d46ba08ebf8eac1bf0f3ebde0
cdb9894c7c98,Supreme Court Asks When Police Can Enter Without Warrant in Emergency,"police, us politics, search and seizure, 4th amendment, civil rights, cato institute, supreme court;scotus, william trevor","The panicked call to the police came from William Trevor Case’s ex-girlfriend. He had a loaded handgun, she said, and had threatened to kill himself previously. Mr. Case, an Army veteran, was well known to law enforcement officers who went to check on him at his home near Butte, Mont. Mr. Case had “tried this suicide by cop” stuff before, one of the officers said, using profanity, according to a body-cam recording from the fall of 2021. The officers from the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Police Department eventually entered Mr. Case’s home with their guns drawn, yelling to announce their presence. They did not have a warrant. When Mr. Case suddenly emerged from a closet, his arm outstretched with what appeared to be a gun, an officer shot him in the abdomen. The veteran, who survived, was convicted of assaulting the officer. He appealed that conviction, arguing that a gun and other evidence from his home should not have been presented at trial because the officers had entered Mr. Case’s home without a warrant. The Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider Mr. Case’s appeal, weighing when the police can enter a home without a warrant based on reports that someone inside may need emergency help. The outcome has implications for police tactics and the expectation of privacy in one’s home. Mr. Case’s position has the backing of civil liberties groups.

If the justices determine that lawmakers may not consider race in drawing districts, the repercussions for the country’s political balance could be sweeping , allowing Republican state legislatures to eliminate at least a dozen Democratic-held House districts across the South. It’s not clear how fast any redistricting could happen. The court typically issues major rulings by late June or early July, and the next major vote is the 2026 midterm elections in November. The case examines whether Louisiana lawmakers violated the Constitution when they adopted a new electoral map in 2024, creating the state’s second majority-Black district. It challenges a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During the oral argument, several of the court’s conservative justices appeared focused on whether there should be a time limit for allowing race to be used as a factor in congressional maps, a requirement that stemmed from civil rights era protections aimed at undoing generations of efforts to suppress the power of Black voters. “This court’s cases, in a variety of contexts, have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades, in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who is expected to be a key vote on the issue. “What exactly do you think the end point should be?” Justice Kavanaugh then asked a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who argued to uphold the Voting Rights Act. That question — whether there should be a time limit on using race-based remedies — appeared to be at the heart of the oral argument. The legal battle can be traced back to the 2020 census, which showed an increase in Louisiana’s population of Black adults. While Black Louisianans made up about a third of the state’s population, there was only one majority-Black congressional district out of six districts. After the census, state lawmakers revisited the map and passed a version that still had only one majority-Black district. Two groups of Black voters sued in 2022, asserting that state legislators had violated the Voting Rights Act by packing Black voters into one district and diluting their voting power. The Voting Rights Act, one of the central legislative achievements of the civil rights movement, banned discriminatory practices like literacy tests that had been used to disenfranchise people. A federal judge agreed, finding that the map likely did violate the statute. State lawmakers then proposed another map in January 2024, which included a second majority-Black district — a long, narrow one that wound from the southeast part of the state to the northwest. State lawmakers claimed that they had crafted the map with politics, not race, in mind, protecting valuable Republican incumbents, including Speaker Mike Johnson. But shortly after lawmakers approved that map, a dozen white voters sued, arguing that the new map was an illegal racial gerrymander that had caused them to suffer “unlawful, intentional discrimination based on race.” In April 2024, a divided panel of three federal judges agreed, striking down the new map. Louisiana then appealed to the Supreme Court. The justices paused the lower court’s order, allowing Louisiana’s new map to be used in the 2024 election. Democrats picked up a seat, as voters in the newly created district elected Cleo Fields, a longtime party figure from Baton Rouge. Mr. Fields is Black. The justices heard the case, Louisiana v. Callais, in the spring. But instead of issuing a decision in late June or early July, the justices, in a rare move, ordered new arguments for their next term, which began this month. Rearguments can be a signal that the justices are poised to take a broader action in a case. In 2009, the court called for reargument in Citizens United, a campaign finance case that turned from a minor case into a blockbuster, clearing the way for unlimited campaign spending by corporations. The court offered no explanation for punting on the case, but several weeks later, the justices announced that they would hear arguments on a more expansive question: whether Louisiana’s “intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.” That question suggested that the justices appeared to be considering holding the provision of the Voting Rights Act that has been used to challenge redistricting plans unconstitutional. The court’s conservative justices have long pointed to what they have viewed as a tension between the Voting Rights Act’s goal of protecting minority voting rights and a colorblind conception in the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which requires that the law treat everyone equally. Two years ago, however, the justices rejected an Alabama voting map, finding that it had diluted the power of Black voters. In that case, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who has been a skeptic of the Voting Rights Act for decades, wrote the majority opinion agreeing that lawmakers could take race and other factors into account when redistricting. The new question in the Louisiana case has shaken up the alliances from the first argument. In the months since the justices announced that they would hear arguments again, the Louisiana officials who had defended the map have essentially switched sides, aligning with the white voter plaintiffs. They were joined by lawyers for the Trump administration. In a brief to the court, Liz Murrill, Louisiana’s attorney general, described the structure of the provision of the Voting Rights Act that allows race to be used as a factor in redistricting — Section 2 — as “unworkable and unconstitutional.” The constitutionality of Louisiana’s second majority-minority district was defended on Wednesday by a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Along with voting rights organizations, the NAACP has argued that the case is about whether minority communities continue to have meaningful representation in politics. They have also raised concerns that gains from the civil rights era were at risk.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/supreme-court-voting-rights-act.html,politics,BBC,By Abbie VanSickle,https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,2025-10-15T09:03:29+00:00,de94cf20799713ef855331ecb3e9a2836b3cbe4e
8e6310db41c8,Trump Awards Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom,"charlie kirk, presidential medal of freedom, assassination, right-wing extremism and alt-right, conservatism in the united states, erika kirk, donald trump, us politics","President Trump on Tuesday posthumously awarded Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, bestowing the nation’s highest civilian honor on a political ally who was assassinated last month. “We’re here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I’ve ever seen before, and an American patriot of the deepest conviction,” Mr. Trump said during a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, which was attended by most of the cabinet. The president presented the medal to Mr. Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, on what would have been Mr. Kirk’s 32nd birthday, a tribute that Mr. Trump joked had stopped him from asking Mrs. Kirk to reschedule the event. “I raced back halfway around the globe,” Mr. Trump said, referring to his trip to Israel and Egypt that he returned from early Tuesday morning. “I was going to call Erika and say, ‘Erika, could you maybe move it to Friday?’ And I didn’t have the courage to call. But you know why I didn’t call? Because I heard today was Charlie’s birthday.” In tearful remarks, Mrs. Kirk said that her late husband “probably would have run for president, but not out of ambition.” She added: “He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed.” Mrs. Kirk thanked Mr. Trump for bestowing the honor on her husband, and promised to carry out his legacy. “You have given him the best birthday gift he could ever have,” she said. Mr. Kirk, the founder of the right-wing political organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot on Sept. 10 while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. Mr. Kirk, from the time he was 18, built Turning Point into a sprawling organization, with hundreds of chapters on college campuses. Mr. Trump and other top Republicans have credited Mr. Kirk for their electoral victories because of his work mobilizing young voters. “Charlie Kirk was a martyr for truth and for freedom,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. “From Socrates and St. Peter, from Abraham Lincoln to Martin Luther King, those who change history the most — and he really did — have always risked their lives for causes they were put on earth to defend.” But Mr. Kirk’s rhetoric was divisive, with critics arguing that his views on gay and transgender rights, as well as on race, were offensive. Mr. Kirk also may not have approved of the president comparing him to Dr. King, whom Mr. Kirk assailed as an “awful” person. He once said that the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a “mistake.” The citation for the medal lauded Mr. Kirk for his work building Turning Point into the largest conservative youth organization in the nation, and for his commitment to the nation’s founding principles. Mr. Kirk is the first person to receive the honor in Mr. Trump’s second term. The president has announced plans to also award it to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and an adviser to Mr. Trump, and Ben Carson, who served as the housing secretary in Mr. Trump’s first term. Through his work with Turning Point, Mr. Kirk developed close relationships with many of the president’s top aides and other prominent Republicans, many of whom were in the Rose Garden on Tuesday. Among those in attendance were Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, who was especially close with Mr. Kirk, also attended the ceremony, as did Javier Milei, the leader of Argentina, who met with Mr. Trump earlier in the day. Mr. Kirk’s death, which was captured on video, was part of a wave of political violence that has targeted people across the political spectrum. Mr. Trump survived two assassination attempts while running for president last year; Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota state lawmaker, was killed in June; Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania was the victim of an arson attack on his home in April while he and his family slept; and in 2017, Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, was nearly killed during a shooting at a congressional baseball team practice that targeted Republicans. But Mr. Trump has acknowledged only “radical left” political violence, and he said Tuesday that his administration was working to “confront it.” Since Mr. Kirk’s death, Mr. Trump and his allies have escalated attacks on their political opponents, and have vowed a broad crackdown on critics and left-leaning institutions.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/trump-charlie-kirk-medal.html,politics,BBC,By Tyler Pager,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14DC-TRUMP-01/14DC-TRUMP-01-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,2025-10-15T00:03:00+00:00,f7ab5f0988c3df69ec43c7add268f52eda3441ca
cd0cbb1c7072,Trump Says He May Give Tomahawks to Ukraine. Is He Bluffing?,"russian invasion of ukraine (2022), us foreign policy, ukraine, foreign aid, arms trade, military, missiles and missile defense, peace process, vladimir putin, donald trump, volodymyr zelensky, russia, internal-open-access-from-nl","Fresh off negotiating a peace deal intended to end the war in Gaza, President Trump on Tuesday suggested that he may allow a sale of U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, giving Kyiv the ability to conduct long-range strikes deep into Russia. That is exactly the kind of message that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine wants to hear as he prepares for a visit to the White House on Friday. “He would like to have Tomahawks,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Zelensky. “We have a lot of Tomahawks.” But it is also something that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has warned against, saying that such a sale would signal a “qualitatively new stage of escalation.” Mr. Trump’s threats to provide the missiles to Ukraine — whether he follows through on them or not — are a sign of his growing frustration with Mr. Putin, who has refused to budge or compromise despite Mr. Trump’s splashy attempts at diplomacy . The Defense Department has drawn up plans to sell or transfer Tomahawks should Mr. Trump give the order. But providing the weapons would come with enormous challenges, not least the fact that Ukraine does not have the naval or ground-based launchers required to fire the missiles. Ukraine would need a U.S. Army launcher called Typhon to fire the Tomahawks, a step that military officials say would pull the United States closer to direct confrontation with Russia. It is unclear how many Tomahawks the United States could provide, how Ukraine would safely store them and what impact a limited number of the missiles would have. There are also real concerns of escalating tensions with Russia, a point underscored by the Kremlin’s recent warnings to Washington not to provide the long-range arms to Ukraine. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said in remarks published Sunday that “the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern.” “Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,” he told a Russian state television reporter. In recent days, Mr. Trump has suggested that the mere threat of sending Tomahawks to Ukraine could force Mr. Putin to the negotiating table. He said he planned to talk directly with the Russian president about the subject. “If this war doesn’t get settled, I may send Tomahawks,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “A Tomahawk is an incredible weapon. And Russia does not need that. If the war is not settled, we may do it. We may not. But we may do it.” Mr. Trump is feeling confident in his ability to pressure countries into reaching peace deals after his experience striking an agreement meant to end the war in Gaza. In that conflict, Mr. Trump allowed the Israel military to decimate Hamas, essentially forcing Gaza’s rulers to accept a peace deal or be destroyed. Mr. Trump’s team also worked aggressively with influential allies on each side of the conflict to pressure the parties to return hostages and prisoners, and end the killing of civilians. Under a new financing plan negotiated earlier this year, NATO member allies are now buying U.S. weapons and ammunition, then giving them to Ukraine. So far, four packages of American arms and equipment totaling about $2 billion have been funded by Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Canada. “Such support is vital,” Col. Martin O’Donnell, a spokesman for NATO’s top military commander, said on Tuesday. During the Biden administration, the White House was acutely concerned with how Mr. Putin would react to each new American weapons system provided to Ukraine. Sending weapons capable of progressively longer ranges increased the risk of a war that drew in NATO, officials believed. With a range greater than 1,000 miles, Tomahawk missiles could reach more than five times farther than the Army Tactical Missile Systems that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. eventually agreed to provide Kyiv in 2023. At a recent gathering of international foreign policy experts in Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi, Mr. Putin praised Mr. Trump but warned against sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying such a step would represent a “new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the U.S.” Liana Fix, a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that whether Mr. Trump goes through with the sale “depends on whether Putin is able to get through with this to Trump, and whether he is successful with telling Donald Trump, ‘You can’t do this, this will lead to nuclear war.’” On the other hand, she said, the world was witnessing a coordinated pressure campaign from Europe to push the United States more strongly behind Ukraine, believing only intense and united leverage against Russia could get Mr. Putin to stop his war. “What we see now is sort of a coordinated campaign, especially pushed by the Europeans and also by the Ukrainians, to signal to Moscow that it is not on the winning side, and that support for Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. is still there,” she said. For months, Mr. Trump has signaled that he is increasingly inclined to provide Ukraine with the weapons. In August, he wrote in a social media post that Ukraine was like a sports team that was hampered because it was not allowed to play offense. “It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offensive. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia,” he wrote. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump, who calls Mr. Putin “a friend,” once again warned that the Russian president was heading down the wrong path. “He’s got to really settle this war. And you know, they have long lines waiting for gasoline in Russia right now,” he said, adding: “His economy is going to collapse, and I’d like to see him do well. I mean, I had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin, but he just doesn’t want to end that war, and I think it’s making him look very bad.” Adam Goldman and John Ismay contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/trump-tomahawks-ukraine-russia.html,politics,BBC,By Luke Broadwater and Eric Schmitt,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14dc-trump-tomahawks01-photo-tpmz/14dc-trump-tomahawks01-photo-tpmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T22:49:20+00:00,3d248b4726c1a28b1f3d3790c9e2584b5a05162f
805151ac5a0f,White House Guts Education Department With More Layoffs,"us politics, closings, federal budget, us department of education, civil service, layoffs;furloughs, civil rights, federal aid, special education, discrimination, financial aid, student loan, donald trump, linda e mcmahon, omb","A pair of decades-old promises from Congress — ensuring disabled students receive a free and appropriate education and protecting all pupils from discrimination in schools — have been thrown into doubt after a round of sweeping layoffs at the Education Department. The department’s Office of Special Education Programs was decimated by the cuts, which the Trump administration issued on Friday in its latest reduction of the federal work force. The special education office has been the principal government arm overseeing billions of dollars that support about 10 percent of the nation’s school-aged children, but will have fewer than a half-dozen employees, a reduction of about 95 percent since the start of the year. The Office for Civil Rights in the department was also slashed. After starting the year with 12 regional sites, the civil rights office was cut in half in March and may go down to a site or two when the layoffs take effect in 60 days, according to data compiled by the union representing education workers. Over 22,600 discrimination complaints in schools were filed with the department last year, more than double the number from five years earlier. And the layoffs gutted the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, which oversees a wide range of funding for states and school districts. The firings included a team of employees who oversee federal funding for low-income students, known as Title I, which is the largest source of federal funding to school districts, according to three Education Department employees with knowledge of the cuts. About 466 workers at the Education Department have been fired since Friday, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget, and the breadth and depth of those cuts appeared to touch nearly all aspects of an agency that President Trump has vowed to eliminate, part of his bid to end the federal role in supporting roughly 54 million students in the nation’s elementary and secondary schools. Education Department officials have not disclosed precise numbers on where those cuts were targeted as of Tuesday; the Trump administration declined to discuss the changes, and a spokeswoman declined to comment. The administration has described the more than 4,000 layoffs across federal agencies as punishment to Democrats for the government shutdown. The lack of communication left unions scrambling to piece together the fallout. But the individual notices sent to Education Department staff were sent to their official emails, which workers had been repeatedly warned would be illegal to check during a shutdown. The administration sent word in recent days that government workers could check their messages to see if they had been fired, but several employees said on Tuesday that they were refusing to open their email because they did not trust the Trump administration. Unions representing federal workers have sued over the firings and described the cuts as an attempt from the administration to use the government work force as a bargaining chip in a political feud. “If you are a kid in America, regardless of where you live or what your capabilities are, or what year you are in school, you are going to be affected by these cuts,” said Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, which represents Education Department employees. The Education Department, which had about 4,100 employees at the start of the year, lost about half its work force to layoffs in March. The new layoffs, which target about one-fifth of the remaining workers, spanned the agency — striking even some programs that President Trump has said he supports. The layoffs included employees who work on funding for charter schools, historically Black colleges and tribal universities, areas that the Trump administration has fought to increase funding for , even as it wants to claw back education spending elsewhere. Many of the remaining Education Department employees work in the office of Federal Student Aid, which handles federal student loans for college students and appears to have been largely spared. But the layoffs effectively gut two key offices that handle money for students that goes out the door to states and school districts across the country. And it threatens to further upend the Office for Civil Rights, which historically has focused on investigating complaints of discrimination against students of color and students with disabilities. Under President Trump, it has instead sought to prevent schools from recognizing transgender identities or directing extra resources toward Black students. Denise Forte, president of EdTrust, said the wide-ranging layoffs appeared to be a backdoor attempt to free states from laws and regulations established by Congress, which require them to spend federal education dollars on the most vulnerable children, including those from low-income families, students with disabilities and homeless children. “This is the way he is trying to accomplish Project 2025,” Ms. Forte said, referring to the conservative policy document that has been embraced by the Trump administration and outlines a plan to shut down the Education Department. Current law, as passed by Congress, requires the agency to maintain offices that oversee elementary and secondary education, special education and many other policy areas. “It’s impossible for the department to carry out its statutory functions with this level of staffing,” said Josie Eskow Skinner, a former department lawyer who was laid off earlier this year. Some of the staff slated to be laid off act as something of a help desk for states and school districts. They might answer questions about which in-class supports a child with autism is entitled to, or how to count the number of homeless children. Katy Neas, a former deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., noted that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was created by Congress in 1975, in part because states were not effectively educating students with disabilities. She said that the office had played a role in monitoring compliance, such as when Texas put a cap on the percentage of students who could receive special education services. “This administration has said they want to return education to the states — it’s for the reason that states refused to educate kids with disabilities that we have this law in the first place,” said Ms. Neas, who is now the chief executive of the Arc of the United States, an advocacy organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education handles a wide range of funding for states and school districts, including funds that Mr. Trump wants to cut or consolidate, arguing that federal government adds bureaucracy to education, without improving student outcomes. He withheld funding from some of those programs this summer and has proposed cutting education spending by 15 percent for next year. Jodi Grant, the executive director of the nonprofit Afterschool Alliance, said it was “shocking, devastating, utterly without any basis” to lay off federal workers who help support grants for after-school programs that serve nearly 1.4 million students nationwide, mostly lower income. “This small staff at the U.S. Department of Education that has long administered these grants had a big impact,” Ms. Grant said. It’s unclear how the layoffs, which are set to take effect in December, will impact federal funding itself. Mr. Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, has repeatedly sought to assure parents and lawmakers that the Trump administration would not cut federal funding for low-income students or students with disabilities. She has suggested that funding to carry out the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act could be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services. During her confirmation hearings, Ms. McMahon also suggested that the Justice Department could take over her department’s civil rights investigations.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/trump-education-department-federal-layoffs.html,politics,BBC,"By Sarah Mervosh, Michael C.

26eda2274733,Jack Smith Calls Idea That Politics Infected Trump Prosecutions ‘Ludicrous’,"us politics, special prosecutor, ethics misconduct malfeasance, federal criminal case against trump (documents case), jim jordan, jack smith, donald trump, house committee on the judiciary","Jack Smith, the special counsel who twice secured indictments of Donald J. Trump, said it was “ludicrous” to suggest he was motivated by partisan politics — and offered a scathing denunciation of the Trump Justice Department — in his first extended remarks since resigning in January. “The idea that politics played a role in who worked on that case, or who got chosen, is ludicrous,” Mr. Smith said during an Oct. 8 interview with the former prosecutor Andrew Weissmann at the University College London that was posted online Tuesday. Mr. Smith offered a dour hourlong assessment of Mr. Trump’s campaign of retribution against his enemies , rebuking the indictments of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, over the objections of career prosecutors. He also called out the forced resignations of prosecutors who unsuccessfully opposed White House efforts to drop the bribery case against Mayor Eric Adams of New York . “Nothing like what we see now has ever gone on,” he said. “There are rules in the department about how to bring a case — follow those rules,” he added. “You can’t say: ‘I want this outcome. Let me throw the rules out.’” The abrupt re-emergence of Mr. Smith, a veteran public integrity and war crimes prosecutor cast as a “deranged” partisan by Mr. Trump, comes as the president ramps up demands for payback and his congressional allies increase pressure on Biden-era officials seen as his enemies. And Mr. Smith is the biggest. On Tuesday, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee summoned Mr. Smith to testify behind closed doors about what they called “partisan and politically motivated prosecutions” of Mr. Trump. Representative Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who is the chairman of the panel, demanded that Mr. Smith appear by Oct. 28 but did not issue a legally binding subpoena. A spokesman for Mr. Smith had no comment. While Republican lawmakers publicly celebrated the move, they have been more circumspect privately, expressing concern that offering a public arena for Mr. Smith, a self-assured prosecutor comfortable in high-pressure situations, could backfire by undermining the narrative that the investigations were unjustified. Mr. Smith joked that his first boss would have thrown him “out the window” if he had expressed a political or personal motive for bringing a case, in a rare moment of levity during an hour of otherwise sober conversation. Mr. Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in November 2022, was most passionate in his defense of the career prosecutors and F.B.I. agents who worked for him, many of them subsequently purged by Trump political appointees without evidence they had done anything wrong. “They do not like to tell their own story. They cannot start a sentence with I; they start that with we,” he said. “These are team players who don’t want anything but to do good in the world. They’re not interested in politics.” Mr. Smith added that he was “very concerned” about efforts to “demonize these people for political ends when these are the very sort of people I think we should be celebrating.” Trump law enforcement officials, working closely with congressional Republicans, have targeted career F.B.I. agents and prosecutors who worked for Mr. Smith for termination without providing verified evidence of wrongdoing, citing Mr. Trump’s broad powers under Article II of the Constitution. Earlier this month, Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, fired two agents who were identified as having worked with Mr. Smith. Both were bureau veterans with excellent performance records. They had been identified as associates of Mr. Smith in documents obtained by Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In his role as special counsel, Mr. Smith brought two foiled federal prosecutions against Mr. Trump — a case accusing him of retaining classified documents after leaving office and obstructing efforts to retrieve them in Florida, and charges stemming from his effort to overturn the 2020 election in Washington. Both were dropped after Mr. Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Mr. Smith shrugged off criticism about the pace of both cases, saying that his team — and Justice Department officials who worked on the election interference case before he arrived — moved as fast as possible given the demands of collecting evidence sufficient to obtain convictions. “The idea of people criticizing things — particularly in the media — if you are a good prosecutor, that is noise, and you need to tune it out,” he said, adding, “We do all our work by the book.” Mr. Smith painted a dire picture of the department’s future. He said the firings and resignations of experienced career prosecutors, particularly in the national security division, would hamstring the department for years. “If you think getting rid of the people who know most about national security is going to make our country safer, you do not know anything about national security,” he said. For years, Mr. Jordan, as head of the judiciary panel, has been scrutinizing the special counsel’s office, accusing it of attempting to silence Mr. Trump and raiding his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, in an unnecessary and “abusive” fashion. He has accused Mr. Smith and his team, without evidence, of manipulating evidence in the case. On Tuesday, Mr. Jordan wrote a letter summoning Mr. Smith to Capitol Hill for testimony needed “to understand the full extent to which the Biden-Harris Justice Department weaponized federal law enforcement.” The letter accused Mr. Smith of “abusive surveillance” of lawmakers and of “prosecutorial misconduct and constitutional abuses.” Mr. Jordan claimed Mr. Smith’s prosecutorial tactics were “so flagrant that the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility confirmed to the committee in November 2024 that it had opened an inquiry.” Mr. Jordan appeared to be referring to a so-called self-filed complaint from a member of Mr. Trump’s defense team, Stanley Woodward Jr., against a career national security official who was working on the Florida documents investigation. Such complaints are not proof of guilt, and there are no indications that the inquiry uncovered any wrongdoing. Mr. Woodward is now a senior Justice Department official. Democrats immediately pointed out the paradox of House Republicans accusing Mr. Smith of “politically motivated prosecutions” just days after the acting U.S. attorney secured the indictment of Ms. James amid Mr. Trump’s calls for her prosecution on social media. The request for all documents and communications and a transcribed interview, Mr. Jordan wrote on Tuesday, was part of the committee’s investigation into what he described as the former special counsel’s “partisan and politically motivated” prosecutions of Mr. Trump and his co-defendants. It was not the first time Mr. Jordan had wielded his gavel in the service of Mr. Trump’s vendettas. Acting as one of the president’s top allies in Congress, Mr. Jordan in 2023 issued a letter demanding documents and testimony from Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, whom he accused of “an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority ” after his indictment of Mr. Trump that year. But Democrats on Capitol Hill celebrated Mr. Jordan’s request as an unexpected victory for transparency. “Chairman Jordan’s letter today to Jack Smith clearly demands the release of Smith’s full report, and all accompanying records, from his investigation into Donald Trump’s hoarding of classified documents and obstruction of justice at Mar-a-Lago,” Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “An extraordinary yearslong MAGA cover-up has deprived the American public of the opportunity to read this special counsel report that the taxpayers paid for.” He added: “We look forward to finally receiving the Jack Smith report on Trump and the classified documents!”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/jack-smith-house-judiciary-committee.html,politics,BBC,By Glenn Thrush and Annie Karni,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14DC-INVESTIGATE-vkzf/14DC-INVESTIGATE-vkzf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T21:10:30+00:00,7c363b3919d322ba35e89ed3eefa66e143cffa52
2c980c4ca981,U.S. Attorney Was Forced Out After Clashes Over How to Handle Russia Inquiry,"us politics, ethics misconduct malfeasance, us attorney, cia, democrats, fbi, justice department, joe biden, pamela j bondi, letitia james, donald trump, erik s. siebert, kashyap patel","Career prosecutors at the Justice Department do not believe criminal charges are warranted from an investigation seeking to discredit an earlier F.B.I. inquiry into Russia’s attempt to tilt the 2016 election in President Trump’s favor, according to people familiar with the matter. It leaves unclear what political appointees at the Justice Department might do, given the breadth of Mr. Trump’s demands that it pursue people he perceives as enemies. Already, the U.S. attorney in the Western District of Virginia overseeing the case, Todd Gilbert, was forced to resign in August because he refused to sideline a high-ranking career prosecutor who found the evidence flimsy, the people familiar with the matter said. Senior Justice Department officials had ordered Mr. Gilbert to open a grand jury investigation into whether anyone at F.B.I. headquarters during and after the Biden administration had mishandled classified documents related to the Russia investigation that Mr. Trump has long decried as a “witch hunt” against him. Even as news of Mr. Gilbert’s departure over the summer raised concerns about turmoil inside the Justice Department, the events leading up to it have remained unclear until now. The new details highlight how Mr. Trump’s push for criminal prosecutions of those he sees as enemies has led to crises inside multiple U.S. attorneys’ offices, in this instance dooming a top prosecutor in the Western District of Virginia, based in Roanoke. Similar disputes consumed Mr. Gilbert’s counterpart in eastern Virginia, Erik S. Siebert, in recent weeks. Mr. Gilbert was a longtime Republican legislator in Virginia until he was sworn in as the top prosecutor in July. He was quickly ordered to take up a case championed by the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, and his deputy, Dan Bongino, after they learned that classified documents had been found inside “burn bags” at F.B.I. headquarters. For decades, classified documents have been retained on computer servers. When printouts are made of sensitive documents, officials often dispose of them by burning the papers as a security measure. Mr. Patel and Mr. Bongino are among the Trump loyalists who have pressed for an investigation to determine whether senior F.B.I. officials at the time had conspired to protect former F.B.I. and C.I.A. officials by hiding or destroying such documents. There have been a number of unusual facets to the investigation. The Justice Department tends to try to closely control national security-related investigations in a particular office or team. In this instance, however, the department has dedicated multiple U.S. attorneys’ offices to a set of interconnected issues, all centered on an effort to show misconduct in the Russia investigation, which is nearly a decade old. Federal prosecutors in western Virginia, rather than in Washington, were assigned the document investigation on the legal theory that jurisdiction was there because the F.B.I. has a classified document storage facility in Winchester, which is in that part of the state, according to people familiar with the case. Since the investigation began, there has been little indication of any grand jury activity, though a host of former F.B.I. officials voluntarily sat for interviews, according to people familiar with the matter. Witnesses in the case were questioned by a combination of civil lawyers — not criminal prosecutors — from the Western District of Virginia, as well as criminal prosecutors from the neighboring Eastern District of Virginia and F.B.I. agents. To reassure witnesses that they were not targets of the investigation, witnesses were allowed to be interviewed at their lawyers’ offices, rather than at government buildings. Defense lawyers who have clients caught up in the case have expressed bafflement at what possible crime could have been committed, and one witness approached earlier this year was told the investigation was being conducted at the specific direction of Mr. Patel. Shortly after Mr. Gilbert took over as U.S. attorney, senior Justice Department officials instructed him to open an investigation into the handling of secret documents related to Russian intelligence reports, these people said. After reviewing the evidence, Mr. Gilbert told his superiors that he did not believe there was sufficient evidence to justify a grand jury investigation, these people said. Frustrated by that answer, aides to Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, blamed a senior career attorney in the office who they believed had swayed Mr. Gilbert: Zachary Lee, a veteran prosecutor with more than two decades of experience involving public corruption and narcotics, among other issues. Justice Department officials ordered Mr. Gilbert to replace Mr. Lee with Robert Tracci as his deputy, these people said. After Mr. Lee was demoted, senior department officials suspected Mr. Gilbert was still primarily consulting Mr. Lee, whom they came to view as a holdover from the Biden administration, though he had been hired during the George W. Bush administration and promoted during the first Trump administration, these people added. At one point, Mr. Blanche spoke directly to Mr. Gilbert and offered him more resources to pursue the case, according to one person familiar with the events. Pressed to further sideline or remove Mr. Lee, Mr. Gilbert refused, these people said. Department officials then informed Mr. Gilbert that he would be fired, and he resigned shortly afterward, posting a GIF on social media with a joke from the movie “Anchorman,” in which the lead character exclaims, “Boy, that escalated quickly!” Mr. Tracci has since stepped in as the acting U.S. attorney. Mr. Lee, who left the office this month, declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment about the case. The investigation appears to have petered out, at least for the moment. While investigators have interviewed a number of former F.B.I. officials, there has been little observable activity in the case for weeks, and several people familiar with the work described it as essentially over. In recent weeks, however, Trump appointees have secured critical indictments against some of Mr. Trump’s nemeses, over the objections of career prosecutors. In the Eastern District of Virginia, Mr. Siebert, a Trump appointee, informed Justice Department officials that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey. Career prosecutors viewed a possible mortgage fraud case against Ms. James as fatally flawed and weak; they also considered the investigation into whether Mr. Comey had lied in testifying to Congress in 2020 as unworthy of charges. Mr. Trump then fired Mr. Siebert, replacing him with a White House lawyer with no experience as a prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, who quickly won grand jury indictments against both Mr. Comey and Ms. James. Both defendants deny wrongdoing, and have accused the Trump administration of misusing the criminal justice system to pursue political vendettas. Other prosecutors have been under pressure to deliver big-name indictments on politically sensitive cases sought by Mr. Trump and his allies. In Baltimore, charges could be filed any day against the president’s former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, in a long-running investigation into whether he mishandled classified information. That same office has also been assigned to investigate Senator Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat, to determine if he engaged in mortgage fraud. In Philadelphia, the U.S. attorney is overseeing an investigation into whether intelligence officials lied about an intelligence assessment drafted in the waning days of the Obama administration. That assessment, long criticized by the president’s supporters, determined Russia had sought to interfere in the 2016 election to benefit Mr. Trump.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/doj-trump-russia-inquiry-prosecutors.html,politics,BBC,By Devlin Barrett and Michael S.

c61ead123427,"Before Alaska Flooding, E.P.A. Canceled $20 Million Flood Protection Grant","flood, federal aid, alaska natives, epa, donald trump, lee m zeldin, kwigillingok, kipnuk, alaska","Five months before catastrophic floods swept through the Alaska Native village of Kipnuk on Sunday, tearing many houses off their foundations, the Trump administration canceled a $20 million grant intended to protect the community from such extreme flooding. The grant from the Environmental Protection Agency was designed to help stabilize the riverbank on which Kipnuk is built, protecting it from the twin threats of erosion and flooding. But in May, the E.P.A. revoked the grant, which was issued at the end of the Biden administration, saying it was “no longer consistent” with the agency’s priorities. Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, boasted on social media that he was eliminating “wasteful DEI and Environmental Justice grants,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and programs to help communities facing a disproportionate level of environmental threats. It is unclear whether the work funded by the grant would have prevented the tragedy on Sunday, which left one person dead and two missing in the neighboring village of Kwigillingok. But the disaster laid bare the area’s vulnerability to flooding and the consequences of the Trump administration’s cuts to environmental programs. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said the flooding underscored the need for funding for underserved communities in the state. Earlier this year, Ms. Murkowski called on the Trump administration to ensure that funding for Alaska Native communities did not get swept up in the president’s opposition to D.E.I. initiatives. “This administration prioritizes lowering costs — but minimizing the impacts of a disaster like this before it occurs is far cheaper than rebuilding afterward, to say nothing of the toll these events take on people’s lives,” Ms. Murkowski said in a statement. “Whether you call it climate change or ‘once-in-a-generation’ extreme weather, no community in the wealthiest country on earth should lack the basic infrastructure needed to keep its people safe.” Brigit Hirsch, the E.P.A. press secretary, said in an email that the agency was still providing about $140 million to Alaska, much of which would support infrastructure projects in rural communities. She did not respond to questions about the terminated grant for Kipnuk. Rayna Paul, the environmental director for Kipnuk, could not be reached for comment amid cellphone service outages in the aftermath of the disaster. But in a court filing in litigation over the funding’s cancellation, Ms. Paul said the money was “essential to prevent environmental and cultural catastrophe.” Kipnuk, a village of about 970 people along the Bering Sea, is built on permafrost, ground that has been frozen in some cases for hundreds or thousands of years. Climate change is heating the Arctic region more rapidly than the rest of the planet and the permafrost has started to thaw . “When you have permafrost it’s like you’re dealing with concrete; you could take an ax to it,” said Tom Ravens, a civil engineering professor at the University of Alaska-Anchorage who focuses on the Arctic. “Once that permafrost thaws, it becomes this gooey mess.” As a result of melting permafrost, Kipnuk’s key infrastructure is at risk of collapsing into the river whenever it floods after a major storm. Ms. Paul said she was especially worried that abandoned fuel tanks and batteries could leak hazardous waste into the river, potentially contaminating the water and surrounding lands. On Monday, officials were investigating possible fuel spills stemming from the stations that supply local boats and airplanes. Kipnuk has already flooded at least 30 times between 1979 and 2022, mostly after major storms, according to a report last year from Alaska’s Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. “In recent years, we’ve seen stronger storms and records being broken more regularly, which is incredibly concerning,” said Nora Nieminski, a coastal hazards program manager who was an author of the report. Ms. Nieminski declined to discuss the canceled grant, citing an agency policy of not commenting on federal funding decisions. But, she said, “the fact that Kipnuk was applying for this grant is just proof that they are very much in need of support and in need of funds to relocate homes that are threatened by higher waters.” The remnants of Typhoon Halong unleashed record-breaking storm surge in Kipnuk over the weekend, Ms. Nieminski added. Emergency management officials rescued at least 51 people in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok on Sunday, while more than 1,000 remained in emergency shelters on Monday. The E.P.A. grant was intended to fund Kipnuk’s river stabilization project for three years. Planning, design and some construction were supposed to happen between June and September, when the river would have thawed enough for barges to bring supplies to the village. Amanda Coyne, a spokeswoman for Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said on Wednesday that Mr. Sullivan had asked Mr. Zeldin in May to restore the Kipnuk grant and was in touch with the E.P.A. administrator again this week. “The specific grant related to erosion in Kipnuk likely would not have been implemented in time to prevent this disaster,” Ms. Coyne said. “That said, as these storms become more frequent and more intense, Senator Sullivan believes we need to put long-term protections in place for rural Alaska.” Zealan Hoover, who served as a senior adviser at the E.P.A. during the Biden administration, accused Mr. Zeldin of using “inflammatory rhetoric” about D.E.I. initiatives that misrepresented efforts in places like Kipnuk. “For decades, E.P.A. has been a partner to local communities,” Mr. Hoover said. “For the first time under this administration, E.P.A. has taken an aggressively adversarial posture toward the very people and communities that it is intended to protect.” The Biden administration awarded Kipnuk the funding under the Community Change Grants program, which was created under a 2022 climate law and was intended to benefit disadvantaged areas. In January, Mr. Trump issued an executive order directing agencies to eliminate all D.E.I. policies, programs and offices. The E.P.A. complied by closing its environmental justice offices , which had helped oversee the Community Change Grants program, and firing or reassigning hundreds of their employees. Without the federal funding, residents and leaders of Kipnuk would probably not have the resources to pursue the riverbank stabilization project on their own. The village has an average annual income of $12,107 and a poverty rate of more than 26 percent. The homes lack running water, and the only buildings with flushable toilets are the school and the laundromat. “The Native Village of Kipnuk does not have taxing authority and cannot raise funds itself for riverbank stabilization, or anything else,” Ms. Paul wrote in the court filing. “It depends on grants to fund local government projects.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/climate/kupnik-alaska-typhoon-trump-epa-flood.html,politics,BBC,By Maxine Joselow and Lisa Friedman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/climate/14cli-alaska-typhoon/14cli-alaska-typhoon-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T20:55:26+00:00,c5ab9fd5f618e4a25cd989c4a72da4b983bd90e6
63503f45d7b0,Trump Renews Threat to Cut ‘Democrat Programs’ During Shutdown,"us politics, closings, federal aid, budget, federalism, democrats, donald trump","Two weeks after the start of the government shutdown, President Trump has seized on the stalemate for political gain, aiming to hurt Democrats while insulating his administration from the costs of the fiscal crisis he helped bring about. Democrats and Republicans remain starkly at odds over how to reopen the government. But unlike previous presidents, Mr. Trump has been unwilling to mediate a truce. He has opted instead to stretch the limits of his power to cushion the blow for agencies and constituencies he supports, while embarking on a retribution campaign against his political foes. That strategy came into clear view on Tuesday, as Mr. Trump publicly renewed his threat to strip away funding from Democrats’ priorities. He promised to release a list on Friday of “Democratic programs” slated for cuts if the government remained closed, saying that some were “never going to open up again.” At the same time, Mr. Trump assured that “Republican programs” would be spared. The threat came days after the administration moved to lay off thousands of federal workers and cancel billions of dollars in federal aid . Each of the moves seemed designed to put pressure on Democrats, who say they will not back a Republican measure to fund the government unless it extends a set of soon-expiring federal health subsidies . In the process, the White House has looked to shield itself from both the burden and the blame of the shutdown, given the severe consequences it could inflict on families, businesses and the economy. Over the weekend, the administration rearranged the budget at the Pentagon so that it could pay military service members their full checks, even as many in government must forgo salaries while federal funding has lapsed. Mr. Trump and his aides have eyed similar budgetary maneuvers to pay other categories of workers, including federal law enforcement. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

449e09f1b27e,"U.S. Military Kills Another 6 People in 5th Caribbean Strike, Trump Says","targeted killings, smuggling, drug abuse, caribbean, venezuela, us military, us foreign policy, us politics, donald trump, internal-open-access-from-nl","The United States killed six men aboard a boat in international waters “just off the Coast of Venezuela,” President Trump wrote on social media on Tuesday, asserting without evidence that they had been transporting drugs. The strike was the fifth known attack by the U.S. military on such boats since Sept. 2. The military has now killed 27 people as if they were enemy soldiers in a war zone and not criminal suspects. “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known” route for smuggling, Mr. Trump said in his social media post. He also posted a 33-second aerial surveillance video showing a small boat floating, and then being struck by a missile and exploding. Unlike some previous announcements, the president did not identify the nationality of the people who were killed or name a specific drug cartel or criminal gang with which they were supposedly associated. Since Mr. Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, started the operation last month, a broad range of legal specialists have called the premeditated and summary extrajudicial killings illegal. They noted that the military cannot lawfully target civilians — even criminal suspects — who do not pose a threat in the moment and are not directly participating in hostilities. The Trump administration has asserted that killing suspected drug smugglers — rather than having the Coast Guard interdict boats and arrest people aboard them if suspicions of drug smuggling proved accurate — is consistent with the laws of war. But the administration has not released any detailed legal analysis in support of that conclusion. Charles L. Young III, Mr. Trump’s nominee to be general counsel of the Army, said at his confirmation hearing last week that he had seen a memo by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel about the operation but did not disclose its legal analysis or arguments. The administration’s public explanations have nodded toward different legal concepts and terms without explaining why they apply to suspected drug smuggling. For example, Mr. Trump last month signed a letter to Congress informing lawmakers of the Sept. 2 strike, which he said had killed 11 people aboard a boat as a matter of “self-defense.” After a strike on Sept. 15 killed three people, the administration sent a different kind of notice to Congress declaring that Mr. Trump had “determined” that the United States was now in a formal armed conflict with various Latin American cartels and gangs that his team had labeled “terrorists.” Suspected drug runners for them could be lawfully targeted as “unlawful combatants,” the administration wrote. Congress has not authorized any armed force against drug cartels, and the administration’s designation of various criminal groups as “terrorists” is novel and contentious because they are motivated by illicit profit, not ideology. In any case, the law that permits the executive branch to label foreign groups as terrorists authorizes tactics like freezing their assets but does not convey legal authority to attack them militarily. The administration has not explained how a boat in the southern Caribbean Sea, far from the U.S. coast, posed the kind of imminent threat of armed attack that could prompt a right to use force in self-defense. Nor has it explained how smuggling an illicit consumer product counted as the sort of hostilities that, under international law, shift to armed-conflict rules from human rights ones. In peacetime, the authorities arrest criminal suspects and can use lethal force only in defense against an imminent threat; in war, it is lawful to target enemy fighters based on their status even if they pose no threat at the moment. In his posting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump did not mention self-defense or a purported state of armed conflict. Instead, the president invoked his constitutional role as the head of the U.S. armed forces without further discussion, saying he had authorized Mr. Hegseth, whom he calls the secretary of war, to order the strike. “Under my Standing Authorities as Commander-in-Chief, this morning, the Secretary of War, ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Mr. Trump wrote, “just off the Coast of Venezuela.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/trump-drugs-boat-attack.html,politics,BBC,By Charlie Savage,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14dc-boat-photo-wbvh/14dc-boat-photo-wbvh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T18:51:04+00:00,363baa6cc476ed0021f0351ff8ed17be3d930a83

The identities or nationalities of the detainees were not immediately known. All were believed to be men. Trackers spotted the flight after it left a Homeland Security Department hub in Alexandria, La., on Monday afternoon. But the first confirmation came on Tuesday, after the federal holiday, from a defense official who was not authorized to be identified by name. The operation raised to about 710 the number of migrants who had been temporarily held at the base since the Trump administration’s deportation operations began in early February. On Oct. 1, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents transferred 18 detainees held at the base back to U.S. holding facilities, leaving the site empty. The arrivals on Monday were the first since then. A spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department did not respond to questions of why the base was cleared of migrants, or why more were sent there. The site had generally served as a way station for deportees bound for Latin America, primarily Venezuela and El Salvador. More recently, the department used it to house several dozen men from countries farther from the United States, including Egypt, Iran, India, Romania and Vietnam. Civil liberties lawyers are seeking a court order to shut the operation down. A hearing before a federal judge is scheduled in Washington later this month. “Never before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guantánamo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention,” their filing claims. “Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so. The government has ample detention capacity inside the United States.” President Trump initially authorized his administration to hold up to 30,000 people on the base in tent cities. But that proved impractical, and the military dismantled rows of tents erected for the mission and returned them to storage for use in the event of a humanitarian crisis in the Caribbean. The largest number of migrants held at Guantánamo on a single day was 178 on Feb. 19 — all of them Venezuelans — before they were all removed , and all but one repatriated. Since then, the deportee population has ranged from zero to dozens. The military recently added a second bunk to some cells at a site where the migrants have been held, called Camp 6, to increase ICE detainee capacity to about 200. A second site has been closed because of a water break.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/ice-migrants-guantanamo-bay.html,politics,BBC,By Carol Rosenberg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14DC-GITMO-pwgc/14DC-GITMO-pwgc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T18:12:13+00:00,0e6b208f6cbd38a3a5a6de496b52178bd39f0e2d

He was made of fiberglass, not flesh, part of a surrealist art exhibition that was supposed to open in June. Then Israeli warplanes struck, marking the start of a blistering 12-day war that also drew in the United States. The show was postponed and the artists, unable to return home, were stranded at the gallery. Every night they pulled chairs into the courtyard to watch “the fireworks,” as the gallery owner, Houman Dayhimi, tartly put it — missiles streaking across the sky, the dark glow of explosions with a terrifying orchestra of booms and thuds. Reality took on the air of the art show. “It was surreal,” Mr. Dayhimi said. Like many Iranians, Mr. Dayhimi was used to bending to the vagaries of geopolitics. A decade earlier, his gallery space, the Dayhim Art Society, was a sprawling furniture plant with 700 employees. Then American sanctions forced it into bankruptcy, so he filled its workshops with artworks and the offices of tech start-ups. Even so, this latest flash of hostilities with the United States and Israel, at a time when Iran’s regional influence was crumbling, appeared to signal a volatile new path. “We know that change is coming, but we don’t know what or how,” Mr. Dayhimi said. “And that’s what makes it worse. It’s so unpredictable.” Nearly half a century after Iran’s revolution, people are accustomed to navigating the fraught space between the dictates of their government, pressure from foreign powers, and their own identities and desires. Signs in upmarket restaurants order women to wear the hijab, yet are roundly ignored by young diners with flowing hair. The internet is censored, so people used VPNs to scroll through Instagram and TikTok. American sanctions make for a thriving black market. Religion was strangely muted. Over eight days in July, I hardly saw a cleric on the streets, and rarely heard the three-times daily call to prayer, even though Iran is a theocratic republic. Certainly, there was plenty that conformed to Iran as advertised. Many women covered their hair. Black-clad police officers patrolled on dirt bikes. Giant murals depicted official heroes — stern-faced clerics, slain generals and nuclear scientists — and designated villains. “DOWN WITH THE USA” read the slogan across an American flag dropping cartoon bombs. But there was also, just a few streets away, splashes of beauty or history on walls covered in images of flowers or ancient Persian warriors. And while “Death to America!” rang out at Friday Prayer, some Iranians confided that they didn’t agree, even since the cartoon American bombs became jarringly real. (As part of the restrictions that journalists face in Iran, the government assigned a translator to us whose work we later verified. It was excellent.) During our trip, the city had a wounded air, its sang-froid shaken by a war that few had anticipated, or wanted. Residents said they felt rattled, and worried about what might come next. The ‘Den of Espionage’ A diplomatic ghost ship of sorts was moored on Taleghani Street in the form of a long, two-story building. Once it was the epicenter of hostilities between Iran and the United States. Now it is a museum. The sign over the front door still reads “United States of America Embassy,” complete with a crest of a soaring eagle. But the lobby is dominated by images of skulls, and crossbones and a ghoulish Statue of Liberty. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stared from a poster in the corner, a faint smile playing on his lips. The hostage crisis of 1979, when Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy and held 52 Americans for 444 days, was the foundational trauma between Iran’s rulers and the United States. It set the stage for decades of smoldering hostility during which the Americans cut off diplomatic ties and the Iranians sought to write their own version of that history in the halls of the deserted embassy, now officially known as the “U.S. Den of Espionage Museum.” After buying my ticket for $1.40 (the prevailing price for foreigners), I entered via the Roosevelt Gate, as it was once known. A path led through an overgrown garden, where street cats lounged under the pine trees. Charred helicopter parts were stacked on a plinth, wreckage from a failed rescue mission when American military aircraft collided during a sandstorm in 1980, killing eight American service members. “The sands in the desert were God’s agents,” read an inscription. Upstairs, the ambassador’s office had been carefully preserved — leather chairs, a handsome desk and immaculate American flag. (Iranian factories produce thousands of U.S. flags every year, mostly to be burned at street demonstrations.) A portrait of a smiling President Jimmy Carter hung from a wall. “Carter paid the price,” remarked our guide, Amir, a 21-year-old military conscript, referring to the role of the crisis in Mr. Carter’s failed re-election bid in 1980. Like many in a country where self-censorship is common, he requested to use one name. At the end of the hall, beyond a steel door, lay the main focus of the museum: the C.I.A. station. An array of vintage American spy gear was on proud display. There were compartmented rooms, machines to encode and decode messages, satellite transmitters, eavesdropping equipment, industrial shredders and devices that, according to the exhibit label, were used to forge passports and license plates. Waxwork figures sat beside a mound of shredded paper, in a depiction of the painstaking, yearslong effort by Iranian students to reassemble shredded American documents found inside the embassy, later published in several books. The Iranians liked to call the American hostages “guests of the ayatollah,” and exhibits in the museum stressed they had been treated fairly. In the embassy hallway, a line of portraits offered descriptions of each hostage, including details of their post-crisis careers and lives, some written in an almost fond tone. In fact, many hostages later complained of psychological abuse and physical mistreatment during their ordeal. The message of the museum is clear: Americans were only interested in meddling in Iran, not helping it. Still, it has a limited audience. The museum welcomes about 5,000 people every year, mostly tourists from Russia and China, Amir said. Even that flow had dried up since the war in June. During our tour, there was only one other visitor. On the way out, a museum manager presented me with some merch: A plaque commemorating Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian commander killed in an American drone strike in Iraq in 2020. Then I took at a break at the Boof Cafe, a smart little coffee house that recently opened on the embassy grounds. Photos of Charlie Chaplin and Marlon Brando adorned the walls. The owner, a soft-spoken man in his 60s, offered a warm smile but was wary of talking politics. “That’s up to the politicians, not ordinary people like me,” he said of the tensions between Iran and the United States. He pushed my order — an iced Americano — across the table. It was delicious. Jammed Signals Beyond the old embassy, hints of American culture were on open display. Songs by the Pixies, the Boston rock band, played in a Starbucks-style coffee shop. A vintage Lincoln Continental was parked in the lobby of my hotel. Young men clustered in darkened gaming cafes to play Grand Theft Auto. If the museum was the past, most people were preoccupied by the present, in particular the daily struggle to survive, and how it had gotten worse since relations with the United States took a sudden dive. Siyavash Naeini cursed as he maneuvered his modest taxi through the city’s infamous traffic. Snapp!, the ride-hailing app that is Iran’s version of Uber, was barely functioning, he grumbled. The authorities were jamming GPS signals in the city to make it harder for Israeli or American warplanes to locate potential targets. But that also made it near impossible for customers to hail his cab. Since June, his business was down 70 percent. Mr. Naeini, 59, couldn’t afford to stop. He had been diagnosed with cancer — “terminal,” he said matter-of-factly — and needed the money to pay for the drugs that kept him alive. “Since I started chemotherapy, I can’t feel the pedals very well,” he said, idling at a stop light. He got the drugs at subsidized prices from a government-run pharmacy, he said. But sometimes supplies ran out, forcing him onto the black market, where prices were 10 times higher. It was cleaning him out. “My wife sold her jewelry,” he said. “I sold our rugs.” As we pulled up to our destination, I offered my sympathies. Mr. Naeini brushed it off. He didn’t want pity, he said. It was just the struggle of life. Then he drove away, scouring the streets for his next customer. Waiting for Godot We were standing near the British embassy, where a sign read “Babbi Sandz Street.” The street was named for Bobby Sands, a member of the Irish Republican Army who in 1981 died on hunger strike in prison in Northern Ireland, demanding to be treated as a political prisoner. In Britain, Mr. Sands was reviled, but in Iran he joined the pantheon of martyrs. Lionizing martyrs has become a key part of Iran’s political culture. As well as ordaining enemies, like the United States, the authorities anoint national heroes said to share the values of the Iranian revolution. It can also be a way of irking rivals. The British embassy later shifted its entrance to an adjacent street, to avoid having its address named after an Irishman who opposed British rule. Until recently, Egypt’s embassy in Tehran was on a street named after Khalid al-Islambuli, the extremist who assassinated the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. In a sign of warming relations between Iran and Egypt, the name was changed in June. The enthusiasm for Mr. Sands has taken some unorthodox forms. Just before midnight I stopped for dinner at “Bobby Sands Burgers,” a fast-food restaurant on a hilly street in northern Tehran. A line of diners stretched down the street, waiting to order burgers and fries over a counter that was decorated with neon images of the dead Irishman. “Bobby Sands stood for freedom and liberation,” the manager, Kia Garabandi, told me. “Iranians can relate to that.” If it seemed odd to name a burger joint after a person who had starved to death, Mr. Garabandi didn’t think so. “A great man,” he said. “And we make great burgers.” With so much turbulence around, others preferred to focus on the future instead of history, hoping it might bring a kind of deliverance. At a memorial for the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed in an Israeli strike, a mourner told me he welcomed the war. He said it would bring forward the moment when a religious savior known as the Mahdi would return to earth, turning everyone into Muslims. “Even you,” he said, jutting a finger in my chest. Others are not holding their breath for any savior to appear. In downtown Tehran, students crowded into an artsy gathering spot called the Cafe Godot, named after the Beckett play. “It’s an existential tragicomedy,” remarked the cafe owner, Homayoun Ghanizadeh, a well-known movie and theater director. “Iranians can relate to that.” “Just like in the play,” Mr. Ghanizadeh said, “every day a messenger comes and says: Godot won’t come tonight, but he will surely come tomorrow night. And the next day, it all starts over again.” “In my view, the Islamic Republic is also in a state of waiting,” he said. “Although their Godot is quite different from the one ordinary people are waiting for.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/middleeast/iran-tehran-united-states.html,World,BBC,By Declan Walsh and Nanna Heitmann,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/world/xxint-iran-dispatch-promo/xxint-iran-dispatch-05-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:00:41+00:00,04abdcc9d6e75a8e200153669037322aa6511f8c
53ab7ade1f83,Frustrated Gen Z Threatens to Topple African Governments,"africa, morocco, kenya, madagascar, william ruto, civil unrest, generation z;gen z, youth, politics, human rights, international relations","First Kenya, then Madagascar and now Morocco. A wave of protests under the banner of Gen Z has swept through parts of Africa. Demonstrators have stormed Parliament buildings. Security forces have killed and injured hundreds, and in Madagascar the president fell from power on Tuesday. Each protest has had specific causes, but under the surface each reflects the failure of elected governments to provide economic opportunities for young people across a continent with the youngest population in the world , according to protesters and analysts. The frustration among young people poses a challenge to governments beyond where Gen Z protests have taken place, not least because of the continent’s young demographic. Africa’s median age is 19, which means that young people are entering the workplace and becoming politically active in large numbers. Young voters in Botswana last year helped defeat the party that had ruled since independence, while in South Africa discontent among young people with the economic performance of the African National Congress helped cause its vote share to fall below 50 percent for the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994. “Young people want some form of prosperity, they want some form of hope and they are not seeing that,” said Ndongo Sylla, a Senegalese economist and author. The attempts by security forces to repress the protests suggest that governments lacked clear answers, he added. In one measure of the limited economic opportunities in Africa, the vast majority of new jobs on the continent are in the informal sector, according to the African Development Bank. Young people often lead demands for change and analysts argue that, while social media makes these protests distinct, it does not constitute a fundamental difference. But social media has made it easier for Gen Z, the demographic cohort born roughly between 1997 and 2012, to outfox the authorities by orchestrating demonstrations on the fly without high-profile leadership. At the same time, political demands have often shifted and become more ambitious over time, which has kept governments off balance in the face of the protests. Kenya, where global Gen Z protests broke out last year, is a case in point. Young people marched through the capital, Nairobi, and other cities to protest a finance bill introduced by the government of President William Ruto that they said would raise prices. Behind that lay an array of grievances, including spiraling debt, corruption, rising prices and youth unemployment. In a significant victory, the president withdrew the bill in June last year, the day after some protesters stormed parts of Parliament and more than 60 people had died, largely as a result of police fire. The protests resumed in June on the anniversary of the largest demonstrations, with calls for the president to resign, and at least eight others were killed. “The systemic change that everybody wants has not happened,” said Nelson Amenya, a student activist. Mr. Amenya’s role as a whistle blower over a proposed deal by the government to overhaul the capital’s main airport last year helped fuel the protests in Kenya. In recent weeks there have also been protests in Indonesia and Nepal, where the government fell, while President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar was forced to dissolve his government in an attempt to quell protests. The protesters had demanded that he step down for his failure to deliver basic services, including electricity and water. Many young people were not appeased. “Firing the government is not a solution. The real problem hasn’t been uprooted,” said Rakoarivao Andritiana Kevin, 20, a law student at the University of Ankatso in the capital, Antananarivo, arguing that Mr. Rajoelina should resign. Mr. Rajoelina has since gone into hiding and was impeached by Parliament on Tuesday. The demonstrations that erupted in Morocco in recent weeks were driven by anger over spending on infrastructure ahead of this year’s Africa Cup of Nations football tournament and the 2030 World Cup. Three people were killed. The protests, organized by a group known as Gen Z 212, used social media to call for better schools as well as hospitals and broader freedoms. “Promises have not been kept and the credibility of the country’s political elite has suffered as a result,” said Aboubakr Jamai, dean of the Madrid center at the American College of the Mediterranean. The success of the demonstrations in Madagascar and Nepal, which have prompted changes of government, has forced activists in Kenya to reflect on their lack of progress. “I’ve been looking at them with green eyes, with jealousy, because they are literally getting what they want,” said Lee Makenna Jelani, who has supported Kenya’s protests and organized a dialogue on social media to discuss what lessons could be learned. But others in Kenya said they have been inspired by what they see as a movement that has spread across the continent and beyond. Hanifa Adan, 29, who played a prominent role in rallying the demonstrations last year and was briefly detained, said she had followed the other protests avidly. “We are validating each other. We are inspiring each other,” she said. “We borrow courage from each other.” Aida Alami and Gaelle Borgia contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/africa/africa-gen-z-protests-kenya.html,World,BBC,By Matthew Mpoke Bigg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15int-DRIC-genz-1-mfgk/15int-DRIC-genz-1-mfgk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:02:36+00:00,a46d8f2bc1c2fc099d023e88478751ed27515962
e20d15135f95,"With Truce in Place, Hamas Pursues Bloody Crackdown on Rivals in Gaza","military, israel gaza war, palestinians, terrorism, peace process, targeted killings, hamas, gaza city, deir al balah, gaza strip","The public execution was captured on video. Masked gunmen, some wearing green headbands associated with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, lined up eight captives in the middle of a crowded street in Gaza City on Monday. They forced the men to bend over, leveled their rifles at them, and opened fire, leaving their bodies in the dirt. A Hamas internal security official confirmed that the video, which The New York Times geolocated to Gaza City, showed Hamas fighters executing Palestinian rivals. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to journalists. The execution took place just days after a cease-fire with Israel began on Friday and Israeli forces pulled back from parts of Gaza. Analysts say that Hamas appears to be trying to assert that it is still the dominant force in the territory, no matter how weakened it is after two years of war with Israel. Hamas lost many of its top commanders and thousands of fighters in the conflict, and some Gaza residents launched rare protests against the group’s iron-fisted rule earlier this year. Israel has acknowledged that it also sought to undermine Hamas’s control by backing rival Palestinian clans in Gaza, with mixed results . “Hamas is sending a message: ‘We are here. We are the sole authority in Gaza,’” said Tamer Qarmout, a Palestinian political analyst and academic from Gaza, who is based in Qatar. Since Monday, at least 10 members of Hamas’s security forces and at least 20 members of rival Palestinian groups have been killed in the internecine fighting, according to a Gaza health official and the Hamas internal security official. It was not clear whether the eight men who were executed in the video were counted in those tolls. Some of them were members of the Doghmosh family, which has a long-running rivalry with Hamas, Nizar Doghmosh, a family leader, told The Times on Wednesday. The outbreak of internal violence in Gaza, which has been limited to a few incidents so far, could further complicate President Trump’s vision for a postwar Gaza. His plan to end the war requires Hamas to lay down its weapons, allow an international force to stabilize the territory, and effectively end its two-decade control — demands the group has rejected so far. After a visit to Israel on Monday coinciding with Hamas’s release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, Mr. Trump was asked by a reporter about the possibility of the group reasserting itself as a police force in Gaza and shooting rivals. Mr. Trump suggested the United States was not opposed, at least for now. “They’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” he said. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump addressed the issue again, saying Hamas had “taken out a couple of gangs that were very bad,” and adding: “That didn’t bother me very much, to be honest.” During the war, uniformed Hamas fighters were rarely seen on the streets of Gaza. They avoided moving in the open as much as possible so they would not be targeted by Israeli airstrikes. Palestinian witnesses in Gaza say groups of masked, rifle-toting Hamas security forces are appearing again now, including when Hamas handed over the remaining hostages to the Red Cross on Monday. Some of the Hamas activity does appear to entail restoring public order in Gaza’s daily life. In the central city of Deir al-Balah, for example, armed men have been spotted in the streets directing traffic this week, which they had hardly done throughout the war. Hamas officials publicly acknowledge that they are also launching operations against people they deem to be lawbreakers or collaborators with Israel. Two Hamas internal security officials said the killings shown in the video were in retaliation for the Doghmosh family’s killing of several Hamas militants during the war. The clashes that led to the killings shown in the video began on Sunday, Mr. Doghmosh said, after Hamas had sought to apprehend members of the family it accused of being collaborators with Israel. He denied that the family as a whole was working with Israel. Later that evening, Hamas fighters and armed members of the Doghmosh family fought a pitched gun battle in Gaza City, according to two Gaza health officials, two Hamas internal security officials and Palestinian residents. One of those killed in the clashes was Naim Naim, whose father, Basem Naim, is a senior Hamas leader, according to two family members and one of the Gaza health officials. After the clashes, armed Hamas fighters burst into nearby houses, checking identity cards to see who belonged to the Doghmosh family, said a Palestinian witness who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. He said his family spent hours huddled in the center of their home amid a hail of gunfire and explosions outside. Then Hamas fighters showed up and ordered them to flee, he recounted. At least 24 bodies arrived at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City from the Hamas-Doghmosh clashes on Sunday night, said Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the medical facility’s director. He said he did not know how many were from each side. On Monday, the day after the gun battle in Gaza City, the Hamas gunmen were filmed shooting the masked and blindfolded men in the middle of neighborhood where the clashes took place, surrounded by a large crowd of bystanders. Hamas’s interior ministry has warned rival groups that it will come after any “criminal gangs” that threaten “civil peace.” It called for members of those groups who were not involved in killings to hand themselves over in exchange for amnesty and warned that anyone who did not would face consequences. Mahmoud Mardawi, a Hamas official, vowed on social media on Tuesday that the group would not allow “chaos to spread in beloved Gaza nor criminals to escape punishment.” Military analysts say a major target for this Hamas crackdown will likely be the string of small Palestinian militias that have sprung up in Gaza over the past several months, though it is not clear whether Hamas has already moved against them in force. None have mounted a serious challenge to Hamas yet, the analysts said. Some of these smaller militias say they have worked in coordination with Israel . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel confirmed in June that Israel was “using clans in Gaza” who were fighting Hamas on its behalf. Israeli officials later confirmed helping to arm one operated by Yasser Abu Shabab in eastern Rafah. Mr. Abu Shabab was notorious for ransacking humanitarian aid from U.N. convoys earlier in the war, according to aid officials. Later, he set up a militia in an Israeli-controlled zone inside Gaza, saying this zone would be peaceful and free of Hamas. His militia uploaded videos showing makeshift classrooms and quiet tents in an effort to attract displaced Gazans to join. “This adventure was only ever going to end one way,” said Michael Milshtein, a former senior Israeli intelligence officer. “We armed and supported these militias, and now Hamas is coming for its revenge.” If Hamas attacks any of the clans affiliated with Israel, it would pose a “heavy dilemma” for the Israeli authorities, who would have to decide whether to defend them — thus breaking the cease-fire — or allow them to be killed or arrested, Mr. Milshtein said. For now, at least some militia members say they have no plans to surrender to Hamas. “We are preparing to defend ourselves by any means necessary should Hamas attack,” said Mohammad al-Mansi, 21, whose father leads a small armed group opposed to Hamas in northern Gaza. “We won’t turn ourselves in. We would rather die.” Bilal Shbair and Abu Bakr Bashir contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/middleeast/hamas-crackdown-rivals-gaza.html,World,BBC,"By Iyad Abuheweila, Aaron Boxerman and Sanjana Varghese",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15int-gaza-hamas-2-jlgm/15int-gaza-hamas-2-jlgm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:58:39+00:00,02f18381fdf5a4b241da9f32e62b5c196fbd5c6a
2a5a4bd472d3,Syria’s New Leaders Are Talking to a Former Enemy: Russia,"international relations, war;armed conflicts, embargoes sanctions, military bases, ahmed al-shara, bashar al-assad, vladimir putin, syria, russia","The shops in the Syrian town of Hmeimim — hair salons, kebab stalls, a mechanic’s garage — have signs in Russian. But most of them were shuttered on a recent morning. Soldiers from the nearby Russian air base don’t visit anymore, a cafe owner said. Ten months after the fall of its ally, the authoritarian president Bashar al-Assad, Russia’s influence is barely visible in Syria. Most of its troops are gone, and the bases and investment projects built up during its decade-long intervention are largely abandoned. The new president, Ahmed al-Shara, who led the Islamist rebel force that overthrew the Assad regime and upturned Russia’s interests in the region, allowed Moscow to maintain a small footprint in Syria rather than chasing it out completely. “With al-Shara, we are clearly seeing pragmatism over ideology,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “There is no reason for al-Shara to make another enemy, as he is trying to survive in this geographic region.” For many Syrians, including the former rebels who now run the country and one-time refugees back home after many years, there is no love lost for Russia. It propped up Mr. al-Assad’s brutal dictatorship for decades and entered the 13-year civil war directly, unleashing deadly bombing raids on Syrian towns and villages. In previous contacts with Russian officials, Syria’s Islamist leaders have asked that Mr. al-Assad, who has taken refuge in Moscow, be extradited for a war crimes trial and that Russia pay war reparations. But Syria, under pressure from neighbors and larger powers, faces many security and economic challenges that could motivate Mr. al-Shara to seek compromises. His priorities are to negotiate an end to international sanctions and ease the nation’s crippling poverty, while preventing outside interference as he consolidates power and secures Syria’s borders. Russia has made clear that it wants to maintain its air bases in Syria — the one at Hmeimim and a smaller one in the northeastern city of Qamishli — and to continue to use the port of Tartus on the Mediterranean coast, analysts said. Together, they provide Russia with its only stopover points in the eastern Mediterranean for planes and ships traveling to and from Africa. Officials at the Syrian Foreign Ministry declined requests for comment on the government’s plans for its relations with Russia. But political analysts and politicians in Syria said that Moscow was in no position to make demands. “The reality is Russia continues to remain in Syria with a big, purple black eye,” said Ms. Aydintasbas, the Brookings Institution fellow. Russian personnel have to give prior notice of their movements to the Internal Security Service of Syria and are only allowed to travel under escort, according to Syrian security officers guarding checkpoints near Hmeimim and Tartus. Russia once controlled the naval base at Tartus, but now it can only use a single berth when the Syrians allow it, said Abed al-Thalji, an independent Syrian analyst based in Europe. A Russian submarine that had docked at Tartus now stays in Algeria and Libya, he said. And military vessels that escort Russian shipments to Syria anchor off Egypt, added Mr. al-Thalji, who tracks maritime traffic. After canceling Russia’s contract to manage the Tartus port, the Syrian government this summer signed a deal with Dubai Ports World, which agreed to invest $800 million in the facility, Ahmed Khalil, who has been the port’s general manager since December, said in an interview. Business at the port has started to take off since President Trump lifted most of the U.S. sanctions , Mr. Khalil said. “All the quays are busy and we have ships waiting to come inside,” he said. There were signs of ongoing Russian trade with Syria. Rolls of Russian steel were among the goods stacked at quays that New York Times reporters saw during a visit in August. Russia has also provided Syria with much-needed oil and grain at near-giveaway prices, according to several analysts. Syria needs Russia on its side at the U.N. Security Council for important security and political matters. For one, Mr. al-Shara and his interior minister are still on a U.N. sanctions list targeting members of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, Mr. al-Thalji said. Another is enforcement of the Disengagement Treaty, which created a buffer zone along the Golan Heights and which Israel has breached by occupying Syrian territory since December. Since Mr. al-Assad’s ouster, Israel has repeatedly bombed Syrian military facilities , concerned that the old regime’s weapons could fall into the hands of parties that are hostile to it. Israel is also suspicious of the country’s new Islamist leaders and has carried out airstrikes on the Defense Ministry building in central Damascus in July. Under the Assad regime, Russian forces helped patrol Syria’s southern border along the Golan Heights. Diplomats have raised the possibility of Russia’s returning to that role to ease tensions between Israel and the new government. After months of quiet contacts, Russia sent a senior-level delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Mr. Putin’s top energy strategist, to Damascus in September to recalibrate relations. Mr. Novak was welcomed by Maher al-Shara, a brother of the president who speaks Russian and is married to a Russian woman. Maher al-Shara is believed to be responsible for Russian affairs in the office of the presidency. After Mr. Novak’s visit, a delegation from the Syrian Defense Ministry visited a Russian air defense training facility. It is not clear whether any deals are on the table. But Ms. Aydintasbas said that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a close ally of the Syrian president, would most likely advise him, based on experience, to balance the risks of upsetting Western partners by drawing closer to Russia against the security and economic gains that could result. “It’s the Erdogan playbook of balancing acts among great powers and opening up possibilities for a small country,” she said.

ae7942da8f26,First Burials to Be Held for Israelis Returned From Gaza,"israel gaza war, funerals, israel, hamas","The bodies of two Israelis returned from Gaza earlier this week were expected to be buried on Wednesday, underscoring that while many in the country were celebrating the return of the living hostages from Gaza, others were also mourning the dead. A funeral for one of those whose bodies were returned, Guy Ilouz, was set to take place in the afternoon in central Israel, according to the Hostage Families Forum, which has advocated on behalf of the families of those held in Gaza. Mr. Ilouz was abducted in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the Gaza war. The body of Daniel Peretz, whose tank crew battled Hamas militants at an Israeli military installation on Oct. 7, 2023, was also scheduled to be buried Wednesday evening, according to the Forum. Mr. Peretz, who was 22, was declared dead by the Israeli military in March 2024 and his family held a funeral for him at the time. Hamas militants in Gaza have handed over the remains of eight people since Monday. Israel has identified six of those bodies as Israelis and one more as a Nepali. The identity of the eighth was not yet clear. Hamas officials have said the group is struggling to quickly locate all the bodies that have been held in Gaza, because of the vast destruction across the enclave after two years of war. Israeli officials have suggested that they could take measures to penalize Hamas for not turning over more bodies, including limiting the number of trucks entering Gaza with supplies. Mr. Ilouz, who was 26, was injured and taken hostage by Hamas after fleeing the Nova music festival in southern Israel, according to the Israeli military. The military said that he succumbed to his wounds after not receiving proper medical care while held in Gaza. Maya Regev, who was freed from captivity in Gaza in November 2023, met Mr. Ilouz at a hospital in the enclave. “You suffered a week alone until I arrived,” she wrote to him on Tuesday on social media. “We spoke about the most simple and pure things in the darkest and most horrific place that man has known.” On Wednesday, for the second consecutive day, the Red Cross delivered the bodies of 45 Palestinians to Gaza from Israel, according to the Gaza health ministry. Under the cease-fire deal concluded between Hamas and Israel last week, Israeli authorities were supposed to release the remains of 15 Palestinians for each Israeli body returned by Hamas, according to Arab officials.

ebe74cfcf10d,London Became a Global Hub for Phone Theft. Now We Know Why.,"robbery, police, organized crime, crime, mobile phone, biking, scotland yard metropolitan police service, europe, britain, london, china","Sirens screamed as police vans pulled into a north London street, and shocked passers-by paused to watch as officers charged into three secondhand phone shops. “Do you have a safe on your premises, sir?” one officer asked a shopkeeper, who was sitting next to his computer and a half-drunk cup of tea. The man watched as they combed through phones, cash and documents from two safes. The raid, which The New York Times was invited to observe, was one of dozens carried out across the capital last month, part of a belated, highly visible effort by London’s Metropolitan Police to tackle the phone theft problem that has plagued the city in recent years. The scale of the crime has gone beyond the pick-pocketing familiar to London since before Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist made it famous. Increasingly brazen thieves, often masked and on e-bikes, have become adept at snatching phones from residents and tourists. A record 80,000 phones were stolen in the city last year, according to the police, giving London an undesirable reputation as a European capital for the crime. Last month’s raids were aimed at identifying a group of middlemen who, the police say, use secondhand phone shops as part of a multilayered global criminal network. By the end of the two-week operation, detectives had found about 2,000 stolen phones and 200,000 pounds ($266,000) in cash. After years in which phone theft was a low priority for an overstretched police force, the new operations are revealing the curious blend of factors behind the epidemic, including steep cuts to British police budgets in the 2010s and a lucrative black market for European cellphones in China. A Mile of Aluminum Foil For years, London’s police assumed most of the phone thefts were the work of small-time thieves looking to make some quick cash. But last December, they got an intriguing lead from a woman who had used “Find My iPhone” to track her device to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport. Arriving there on Christmas Eve, officers found boxes bound for Hong Kong. They were labeled as batteries but contained almost 1,000 stolen iPhones. “It quickly became apparent this wasn’t just normal low-level street crime,” said Mark Gavin, a senior detective leading the investigation for the Metropolitan Police. “This was on an industrial scale.” The breakthrough coincided with a broader push by the police to increase public confidence by tackling the city’s most common crimes. Phone theft has been the subject of particular anger among victims, who for years reported their cellphones stolen and handed the police the locations being transmitted, only to be given a crime reference number and hear nothing more. The police are now using that information to map where stolen phones are transported by street thieves. After the Heathrow seizure, a team of specialist investigators who normally deal with firearms and drug smuggling was assigned to the case. They identified further shipments and used forensics to identify two men in their 30s who are suspected of being ringleaders of a group that sent up to 40,000 stolen phones to China. When the men were arrested on Sept. 23, the car they were traveling in contained several phones, some wrapped in aluminum foil in an attempt to prevent them from transmitting tracking signals. At one point, the police said at a news conference, they observed the men buying almost 1.5 miles’ worth of foil in Costco. Some phones are reset and sold to new users in Britain. But many are shipped to China and Algeria as part of a “local-to-global criminal business model,” the police said, adding that in China, the newest phones could be sold for up to $5,000, generating huge profits for the criminals involved. Joss Wright, an associate professor at the University of Oxford who specializes in cybersecurity, said that it is easier to use stolen British phones in China than elsewhere because many of the country’s network providers do not subscribe to an international blacklist that bars devices that have been reported stolen. “That means that a stolen iPhone that has been blocked in the U.K. can be used without any problems in China,” Mr. Wright said. E-Bikes and Balaclavas The exporters are at the top of a three-tier criminal network, the police say. In the middle are the shopkeepers and entrepreneurs who buy stolen phones from thieves and sell them to unsuspecting members of the public or pass them on for transport abroad. On the lowest tier are the thieves. Their numbers have risen in line with the juicy profits on offer, and a growing sense of impunity. Overall crime in London has fallen in recent years , but phone theft is disproportionately high, representing about 70 percent of thefts last year. And it has risen sharply: The 80,000 phone thefts last year were a stark increase from the 64,000 in 2023, the police told a parliamentary committee in June. That is partly because this crime is both “very lucrative” and “lower risk” than car theft or drug dealing, Cmdr. Andrew Featherstone, the police officer leading the effort to tackle phone theft, told a news conference. Thieves can make up to £300 (about $400) per device — more than triple the national minimum wage for a day’s work. And they know they are unlikely to be caught. Police data shows about 106,000 phones were reported stolen in London from March 2024 to February 2025. Only 495 people were charged or were given a police caution, meaning they admitted to an offense. Of course, many other large cities, including New York, face phone theft. The police in London argue that varying crime recording practices make it impossible to identify where in the world the problem is worst. But many experts blame a specifically British issue: the impact of years of austerity imposed by Conservative-led governments in the 2010s, which led to cuts in the number of police officers and their budgets. In 2017, the Met said it would stop investigating low-level crimes where it judged there was little prospect of catching the culprits, so it could prioritize tackling serious violence and sexual offenses. Emmeline Taylor, a professor of criminology at City St. George’s, University of London, said in an interview that the police “became more of a reactive force,” adding, “Low-level career criminals realized that they were getting away with the crimes they were committing.” Then, a technological advance arrived that made their work even easier: electric bikes. Lime bikes, which can be rented and dropped off anywhere, launched in London in 2018. They exploded in popularity. Before long, e-bikes were the getaway vehicles of choice for phone thieves. Sgt. Matt Chantry, one of the leaders of the raid last month, said in an interview that thieves on e-bikes were “a real problem.” They mount sidewalks and swipe phones from people’s hands at high speed, he said, while making themselves “unidentifiable” by wearing balaclavas and hoods. “How do you police that?” he asked. Attempting to chase them on London’s sometimes gridlocked streets is “high-risk,” he said, endangering pedestrians, other drivers and the offender. Ultimately, he said, the police had to ask, is the risk of a fatality worth it for a cellphone? Lost and Found: 4,000 iPhones The raid on the three secondhand shops in north London last month paid off, with the police recovering £40,000 and five stolen phones. Those handsets will join around 4,000 other stolen iPhones recovered by the police since December, currently held in a storeroom in Putney, southwest London, as officers try to contact their owners. In the longer term, Commander Featherstone said, the police want to dismantle the criminal networks driving the illicit trade and “disincentivize criminals from wanting to steal phones” by making it clear they can be caught. But the police are also hoping users will become more savvy about their personal security. Even as smartphones have become more advanced and valuable, many people’s handling of them has become less protective. For the modern phone thief, a classic mark is a pedestrian walking close to the curb, deeply absorbed by the content on a cell screen — a map, a text, a video. “You wouldn’t count your money on the street,” said Lawrence Sherman, an emeritus criminology professor at the University of Cambridge. “But when the phone is worth £1,000, it’s like pulling £1,000 out of your wallet and looking at it as you walk.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/europe/london-police-phone-theft-china-gang.html,World,BBC,By Lizzie Dearden and Amelia Nierenberg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16uk-phone-theft-01-vcmf/16uk-phone-theft-01-vcmf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T04:01:08+00:00,4a2afef45b54e354136ea5ed01bf39cae01aabc2
08f3dd5c9c85,"Raila Odinga, Champion of Kenyan Democracy and Former Prime Minister, Dies at 80","raila odinga, william ruto, kenya, politics, obituary","Raila Odinga, a towering figure in Kenyan politics who served as prime minister and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency five times, died on Wednesday while on a trip to India. He was 80. The Devamatha Hospital in Kerala, in southern India, said in a statement that Mr. Odinga died there after he collapsed during a morning walk. Mr. Odinga played a pivotal role in championing multiparty democracy in the 1990s, after multiple spells in detention without trial. He was a leader both inside and outside government, alternately holding ministerial posts and acting as an opposition figurehead for decades. As tributes from African leaders poured in, President William Ruto of Kenya announced the death in a televised address and declared seven days of national mourning as well as a state funeral. He described Mr. Odinga as a “colossus of Kenya’s modern politics, an indomitable warrior in our struggle for freedom and prosperity.” “In his passing, we have lost a patriot of uncommon courage,” he said, calling Mr. Odinga a pan-Africanist “who offered a compelling model of principled politics.” Mr. Odinga’s death leaves a void in Kenyan politics, given his role as the principal challenger to successive governments. In the short term, it could strengthen the hand of Mr. Ruto, Mr. Odinga’s one-time political nemesis, who faces re-election in 2027. He was first treated at an ayurvedic hospital for treatment five days earlier, a local police official said. On Wednesday, doctors performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation there before Mr. Odinga was transferred to Devamatha, where he was pronounced dead about two hours later, the hospital said. Mr. Odinga had been suffering from diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, the hospital added. A post-mortem examination was being conducted. “He was by far the most consequential political actor in Kenya over the last 30 years,” said John Githongo, a prominent anticorruption campaigner who supported Mr. Odinga’s 2022 election bid. “For a long time, Raila was the center of gravity in Kenya’s particular brand of often brutal elite politics.” His death is likely to bring “major realignments with quite a bit of head-spinning developments” in Kenyan politics, Mr. Githongo added. Thousands of people poured onto the streets in Kisumu, the city in western Kenya that was Mr. Odinga’s political stronghold and home to many members of his Luo ethnic group. Some waved tree branches as a sign of mourning, while others blew whistles or honked car and motorbike horns. “The death of Raila is the death of a hero,” said Jacob Otieno Akach, 75, who lives in the city. “His work toward development and democracy is evident and shall live beyond him.” Mr. Odinga was regularly referred to by his first name, and in later years he also became known as “Baba,” which means father in Kiswahili. In a statement , Mr. Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement party called him “a true giant of the nation.” A delegation led by the party’s secretary general, Senator Edwin Sifuna, was traveling to India to retrieve Mr. Odinga’s body. Speaking from the airport in Nairobi, Mr. Sifuna said it was “too early” to consider who might succeed Mr. Odinga as party leader. Mr. Odinga’s career tracked the twists of Kenya’s transition from autocratic and, for several years, single-party rule into one of Africa’s leading democracies. Born in western Kenya, he was a scion of one of the country’s most important political families. His father, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga , was a leading figure in the struggle for independence from Britain and served as vice president under Kenya’s founding leader, Jomo Kenyatta. In the early part of his career, Mr. Odinga cultivated a reputation as an anti-establishment politician, in part through his willingness to defy the police and lead mass demonstrations and also because of his popularity in the poorest parts of Nairobi. He played a leading role in a campaign for a new Kenyan constitution that was adopted in 2010. Mr. Odinga’s determination to become president made him a pillar of national politics. His failed attempts to achieve that goal frustrated progressives who sought to reform the country’s democratic institutions amid sometimes violent elections and the stubborn grip of ethnic considerations on national politics. But his reputation as an opposition firebrand was tempered in recent years by compromises with those in power, most notably a deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018, known as “the handshake.” That ushered in a period of political cohabitation that effectively neutered the opposition. The terms of “the handshake” were never made public. But critics said Mr. Odinga had put his ambition before his principals. In 2022, Mr. Kenyatta backed Mr. Odinga to succeed him. But Mr. Odinga lost his fifth presidential bid in an election that Mr. Ruto eventually won. Mr. Odinga’s early political outlook was influenced by a spell in Eastern Europe. In the 1960s, he won a scholarship to study in communist East Germany, which cultivated ties with many African nations through education. Mr. Odinga named his first son Fidel, after the Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Following a failed coup attempt in 1982 against President Daniel arap Moi, Mr. Odinga was arrested and charged with treason. He was beaten while in custody and spent six years in detention without trial. After his release, he helped lead protests that spurred a return to multiparty democracy in Kenya. The country joined other African states that were turning their backs on single-party rule after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Kenya’s first multiparty election was held in 1992, and Mr. Odinga’s father ran and lost. Mr. Odinga himself first ran for president five years later and came in third, behind Mr. Moi. He finally gained political power when he became prime minister in April 2008 , under a deal that helped bring calm after post-election violence killed more than 1,000 people . Mr. Odinga was the main challenger in the 2007 election but the incumbent, Mwai Kibaki, was declared the winner in a contest that many viewed as rigged. Mr. Odinga’s decision to enter government enabled Mr. Kibaki to retain the presidency, a fact that was galling to many supporters of the opposition leader. Mr. Odinga was prime minister for five years and ran for president again in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Each time he lost and declared that the result had been rigged. In 2017, Kenya’s Supreme Court ordered the election to be rerun , saying it had failed to meet democratic standards. Mr. Odinga lost again, but the court decision was hailed as a landmark and a validation of his criticisms. In his later years, Mr. Odinga came to be viewed by many Kenyan progressives as part of the elite. Few of the Gen-Z protesters that have electrified Kenya since last year with calls for wholesale reform have cited Mr. Odinga as their champion. For all that, Mr. Odinga’s prominence over successive decades helped him gain stature across Africa, a continent where political longevity commands respect. Backed by Mr. Ruto, Mr. Odinga bid this year to become chairman of the African Union, a leadership election he hoped to finally win. But in a vote in February, he was defeated by the foreign minister of Djibouti, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf. Among those offering condolences on Wednesday was President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, who called Mr. Odinga a “patriotic and selfless leader.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India called Mr. Odinga “a towering statesman and a cherished friend of India” in a statement posted on social media. Mr. Modi said Mr. Odinga had admired “the traditional medicine systems of India” since one of his daughters, Rosemary, traveled to the same ayurvedic hospital in Kerala for treatment. Mr. Odinga is survived by his wife, Ida, and three children. His eldest son, Fidel, died in 2015.

3b8f4b9e9cd9,Putin Welcomes the New Syrian Leader While Still Harboring the Old One,"international relations, ahmed al-shara, vladimir putin, bashar al-assad, russia, syria","President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia welcomed President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria for talks at the Kremlin on Wednesday, a remarkable scene in a country that is harboring the new Syrian leader’s toppled predecessor and enemy, Bashar al-Assad. The meeting demonstrated a clear desire by both the Russian and Syrian leaders to open a new chapter in relations between Moscow and Damascus. During Syria’s 13-year civil war, Mr. Putin backed Mr. al-Assad but ultimately failed to prop him up when Mr. al-Shara’s rebel forces stormed Damascus in December. For Mr. al-Shara, a former Qaeda operative who for years led his rebel forces under brutal Russian airstrikes in Syria, the meeting marked a clear victory. Despite having backed Mr. al-Assad in the war, Mr. Putin welcomed Mr. al-Shara in a gilded Kremlin hall, a calculated gesture as Moscow looks to retain its longstanding military bases in Syria. The summit also demonstrated Mr. Putin’s agility as a geopolitical tactician and his willingness to shift messaging drastically to suit Russia’s interests. Mr. Putin, like American leaders, for years denounced Mr. al-Shara’s rebel faction as a terrorist group. But in opening remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Putin elided that history and underscored decades of friendly relations between Moscow and Damascus, dating back to 1944. “During this time, relations between Syria and Russia have always been exclusively friendly,” Mr. Putin said. “We in Russia have never had any relations with Syria that were tied to our political circumstances or special interests. Throughout these decades, we have always been guided by one thing: the interests of the Syrian people.” Mr. al-Shara thanked the Russian leader for welcoming him to Moscow and expressed an openness to reboot relations between their nations.

b8551f0e1f7a,Afghanistan and Pakistan Announce Cease-Fire After a Week of Deadly Clashes,"war;armed conflicts, terrorism, international relations, afghanistan, pakistan","Afghanistan and Pakistan announced a cease-fire between their militaries on Wednesday, in a bid to defuse tensions after a week of incendiary rhetoric and deadly clashes along their border threatened to spill into a broader conflict. The cease-fire, announced by both governments, took effect hours after at least 12 Afghan people were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in fighting near the two main border crossings between the two countries. In a statement, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said both sides would respect a 48-hour cease-fire and favor dialogue. Afghanistan also “instructed all its forces to observe the cease-fire,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Afghan government, said in a similar statement. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have dropped in recent weeks to their lowest point since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. On Sunday, Afghan forces attacked Pakistani military outposts along the border in what they said was retaliation for airstrikes in Afghanistan last week that Kabul has blamed on Pakistan. Both sides claimed dozens of casualties; they stopped fighting after Qatar and Saudi Arabia urged restraint. But border crossings have since remained closed, and in the early hours of Wednesday fighting erupted again near the two main border crossings between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both sides accused each other of attacking first. Mr. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said a Pakistani attack that included artillery had killed 12 people and wounded 100 others. Pakistan’s military said it had responded to an Afghan attack. The fighting took place in the Spin Boldak border area of southern Afghanistan and central Pakistan, according to Pakistani and Afghan officials, and near the Torkham border crossing, hundreds of miles north. Residents on the Afghan side of the border in Spin Boldak said in telephone interviews that explosions and the sound of heavy artillery had woken them in the middle of the night. The fighting later reached the area’s border crossing point and a market, sending residents fleeing to nearby Kandahar, one of Afghanistan’s largest cities and the residence of the country’s leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada. Noorullah Khatab, a construction engineer in Spin Boldak, said he had heard explosions around 3 a.m. and had rushed back to his home in Kandahar later in the morning, when he saw dozens of ambulances transporting the wounded from the border to the city. “The firing continued until morning,” he said. “I couldn’t sleep at all.” The Pakistani military also accused Afghan forces of attacking Pakistani border posts near the Torkham border crossing, in the northern Pakistani region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. But a spokesman for the governor’s office of Khost Province in Afghanistan, on the other side of the border, accused Pakistani forces of opening fire in the early hours of Wednesday. The spokesman, Mustaghfir Gurbaz, accused Pakistani forces of killing a journalist and injuring another from Afghanistan’s public broadcaster hours after the fighting stopped. The fighting on Wednesday further escalated tensions that began last week when at least two explosions rocked Kabul’s downtown and an airstrike hit a market near the border, according to Afghan officials who accused Pakistan of violating Afghanistan’s sovereignty and striking at the border. Pakistan has neither publicly confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attacks. A Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t allowed to discuss the ongoing tensions publicly, said on Wednesday that Pakistan had carried out strikes in the provinces of Kandahar and Kabul against Afghanistan’s military and the leaders of an armed group fighting in Pakistan’s Balochistan Province. The Afghan army attacked Pakistani border posts on Saturday, killing at least 23 soldiers and injuring 29 others, according to the Pakistani military. The Taliban government, which said it had carried out the attacks in response to the strikes days earlier, said nine Afghan soldiers had died and at least 16 others had been injured. Pakistan has accused the Taliban government of harboring militant groups that have killed hundreds of Pakistani security forces in recent years. Afghanistan has denied the accusations, even as many analysts, including independent United Nations experts, have pointed out that the banned group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the T.T.P. or Pakistani Taliban , has received financial support from the Afghan government, and that its militants have trained freely in Afghanistan.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/asia/clashes-afghanistan-pakistan.html,World,BBC,By Yaqoob Akbary and Safiullah Padshah,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15afgaistan-pakistan-clashes-01-hktc/15afgaistan-pakistan-clashes-01-hktc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T13:19:53+00:00,f0563664efd084bf3eed5cf57812ebb23a0a13b9

Soon he was whisked into a van with other political prisoners at the central K.G.B. prison in Minsk, the capital. They were ordered not to look out the windows as the vehicle sped down a highway, past the well-kept pastures of northwestern Belarus and across the border into Lithuania. Suddenly, the van stopped by the side of the road. The doors flung open, and a man addressed them. “Hi, I am John Coale,” the man said, according to Mr. Dziadok. “President Trump sent me to free you all.” Mr. Coale, a Trump administration envoy, had helped broker the release of 52 Belarusian political prisoners. His appearance in the country last month was the latest chapter in the United States’ unlikely rapprochement with Belarus, an autocratic Eastern European country that is a client state of Russia, which sees itself as fighting a war against the West . Ties between the United States and Belarus have been in a deep freeze for years because of Belarus’s political repression and its assistance in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There is no public indication that the administration is pushing Belarus to change course on either of these issues, and analysts say it is unclear what the United States hopes to get out of the thaw. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment. Mikola Dziadok was freed last month after spending a total of almost 10 years in prison for his antigovernment activity. Credit...

13cf93843979,China Got Trump’s Attention but Renewed a Risky Game of Chicken,"international relations, us foreign policy, embargoes sanctions, asia-pacific economic cooperation, commerce department, communist party of china, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us","China’s decision to tighten export controls on rare earth metals was not only about strengthening its grip on the world’s supply of the crucial minerals. It was also a high-stakes ploy to jolt President Trump into paying attention to what Beijing felt were attempts by his subordinates to sabotage a U.S.-China détente, analysts say. Evidently, it worked: Mr. Trump has redirected his focus toward trade with China. But China’s move also unnerved governments and businesses in Europe , and sparked another round of tit-for-tat trade blows, rattling stock markets. Days after Mr. Trump said he would impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods next month, China added five American subsidiaries of a South Korean shipping company to its sanctions list. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil. By Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the U.S. government would counter Chinese economic measures by exerting more control over private American businesses in key strategic sectors. The escalating tensions threaten to wipe out any progress the two sides have made in the past five months to roll back punitive measures they had taken against each other. They also raise the question of whether Beijing pushed its strategy too far by making clear that China will use the minerals as a geopolitical weapon. China was reacting to a Sept. 29 decision by the U.S. Department of Commerce to expand the number of companies, including potentially Chinese ones, blacklisted from acquiring American technology. That move surprised Beijing, which thought the countries had reached a truce in their trade war after four rounds of negotiations and a Sept. 19 phone call between Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, and Mr. Trump, Chinese analysts said. Flexing China’s control over rare earths — akin to poking Mr. Trump in the eye — may also have been intended by Mr. Xi to demonstrate his strength to a domestic audience before a crucial meeting of Communist Party leaders next week. “If you are the leader and you just had a phone conversation” with the U.S. president, “and then 10 days later, they slapped you on your face, what would you do ahead of a major political event?” said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. Chinese state media have hailed rare earths as the ultimate weapon in trade negotiations with the United States, with one television commentator saying the restrictions dealt a “fatal blow.” Analysts who have spoken to Chinese officials said that Beijing believed that the Commerce Department move — which would target thousands of Chinese companies — was the work of hawkish members of the Trump administration. The sense in Beijing was that Mr. Trump, who was focused on Gaza peace talks and the U.S. government shutdown, needed to be made aware of the consequences of these moves. “By launching a very strong counterattack on the U.S. side, Beijing is reminding Donald Trump that you have to take a hands-on approach to relations with China” and not let “hawkish people” derail relations between the two countries, Prof. Wu said. Beijing was particularly aggrieved because it felt it had shown good will to the Trump administration by agreeing to allow the sale of TikTok , the analysts said. The question now is whether Beijing’s gambit will succeed in getting the Trump administration to back down, or if it results in a full-blown trade war that could lead to a global slowdown. Already, it has led to a broader backlash, with the European Union trade commissioner accusing China of weaponizing its hold on the minerals and urging the European bloc to coordinate with Group of 7 nations to push back against the restrictions. “The Chinese miscalculated,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington, who is currently visiting Beijing. “People around the world saw the rules and were shocked and considered it an overreaction.” For China, threatening to cut off access to its rare earth minerals has been its ace card against the United States. Beijing controls most of the world’s supply of those metals, which are needed for virtually every modern-day technology , including semiconductors, robots and jets. Earlier this year, the same tactic helped persuade the Trump administration to suspend its threat to impose sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods. But this time, China went a step further. It extended its controls extraterritorially, meaning that exporters anywhere in the world would have to apply for a license to sell products with even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths. It is probably not a coincidence that China is taking such an assertive posture ahead of a Communist Party meeting to lay out the blueprint for the country’s plan for the coming five years. Chinese leaders typically want to project stability and strength during the meetings to burnish their legitimacy, analysts say. “You have to respond strongly so that you can — I wouldn’t say save face — but you have to consolidate your political position and show to a domestic audience that you are strong enough to protect China’s national interests in the face of the provocation,” Prof. Wu added. With tensions heating up again, it is unclear if Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi will meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month, as had been anticipated. Both sides continued to up the ante in the past week. They began charging higher port entry fees for each other’s shipping firms. The Chinese government blacklisted five American subsidiaries of the South Korean shipping company Hanwha, accusing the subsidiaries of “supporting and assisting” the United States in its moves in the shipbuilding industry. Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that Beijing was harming American soybean farmers. He threatened to restrict more trade with China, including by boycotting Chinese cooking oil. U.S. analysts say that the Chinese Ministry of Commerce appeared to be aware that it may have overreached, as the ministry sought to reassure the world that the new controls would not be used widely and did not represent a blanket ban, even as it vowed to fight back against any tariffs. China was overly confident that it could get Washington to walk back its latest sanctions and, at the same time, avert any global blowback, analysts said. But China can ill afford more trade tensions on top of its existing troubles with the United States. Exports are among the few engines of growth for a Chinese economy suffering from a prolonged property crisis and a deflationary spiral, caused by overproduction in key industries and falling prices. Evan S. Medeiros, a professor of Asian studies at Georgetown University who was an Asia adviser to President Barack Obama, said China could have pushed back without threatening economic coercion against its geopolitical rivals. “This is a hell of a way to get Trump’s attention,” Prof. Medeiros said. “You get somebody’s attention by waving your hands in the air, not by arming yourself to the teeth and just promising you’re not going to use a 50-caliber machine gun on them.” The new rare earths export controls, which are modeled after U.S. export controls, were likely developed well in advance of their unveiling, experts said. Some analysts say that suggests Beijing was merely looking for a pretext — like the new Commerce Department rules — to deploy the new measures. “Xi fundamentally doesn’t want to give the U.S. rare earths, or really any ‘strategic materials’ it has,” said Kirsten Asdal, head of the China-focused consultancy firm Asdal Advisory. “The party has articulated that the country that controls the upstream inputs will enjoy the ability to develop the most advanced technology and keep it from others.” Lily Kuo contributed reporting from Taipei, Taiwan, and Berry Wang from Hong Kong.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/asia/china-trump-tariffs.html,World,BBC,By David Pierson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15int-china-us-analysis-btqc/15int-china-us-analysis-btqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T15:12:42+00:00,05c55b6a799826ed405e06a47515369cfc63c107

About 80 people came to this pre-Rosh Hashanah gathering last month of Café Centropa, an outgrowth of Mr. Serotta’s singular project and achievement: Centropa , the nonprofit he built to document vanished Jewish life in Central and Eastern Europe. With the help of dozens of researchers and his countless trips to the region, Mr. Serotta and Centropa created a digital archive of 1,230 interviews conducted in 20 European countries, totaling some 45,000 pages of testimony. The archive includes more than 25,000 photographs. “And every one of them comes with a story,” Mr. Serotta said. “The Holocaust is mankind’s single greatest crime, and while there are witnesses to it, those stories should be told and recorded.

fad10b5b8c84,"A Major Automaker, in a Nod to Trump, Shifts Production From Canada to the U.S.","tariff, cars, manufacturing, jobs, us foreign policy, stellantis, unifor, mark carney, antonio filosa, doug jr ford, donald trump, brampton, ontario, canada, ontario, us","Stellantis, the giant automaker, is abandoning plans to reopen a factory in Canada and is shifting production to the United States, a move that deals a blow to a key Canadian industry and reflects the fallout from President Trump’s tariff policy. The decision is part of a $13 billion, four-year investment announced by Stellantis on Tuesday to significantly ramp up production in the United States. Antonio Filosa, Stellantis’s chief executive, said the plans follow “very productive talks with the Trump administration” and described the deal as the largest investment in the company’s 100-year history in the United States. Stellantis had been planning to produce its Jeep Compass vehicle at a plant in Brampton, Ontario, west of Toronto. The company closed the factory in 2023 and laid off its roughly 3,000 workers as it retooled the facility, but now the fate of those employees is unclear. Stellantis, which owns more than a dozen brands, said it would instead make the vehicle at a plant in Illinois that had also been idle since 2023, creating 5,000 new jobs. Mr. Trump, who has imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canadian autos, has said he wants to move vehicle production back to the United States to help revive manufacturing and provide more jobs for Americans. The tariffs he applied would likely make it too expensive to produce cars in Canada, Mr. Trump said during a meeting in May with Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada. “We don’t really want cars from Canada.” Stellantis’s decision underscores the challenge Canada faces because — unlike other countries — it has been unable to negotiate a trade deal with the Trump administration and tariffs can inflict heavy damage on an economy that dependent on exports to the United States. Mr. Carney said the move by Stellantis was “a direct consequence of current U.S. tariffs.” He said his government was “focused on what we can control,” pointing to recent economic relief strategies, including a 5 billion Canadian dollar, or $3.6 billion, emergency fund for industries hardest hit by tariffs. Canadian officials have tried to make the case to U.S. officials that the auto industries in both countries are deeply integrated, with parts moving back and forth across the border multiple times as part of the assembly of vehicles. Dominic LeBlanc, the minister managing relations with the Trump administration, is in Washington this week to continue trade talks. The levies are also adversely affecting other automakers. In May, Honda announced that it would move the manufacturing of its CR-V sport utility vehicle to the United States from Alliston, Ontario, and postpone plans for electric vehicle and battery production. General Motors has also stopped the production of electric delivery vehicles in Ingersoll, Ontario, and cut a shift at a plant that produces pickup trucks in Oshawa, Ontario. “Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Lana Payne, the president of Unifor, the union that represents autoworkers, said in a statement. In 2022, the federal and Ontario governments allocated 1 billion Canadian dollars, or $712 million, to help Stellantis upgrade its plants, including its Brampton facility. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, who has become one of Canada’s staunchest defenders against Mr. Trump , said his government has not released any financing to Stellantis for the Brampton plant. “Stellantis has a duty to live up to their promise to Brampton autoworkers,” Mr. Ford said in a statement. After the Brampton factory shut down in 2023, Stellantis officials at the time promised that it would reopen and the company would fulfill its commitments to the community. Another union official said it would fight to ensure the company honors that promise. Flavio Volpe, the president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, a trade group, accused Stellantis of bending to Mr. Trump’s will. It is imperative for Canada, Mr. Volpe said, to respond to the company’s decision and “to hold them accountable, to get a new product in that plant, to not let them off the hook and feel bad for them because they got bullied by the White House.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/canada/stellantis-auto-production-canada-us-trump-tariffs.html,World,BBC,By Vjosa Isai,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/15int-canada-stellantis/05canada-tariffs-pbtv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:09:09+00:00,879257bc26ab6989f5d437bd29c21617ffd1a38b
a6e624dd1d20,Iran Sentences 2 French Citizens to Prison on Spying Charges,"iran, france, political prisoner, international relations, jean-noël barrot, tehran, europe","A court in Iran has convicted two French citizens of spying and given them heavy prison sentences, Iranian authorities said on Tuesday, in a case that has been a longstanding source of tensions between France and Iran. The Fars news agency, which is affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, identified the two defendants as Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, who have been held in Iran since 2022 on charges that France has called baseless. The Mizan news agency, which is overseen by Iran’s judiciary, announced the convictions, although it did not name the defendants. They were found guilty of spying for French intelligence services, conspiring to undermine Iran’s national security and cooperating with Israeli intelligence services, the news agency reported. One was sentenced to a total of 32 years in prison, and the other to a total of 11 years in prison and 20 years in exile, according to Mizan, although it was not immediately clear what that entailed. The news agency reported that their detention periods would be “deducted from the final sentence,” suggesting the sentences would run concurrently, not consecutively. The verdict can be appealed to Iran’s Supreme Court within 20 days. France’s foreign ministry declined to comment on Wednesday. But the detention of Ms. Kohler and Mr. Paris has become a major sticking point in relations between Iran and France, which has repeatedly and strenuously called the charges against them baseless. Iran has used the detention of foreign and dual citizens as a tool of its foreign policy for nearly five decades . Britain, France, the United States and others have accused Iran of detaining people to use them as diplomatic bargaining chips to press for the release of Iranian prisoners abroad or to free frozen funds. Ms. Kohler, 41, a literature professor, and her partner, Mr. Paris, a retired professor in his 70s, were visiting Iran as tourists in 2022 when they were arrested. They were detained in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison , where dissidents and political prisoners are held. French authorities have likened the conditions Ms. Kohler and Mr. Paris face in Evin to “torture,” saying they are in near total isolation and have almost no access to consular visits. The convictions raised the possibility that Iran could now be ready to swap or release Ms. Kohler and Mr. Paris, who are the only French citizens remaining in Iranian custody. Other French citizens arrested in Iran on similar charges have often been released once their court cases have ended. Last week, an 18-year-old French-German cyclist who had been arrested in Iran in June on spying charges was released and returned to Europe shortly after his acquittal. Jean-Noël Barrot, France’s foreign minister, said last week of Ms. Kohler and Mr. Paris that “we have strong prospects of bringing them home in the coming weeks.” “We remain fully mobilized and demand their immediate and unconditional release,” Mr. Barrot told France Inter radio . Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, suggested last month that Ms. Kohler and Mr. Paris could be exchanged for Mahdieh Esfandiari, an Iranian woman living in the French city of Lyon who was arrested this year and accused of promoting and glorifying acts of terrorism online . Iran has called her detention arbitrary. “A lot of work has been done in this regard, and now we have reached a point where the issue of her exchange with French prisoners in Iran is nearing its final stages,” Mr. Araghchi said at the time in a televised interview. But Asghar Jahangir, a spokesman for the Iranian judiciary, said this week that Ms. Esfandiari’s case and that of Ms. Kohler and Mr. Paris were “two separate issues,” making it unclear whether a prisoner exchange was possible. France’s foreign ministry, citing the ongoing legal proceedings against Ms. Esfandiari, has declined to comment on her case. She is expected to stand trial in January.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/europe/iran-france-spying-charges.html,World,BBC,By Aurelien Breeden and Leily Nikounazar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/world/15int-france-iran/15int-france-iran-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:12:20.169000+00:00,593cf5d852bc4bd020bbfb01a77a205d90d0cf9a
a8c618e5942f,L.A. County Declares State of Emergency Over Immigration Raids,"emergency response and preparedness, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, federalism, immigration, us states, los angeles county","Los Angeles County voted on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over federal immigration raids, the latest move by the county to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Southern California. The emergency declaration, traditionally used in response to events like natural disasters, would allow the county to provide resources for those who have been affected by the raids. County officials say the move will provide help for those who have refrained from going to work for fear of being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or who lose their income after family members are detained. The declaration, which was passed in a 4-to-1 vote by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, also gives officials the ability to vote later to impose an eviction moratorium and other protections for tenants who might have fallen behind on rent payments because of the raids. In justifying the declaration, county officials argued that federal immigration sweeps, in which thousands of people have been detained by heavily armed and masked immigration officials, have produced a climate of fear. “We have residents afraid to leave their homes,” said Janice Hahn, a board member who voted in favor of the declaration. “We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers were taken from their workplaces and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on the table.” Last month, county officials approved around $30 million in rental relief assistance for residents who were affected by wildfires or federal immigration raids. The county plans to begin accepting applications for that relief in December. The board did not provide an estimate for how many residents have been affected by immigration raids or how many might apply for relief. County lawyers have warned that the emergency declaration could create issues for landlords and tenants, as well as invite litigation from the Trump administration. They said the declaration could lead to significant income loss for landlords and expose tenants to lawsuits from landlords seeking to recover debts. It could also prompt tenants to publicly disclose their immigration status, the lawyers said, inviting enforcement action from the federal government. Kathryn Barger, the member of the board of supervisors who voted against the declaration, argued that the raids did not meet the criteria for an emergency. “Emergency powers exist for crises that pose life and death consequences like wildfires — not as a shortcut for complex policy issues,” she wrote in a statement provided to the news media after the vote. “Stretching emergency powers for federal immigration actions undermines their purpose, invites legal challenges, and circumvents the public process.” Los Angeles County — home to 10 million people and the country’s largest population of undocumented immigrants — became the primary battleground this summer in the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration. A spike in immigration arrests led to protests, and the federal government responded by deploying National Guard troops and Marines to the region. Local and state officials have sought to push back, banning federal officials from wearing masks in the state, filing lawsuits over the deployment of troops and challenging the tactics used by ICE . In July, a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from making indiscriminate immigration arrests in the county, and a sense of normalcy returned to Los Angeles. But last month, the Supreme Court overturned the order, reinstating fear among immigrants there.

12feeb6facf9,"South Korea Targets Cambodia’s Scam Industry After Kidnappings, Torture and a Death","fraud, kidnapping and hostages, murders and homicides, missing person, organized crime, cambodia, south korea","South Korean officials said Wednesday that they were trying to bring back missing South Koreans from Cambodia, where hundreds of people have disappeared into online scam centers that steal billions of dollars from victims worldwide. Outrage in South Korea has grown after 330 people were reported missing after traveling to Cambodia this year, including a 22-year-old university student who was later found dead. Others have been tortured and confined by those running the scams, South Korean officials said. The victims were lured by high-paying job offers, only to be forced to defraud other South Koreans, officials said. Most of those reported to have disappeared have since been accounted for, but 79 were still missing in Cambodia, Wi Sung-lac, South Korea’s national security director, said at a news conference on Wednesday. He added that the government would also try to repatriate about 60 people who had been detained by the Cambodian authorities. South Korea is the latest nation to try to combat Cambodia’s scam industry. In February, China led a crackdown on scam compounds in Myanmar and Cambodia. On Tuesday, the United States and Britain imposed sanctions on parts of a Cambodian conglomerate, Prince Group, which they said was running scam networks worldwide. U.S. federal prosecutors indicted its chairman, Chen Zhi, and seized $15 billion in cryptocurrency that they said were proceeds from his fraud and money laundering schemes. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said that, starting Thursday, it was barring South Koreans from traveling to parts of Cambodia where scams and human confinements were rife. Some Southeast Asian countries, like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, have become hotbeds for online fraud. Scammers based in the region stole at least $10 billion from victims in the United States last year, the Treasury Department said. South Korean nationals were defrauded of about $148 million in 2023, according to a report last year by the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime. Criminal groups traffic people to porous border regions of Southeast Asian countries, often through false job advertisements, to carry out scams in their native language. People from China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and Africa make up the majority of those trafficked to scam compounds, but some South Koreans are also lured by promises of high pay. About 200,000 people of various nationalities are involved in Cambodia’s scam industry, Mr. Wi said. He said that about 1,000 were believed to be South Korean. Advertisements targeting South Koreans on online job boards and Telegram, the online messaging app, seen by The New York Times promised weekly payments of at least 5 million won (around $3,500), more than the average worker in South Korea makes in a month. Organized crime groups from South Korea run scam operations in Cambodia that are smaller in scale than the thousand-strong compounds owned by Chinese syndicates, said Jeremy Douglas, the chief of staff and strategy at the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime. Smaller rings run by young Koreans in their 20s and 30s are also operated in Cambodia, Mr. Douglas said. Mr. Wi said that some South Koreans traveled to Cambodia intending to be involved in illegal activities, and that some willingly returned to Cambodia after coming home. He added that the South Korean government would work to prevent people from seeking high-paying jobs in Cambodia. Park Chan-dae, a South Korean lawmaker, said in a public hearing on Monday that some of those kidnapped had endured harsh treatment. “Some were forced to take drugs, sexually assaulted and subjected to medical exams for the purpose of organ trafficking,” he said. “Every minute and every second was a matter of life and death.” They were able to escape or reach their families through Telegram, leading to their repatriation, he said. Lee Jeong-sook, the president of the Korean Rescue Organization, a nonprofit that has helped extract South Koreans from Cambodia, said in a news conference on Wednesday that the people running the crime operations would confine those who refused to work, as well as beating them, torturing them, or extorting funds from their families. Park Minho, the 22-year-old university student, died of a heart attack caused by “severe torture,” the Cambodian government said in a statement on Tuesday. The statement said that his body had been found in August in a Ford pickup truck, and that he had been living in a building that the authorities later identified as a base for a scam operation. Three Chinese people and two others have been charged in connection to Mr. Park’s death and running scam operations, the Cambodian government said, adding that it was working with South Korean officials to locate other accomplices. After its crackdown in February, China repatriated hundreds of people freed from scam centers in Myanmar, where they were forced by Chinese criminals to engage in investment and cryptocurrency fraud, online dating cons and other schemes. While Chinese syndicates are still the main players in the scam industry, Mr. Douglas said, the recent lull created an opportunity for Japanese and Korean criminal actors who were already in the region. “The crackdown by China no doubt created a space for others and played a role in the diversification, but it was already happening,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/asia/cambodia-south-korea-scams.html,World,BBC,By John Yoon and Francesca Regalado,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15xp-scams-hlvj/15xp-scams-hlvj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T11:44:10+00:00,04a02eca3bef6cffa2f4d67db14948a165b4ecb6
657a76cb7917,Trump’s Tariff Fight With China Means Trouble for a Vast Wilderness in Brazil,"climate change;global warming, agriculture, forests, soybeans;soy, regulation and deregulation, international trade, us foreign policy, environment, protectionism, luiz inacio lula da silva, xi jinping, donald trump, amazon rainforest","The humble soybean is in the middle of a geopolitical tangle that spans three continents and threatens to devour the world’s largest tropical savanna. At issue is China’s enormous appetite for soybeans, millions of tons a year, mainly for cooking oil and livestock feed. Sating that demand has taken a grave toll in recent years on the forests and grasslands of Brazil, China’s biggest supplier. That stands to get worse in the coming months, because China has all but stopped buying American soybeans, giving Brazilian farmers greater incentives to expand into new areas to grow soy. Earlier this year, the government in Beijing slapped a hefty tariff on American soybeans in retaliation for hefty U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Until then, America had been China’s second-biggest supplier. But now, farmers in the United States have sold not a single bushel to China from this fall’s harvest. Hopes of a relief package from the White House have been delayed by the government shutdown. Likewise Argentina, whose president, Javier Milei, met with President Trump on Tuesday. Argentina sold a mountain of soybeans to China this year after American farmers were locked out. But no country stands to gain as much as Brazil, the world’s biggest soybean exporter. No surprise then that its powerful farm lobby is pushing to dismantle one of the most important industrywide measures, known as the Soy Moratorium and designed to limit deforestation in Brazil’s most famous biome, the Amazon. All of this is awkward for Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He is hosting the next round of international climate negotiations in November, in the Amazon rainforest city of Belém. His administration has pledged to get deforestation under control. “The government is facing a very difficult situation,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaigner with Greenpeace Brazil, said in an interview. “There is an attack on one of the most important mechanisms for zero deforestation.” Soybeans are Brazil’s biggest agricultural export. Its soy production has steadily risen over the past several decades. But it really accelerated in the past 10 years, as relations soured between Beijing and Washington, and China went looking for soybeans beyond the American Midwest. By 2017, at the start of the first Trump term, Brazil had overtaken the United States as the world’s leading soybean producer. Now, relations between Beijing and Washington have sunk to a new low, and American farmers stand to lose their biggest global customer. For much of the past year, prices have been around $10 a bushel , down from $13 or so at the start of 2024. “We’ve had strong growth in recent years, starting with that first U.S.-China trade war. And now, with the second one,” Lucas Costa Beber, vice president of Aprosoja, the Brazilian Association of Soybean Producers, said this week. “In the long term, if this situation continues, opportunities for Brazil will increase.” The prognosis for Brazil’s biosphere is less rosy. Soy plantations tend to come up on land that had been logged and cleared previously for cattle grazing. Today, soy plantations cover 40 million hectares, about 14 percent of the country’s agricultural land , according to MapBiomas, an independent group that uses satellite data. Most of that is in the Cerrado, a vast region of tropical savanna and forest corridors that is less a global celebrity than the Amazon but still a critical ecosystem for Brazil. In the Cerrado lie the headwaters of the country’s biggest river basins, and it is vital to regulating rainfall patterns and temperatures. Deforestation has declined in the past year, as the administration of Mr. Lula has tightened enforcement. But nearly half of the native vegetation of the Cerrado has vanished, making way for cattle grazing and soy plantations. “The Cerrado is disappearing,” said Luciana Gatti, a climate change researcher at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research. And now, she said, “the pressure to produce soybeans to export to China will be bigger.” In 2023 alone, soy was harvested from more than 460,000 hectares of recently deforested land in the Cerrado, according to Trase , a nonprofit group that tracks deforestation in agricultural supply chains. That is an area bigger than Rhode Island. The Cerrado is not part of the Amazon. Soy-related deforestation hasn’t been eradicated entirely in the Amazon itself, independent researchers say , but it has been slowed significantly by the Soy Moratorium. Under that industry pact, which applies only in the Amazon region, the world’s major commodity traders jointly agreed to not buy or finance soy grown on lands that were deforested after 2008. Partly as a result, in 2023, soy harvest in the Amazon came from 150,000 hectares of recently deforested land, according to Trase figures , a far smaller area than in the Cerrado. Now, pressure is mounting to suspend the Soy Moratorium in the Amazon. In August, Brazil’s national antitrust regulator briefly suspended it while the agency opened an investigation into alleged collusion among traders. A federal court immediately reinstated the moratorium, but its future remains uncertain. The soy producers’ association is leading the charge against the moratorium. Mr. Beber, the group’s vice president, called it a “trade barrier disguised as environmental protection.” He said the moratorium effectively favored other countries by regulating which Brazilian soybeans can be traded on the world market. Mr. Beber said farmers could vastly expand soy production in areas of the Cerrado that are currently pasture lands. “All of those regions have degraded pastureland with potential to be converted into cropland,” he said. “It really just depends on economic and market viability.” The market viability for American soy farmers is murky. Soybeans are the top U.S. agricultural export. The American Soybean Association has said American farmers risk losing their main customer , China, which brought in more than $12.6 billion last year, if the trade dispute continues. Meanwhile, tariffs on China have pushed up the costs of fertilizer and equipment in the United States. Mr. Trump has swung wildly on whether he intends to meet with Mr. Xi at the end of the month at a trade summit in South Korea. If they meet, soybeans are sure to be on the agenda.

0e9df33d852a,Inside Iran’s Museum of American Espionage,"us foreign policy, iran, kidnapping and hostages, iran-israel war, diplomats embassies and consulates, war;armed conflicts, museum, cia, israel, tehran","So we’re here outside the U.S. embassy compound in Tehran. Here we have an apple with the CNN logo. The Twin Towers interspersed with the dollar sign. The Statue of Liberty. This is one of the most photographed walls, probably in all of Tehran. Americans know this as the former U.S. compound. But to Iranians, this is known as the “U.S. Den of Espionage Museum.” And of course, what happened here is at the root of the hostility between the U.S. and Iran for over four decades, a hostility that escalated recently. In June, Israel and the U.S. launched strikes on Iran, resulting in a short but intense war that rattled the capital, killing hundreds. Foreign journalists face restricted access in Iran, but during a recent trip, officials allowed us to visit the former embassy, where much of the current animosity traces back to. On November 4, 1979, Iranian students stormed the embassy, fearing the U.S. planned to restore the Shah, or king, who had been deposed months earlier. They held 52 hostages for a total of 444 days. [Voiceover] “The students had restricted outside contacts with the hostages. So far they’d refused to forward letters to their captors.” “How can you call these hostages? These people are political smugglers.” “I announced a series of economic and political actions.” “We’re beyond the time for gestures. We want our people to be set free.” Six C.I.A. officers were among the hostages, the U.S. government later said, accusing Iran of violating diplomatic conventions. Decades of tensions would follow. “So this was during the hostage crisis?” “After the hostage crisis.” “After the students came in.” Twenty-one-year-old Amir is working here as a guide as part of his compulsory military service. Like many in Iran, where self-censorship is common, he asked us not to use his last name. “Typically, how many people visit this museum every year?” “It’s about 5,000, most of them from Asia. But rarely we have visitors from U.S. and U.K. too.” This is the former U.S. ambassador’s office. It’s been carefully preserved to look largely like it did before the hostage crisis. When it became certain that the students were taking over the embassy, the Americans inside desperately tried to shred as many classified documents as they could. “These are the famous shredding machines probably known to most Americans from the movie Argo, right?” “The students tried to recover some of these documents. It took six years to reassemble the shred papers together. And, after recovery, students classified all these documents as a book.” There’s a particular focus on this part of the museum, which is presented as the C.I.A. station. It’s full of spy equipment. There’s encryption devices, there’s an eavesdropping machine. There’s a secure room just behind me. And for the regime here that is presented as proof that this building wasn’t just used for diplomacy, but was also used to surveil Iranians and, as they see it, to meddle in their affairs. “This is all the material for tapping communications, monitoring communications.” “Yeah, I mean, I got to say, it’s more elaborate than I would have imagined, right? It gives you an insight into what espionage looked almost five decades ago.” The message at the museum was clear for its visitors, including the handful of foreign journalists, like us, who had been allowed in. The Americans were untrustworthy then and shouldn’t be trusted now. Many Iranians told me they viewed the museum as a relic of the distant past, but they were also on high alert since the war in June, and fears that fighting with the United States could start at any moment.

46c1cbd1d38c,Inmates Make Brazen Escape in Guatemala,"guatemala, prison escape, gang, barrio 18, latin america, internal-open-access-from-nl","In a brazen scheme that may have involved escapes during prison visits, 20 inmates accused of being members of a major gang have slipped out of a Guatemalan prison and set off a sweeping manhunt, the authorities say. The escapes took place over a period of time, but were only announced on Sunday, officials said. They came shortly after the American authorities designated the gang , Barrio 18, as a foreign terrorist organization, placing it on the same list as the region’s most notorious cartels. The prison break has set off a nationwide manhunt, with 45,000 police officers taking part. It has also created a crisis for the government, with several prison officials dismissed and intense scrutiny falling on members of the president’s cabinet, though corruption has long plagued Guatemala. Both members of President Bernardo Arévalo’s party and opposition lawmakers have called for an investigation. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala described the escapes as “utterly unacceptable,” and said in a statement on Sunday that the government “must act immediately and forcefully to recapture these terrorists, who pose a threat to both Guatemala and the security of U.S. territory.” Guatemalan officials said they were coordinating with Interpol and the authorities in neighboring countries, “especially Mexico's,” to track down the fugitives, Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez said at a news conference on Monday. The escapees included high-ranking gang leaders, the Guatemalan government said. Only one has been recaptured by so far. “I’m not going to deny the reality — there’s no good explanation,” Mr. Jiménez said. The prisoners escaped from the Fraijanes II prison, a maximum-security facility outside Guatemala City meant for gang members. When exactly they did so remains unclear, the director of the country’s prison system, Luis Alfonso Godínez, said at a news conference on Sunday. For around two months there had been “rumors” of escapes, he said, adding that the inmates had likely slipped out gradually — “one by one or two by two” — and that some may have done so during prison visits. In the past, leaders have had lower-ranking gang members take their place in prison, but officials said that such swaps did not appear to have occurred this time. Security protocols at Fraijanes II were “weak,” Mr. Godínez said. The prison did not have technology to help with prisoner counts or to “confirm that the people incarcerated are the same people that appear in its records,” he said. He also mentioned the possibility that prison employees had been bribed by the gang. The only fugitive to have been rearrested to date was identified as Byron Fajardo Revolorio , who is known as Black Demon. He is serving a 180-year sentence. Mr. Godínez said Sunday that in response to the escapes, facial-recognition and other technology would be used to monitor the prisoner population. The following day, Mr. Jiménez, the interior minister, announced that Mr. Godínez had been removed from his post, though he said he was not suspected of working with Barrio 18. The directors of several prisons had also been dismissed over suspected ties to the gang, he said. Mr. Jiménez also said that all prison directors would have to take polygraph tests. Citing corruption within the prison system, he called on the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Barrio 18 has often been compared with the violent Salvadoran street gang MS-13, and was long active in neighboring El Salvador. There, thousands of Barrio 18 and MS-13 members are being held in the maximum-security facility that El Salvador’s president often showcases online. Mr. Jiménez has said there were some 12,000 gang members and collaborators in Guatemala, with about 3,000 behind bars. The crisis coincides with the transfer last month of the man believed to be the top leader of Barrio 18 in Guatemala, Aldo Dupie Ochoa, who is known as El Lobo, from Fraijanes II to another prison. The transfer prompted prison riots across the country, with gang members calling for his return to Fraijanes II. A judge eventually ordered that the gang leader be sent back. Across Latin America, gang leaders often run their criminal organizations from behind bars, often with the aid of smuggled cellphones and other contraband. To do so, they rely on the widespread corruption among prison employees and government officials. After the Fraijanes II escapes were revealed this week, the interior minister described collaboration between the Guatemalan authorities and the Trump administration to overhaul the prison system, including building a new facility for gang members. “Talks are well underway with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the design and construction of the maximum-security prison,” Mr. Jiménez said. He said the government also had support from the U.S. government to collect biometric data in the prisons and to coordinate training for prison officers. Since President Trump took office, the U.S. government has labeled around a dozen organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, a designation which opens the way for more aggressive action against them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/americas/guatemala-prison-escape.html,World,BBC,By Annie Correal and Jody García,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14int-guatemala-prison-gwtp/14int-guatemala-prison-gwtp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T00:19:29+00:00,c56a96d036f25077023d35e03d5efae3cf3939c9
be896ec31ad7,What Makes a Martyr?,"charlie kirk, politics, right-wing extremism and alt-right, presidential medal of freedom","It’s not just American conservatives who are trying to immortalize Charlie Kirk. His name was a rallying cry at a large far-right gathering in London . His death was the No. 1 topic at a right-wing party conference in Madrid. Even the mayor of Lima, Peru, held a memorial for Kirk , comparing him to martyrs in Rome who helped spread Christianity. In the U.S., Kirk’s consecration as a MAGA saint has been swift. There are proposals to name portions of highways after him and to mint coins with his face on them. Oklahoma is considering a bill that would require all state colleges to build a statue of Kirk. Yesterday, on what would have been his 32nd birthday — and was officially a National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk, thanks to an act of Congress — President Trump held a ceremony to posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Martyrs are potent. Their deaths can be used to infuse a cause with quasi-sacred meaning. They can be used to unite people behind that cause and against an enemy. They can be used to justify violence. There are a number of criteria that experts say make someone a good martyr — and Kirk ticks all the boxes. Three ingredients George Floyd made an effective martyr. Ashli Babbitt less so. If you haven’t heard of Babbitt, it’s because efforts to elevate her after her death never reached the heights many on the right had hoped for. Babbitt died in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. She was killed by a police officer when she tried to breach a door that was one of the last barriers between rioters and members of Congress. Trump and other prominent MAGA figures framed her death as the execution of an “innocent.” There was a burst of Babbitt hashtags and T-shirts in QAnon and far-right circles, where she remains a martyr to this day. But efforts to broaden her appeal beyond that never really bore fruit. Floyd, a Black man, died facedown on the pavement when a white police officer knelt on the back of his neck. “I can’t breathe,” the words he repeatedly uttered in his final moments, became the rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. People across the globe marched in his name. Pilgrims still flock to the site of Floyd’s death outside a convenience store that was renamed after him. Murals of him abound. What accounts for the difference? I asked Tom Holland, a historian who has studied Christian martyrdom, what the most compelling martyrs had in common. He listed three criteria. First: a public, dramatic and ‘innocent’ death. Floyd’s victimhood was never in any serious question. The world watched the video of him taking his last breath. Babbitt’s death split the right. Senior Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham called the Jan. 6 rioters “domestic terrorists.” The House speaker at the time, Kevin McCarthy, said the officer who shot her “did his job.” Second: The death should have a cause linked to it. Martyr means witness in Greek; the early martyrs were witnesses to God. Babbitt and Floyd both had causes linked to their deaths. In Babbitt’s case, it was Stop the Steal; in Floyd’s, it was Black Lives Matter. But they differ again when it comes to Holland’s third piece of criteria. Third: Martyrs need a powerful movement. Movements have the resources to invest these deaths with greater meaning — to tell their stories in a way that galvanizes people. In May 2020, when Floyd died, America’s left was mobilized ahead of that year’s presidential election. By the time Babbitt died, Trump had lost that election and was a few weeks from leaving office. It wasn’t yet clear where MAGA was going. A powerful tool Kirk’s death, Holland noted, can be made to fit all the criteria. He was shot while debating college students. He was already recruiting young voters to the MAGA cause. And he’s being mourned by a movement that’s more powerful than ever. The ripple effects of Kirk’s death have already gone beyond statues and plazas. He’s become a powerful tool. The administration has used his death to crack down on free speech and liberal groups. It has threatened to deport people who trivialize Kirk’s murder and has canceled some foreigners’ visas . While guest-hosting an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show,” the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller declared that the administration was “at war” with the left, and he vowed “to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy” what he called a “vast domestic terror movement.” The government would do this, Miller said, “in Charlie’s name.” Interested in providing feedback on this newsletter?

The military has suspended the Constitution and dissolved all of Madagascar’s major institutions — including the highest court, the electoral commission and the Senate — but left in place the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The demonstrations began in late September over the government’s failure to provide reliable water and electricity but later spread to cover a wide range of grievances. The protesters have drawn inspiration from Gen Z demonstrations that erupted recently in Nepal and Kenya . The situation in Madagascar, an island in southern Africa off the coast of Mozambique, remains unstable. Here’s what we know so far. Why are young people protesting? Thousands of young people have been on the streets in Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, and other major cities since Sept. 25.

4a88cc07c9a6,"Zelensky Revokes Odesa Mayor’s Citizenship, Amid Feud With Local Leaders","russian invasion of ukraine (2022), mayoral races, petro poroshenko, volodymyr zelensky, odessa ukraine, ukraine, citizenship, martial law","President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday revoked the Ukrainian citizenship of the mayor of Odesa, the country’s third-largest city, on the ground that he was a citizen of Russia, according to the country’s security services . The move, which effectively pushes the mayor out of office, marks the most dramatic escalation yet in a feud between the national authorities in Kyiv and local leaders across Ukraine. These local officials say that Mr. Zelensky is using wartime powers to tighten his grip on cities and regions governed by opposition politicians. The Odesa mayor, Hennady Trukhanov, who has been in office since 2014, denied in a statement that he held Russian citizenship and said he would appeal the decision before Ukraine’s Supreme Court. Ukrainian law bars the country’s citizens from holding Russian citizenship. Accusations that Mr. Trukhanov, a former member of a now-banned pro-Russia party, was a citizen of Russia have circulated for years. Ukraine’s security services said in 2016 that they had found no proof. Mr. Trukhanov has also been accused by Ukraine’s anti-corruption authorities of embezzling public money . Mr. Trukhanov has largely restrained his criticism of Mr. Zelensky during the war. But he has opposed certain policies, such as renaming streets and removing statues associated with imperial Russia . Odesa, a city heavily shaped by the Russian Empire, is full of such symbols. Mr. Zelensky’s action against Mr. Trukhanov comes amid rising tensions with mayors of other large cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv. Mr. Zelensky and his allies have accused the local leaders of mismanaging public services and failing to protect their cities from Russian air attacks. The mayors say that efforts to curtail their authority are aimed at concentrating power in Mr. Zelensky’s hands, and weakening his opponents as potential candidates in elections that he says will resume once the war is over. “Our president has been in power for six years, and only now he has suddenly discovered that Mr. Trukhanov allegedly has Russian citizenship,” Oleksii Potapskyi, head of the opposition party European Solidarity in the Odesa City Council, told a local news outlet . “You know, this is more of a political crackdown. It has nothing to do with democracy.” Earlier this year, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, accused Mr. Zelensky of abusing martial law powers to overrule the City Council. Around the same time, Ukraine’s national security council froze the bank accounts of former President Petro O. Poroshenko , whom Mr. Zelensky defeated in 2019 , without leveling any specific accusations. In late September, a petition was launched urging Mr. Zelensky to revoke Mr. Trukhanov’s Ukrainian citizenship. It quickly reached the 25,000 signatures required for the president to consider it. In recent days, Mr. Zelensky had publicly criticized the mayor, saying that efforts to restore power to Odesa and surrounding areas after Russian attacks had failed and that “there have been many mistakes by local authorities.” On Tuesday, Ukraine’s security services published a document resembling a Russian passport that bore Mr. Trukhanov’s name and face. They said that Mr. Trukhanov had received the document on Dec. 15, 2015, and that it was valid for 10 years. While stripping Mr. Trukhanov of his citizenship effectively ousts him from his position, he said he would continue to perform his duties until the City Council dismissed him. The national authorities did not say if they would move to expel Mr. Trukhanov from Ukraine or, if they did so, where he would be sent. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Zelensky, pointing to “security issues” in Odesa that he said had remained unaddressed, announced that he would establish a military administration for the city and would appoint its head shortly. Civil society groups in Ukraine have long raised concerns that the central government uses military administrators to consolidate authority, even on matters unrelated to defense. “Revoking Trukhanov’s citizenship and establishing the Odesa military administration is an open signal to every mayor that everyone is under scrutiny and, when the time comes, they’ll get to each of them,” Oleksii Honcharenko, a lawmaker from Mr. Poroshenko’s party, wrote on social media.

8c52a8298e3f,Newsom Vetoes California’s Ban on ‘Forever Chemicals’ in Cookware,"cookware and bakeware, hazmat, legislation, pfas, regulation and deregulation, cooking, water pollution, gavin newsom, david chang, rachael ray, marcus samuelsson, california","Gov. Gavin Newsom of California vetoed a bill that would phase out harmful “forever chemicals” used in nonstick cookware, saying he was worried it would make pots and pans more expensive for Californians. The veto, announced late Monday, is a victory for the cookware industry as well as for celebrity chefs and cooks who had defended the chemicals’ use, saying that nonstick pans are safe when used responsibly. Rachael Ray, David Chang and Marcus Samuelsson had all opposed the bill. Forever chemicals, also called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, have been widely used to coat nonstick cookware. The chemicals are also used in many other products, including waterproof boots and jackets, stain-proof carpets, dental floss and firefighting foams. The synthetic chemicals, which can accumulate in the body, have been linked to low birth weights, birth defects and developmental delays in infants as well as an increased risk of some prostate, kidney and testicular cancers. And when they end up in the environment — either during the manufacturing process, or from the products themselves — they can contaminate drinking water, agricultural land and even the air. The term “forever chemicals” comes from the fact that they don’t easily break down over time. The California bill would have phased out the use of PFAS chemicals in six product categories, including cookware; food packaging; dental floss; cleaning products; ski wax; and children’s products like crib mattresses, playpens and strollers. Mr. Newsom said that while he shared the bill’s goal to protect human health and the environment, he remained “deeply concerned about the impact this bill would have on the availability of affordable options in cooking products,” he said in his announcement. He encouraged backers of the measure to “continue discussions in this space, while ensuring that we are not sacrificing the ability of Californians to afford household products like cookware.” Steve Burns, president of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, which represents manufacturers, thanked Mr. Newsom “for recognizing and emphasizing the significant economic hardships this bill would have caused to millions of working Californians.” Environmental groups condemned the move. “Governor Newsom failed to protect Californians and our drinking water from toxic ‘forever chemicals,’” said Anna Reade, director of PFAS advocacy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. She pointed out that several other states had already passed laws to phase out PFAS from consumer products. “California is a laggard,” she said. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Ben Allen, Democrat of Santa Monica, said the veto meant Californians would ultimately shoulder the cost of cleaning up the chemicals. He also said that safer alternatives, such as pans made of cast iron or carbon steel, were available at reasonable prices. “While the manufacturers escape accountability, ratepayers and local governments have been struggling to keep up with the ballooning costs of cleaning these ‘forever chemicals’ from our water infrastructure,” he said. The debate over the bill garnered attention because several celebrity chefs and cooks, each with their own cookware lines, had come out in opposition, submitting letters to lawmakers urging them to vote against the bill. In a text message last month, Ms. Ray said she stood by her letter, which she had sent “after giving the issue much thought.” Nonstick pots and pans, she said in her letter to lawmakers, “are a key component of durable, affordable nonstick cookware used by millions of home cooks across the country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/climate/pfas-forever-chemicals-california-cookware-ban.html,World,BBC,By Hiroko Tabuchi,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14cli-chemicals-pans-hfkw/14cli-chemicals-pans-hfkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T16:47:58+00:00,7a23fffabcc8e5217462d25bc64ba71fa645bf69
a32dc79c9f73,"Bangladesh Garment Factory Fire Kills at Least 16, Official Says","bangladesh, dhaka, rana plaza building collapse, manufacturing, accidents and safety, internal-open-access-from-nl","At least 16 people died in a fire at a garment factory and chemical warehouse in Bangladesh on Tuesday, an official said, with expectations that the toll could rise. Lt. Col. Tajul Islam Chowdhury, the director of the fire service, said that the fire broke out in Dhaka, the capital, around 11 a.m. on Tuesday. Sixteen dead were recovered from the garment factory, he said, but there could be more casualties at the nearby chemical warehouse, where the blaze was not yet under control. He said it was unclear how many people had been inside at the time. Bangladesh is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of ready-made garments. The industry employs millions of workers, most of whom are women. Working standards have improved since the collapse in 2013 of Rana Plaza , a building that housed several factories, killed more than 1,000 workers , but deadly fires are still reported frequently. Outside the buildings in Dhaka’s Mirpur area where the disaster occurred, anxious family members had gathered hoping for any information about their loved ones. Many of them were holding photos of young women outside the cordoned-off area. Mohammad Nayeem said that he was searching for his wife, Samia Akter, who worked at the garment factory and that officials had told him to look in area hospitals. “I went twice to Dhaka Medical, but couldn’t find her,” he said. “I still don’t know where she is.” It was unclear what chemicals were housed in the warehouse, and firefighters were proceeding with caution. In 2022, several firefighters died after they rushed into a similar facility housing chemicals. This time, the fire service was relying on drones and other technology to find the source of the blaze inside the warehouse.

4918f9a2ddc0,‘A Big Day’: How the U.S. and the Arab World Teamed Up to Seal the Gaza Deal,"israel gaza war, peace process, us foreign policy, international relations, politics, arabs, israel, hamas, ron dermer, jared kushner, benjamin netanyahu, steven witkoff, donald trump, egypt, qatar, gaza strip, kidnapping and hostages, internal-open-access-from-nl, military, terrorism","The Egyptian intelligence chief was briefing a roomful of negotiators on the state of play in the Gaza cease-fire talks when the prime minister of Qatar quietly slipped a handwritten note to Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. The note urged the two Americans to push the Israelis to compromise. It was the morning of Wednesday, Oct. 8. Mr. Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, and Mr. Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, had just arrived on a private plane in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for what they hoped would be a breakthrough, at last, in the negotiations to bring an eventual end to Israel’s two-year war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They had reason to be optimistic. For the first time, Hamas had signaled its readiness to release all the Israeli hostages without a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and as long as it received assurances Israel would not return to war. Giving up the hostages could deprive Israel of a reason to carry on the war. And Israel was ready to free thousands of Palestinians from its prisons, including 250 serving life sentences. But the talks were jammed. Negotiators who had been meeting for two days at the resort town’s international convention center had shied away from pressing Israel and Hamas on a thorny question: how much territory in Gaza the Israeli military would leave before the hostage and prisoner exchanges. They feared that getting into the details of the map could derail the talks altogether. This account is based on interviews with 15 officials from the United States, Israel and Arab governments involved in or briefed on the negotiations, all of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations and sensitive diplomacy. Both Israel and Hamas had taken maximalist positions. Hamas wanted Israel to pull out of Gaza entirely except for a narrow buffer zone along its border. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted Israeli troops to stay entrenched in some cities in Gaza to show his public and his hard-line ministers that he was making few concessions. Bridging that gap last Wednesday required steady American pressure on the lead Israeli negotiator, Ron Dermer, officials said, as the Qatari premier’s note had urged. It also took three calls to the mediators from Mr. Trump himself, U.S. officials said. Mr. Dermer’s office declined to comment. Hamas did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, the two sides more or less split the difference, Arab officials said. Israel would hold onto much more territory than Hamas wanted it to, but it would pull out of many built-up areas. Hamas grudgingly accepted the compromise, Arab and Israeli officials said. The mediators also knew that negotiating an agreement focused on the narrower issues of a cease-fire and hostage and prisoner exchange was more attainable than pushing for a grand deal that dealt with difficult questions around Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza and Hamas’s disarmament. The success of Wednesday’s talks, where earlier attempts had failed, reflected how, once enough pressure had been applied, seemingly huge impediments could be overcome, or at least set aside for later. In the past, the two sides had fallen back on absolutes. Israel insisted on “total victory,” and Hamas on a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza., A big complaint from mediators about Israel in prior talks was that its negotiators never really had a mandate from Mr. Netanyahu to make a deal. This time, the leaders of both delegations — Khalil al-Hayya, the top Hamas negotiator, and Mr. Dermer — came with a mandate to reach a deal, Arab and Israeli officials said. The talks were the culmination of dizzying weeks of diplomacy that began after the fallout over Israel’s botched strike against Hamas officials meeting in Qatar. By late September, Mr. Trump had announced a 20-point plan that, while short on many details, specifically called for the release of all hostages in exchange for an Israeli pullback in Gaza. Crucially, on Oct. 3, Mr. Trump chose to embrace Hamas’s statement on his Gaza plan, even though it only offered support for part of his proposal, namely the exchange of hostages and prisoners. At the same time, he made clear that Israel would need to cooperate with his effort to strike a deal or risk facing his wrath. Israel’s botched strike in Qatar had created an opening to apply such pressure. But a senior U.S. administration official credited Mr. Trump’s long-term approach to Mr. Netanyahu with allowing him to prod the Israeli leader in the direction of a deal. His staunch support gave Mr. Netanyahu confidence, the official said, that Mr. Trump would not ask him to do anything that would compromise Israeli security. As for Hamas, two years of the Israeli military’s offensive had left it severely weakened. Much of the Arab and Muslim world was now pressing Hamas, including a key patron, Turkey, whose intelligence chief was participating in the talks. And the militant group took seriously the threat that if it were seen as responsible for sinking Mr. Trump’s plan, Israel would have a free hand from Washington to carry on attacking Gaza, Arab officials said. In the past, Hamas had insisted on holding onto some Israeli hostages as leverage unless Israel fully withdrew from Gaza and ended the war. But the group came to believe that holding the hostages was giving Israel legitimacy to continue fighting the war, according to senior U.S. officials. “They were almost looking at the hostages less as an asset and more as a liability,” Mr. Witkoff said. By Wednesday afternoon in Sharm el-Sheikh, mediators felt they were finally getting close as they shuttled between Israeli and Hamas delegations. Under pressure from Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner, Israel was showing more willingness to accept a middle ground on the withdrawal. The Israeli negotiators came around to thinking that while they would effectively be giving up control over half of Gaza, they could keep the other half to pressure Hamas to make more concessions in future talks about postwar governance, Israeli and Arab officials said. Mr. al-Hayya, who had survived an Israeli assassination attempt weeks earlier in Doha, said he needed to consult with other members of Hamas’s leadership. A convoy of black S.U.V.s brought him and three other officials in the militant group back to their residence, Arab officials said. The Hamas officials were gone for so long that the Qatari prime minister instructed a top aide, Abdulla al-Slaiti, to chase them down at their residence, officials said. Mr. al-Hayya was only ready to inform mediators of Hamas’s decision at 10 p.m. — five hours after they left the talks. By then, the Israeli, American, Turkish, Qatari and Egyptian teams had already dispersed to their villas at the Four Seasons in Sharm el-Sheikh, a sprawling beachside resort. The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and the Egyptian intelligence chief, Gen. Hassan Rashad, were sitting in General Rashad’s villa when Mr. al-Hayya approached, officials said. Mr. al-Hayya told the mediators that even though Hamas considered the deal unfair, its priority was to stop Israel’s bombings in Gaza, according to officials. Hamas, he said, still hoped the mediators would do everything they could to improve the deal for Palestinians. Though cloaked in dissatisfaction, Mr. al-Hayya’s response was nonetheless clearly a yes. Both Mr. Al Thani and General Rashad began to sense that the longest war between Israelis and Palestinians might be edging toward an end. Minutes later, Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner came to General Rashad’s villa to hear the positive response and quickly relayed it to the White House, Arab officials said. Around that time, Mr. Witkoff held a quick but rare meeting with Mr. al-Hayya, in which he said the United States would ensure that Israel upheld its commitments, if Hamas followed through with its own, officials said. Axios first reported on the meeting. Some issues were still unresolved, like the names of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel, and mediators debated the merits of announcing the deal right away. But the mediators concluded that the outstanding issues were not deal-breakers, and said that Mr. Trump could issue a statement announcing an agreement. In Washington, Mr. Trump was hosting an event at the White House when Secretary of State Marco Rubio passed him a note. “Very close,” the note read. “We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.” Egyptian officials, sitting alongside an Israeli intelligence official, had finished making the final edits to the agreement’s text. Mr. Al Thani signed the agreement first, before approaching Mr. Dermer with an English copy and, separately, Mr. al-Hayya with an Arabic one, officials said. At 1 a.m., one of the American negotiators took a call from Mr. Trump and put him on speaker so the president could address the room. “It’s a big day,” the president said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/middleeast/us-arab-gaza-deal.html,World,BBC,"By Adam Rasgon, David M.

1119968abce2,Why Was the President of FIFA at the Gaza Summit?,"international relations, soccer, us foreign policy, us politics, politics, israel gaza war, 2026 world cup, fifa world cup, fifa, gianni infantino, donald trump, gaza strip, israel, egypt, internal-open-access-from-nl","Along the raised dais in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where world leaders flanked President Trump to mark the cease-fire deal in Gaza, one man stood out who was neither head of government nor Arab royalty. Gianni Infantino, the president of global soccer’s governing body, FIFA, was the only sports official at Monday’s summit and the only dignitary without a political role. He posed for photos with President Trump and with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. He promised to help reconstruct sports fields destroyed in Gaza and said he traveled to Egypt at Mr. Trump’s invitation. “It’s something that is really important for FIFA to be here,” Mr. Infantino said on Instagram in a polished highlight video showcasing his interactions with world leaders. Mr. Infantino has made it his business to be where Mr. Trump is, no matter the agenda of the day. Mr. Infantino gave remarks at a 2020 dinner for business executives hosted by Mr. Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. During the Covid pandemic that year, he traveled to Washington for the signing of the Abraham Accords that established diplomatic ties between Israel and multiple Arab nations. He also secured a prominent seat this year at Mr. Trump’s second inauguration and has appeared in the Oval Office many times since. Mr. Infantino has been one of Mr. Trump’s biggest boosters since his first term, when the United States secured co-hosting rights to the 2026 World Cup. FIFA opened an office in Trump Tower this year. He has talked up Mr. Trump in glowing terms — last week, he called for him to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in Gaza — and in return has been rewarded with the sort of attention and access that Mr. Trump reserves for his top aides and allies. The closeness of their relationship has prompted criticism , including from other soccer officials, over whether Mr. Infantino should be forming such a close public bond with one global leader. FIFA has strict rules on political interference in soccer, and FIFA executives and other soccer officials have privately expressed concern about Mr. Infantino’s behavior around Mr. Trump, according to some of the officials. Mr. Trump has called Mr. Infantino “the king of soccer.” A FIFA spokesman noted that many world leaders were present and that as FIFA president, Mr. Infantino was justified in being there as something of an equal. FIFA is under pressure to rule on a two-year-old complaint from one of its members, the Palestinian soccer federation, against Israel. The complaint alleges that Israel has broken FIFA regulations, including rules on territoriality by allowing teams from Israeli settlements in the West Bank to play in the Israeli league. Israel has rejected the accusations. “Infantino has abandoned all pretense of the political neutrality that FIFA espouses and is statutorily committed to uphold, and has put FIFA firmly in the corner of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu,” said Nick McGeehan, director of the human rights advocacy group FairSquare, which has produced reports critical of FIFA. He described Mr. Infantino’s appearance in Egypt as “deeply troubling.” A FIFA spokesman did not respond to questions about Mr. McGeehan’s statement. Mr. Infantino, who traveled to the summit on a Qatar-owned private jet he frequently uses, has brushed aside the criticisms. He has insisted that he needs a close relationship with a host country’s leader to successfully stage the World Cup. He has spent far less time with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, who are co-hosting the tournament. There is little precedent for sports leaders to align themselves as closely with global leaders as Mr. Infantino has. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Kirsty Coventry, who similarly manages relationships with heads of government, did not attend the summit in Egypt. Mr. Infantino’s predecessor, Sepp Blatter, who was ousted following a corruption scandal in 2015, was never a fixture at political events. Nor was Thomas Bach, whom Ms. Coventry succeeded this year. Mr. Infantino has grown close to leaders elsewhere who blur the lines between business and government. They include President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, whom rights groups accuse of holding sham elections; Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, which secured hosting rights to the 2034 World Cup without a bidding competition; and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, which hosted the 2022 World Cup. Qatar provided Mr. Infantino with a villa in Doha before the World Cup there in 2022. Mr. Infantino has also embraced Trump family members. He broke with convention by allowing Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka to participate in the draw for the Club World Cup, a new tournament that was held in the United States this year. Typically, retired players draw names for tournaments. Mr. Trump has convinced Mr. Infantino to leave two FIFA trophies with him, including a replica of the World Cup that is on display in the Oval Office. Earlier this month, the space reserved for it at FIFA’s museum in Zurich was empty.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/middleeast/gianni-infantino-fifa-trump.html,World,BBC,By Tariq Panja,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/world/14int-soccer-diplomacy-01/14int-soccer-diplomacy-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T14:38:05+00:00,c647a24d0fab6bb775fd90a9a592cfbe874db6b4

The move, made in a speech to lawmakers, was a major concession by Mr. Lecornu to the Socialist Party, whose support he needs to survive no-confidence votes that threatens to topple his cabinet for a second time in less than two weeks. It was also a reflection of the diminished stature of President Emmanuel Macron , who made the pension overhaul a cornerstone of his second term. He pushed the measure through in 2023 despite major protests. But he now faces record levels of unpopularity and is struggling to bring intense political turmoil under control. “Is the government ready for a new debate on the future of our pension system? The answer is yes,” Mr. Lecornu told the lower house of Parliament. The overhaul aimed to raise the age when workers can start collecting pensions, long set at 62, by three months every year until it reached 64 in 2030. Mr. Lecornu said that under his proposal, which will be examined by Parliament, that process would pause until Jan. 2028. Mr. Lecornu’s proposal would also suspend a planned increase in the number of years that workers must pay into the system to get a full pension. But Mr. Lecornu insisted that the cost of suspending the pension overhaul be compensated by budget savings. He estimated that price at 400 million euros in 2026, or about $462 million, and 1.8 billion euros in 2027, or more than $2 billion. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The Public Says No, Thanks.","international relations, foreign workers, us foreign policy, communist party of china, people's daily, hu xijin, xi jinping, donald trump, china, us, india, internal-open-access-from-nl","When the Chinese government announced a new visa to attract young science and technology talent , it advertised the move as another step toward becoming the leading scientific power, one to which people from around the globe would flock. To many in China, it was a gross mistake. In the days before and since Oct. 1, when the visa was supposed to come into effect, commenters have accused the government of inviting foreigners to steal jobs from Chinese people, at a time when young people are finding it harder than ever to land work. They have suggested that foreigners are being blindly worshiped, a longstanding national sore point. Prominent influencers have also stoked nationalism or xenophobia, claiming that China will be overrun by outsiders. After Henry Huiyao Wang, the president of the Center for China and Globalization, a research group in Beijing, praised the new visa, people on social media called him a race traitor, and their posts were shared thousands of times. Platforms have been especially flooded by racist comments about Indians, after Indian news outlets reported on the Chinese visa as a possible alternative to the highly popular H-1B visa in the United States, which now comes with a $100,000 fee. The backlash grew so fierce that the Chinese Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, People’s Daily, published an editorial calling criticisms of the visa “outlandish” and accusing opponents of misleading the public. Hu Xijin, the former editor in chief of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, defended the policy, saying in a video that he saw fewer foreigners in China than in Japan or South Korea. “To be honest, it’s not that there are too many foreigners coming to China right now,” he said, “but rather that there aren’t enough.” The public outcry suggests that China may still struggle to attract the world’s best and brightest scientists, even as the United States has cut research funding and pushed many prominent scholars to consider leaving. Anti-foreign sentiment has grown in China in recent years, as the government has warned of hostile overseas powers and urged people to report potential spies . China has historically had minuscule levels of inbound immigration, and many cultural and legal barriers remain for foreigners seeking to remain long-term. When the government proposed slightly loosening permanent residency requirements for foreigners in 2020, it eventually retreated in the face of a similar backlash . (China granted fewer than 5,000 permanent residency cards between 2004 and 2014, according to People’s Daily .) Even in defending the policy, the People’s Daily editorial assured readers that the visa would make it easier for young scientists to come to China, but that it “cannot be equated with immigration.” It is unclear whether the visa would even grant the right to work, as opposed to simply allowing people to conduct business and educational “exchanges,” as state media said after the visa was announced. Eligibility details have not yet been released, even though the launch date has passed. Officials have said only that applicants would need to have obtained a bachelor’s degree in science, technology, math or engineering from a top university. The difficult job market for young people has been a potential flashpoint for years, as China grapples with slowing growth. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has said that ensuring employment is key to preventing social unrest. The latest jobs figures, released in August , show youth unemployment at a new high. “Among people from every walk of life, educational background and age group I’ve met, everyone says: Work is hard to find,” a popular manga author who uses the pen name Feng Xi Shen Lei wrote on social media . “Given the talent pool in China, I don’t believe that there’s any position in any field that must be filled by a foreigner.” Commenters also attacked the requirement that applicants need only a bachelor’s degree. Many young Chinese say that they need advanced degrees to find jobs, because of stiff competition. In reality, foreigners who enter on K visas may not directly be competing with most of the unemployed young Chinese. That is in part because of a mismatch between supply and demand in China’s job market. Many recent graduates are struggling to find jobs because the sectors that have historically employed most of them, such as real estate or education, are suffering. But in fields such as advanced manufacturing or artificial intelligence, China needs tens of millions more qualified candidates than it has, according to the Ministry of Education . Though China produces the most science and technology graduates in the world by numbers, those graduates make up a smaller proportion of the total work force than in many Western countries. Denis Simon, the former executive vice chancellor of Duke Kunshan University and an advocate for more scientific cooperation between the United States and China, said that greater transparency about how the visas will be granted could help ease people’s concerns. But he said Beijing was sending a clear signal that it wanted to bring in more foreign expertise. “This is part of the longer-term reforms needed to attract high-end talent,” he said.

be8217dba3c1,Protests in Brussels Halt Flights and Disrupt Public Transit,"civil unrest, delays, labor unions, strikes labor, brussels, charleroi, belgium, internal-open-access-from-nl","Demonstrators took to the streets of Brussels on Tuesday, disrupting air traffic and public transit during a national strike protesting proposed austerity measures by the government. The strike was led by the country’s major trade unions, who object to proposed changes in laws that affect pensions, working conditions and salaries. The strike is the latest in a series organized by the trade unions since a new federal coalition government took office earlier this year, vowing to put Belgium’s ailing budget in order. The police estimated that 80,000 people protested on Tuesday. At Brussels Airport, Belgium’s largest, all departing flights and around half of incoming flights were canceled as security staff and baggage handlers joined the strike, an airport official said. More than 300 flights and 48,000 passengers were affected. All flights were canceled at Charleroi Airport, the country’s second largest, an official there said. Trains within Belgium ran as usual, but public transit was disrupted in Brussels and elsewhere. In the region of Flanders, four out of 10 buses and trams were not in service, an official there said. Protesters gathered at Brussels North Station in the morning, with some setting off firecrackers and flares, and marched through the city center to Brussels South Station. At around noon, the police arrested several dozen protesters after a government building on Pacheco Boulevard was vandalized with projectiles, paint bombs and firecrackers, the police said in a statement. In July, the government proposed changes in laws governing pensions, the labor market, health care and taxation in what Prime Minister Bart De Wever called “the biggest socio-economic reforms of the century.” Unions and opposition parties criticized the proposals as eroding the country’s welfare system.

The agency, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., said that it suspected a group called the Russian Antiwar Committee of plotting to overthrow the government. The committee, which was founded by the anti-Kremlin tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, includes exiled politicians, law professors and other prominent professionals. The F.S.B. accused Mr. Khodorkovsky, who was imprisoned for 10 years in Russia on what his lawyers called politically motivated charges, of setting up a “terrorist organization.” In a statement , the agency said that the committee aimed to “seize power by force and change the constitutional order in Russia” by funding Ukrainian Army units and recruiting individuals inside Russia. The criminal case signals how closely President Vladimir V. Putin is watching anti-Kremlin activity abroad as Russia pursues its perceived enemies across international borders, including in some cases with poisonings and shootings . The Russian authorities appear to be particularly concerned with recent moves in Europe. The Council of Europe, an intergovernmental organization that is dedicated to upholding democracy, human rights and the rule of law on the continent, adopted a resolution to create a “platform for dialogue with Russian democratic forces.” That forum would help exiled Russians engage with Europe on their opposition to the Putin government, as well as on issues faced by the hundreds of thousands of anti-Kremlin exiles abroad. Participants are expected to include those who signed a 2023 declaration by the Russian Antiwar Committee condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In its statement on Tuesday, the F.S.B. referred to the actions of the Council of Europe as setting up an “alternative to power structures” in Russia. Mr. Khodorkovsky, in a social media post , linked the terrorism accusations to the antiwar committee’s efforts to set up the democracy forum. The Kremlin sees his committee’s cooperation with the Council of Europe as “a big problem,” he said. “That’s why we have this new investigation into an ‘overthrow of the government’, and lies about ‘recruitment’ or ‘weapons for the Ukrainian Army,’” he noted. Most of the 23 suspects named by the F.S.B. are Russian professionals who have not declared any political ambitions. Some of them once sat on Mr. Putin’s council for human rights or advised the government in an independent capacity before the war. The Russian Antiwar Committee brings together a wide variety of Russian civil society. Its members include Mikhail M. Kasyanov , Mr. Putin’s first prime minister; Sergei Guriev , who is now dean of the London Business School; and other prominent academics such as the political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. The group, which was set up by Mr. Khodorkovsky shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion to “help address the consequences of Putin’s aggression,” has not made any public calls for violence.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/europe/russia-antiwar-ukraine-terrorism.html,World,BBC,By Nataliya Vasilyeva,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/world/14intl-russia-antiwar-committee-Khodorkovsky/14intl-russia-antiwar-committee-Khodorkovsky-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T12:48:14+00:00,6cc8ff20c472615384e8651cfd5833c381eb5490
ac9561160b1d,"Madagascar Military Seizes Power, Then Nation Explodes in Joy","madagascar, andry rajoelina, coups d'etat, africa, politics, civil unrest, internal-open-access-from-nl","Madagascar erupted into cheers on Tuesday at the stunning fall of President Andry Rajoelina, who was impeached by Parliament and ousted by the military in rapid succession, following weeks of violent, youth-led protests that rocked this impoverished southern African island nation. But for all the celebrations over his removal, there were also big questions on what comes next. After Parliament voted overwhelmingly to impeach Mr. Rajoelina on Tuesday, soldiers quickly entered the presidential palace and announced they would be dissolving all of Madagascar’s major institutions — including the highest court, the electoral commission and the Senate — but leaving in place the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. Mr. Rajoelina, who just a day earlier said he had gone into hiding because of threats on his life, swiftly issued a statement condemning “the illegal declaration made today by a faction of renegade military” and insisted that he “remains fully in power.” The developments capped a turbulent 24 hours of political maneuvering and left Madagascar’s future leadership in question at a time the country relies heavily on foreign aid and instability could lead to international isolation. The country had been roiled by protests for weeks over the government’s failure to provide basic needs, including reliable water and electricity. But the immediate aftermath of the impeachment and military takeover was euphoria in Antananarivo, the capital. Thousands gathered at a plaza in the center of the city to celebrate what they believed was Mr. Rajoelina’s ouster. Led by young people who have taken inspiration from Gen Z protest movements worldwide, the revelers danced to reggae, waved Malagasy flags and chanted expletives to let Mr. Rajoelina, 51, know that he must go. Some of the president’s detractors say that he is too beholden to France, Madagascar’s former colonial ruler, and that he has squandered the country’s potential. Madagascar, with a population of 32 million, is rich in mineral resources and biodiversity, and is the largest producer of vanilla in the world. “He is the reason why we suffer,” said Eddy Bessa, a 35-year-old artist, celebrating with the crowd with a Malagasy flag tucked into his dreadlocks. “He is the reason for the corruption. He is the reason for jobless people. And he is the reason why our country lost our own culture.” Despite the joy, it was far from certain that the military takeover would end the corruption that had ignited the protests. Mr. Rajoelina (pronounced rah-JOE-el) himself came to power in 2009 through a coup in which he was assisted by the same military unit, CAPSAT, that is now leading the takeover. And across Africa, military control following youth-led movements has often led to more upheaval. Speaking in front of the presidential palace in Antananarivo, Col. Michael Randrianirina, who is serving as the country’s interim leader, announced the formation of a transitional government that he said would last for no more than two years. The transitional government would include civilians, and would arrange a referendum to create a new constitution and new institutions, said Colonel Randrianirina. When Madagascar’s security forces turned against Mr. Rajoelina and joined the protesters over the weekend, it sparked rumors that the president had fled the country. He announced in an address posted on social media Monday night that he was in a safe place on a mission abroad, but did not confirm his location. He defiantly bucked expectations that he would resign, saying that he would stay in power and named a litany of measures he was undertaking to address protesters’ concerns, particularly frequent electricity and water outages. In response to Mr. Rajoelina’s resistance, opposition lawmakers led an effort to hold an impeachment vote in the National Assembly. Before they could do so, Mr. Rajoelina dissolved the body, posting on social media that the decision was “necessary to restore order within our nation and strengthen democracy. The people must be heard once again.” Members of Parliament dismissed the move to dissolve the body as unconstitutional because it had been posted it on social media and was not formally signed or stamped. During the vote, lawmakers read a list of allegations against Mr. Rajoelina, including abuse of power, illegal commercial transactions and giving improper gifts. Lawmakers then approached the front of the chamber one by one, putting paper ballots into a cardboard box. When the voting was completed, a speaker read the ballots one at a time. Once he reached the 105-vote threshold needed to impeach, many lawmakers stood and cheered. The vote was the first presidential impeachment in the country since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960. “I am free from my chains,” several lawmakers chanted as they waved their arms. “I was a slave, but now I am free.” Alban Menavolo, an independent member of Parliament, said the Gen Z protesters did the right thing by taking their grievances to the streets, and that now lawmakers were doing their part. “The international community needs to recognize what the military does now because they are really thinking about the Malagasy people’s future,” he said. Mr. Rajoelina issued a statement saying that the impeachment process was unconstitutional because the meeting of Parliament did not receive the proper decree. Even though he has questioned the legality of his ouster, Mr. Rajoelina appears to have few options to cling to power. As cars and motorbikes honked their horns in celebration along Independence Avenue in Antananarivo after sunset, the masses of screaming young people appeared certain that the days of Mr. Rajoelina, who was in his third term, were over. Several people said they trusted that the military would steer the country in the right direction, but did not want to dwell too much on what lies ahead. That was for another day. “Today,” said Sandy Rasoarimalala, 33, “is a victory.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/africa/madagascar.html,World,BBC,By John Eligon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14int-madagascar-new1-tbzw/14int-madagascar-new1-tbzw-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-14T12:12:43+00:00,973150f3ade179450854e2748771f02a85082eca
6665e7acba1d,"To Meet Pledges to Save Forests Spending Must Triple, U.N. Report Says","climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, forests, conservation of resources, un, foreign aid, agriculture","Nations are not spending enough to ensure that the forests that cover nearly a third of the planet remain healthy, according to a new United Nations report . To meet various international climate, biodiversity and land restoration goals, annual global spending needs to triple to $300 billion by 2030, the report found. Forests are the “quintessential definition of a public good,” because of the benefits they provide, said Gabriel Labbate, who leads the climate mitigation unit at the U.N. Environmental Program and is one of the lead authors of the analysis. By providing habitat to more than 80 percent of all animals, plants and insects on land, healthy forests are key to sustaining life on Earth. They also help regulate weather patterns and the global climate. Trees and other plants absorb atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide as they grow, which offsets some of the greenhouse gases that are emitted from the burning of fossil fuels and are dangerously heating the planet. The report estimated that roughly 25 million acres are destroyed each year for human industries and extreme wildfires, which are increasing in frequency and intensity as the planet warms. In 2023 and 2024, wildfires consumed some 78 million acres — an area roughly three times the size of Iceland — worldwide. As a result, during those years forests absorbed only a quarter of the carbon they captured 100 years ago. Governments from more than 140 countries signed a declaration at a U.N. climate conference in Glasgow in 2021 agreeing to halt or reverse deforestation by 2030 . In 2023, the world spent some $84 billion protecting forests. The new report used a wide range of data to analyze as many sources of funding as possible, from governments and private institutions, that protect all forest types, from tropical rainforests to boreal forests in the Arctic. There are many ways money can help a forest. For example, governments, aid programs or conservations groups may pay to protect wilderness areas from logging or to support tree-planting efforts. The report found that private institutions, like banks, venture capital firms and corporations, contribute less than $1 out of every $10 that goes toward protecting or restoring forested areas. Governments provide all the rest. This means forests depend on “a lot of taxpayer money,” Mr. Labbate said. Most money for forest conservation and restoration comes from wealthier countries, with China and the United States accounting for nearly half of all funding, according to the report. Tropical countries, which tend to be less wealthy but harbor some of the world’s most vulnerable forests, spent the least. Many are burdened by debt and can’t invest in conservation, said Frances Seymour, a senior policy adviser with the Woodwell Climate Research Center, a nonprofit organization. Farmers trying to make a living or politicians trying to stimulate the economy may end up supporting industries that cut down trees. “It is in everybody’s interest to protect the forest,” said Ms. Seymour. “But nobody gets paid for protecting a forest.” International aid to help tropical countries is also lacking, the report found. Tropical countries spend on average 36 times as much money as they receive from the World Bank and various other global programs to save forests. The report found governments tend to spend within their borders, meaning countries prioritize conservation at home. In the private sector, companies that the U.N. considers likely to increase deforestation attract nearly $9 trillion in investment annually, more than 1,000 times the amount of private money spent protecting forests, according to the report. Agriculture, for instance, received some $400 billion in subsidies in 2023, but causes a lot of deforestation. In the Amazon rainforest, the equivalent of a football field is lost every six seconds to make room for expanding cattle ranches and soy farms. Carbon markets have emerged as a potential way to fund conservation. These are unregulated systems that let businesses offset a portion of their greenhouse gas emissions by paying for projects that protect or restore natural areas. But carbon credits represent only less than 2 percent of the money spent on forests, the report found. At the end of September, a coalition of 34 governments released a plan for financing forest conservation, meant to steer conversations at next month’s U.N. climate conference in Brazil, known as COP30. The plan includes recommendations for improving carbon credits. The same week, Brazil announced it would invest $1 billion into the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a fund that would compensate countries for preserving tropical forests setting aside 20 percent of the money for Indigenous groups. The U.N. report found Indigenous and local groups have been the most effective at protecting the world’s forests, managing over a third of them. But they have received only 13 percent of global money for forest conservation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/climate/deforestation-united-nations-report.html,World,BBC,By Sachi Kitajima Mulkey,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14cli-forest-finance-wczt/14cli-forest-finance-wczt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T12:00:06+00:00,1c2db903bcc9efa2b075e568eeb3a5736f85adc0
c5303f78113f,Venezuela Closes Embassy in Norway After Activist Receives Peace Prize,"international relations, politics, diplomats embassies and consulates, awards, nobel prize, norwegian nobel committee, nicolas maduro, maria corina machado, internal-open-access-from-nl","Venezuela announced on Monday that it was closing its embassy in Norway, less than a week after the opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Ms. Machado was awarded the prize for what the Norwegian Nobel Committee said was “her tireless work promoting democratic rights,” putting attention on the government of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela did not attribute the closure to the peace prize selection, saying it was part of a wider realignment of its diplomacy. In a statement posted on social media, Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said it was reallocating resources to focus on establishing alliances with the Global South. The statement added that Venezuela would also close its embassy in Australia and open new ones in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso. The moves were meant to “defend national sovereignty and actively contribute to the construction of a new world order based on justice, solidarity, and inclusion,” officials said in the statement. Cecilie Roang, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an email that Venezuelan officials had informed Norway of the closure but did not give an explanation. “This is regrettable,” she said. She added: “Despite differing views on several issues, Norway remains committed to maintaining an open dialogue with Venezuela and will continue to work toward that goal.” Mr. Maduro’s government has crushed protests and arrested dissidents, helping to spur an exodus from the country. In recent weeks, the Trump administration — which has called Mr. Maduro’s government a “narco-terror cartel” — has amassed warships in the Caribbean and has begun blowing up boats that American officials say are carrying drugs from Venezuela. Ms. Machado has signaled support for President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, and her party has said that the boats are legitimate targets. In an interview on Fox News last month, Ms. Machado said that Mr. Maduro was “the head of a narco-terrorist structure.” The Norwegian government does not give out the Nobel Peace Prize. The five members of the Nobel committee, who are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament, accept nominations from a pool of potentially thousands of nominators and deliberate in secret to decide a winner. Thor Halvorssen, the chief executive of the nonprofit organization Human Rights Foundation, wrote in a statement on social media that Venezuela’s closure of its embassy in Norway was “an act of political vengeance.” Jonas Gahr Store, Norway’s prime minister, congratulated Ms. Machado on her prize on Friday. “The Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasized that democracy is a precondition for lasting peace,” Mr. Store said. “This is an important award that highlights how important it is to fight for fundamental human rights at a time when democracy is under threat.” Ms. Machado became a political activist in 2002, helping to start a voter rights group, Súmate. She is a conservative former lawmaker and has long been a foil to Venezuela’s socialist ruling party. Ms. Machado has been in hiding since the summer of 2024, when Mr. Maduro claimed victory in a vote that was widely seen as rigged .

The truce agreement called for the immediate handover of all remaining bodies in Gaza, but acknowledged that some could be difficult to locate and may take more time to retrieve because of the destruction. Gaza was highly urbanized before the war, but two years of Israeli strikes have turned large parts of it into a flattened landscape of cement rubble. On Monday, Hamas returned only four bodies out of the roughly two dozen remaining, angering Israelis who had been expecting many more to come home. But late Tuesday night, the Israeli military said it had been informed that the Red Cross received four more coffins with the remains of hostages. A statement from the prime minister’s office around midnight said that Israeli forces had received those remains and that they were being transferred to Israel for identification. After the identification process, families will be notified, it said. The Israeli government has been weighing measures to penalize Hamas for not turning over more bodies, according to two diplomats briefed by Israeli officials and three Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/middleeast/israeli-hostages-bodies-hamas.html,World,BBC,By Liam Stack and Aaron Boxerman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14int-israel-gaza-remains-top1-qhcf/14int-israel-gaza-remains-top1-qhcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T11:27:10+00:00,e81bc2e253b88d03ea915879676137b5be29cdcd
8ec2c537afa5,"Trump Dangles $20 Billion Lifeline for Argentina, With Strings Attached","argentina, us, us economy, foreign aid, foreign investment, treasury department, scott bessent, javier milei, donald trump, internal-open-access-from-nl","President Trump said on Tuesday that Washington’s $20 billion bailout for Argentina comes with strings attached — namely, that the ruling party of his ally, President Javier Milei of Argentina, must prevail in the country’s legislative elections this month. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, where he was meeting with Mr. Milei. Just minutes earlier, Mr. Trump had denied the economic lifeline was meant to help Mr. Milei’s party in the elections. “I think he’s going to win,” Mr. Trump added. “And if he wins, we’re staying with him, and if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.” Mr. Trump’s comments made clear that he viewed the financial support for Argentina as a lifeline not just for the country’s economy, but also for a leader willing to spread his pro-capitalist — and pro-Trump — ideology in Latin America. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” Mr. Trump said, adding that financial success of Argentina would be a “great feather in the cap of the U.S.A.” Mr. Trump’s bailout of Argentina has come with political blowback at home. Democrats have seized on the bailout to accuse Mr. Trump of helping out a foreign government and wealthy investors while the U.S. government remains shut down because of a dispute over extending health care subsidies. Major hedge funds, including those led by friends of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, could benefit financially from the bailout. Funds at investment firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco are heavily invested in Argentina, as are investors who worked with Mr. Bessent when he was an investor for George Soros. “President Trump seems to think it’s more important to offer $20 billion to bail out Argentina than it is to make a bipartisan deal to prevent health insurance premiums from spiking for over 20 million Americans in a matter of days,” Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. American farmers have also criticized the move, given that China has been buying soybeans from Argentine farmers instead of American growers this year. Mr. Trump on Tuesday said he believed China was trying to drive a wedge between the United States and Argentina by buying soybeans from Latin America. Mr. Bessent has defended the administration’s economic support for Argentina, arguing that it could help stabilize the Western Hemisphere and that it is an investment that U.S. business leaders have sought to deepen ties with Argentina. He added that providing U.S. support to Mr. Milei’s opponents, who are not willing to enact a suite of economic changes, would be a waste of money. The face-to-face meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Milei comes after the Trump administration agreed to provide Argentina a $20 billion lifeline that would come in the form of a currency swap with the nation’s central bank. The details of the bailout remain unclear, but it could provide a political boost for Mr. Milei, who is hoping to stave off a financial crisis and a political disaster for his party . The conditioning of the U.S. support on the electoral success of a political ally, rather than strictly the risk of a financial collapse that could hurt an economic partner, was highly unusual, according to economists. Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Clinton administration had stepped in to help Mexico avoid a financial crisis, but the motivation then was to help stabilize the economy of a trading partner. When that administration provided an emergency loan to South Korea in 1998, it was meant to prevent the collapse of a financial system, not to influence the outcome of an election. “In both cases, there was a significant risk of financial contagion to other countries, which is not the case of Argentina today,” Mr. Eichengreen said. “In both cases, the U.S. was significantly exposed to instability in the subject country either economically or financially. Neither condition applies today in Argentina.” In Argentina, however, Mr. Trump has found a leader that amounts to a political kindred spirit. He has described the Argentine leader as his “favorite president,” and Mr. Milei was one of only two world leaders onstage at Mr. Trump’s inauguration. A government bailout would typically be handled through the International Monetary Fund, which would establish a framework for the nation in financial duress. The I.M.F. has provided Argentina with more than 20 economic support packages since the 1950s, including as recently as this April. However, its economy has continued to lurch from crisis to crisis.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/trump-argentina-leader-bailout.html,World,BBC,By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Alan Rappeport,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14dc-prexy1-cmbq/14dc-prexy1-cmbq-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-14T10:01:26+00:00,199b9ce809934a1bae862fba8befff949caa95cd
d312464192fb,Now Comes the Hard Part for the Gaza Cease-Fire Plan,"israel gaza war, peace process, palestinians, hamas, donald trump, benjamin netanyahu, gaza strip, israel, international relations, war;armed conflicts","Getting Israel’s hostages released from Gaza and stopping the war may have taken two years and the direct efforts of the American president and the leaders of several Arab and Muslim nations. But that was almost certainly the easy part. Getting Hamas to give up its weapons, and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip — key preconditions for Israel to pull out of Gaza fully, as both President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Monday — could prove a lot harder. Then there are the other issues in Mr. Trump’s 20-point plan, which outlined a comprehensive solution for Gaza. In full, it also called for the establishment of an international force to help maintain security in the territory, an ambitious effort to rebuild Gaza’s economy and infrastructure, and the creation of a temporary Palestinian governing committee, whose work would be overseen by an international board. During the talks leading up to the cease-fire in Gaza, provisions for who would run the enclave on “the day after” the war was over were among the most complicated and vexing — so much so that they were eventually severed from the cease-fire talks and put off until a second phase of negotiations. That phase had at least an air of auspiciousness on Monday evening in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where Mr. Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt gathered dozens of leaders to try to build on the momentum created by the truce and the exchange of 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of others for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. “Phase 2 has started,” Mr. Trump said. He predicted “tremendous progress.” “It’s peace in the Middle East,” he said. “Everyone said it’s not possible to do. And it’s going to happen.” Yet, Monday’s kickoff in Sharm el-Sheikh aside, it is unclear even when Phase 2 talks will formally begin and where they will be held. And both Israeli and Palestinian analysts said it was easier to imagine things going sideways than to imagine Mr. Trump’s plan being fully realized. “The main issue still hasn’t been solved: Hamas’s weapons,” said Akram Atallah, a London-based Palestinian columnist originally from Jabaliya, in the northern Gaza Strip. “The Israelis are demanding Hamas disarm, which is not a simple administrative measure. Hamas was founded on the basis of bearing arms.” Hamas, he said, is effectively being asked to “dismantle its ideology.” With the halt to a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and lain waste to much of Gaza, Mr. Atallah said that the current atmosphere was more optimistic but that it was uncertain how long that would last. “It feels good right now,” he said, “but I can see dark clouds in the distance and I don’t know what they’re carrying.” Israeli analysts and officials said the likeliest outcome was that Phase 2 of the talks would become bogged down. They envisioned the status quo lingering for so long that it takes root, with Hamas still armed, and the Israeli military refusing to withdraw fully from Gaza. In that circumstance, they also foresaw the Israeli military treating the group much as it now treats Hezbollah in Lebanon: occasionally striking Hamas militants or their weapon depots from afar. Despite Mr. Trump’s repeated, unqualified declarations that the war is over, backsliding on either side could threaten a renewal of fighting, analysts said. “If there’s a terrorist attack against one of our posts right now, God forbid, and we have casualties, after a minute, it’s over,” said Zohar Palti, a former senior Mossad and Ministry of Defense official. Nimrod Novik, a former Israeli envoy and distinguished fellow at the Israel Policy Forum, warned of the influence of domestic politics. “If it turns out in four or five weeks that the general mood in the country is that this war was an awful round, but only another round, and Hamas is back, I can see Netanyahu trying to correct that,” Mr. Novik said, alluding to the possibility of a resumption of hostilities. “All you need is a Hamas provocation and a disproportionate Israeli reaction, and you can have a spiral.” It was up to Qatar, Turkey and Egypt — the three Muslim-majority countries that played major roles in mediating the Hamas-Israel cease-fire — “to pressure Hamas not to provoke,” Mr. Novik said. To members of Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, the onus is squarely on Hamas. Several officials described the cease-fire agreement so far as amounting to a simple trade in which Israel gave away roughly half of Gaza in exchange for its hostages. To get Israel to leave the rest of Gaza’s territory, they said, it will need to give up its arms and let another entity step in to govern the enclave. “Things are very straightforward,” said Boaz Bismuth, a Netanyahu ally who heads the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee. “If you don’t want Israel to be there, you know exactly what you have to do. It’s easy.” But saying so doesn’t make it so. Hamas, experts close to the militant group said, is willing to make certain moves to enable the reconstruction of Gaza, but it still wants to retain some influence over the territory’s future. “Hamas is willing to offer some concessions to enable the rehabilitation of Gaza, but it will not evaporate,” said Ibrahim al-Madhoun, a Palestinian analyst close to Hamas. “Its focus is on quiet. It wants to be part of the solution, and it won’t be an obstacle to stability.” Mr. Palti, the former Israeli intelligence and defense official, expressed skepticism over the Trump plan’s prescription that Hamas be barred from either a military or civilian role in governing Gaza. “Who’s going to do it?” he said. “If somebody thinks that with a magic stick you’re achieving this revolution in hours or days, forget about it. It’s not going to happen. Not because I’m pessimistic; because I’m realistic.” The deployment of an international stabilization force, as the plan suggests, could lead the Israeli military to withdraw further. But it is still largely unknown which countries would contribute to the force, how it would be funded and trained, and when it would deploy. And the Palestinian Authority, which previously governed Gaza and still has employees on the ground, appears to be largely excluded from Mr. Trump’s initiative, barring the completion of unspecified reforms. All of which is not to say that Phase 2 is doomed from the outset. Mr. Bismuth, the lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s party, took great encouragement from the participation of Arab countries in the peace talks, and even more from Monday’s release of 20 Israelis held in Gaza since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. “I do believe that those who have to do the specific moves expected from them will do them,” he said. “When you have such results like today, you can believe in the optimistic scenario.” Natan Odenheimer contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/middleeast/gaza-talks-phase-two.html,World,BBC,By David M.

Still, eager to cater to President Trump’s push for a diplomatic solution, Ukraine sent its diplomats into round after round of meetings with American and Russian counterparts, even as the talks yielded scant results . Now, with Mr. Trump growing increasingly frustrated with Moscow’s refusal to compromise , let alone agree to a cease-fire, Kyiv sees an opening to push for what it has long sought. It wants fewer talks and more weapons to strike Russia, as well as tougher sanctions, to force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in earnest. On Tuesday, a high-level Ukrainian delegation began a multiday visit in Washington to discuss deals to buy American weapons intended to hit deep inside Russia and shield Ukraine from air attacks. President Volodymyr Zelensky plans to follow with a White House visit on Friday, possibly to finalize agreements. He has been beating the drum for American-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, which would bolster Kyiv’s ability to conduct long-range strikes. Mr. Trump hinted on Sunday that he might use the possibility of sending the powerful missiles to Ukraine to pressure President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into laying down arms. “I might say, ‘Look, if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,’” Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One. The Trump administration’s willingness to discuss the delivery and use of such weapons, something the Biden administration flatly refused , marks a shift in Washington’s approach to ending the war, analysts said.

17b5f84b1114,Explosion at Italian Farmhouse Kills Three Military Police Officers,"attacks on police, fatalities;casualties, bombs, eviction, fires, verona, castel d'azzano","A raid on a farmhouse in northern Italy whose occupants had been resisting eviction turned deadly on Tuesday when the building exploded, killing three military police officers, Italian officials said. At least 13 other officers were injured, along with two of the people living in the house. The blast occurred shortly after officers from multiple agencies and firefighters arrived at the dilapidated farmhouse in Castel d’Azzano in the province of Verona, acting on a search warrant, according to Raffaele Tito, the chief prosecutor of Verona. The occupants, three siblings in their 50s and 60s, had been served an eviction order and had threatened to blow up the home, Mr. Tito told reporters on Tuesday morning. The warrant had been issued to search for flammable materials, he said. The farmhouse had been put up for sale on a judicial auction, a sale of property to pay off debts. Mr. Tito said that a judge had ordered the family of farmers who lived there to vacate the property but that they repeatedly refused. Antonello Panuccio, the deputy mayor of Castel d’Azzano, said in a telephone interview that various options for lodgings had been offered to the family members, “but they had refused them.” Officials were investigating the details of the explosion. Mr. Tito said that several gas cylinders had been in different rooms but that it was unclear whether they were open when the explosion occurred. The two-story building collapsed, trapping officers inside, according to a spokesman for the Carabinieri, Italy’s military police. Mr. Panuccio said that two attempts to evict family members last year had been thwarted after they threatened to blow up the home. A brother and sister were arrested at the home on Tuesday, and the woman was hospitalized for her injuries, officials said. A third sibling was arrested in a nearby field shortly after, according to Italian officials. “It’s an incredible tragedy, absurd behavior,” Mr. Tito said from the site of the explosion, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. “The Carabinieri and police tried to act with maximum safety and with all the necessary equipment. But the outcome was unexpected and very painful.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/europe/italy-carabinieri-explosion-verona.html,World,BBC,By Elisabetta Povoledo and Daniel Victor,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14xp-italy-blast-tqcp/14xp-italy-blast-tqcp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T06:10:15+00:00,e4b5e9f9a3e83a983158c65df0557e07685937f8
485d97da818c,Trump’s Two Minds on China Sow a Chaotic Few Days,"us politics, us foreign policy, tariff, rare earths, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us","Just days ago, President Trump indicated his trade war with China was entering a more belligerent phase. China’s new, “unheard of” controls on rare earth minerals were “sinister and hostile” and a “moral disgrace,” he fumed, vowing to hit back with 100 percent tariffs on all products from China. “The rest is History,” he said in a social media post. Just 48 hours later, Mr. Trump appeared eager to rewrite that history. President Xi Jinping of China was only having a “bad moment,” Mr. Trump said on social media on Sunday. “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” He reassured his followers that the United States “wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” The dueling messages appeared to provide a window into an internal tug of war for Mr. Trump over the best way to approach China on trade issues. He has repeatedly seesawed between retaliation and reconciliation, rattling markets, sending businesses scrambling and leaving questions about whether he has a larger strategy. At times, Mr. Trump has taken steps to “decouple” the United States from China, threatening severe tariffs, moving to suspend sales of critical technology and even revoking the visas of Chinese students. But with a potential meeting with Mr. Xi expected this month, Mr. Trump and his aides have also struck a conciliatory tone in hopes of reaching a trade agreement and cementing Mr. Trump’s self-described role as a master deal maker. Both approaches were on display in recent days. Markets in the United States plunged on Friday amid Mr. Trump’s threats, and then rebounded some on Monday as he seemed to back off. Stocks in Asia, which had closed for the week before Mr. Trump’s bellicose turn, fell on Monday amid fears of an intensified trade war. Mr. Trump most likely saw China’s curbs on rare earth minerals, which tighten its grip over global manufacturing, as a personal slight, particularly after the two sides agreed to defuse tensions and scale back tariffs in the spring, said Josh Lipsky, the senior director of the Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center, a think tank. At the same time, the administration wants to keep a summit with Mr. Xi, and a broader trade agreement, on the table, particularly as American farmers begin to feel the trade war’s toll. Mr. Trump raised the possibility on Friday of canceling the meeting, a threat his Treasury secretary backpedaled on Monday. China has halted purchases of American farm products such as soybeans, using U.S. growers to gain leverage in the talks. “We know the pressure the administration’s facing on that front,” Mr. Lipsky said. “So it’s competing priorities, and at any given moment one might win out.” Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said Mr. Trump most likely had two different audiences in mind. “The initial threats were meant to show resolve and punish Beijing’s overreach; the softer tone since is aimed at calming markets and reassuring allies,” Mr. Singleton said. “Trump and his team seem to believe Beijing miscalculated — and they’re leaving room for Xi to walk it back without escalating further.” White House officials did not respond to questions about what prompted Mr. Trump and his aides to change their tone over the weekend. Rare earth minerals are crucial for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets. China controls much of the world’s supply, and the minerals have become one of the more pressing sticking points between U.S. and Chinese negotiators. China’s new restrictions would require companies anywhere in the world to obtain licenses if they were exporting products containing even a minimal amount of Chinese-produced rare earths minerals, including for chip manufacturing. Those exports would also be controlled if the minerals were produced using Chinese mining, processing or magnet-making technologies. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be denied licenses. The restrictions came after the Trump administration took steps to expand its global technology restrictions, and Chinese officials have accused the administration of undermining progress between the two nations. On Sunday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry pointed to the U.S. Commerce Department’s expansion of the companies subject to sanctions when included on a government “entity list,” a move that would affect many Chinese and Russian firms. “It’s pretty clear to me that China does not put out the new rare earth restrictions in the absence of the commerce rule,” Mr. Lipsky said. “We had what I would call a kind of temporary truce between the sides over the summer, where neither side wanted to escalate in advance of the two leaders meeting. That was pretty clear on all sides. And the commerce rule was seen by the Chinese as a violation of that, just as what China did on rare earths was seen by the U.S. as a violation.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to calm markets on Monday, saying on the Fox Business Network that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi could work out their differences before the Nov. 1 deadline that Mr. Trump set for his 100 percent tariffs. Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration was working to find a way to stabilize the finances of farmers. “The Chinese have unfortunately turned our soybean farmers into pawns,” Mr. Bessent said. “They’re trying to manipulate them, and our farmers overwhelmingly back President Trump.” Vice President JD Vance also appeared to leave a door open to a deal with China during an appearance on Fox News on Sunday. Mr. Vance reiterated that Mr. Trump appreciated the friendship he had developed with Mr. Xi. But he also warned China not to “respond in an aggressive manner.” “I guarantee you the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China,” Mr. Vance said. Whether the administration will have the same leverage in the months to come is uncertain.

But what is actually demanded from its signatories in the document they signed remains unclear, despite the very public ceremony. “We’re going to be signing a document that’s going to spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things,” Mr. Trump said just before the signing. “It’s very comprehensive.” Mr. Trump offered no insight on the substance of their agreement and he barely mentioned the two warring parties, Israel and Hamas. Neither were represented at the conference. The signatories were the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, all of whom played a role in brokering a cease-fire and hostage-for-prisoners exchange last week. “We’ve already signed documents in the Middle East having to do with Israel and Hamas and just about everything else,” Mr. Trump said. Seated at a table along with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan; and the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Mr. Trump was effusive in his praise of these leaders and their efforts to broker a truce in the two-year war in Gaza. Behind the table with the signers sat other world leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and his Canadian counterpart, Mark Carney. Green folders with the document had been placed in front of the heads of state at the table, and a hush fell over the room. Momentarily, only the sound of pens on paper could be heard. When Mr. Trump held up his folder showing the signed document, the audience applauded. By zooming in on the page that Mr. Trump held up, it’s possible to see what is written above the world leaders’ signatures. It appears to be a general declaration of principles. “We welcome the progress achieved in establishing comprehensive and durable peace arrangements in the Gaza Strip, as well as the friendly and mutually beneficial relationship between Israel and its regional neighbors,” the document states. The leaders pledged to “work collectively” to implement and sustain peace for future generations. There was no indication of how precisely they intend to accomplish these goals, leaving observers with little more than they had when Mr. Trump late last month unveiled a 20-point plan to end the conflict in Gaza. Israel and Hamas last week agreed to the initial phases of that plan, including the current cease-fire and an exchange of the last Israeli hostages for Palestinian detainees, which occurred on Monday. But there are unresolved points to be negotiated later. It’s unclear, for instance, if Hamas will ever accept Mr. Trump’s demand for it to disarm and not have a future role in governing the Gaza Strip. Another question is whether the cease-fire will hold. Mr. Trump told the summit attendees that the deal was progressing into the next phases. “It’s being worked on right now as we speak, and we’re actually in stage three and four,” he said. He also mentioned, without much explanation, that “we can take them out of order in a positive way,” referring to the phases. Despite the many questions, leader after leader stepped up to praise Mr. Trump and the peace plan. The White House, later on Monday, released a document entitled “The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity,” that appeared to be a full version of the document, though not one with substantive details. “We, the undersigned, welcome the truly historic commitment and implementation by all parties to the Trump Peace Agreement, ending more than two years of profound suffering and loss — opening a new chapter for the region defined by hope, security, and a shared vision for peace and prosperity,” it began.

adde1e2d274d,Trump and Abbas Share Moment of Rapprochement in Egypt,"mahmoud abbas, donald trump, massad boulos, palestinians, international relations, palestinian authority, un general assembly, gaza strip, sharm el sheikh, israel gaza war, west bank, tiffany trump","More than 20 world leaders met in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for a summit to end the war in Gaza on Monday, but one of the most remarkable public exchanges there was the greeting between President Trump and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abbas shook hands warmly and at length, chatting intensely all the while. As the two men posed for the camera at the end of their hushed chat, Mr. Trump took Mr. Abbas’s hand, patting it twice as the Palestinian leader smiled. Mr. Trump gave a thumbs-up sign and presented his own big smile. It was not the first time that Mr. Abbas and Mr. Trump had shaken hands, and their conversation could not be heard. But their body language suggested that they had reached some kind of rapprochement in what has at times been a tense and strained relationship. Just recently, Mr. Abbas was denied a U.S. visa , preventing him from traveling to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. That meant he had to address the assembly by video link, and he missed a conference on Palestinian statehood hosted by France and Saudi Arabia — and about a dozen nations’ recognition of the state of Palestine . The Trump administration cited national security concerns in denying Mr. Abbas and his delegation visas. The State Department, in its announcement of the denials, said it acted on the ground that the Palestinian Authority was “undermining the prospects for peace.” It accused the group of waging “international lawfare campaigns” by filing cases against Israel at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice and of trying to bypass negotiations for peace with “efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state.” Those tensions were not in evidence in the exchange between Mr. Abbas and Mr. Trump on Monday, or in the American president’s address to leaders at the summit in Egypt. As Mr. Trump spoke at Sharm el-Sheikh, he pointed to Mr. Abbas and noted his presence at the summit, drawing a round of applause from the audience. “It’s good to have you,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Abbas has made a concerted effort to repair his relationship with Mr. Trump, which frayed during the U.S. president’s first term in the White House. In that period, Mr. Trump advanced policies that infuriated the Palestinian Authority, which Hamas forced out of Gaza in 2007 but still administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , cut off aid to the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees, presented a peace plan that favored Israel and helped forge agreements between Israel and Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords , that sidestepped Palestinian ambitions to establish an independent state. Mr. Abbas barred senior Palestinian officials from contact with the first Trump administration. But he took steps to sway Mr. Trump in the run-up to his re-election last year. Massad Boulos, a Lebanese-American businessman and the father-in-law of Mr. Trump’s daughter Tiffany Trump, had served as an unofficial emissary of the 2024 Trump campaign to Arab American voters. Mr. Boulos helped Mr. Abbas communicate with Mr. Trump in the months before the election, as did Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian American Trump backer, according to people involved in those contacts. Mr. Boulos and Mr. Bahbah said they helped facilitate the delivery of a letter from Mr. Abbas to Mr. Trump in July, in which the Palestinian leader condemned an assassination attempt against Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump posted the letter on his social media platform . In the letter, Mr. Abbas expressed “grave concern” about the assassination attempt, condemned “acts of violence” and called for differences to be resolved through communication. Mr. Trump replied on the posted letter itself, in his distinctive handwriting with a thick black Sharpie marker, addressing Mr. Abbas by his first name, saying the letter was “so nice” and declaring that “everything will be good.” A 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza that Mr. Trump unveiled last month calls on the Palestinian Authority, which has been accused of corruption, to undergo a period of reform before it can play a role in governing the enclave. The plan does not guarantee the establishment of a Palestinian state. It says only that as the rebuilding of Gaza advances and reforms to the Palestinian Authority are carried out, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.” Adam Rasgon, Charles Homans and Erika Solomon contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/middleeast/trump-abbas-handshake-egypt.html,World,BBC,By Ephrat Livni,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12gaza-abbass-trump1-pwtk/12gaza-abbass-trump1-pwtk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T21:53:32.067000+00:00,8a0af614762c010178d5dd2e74f32666fb33f1c1
c10dbe42ac40,Cuban Dissident Leader Leaves Prison for Exile in the U.S.,"jose daniel ferrer, cuba, political prisoner, us foreign policy, politics","One of Cuba’s most prominent dissidents, José Daniel Ferrer, who has challenged his country’s Communist regime for years, was released from prison on Monday and immediately left the island for exile in the United States with his family. The Cuban foreign ministry said Mr. Ferrer had been freed because of a formal request from the U.S. government following a letter made public this month in which Mr. Ferrer said he wanted to leave the country because of harsh prison conditions and threats against his family. “The dictatorship’s cruelty against me has surpassed all limits,” he wrote last month. “I have suffered beatings, torture, humiliation, threats and extreme conditions.” Mr. Ferrer’s departure represents a blow to Cuba’s opposition at a time when the country is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades and many younger Cubans are abandoning the country. But his arrival in Miami was welcomed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is the son of Cuban migrants. Mr. Ferrer’s “leadership and tireless advocacy for the Cuban people was a threat to the regime, which repeatedly imprisoned and tortured him,’’ Mr. Rubio said in a statement. “We are glad that Ferrer is now free from the regime’s oppression.’’ Mr. Ferrer, 55, has been at the forefront of the Cuban opposition movement for two decades. While most opposition leaders were based in Havana, the capital, Mr. Ferrer’s movement was centered in Santiago de Cuba, the country’s second-largest city, in the eastern part of the country. He was arrested during a protest there that was part of island-wide demonstrations in July 2021 that rattled the government and were brutally put down. Mr. Ferrer had been in prison before, one of a group of 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 and considered “prisoners of conscience” by international human rights groups. Cuba denies that it holds political prisoners, citing laws that prohibit anti-government activities. Mr. Ferrer was released in 2015 along with 52 other prisoners as part of a landmark agreement between Cuba and the United States under President Barack Obama. That agreement led to a fleeting moment of hope that the relations between the two countries might be on the mend after decades of hostility. But the détente was short-lived and hostilities have ratcheted back up. After Mr. Ferrer joined mass anti-government protests in 2021, he was quickly arrested and ordered to prison for four years. He was released in January in a deal brokered by the Vatican, as part of a last-minute agreement in the final days of the Biden administration to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism. That deal was torn up immediately after Mr. Trump took office. Cuba was put back on the terrorism list and Mr. Ferrer was sent back to prison, where his health is reported to have suffered. Mr. Ferrer had been one of the few remaining opposition figures not in exile. “It is a sad day for all Cubans when the only solution to political problems is exiting the country,” said Joe Garcia, a Cuban American and former member of Congress from Miami. But few will begrudge Mr. Ferrer his decision after so much personal sacrifice, Mr. Garcia said. “You can’t blame him. It’s the product of impossible expectations and overwhelming pressure.” Though Mr. Ferrer was long considered resolute in his determination to never abandon Cuba, his decision to leave was not entirely unexpected. It follows a steady stream of dissidents and journalists who have chosen the same path, as well as an exodus of several million ordinary people since Communist rule was established following the Cuban revolution in 1959. Migration has surged to it highest levels in recent years as the country’s economy has cratered. Among those still detained and considered political prisoners are Maykel Castillo, a rapper who featured in an opposition anthem, “Patria y Vida” — “Homeland and Life’’ — and Luis Manuel Otero, an artist and activist who has publicly denounced the government. Mr. Ferrer, in a letter to family and friends from prison last year, complained of being held in solitary confinement for long stretches and not being permitted family visits or telephone communication for over a year and a half. “The dictatorship has buried me alive; they want to silence me at all costs,” he wrote. “I hope I am wrong, but when so many flee from terror and horror, those who remain suffer serious consequences.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/americas/jose-daniel-ferrer-cuba.html,World,BBC,By David C.

fdc6d0c81538,A Reality Check on Peace,"us foreign policy, israel gaza war, donald trump, israel, peace process","How close is peace in the Middle East? President Trump was effusive in his assessment of the cease-fire deal that, so far, has brought 20 hostages back to Israel and freed some 2,000 Palestinians from Israeli prisons: “ It’s peace in the Middle East .” When Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it “one of the most important days for world peace in 50 years,” Trump retorted, “Only 50?” “Maybe 100,” Rubio said. The reality on the ground is a little more complicated. I wanted to understand how close the hostage-prisoner exchange has brought the region to a lasting peace. (After all, we’ve seen something like this before .) So I called up my colleague David Halbfinger, who is in Jerusalem and covering the cease-fire closely. Is everything going according to Trump’s plan so far? Everything has happened according to plan in Phase 1. But Phase 1 is really the low-hanging fruit of this plan. There’s a good chance that this could be the high-water mark of this whole process. What are the potential sticking points in the next phase? Hamas has said it wants a full Israeli withdrawal. The Israelis are saying they’re not pulling out until they get everything that was in the Trump plan. So we have the ingredients for a standoff. Israel and Trump both want Gaza to be run by someone other than Hamas. But Hamas hasn’t agreed to lay down its weapons. So who steps into that breach? Israel refuses to entertain the idea of letting the Palestinian Authority go into Gaza. But then where will the Palestinian technocrats who are supposed to take charge under Trump’s plan come from? What is the security situation in Gaza at the moment? Who is maintaining order? We’ve seen what looks like Hamas beginning to reassert itself on the ground in Gaza. I think they’re trying very hard to show that there is no vacuum. What about this idea of international troops securing the cease-fire? That is one of the most interesting ideas in the Trump plan: bringing in an international stabilization force from a number of countries, including from the Arab world. We’ve heard of everybody from the Emiratis to the Indonesians, the Turks, even the E.U., being willing to take part. But will any of those countries want to come in and have to play the role of getting Hamas to turn over its weapons? Or are they going to wait for disarmament before they step in? And, how long will it take to train up this kind of force? Everywhere you turn, there are these unresolved issues . And yet some people describe this as the best hope for peace since the Oslo accords . The fact that you have so many countries in the Arab and Muslim world backing the U.S. and its push not just for a cease-fire, but for a greater peace, is enormously promising. So there’s reason to see this as a promising moment. It’s just, again, easier to see this running into great difficulty than it is to see it accelerating from here. All parties have a way to claim victory from this deal. Does that help improve the chance that it holds? You’re right, everybody is declaring victory. Hamas certainly is. They’ve claimed they put the issue of Palestinian statehood back at the top of the international agenda, that Israel is isolated, that they have survived the war, that they returned nearly 2,000 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. And all of those things are true. Israel can point to the fact that it has brought home the hostages and severely weakened Hamas. I don’t know how much Israel’s isolation on the world stage is also motivating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do what he’s doing. But when the U.S., which is perhaps its last and certainly its most important ally, applied pressure, Israel came to the table. And if the fighting pauses and worldwide attention turns elsewhere, I think Israelis will have a chance to assess just how much damage has been done to their country’s reputation. And they’re going to want to address that isolation. I mean, you heard Netanyahu talk about making peace in a way he hasn’t ordinarily done. So some cause for hope? Yes, some cause for hope.

Despite calls for his resignation, Rajoelina insisted he was staying in power. There is speculation that he is no longer in the country. Rajoelina’s refusal to step down could further inflame the tens of thousands of demonstrators who have flooded the streets, protesting corruption and the government’s failure to improve the quality of life. In recent days, members of the military, which initially cracked down on the protests, joined the youth-led demonstrators and said they would no longer take orders from their superiors.

0401708b4617,Dozens Are Dead and Dozens More Missing as Catastrophic Rains Devastate Mexico,"rain, landslides;mudslides, flood, fatalities;casualties, rescue, evacuation, climate change;global warming, emergency response and preparedness, politics, mexico, claudia sheinbaum, hidalgo, veracruz, puebla mexico, san luis potosí, querétaro","Mexican authorities are searching for dozens of missing people and struggling to supply aid to thousands more who were caught off guard by torrential rains that drenched several parts of the country , causing severe damage over the weekend. Officials said Monday that 64 people had been killed and 65 were missing across five affected states near the Gulf of Mexico. The toll is expected to increase in the coming days as search and rescue teams continue to reach areas cut off by landslides. President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday morning that her administration estimated that roughly 100,000 homes were affected by flooding and landslides. Dozens of communities remained isolated, and the president said food and water would need to be flown in. “There were no scientific or meteorological conditions that could have indicated to us that the rainfall would be of this magnitude,” Ms. Sheinbaum told reporters, adding that the government’s eyes were mostly on the Pacific, where two storms, Priscilla and Raymond , had formed off western Mexico last week. But it was in the central and eastern parts of the country — in the states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro and Puebla — where extremely intense and localized downpours caused the most destruction, overflowing rivers and setting off landslides. Some towns saw around 20 inches of rain dumped in just four days, government figures show. Ms. Sheinbaum is facing pressure to provide quick relief to the victims, a task hampered by recent budget cuts to climate-change mitigation efforts and the loss of a special disaster relief fund that was dissolved by her predecessor and mentor over corruption claims. (No cases of corruption directly linked to the fund have been legally proven). Research has found that the fund — once considered one of the world’s most advanced financial instruments for disaster relief — saved lives and aided in restoring access to vital services. But Ms. Sheinbaum vowed her administration would spare no expense to support those affected by the heavy rains. “There are sufficient resources. There will be no skimping on that,” she said, adding that her administration still had $867 million this year to allocate to disaster relief. But in some of the hardest hit places, desperation has been growing. On Sunday, during a visit to Veracruz — where an overflowing river displaced thousands and had claimed at least 29 lives — Ms. Sheinbaum was met by crowds of angry residents in the town of Poza Rica. “Where are they?” they shouted, holding up cellphone photos of the missing. A young student rebuked the president as she tried to settle people down, speaking from the back of a pickup truck. Three of his university classmates, the man said, had been missing for three days, while locals responded on their own to the disaster. “We have been here for three days, cleaning up,” he shouted, with emotion. “What good is it to have you here?” Ms. Sheinbaum repeatedly asked the crowd to shush and listen to her, pressing her finger on her lips. “We are going to help everyone,” she said. “Nothing will be hidden.” Asked about Sunday’s encounter, she said Monday that the university authorities told her that two students had died but they had not yet confirmed whether any others were missing. Ms. Sheinbaum has also pointed to a “unique” factor that Mexico has heavily relied on in recent years: its armed forces. In the absence of a special disaster fund, the Mexican Army, Air Force and Navy have played an expanding role in disaster relief efforts. The results have received mixed reviews. In the aftermath of Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 storm that left a trail of destruction and death in Acapulco in 2023, the military was praised for its rapid deployment of aid and personnel. But recovery efforts were hindered, critics say, by a lack of local knowledge and initial neglect of poorer neighborhoods and outlying communities . The financial impact of repairs, social assistance and direct cash transfers on Mexico’s public funds has been substantial. Just like her administration has been doing in Acapulco, Ms. Sheinbaum said on Monday, she would give instructions to dredge rivers, build embankments, rebuild bridges and raise pumping stations for flood control in the recently affected states. So far, more than 7,300 Army soldiers and National Guard members have been deployed to help rescue and evacuate people. Health officials have also been deployed to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue. The rains also interrupted the power supply, leaving more than a quarter million people without electricity, though Mexico’s national power company said by Monday that power had largely been restored.

9584ece0c21d,Madagascar’s President Goes Into Hiding,"internal-open-access-from-nl, politics, civil unrest, corruption, military, coups d'etat, madagascar, andry rajoelina","President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar said in a speech published online Monday that he was sheltering in an undisclosed location because of threats on his life after weeks of bloody protests over corruption and his government’s failure to improve the quality of life. Despite growing calls for him to resign from both the public and some members of the country’s security forces, Mr. Rajoelina insisted that he was staying in power to save the deeply impoverished southern African island nation. The defiant stance threatened to further inflame the tens of thousands of demonstrators who have flooded the streets nationwide. When Mr. Rajoelina, 51, announced Monday morning that he would address the nation later that evening, thousands gathered in a festive rally in the capital, Antananarivo, anticipating that he was going to step down. Now, the mineral-rich country of 32 million people, gripped by chaos, faces an uncertain path forward. Military leaders who have broken from the president have been careful not to actively seize power, seemingly to avoid the appearance of a coup. Such a move would likely draw condemnation from the international community, and Madagascar, which is heavily reliant on foreign aid, could ill afford such isolation. It is unclear what steps the breakaway security forces will take now. Speculation is rampant that Mr. Rajoelina is no longer in Madagascar, but he has refused to give any indication of his whereabouts. He was forced into a corner in recent days when some members of the security forces, which initially engaged in a violent crackdown on the protests, joined the youth-led demonstrators and said they would no longer take orders from their superiors. Mr. Rajoelina’s speech on Monday was delayed several hours because some of the dissident military forces tried to take over the state-run television station that was supposed to broadcast his remarks, according to a post on the presidency’s Facebook page. During the day, thousands gathered at May 13 Square, a center of protest in front of City Hall, where vendors peddled fruit, grilled meat and ice cream. The crowd waved Malagasy flags and chanted songs, including one that used an expletive to call for Mr. Rajoelina to step down. Next to the stage hung a large banner with the anime skull and bones that has become a symbol of Gen Z protests worldwide. Speakers from student groups, workers unions and other activists rallied the crowd. When the coffin of a protester who was shot and killed on Saturday was paraded past the square on top of a van, the crowd fell quiet as people raised their hands in respect. “I’m happy and confident of a better future in Madagascar,” said Fenosoa Hanitriniaina, a 29-year-old law student, believing that the president would be ousted from office. As security forces defected on Sunday, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, a former army general appointed prime minister by Mr. Rajoelina last week, said he would speak with them. “I am a soldier first and foremost,” he said in a text message to The New York Times. “The most important and urgent thing for me is to have frank discussions with my brothers in arms. We have one thing in common, which is a deep love for our country. I remain confident about that.” The protests in Madagascar began more than two weeks ago, spurred by anger over the government’s failure to reliably deliver electricity and water. They have since grown to include broader grievances about corruption and the economy. The majority of Madagascar’s residents live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and both extreme drought and flooding from cyclones have threatened its critical agricultural production in recent years. Many of the protesters said they lost faith in Mr. Rajoelina’s ability to fix the nation’s problems. Mr. Rajoelina, who is in his third term, came to power after leading a coup in 2009. He lost an election in 2013, but regained the presidency in 2018. He was re-elected in 2023, though his opponents argue that the process was rigged. Despite coming to power in a coup, Mr. Rajoelina has warned against another one, saying recently that it would further destabilize the country. He fired his entire cabinet this month, a change he said he made in response to the protests. But calls for his resignation only grew louder.

608050d2d91a,Trump Calls for Israel’s President to Pardon Netanyahu. Could It Happen?,"gaza strip, israel, isaac herzog, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, us politics, us foreign policy, israel gaza war","President Trump was addressing a grateful Israeli Parliament on Monday, after the first of 20 hostages were released by Hamas in a deal he helped broker, when he made an unexpected suggestion: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, currently on trial for corruption, should be pardoned. “Hey, I have an idea,” Mr. Trump said to the holder of Israel’s largely ceremonial presidency, Isaac Herzog. “Mr. President, why don’t you give him a pardon?” Since 2020, Mr. Netanyahu has been on trial for corruption in three separate but related cases. He is accused of receiving cigars, Champagne, bracelets, bags and luxury clothes; disrupting investigative and judicial proceedings; and demanding fawning coverage by two leading Israeli news outlets . He has long denied the charges. But legal experts in Israel questioned whether Mr. Netanyahu could actually be pardoned at this stage in his trial. While Israel’s president clearly has the power to pardon someone convicted of a crime, the country has seen just one notable case of a pre-emptive pardon, in 1986, and its value as precedent is uncertain. “That was a very unusual case,” said Suzie Navot, a constitutional law expert and the vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute. The case, Barzilai v. Government of Israel, stemmed from a cover-up by Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security agency, after its agents executed two Palestinian militants involved in a 1984 bus hijacking . The security forces originally claimed that all four of the hijackers were killed in a takeover of the bus, but it later emerged that two of the hijackers had been taken alive and were then beaten to death . That prompted a scandal, much public turmoil and widespread calls for investigations in Israel, Ms. Navot said. Israel’s president at the time, Chaim Herzog — the father of the current president — issued a “pre-indictment pardon” for the head of Shin Bet and several of his assistants , citing national security concerns, when their roles in the cover-up emerged in a trial of other officials in the case. The pardon was challenged, and Israel’s Supreme Court ended up weighing whether presidential pardon powers extended to those not yet charged with or convicted of a crime. The court’s majority concluded that an expansive view of the pardon power was appropriate given the specifics of the case — a ruling that may not lend itself to a blanket interpretation of the reach of presidential clemency. “It’s a precedent that is difficult to apply in a typical criminal case,” Ms. Navot said. Although a president could point to the Supreme Court’s 1986 ruling, the underlying facts in Mr. Netanyahu’s trial are different, she said. The charges against Mr. Netanyahu are related to his conduct, not national security, and are of a kind that numerous Israeli leaders have faced before, Ms. Navot said. As a result, she added, a pardon at this stage could be seen as undermining the concept that “all men are equal before the law.” Israeli criminal courts have convicted chief rabbis, a former president and a former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, multiple times . In 2010, an Israeli court convicted a former president, Moshe Katsav, on rape charges related to actions earlier in his career, as well as lesser charges from actions while he was president. Following Mr. Katsav’s conviction, his successor to the office, Shimon Peres, said, “Citizens of only one kind exist in Israel — and all are equal in the eyes of the law.” Mr. Trump has railed against the case Mr. Netanyahu faces before. In June, he posted on social media that the trial would get in the way of negotiations over ending the war with Hamas, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname, Bibi, and writing, “LET BIBI GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!” Mr. Trump has likened the criminal charges against Mr. Netanyahu to the accusations he himself has faced in the United States, and has dismissed both as political witch hunts. Mr. Trump wields significant influence in Israel, particularly now that he has helped to broker a cease-fire that secured the release of hostages in Gaza and could be a crucial step in ending the war there. Mr. Herzog could choose to pardon Mr. Netanyahu if he is convicted at trial. But any pardon while the legal process is still underway could be interpreted as an attack on the rule of law, Ms. Navot said, and virtually any Israeli could claim the legal standing to contest it. Originally expected to last a year or more, the criminal proceedings against Mr. Netanyahu have been delayed several times, including by coronavirus restrictions. It was only in December 2024 that Mr. Netanyahu finally took the stand. “I am shocked by the magnitude of this absurdity,” he said then. “I am the prime minister, I am running a country, I am running a war,” he added. “I am not occupying myself with my future, but rather with that of the state of Israel.” And he has, on occasion since then, sought delays and extensions, citing his schedule and diplomatic developments .

765734aac48d,A Divided Israel Unites in Joy as Hostages Come Home,"israel gaza war, kidnapping and hostages, peace process, us foreign policy, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, israel, gaza strip","Many of them had become household names, their faces familiar from posters all over the country: Israelis snatched two years ago from their homes in pastoral border villages, from a music festival rave and from army bases and then secreted into Hamas’s tunnels deep under Gaza. When they finally emerged on Monday as part of a cease-fire deal reached between Israel and Hamas, they were thinner, wan, but alive and on their feet. And Israelis basked in a joyous moment of unifying national redemption after years of agonizing, polarizing war. The 20 living hostages who had remained in Gaza, along with the remains of 28 deceased ones, remained an open wound, with the fate of the hostages tearing at the country’s soul. A majority of Israelis had long wanted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize their release with a deal to end the war, polls showed . But Mr. Netanyahu accused protesters of “hardening Hamas’s stance” while critics of the prime minister accused him, in turn, of prolonging the war to appease his far-right political allies on whose support he relies to stay in power. Now, many Israelis said, with an open-ended cease-fire in place and all the living hostages back home, it was time for the country to heal. “This is a momentous day, a day of great joy,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an address in the Knesset, or Israeli Parliament, on Monday alongside President Trump.

6e0835c34ce1,Palestinians See Little to Celebrate Even Though the Bombs Have Stopped,"israel gaza war, food aid, palestinians, humanitarian aid, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, internal-open-access-from-nl","Palestinians in Gaza expressed relief on Monday that Israel had halted its two-year military offensive in the territory, and that hostages and prisoners had been exchanged. Still, many felt there was little to celebrate. Two years of war left the enclave in ruins, its cities reduced to rubble, tens of thousands dead and the health system devastated. Despair and hopelessness are pervasive and many no longer see a future. “It’s important that the bombing has stopped, but there’s nothing to be happy about,” said Saed Abu Aita, 44, who is displaced in central Gaza. “My two daughters were killed, my home was destroyed and my health has deteriorated.” Israel’s military campaign against Hamas killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials. Their tolls do not specify the number of combatants, but they say thousands were children. Some in Gaza said they do not see the release on Monday of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners — one of Hamas’s stated reasons for launching the war in the first place — as an achievement worth the cost. Hamas secured the exchange by trading the remaining hostages out of the some 250 seized during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war. Mr. Abu Aita said that a fragment of shrapnel penetrated his rib cage when an Israeli airstrike hit his hometown, Jabaliya, in northern Gaza in October 2023, soon after the war began. For more than a year, he said, he has not been able to find a doctor who could remove the fragment. He said he hoped that the return of the last 20 living hostages to Israel on Monday — a crucial element of the cease-fire that went into effect last week — would pave the way to an end to the war. “They needed to go home a long time ago,” he said. “Holding them in Gaza gave Israel a pretext to continue its bombing.” Palestinians in Gaza have lived through hunger, fear and bombardment. With a cease-fire now in effect, aid groups say they are attempting to scale up relief as much as possible to blunt the humanitarian catastrophe and allow people to rebuild their shattered lives. Many relief officials blamed Israeli restrictions for shortages that led to hunger and malnutrition throughout the enclave. While Israel blocked all supplies entering Gaza for nearly three months earlier in 2025, Israeli officials have recently said they were no longer limiting the amount of aid that can go into the territory. Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel committed to allowing a surge of desperately needed supplies into the enclave. On Sunday, the United Nations said it was working to boost its aid to Gaza, including by bringing in cooking gas for the first time since March. Many in Gaza have had to resort to making bread with firewood, because there was little gas or electricity available. “For two years, we’ve dreamed of this moment,” said Amani Nasir, 30. “We’ve had enough of tents, fire, displacement and thirst.” Under the deal, at least 600 trucks of supplies will enter Gaza per day, and Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt will be reopened. Abdel Nasser al-Ajrami, the head of Gaza’s Bakers’ Union, which works with the World Food Program to distribute subsidized bread, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza has been steadily improving since the announcement of the cease-fire last week. “Today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow will hopefully be better,” he said, adding that 17 bakeries were now operating across central and southern Gaza. But there is some skepticism that the cease-fire will hold. The deal clinched last week by U.S., Qatari, Turkish and Egyptian mediators did not resolve some of the toughest sticking points between the warring sides and left Hamas still armed and the dominant force in parts of Gaza for the time being. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said his government will not agree to end the war until Hamas’s government and military wing in Gaza are dismantled. While Hamas has expressed willingness to hand civilian rule over Gaza to another Palestinian entity, it has not committed to giving up its weapons. Since Israel halted its military offensive and pulled back from parts of Gaza in the past few days, Hamas has begun reasserting itself on the streets of the territory. Witnesses in Gaza said they had begun to see small groups of Hamas’s internal security fighters standing guard at some intersections. On Sunday night, Hamas fighters clashed in Gaza City with a rival gang of gunmen and attempted to capture its members, according to the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. During a visit to Israel on Monday to coincide with the hostage release, President Trump was asked by a reporter what he thought about the possibility of Hamas reasserting itself as a police force and shooting rivals. He replied that this was because “they do want to stop the problems” and suggested the United States was not opposed, temporarily. “They’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump’s ambitious vision for Gaza includes bringing in a postwar security force to stabilize the enclave, as well as training a new Palestinian police force to maintain law and order. But that prospect will be difficult should Hamas insist on continuing to play a dominant role in the enclave. Abdullah Shehab, 32, said he was worried that the respite in fighting would only be temporary because Hamas had not agreed to Israel’s conditions for ending the war. In recent days, Mr. Shehab said, Hamas was trying to show that it “hasn’t given up its rule” in Gaza. On Sunday, he said, masked gunmen who he believed were members of Hamas stopped him on the way to the dentist and inspected his car. “The situation is very fragile,” he said. “The weak party, Hamas, hasn’t been convinced to accept the strong party’s demands.” Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/gazans-ceasefire-relief-gloom.html,World,BBC,"By Adam Rasgon, Bilal Shbair, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad and Saher Alghorra",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13int-gaza-ceasefire-promo/13int-gaza-ceasefire-jltz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T18:25:00+00:00,872a7af046e222ede2b550a8025af87888d5dea1
a8be045e7d52,Hostages and Palestinian Prisoners Are Freed as Trump Hails ‘Historic Dawn’ in Mideast,,"Newly released Palestinian prisoners flashed victory signs to cheering crowds who gathered on Monday to watch them step into freedom under the new cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Families waited at dawn in the West Bank city of Ramallah and broke into teary-eyed trills as buses carrying some of the nearly 2,000 released prisoners and detainees approached. They rushed forward to greet the men as they stepped off. Many of the men looked haggard and exhausted. “This feeling is indescribable,” said Nasser Shehadeh, who was released after serving three years of a 17-year sentence for a car ramming attack on two soldiers, who survived. He was told he would be freed three days ago, and said the news came as a surprise. “I haven’t slept since that moment,” he said. On Monday afternoon, the Israeli prison service said it had freed all of the 1,968 Palestinians slated for release in an exchange for all the remaining hostages in Gaza. They were sent to the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Credit Credit... By Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times Among those freed were 250 Palestinians convicted of terrorism offenses or acts of violence against Israelis and roughly 1,700 more who were detained in Gaza without charge during the war. The 250 convicts were mostly affiliated with Fatah, a rival Palestinian faction to Hamas, and were serving life sentences for attacks in the 1980s or 1990s. More than 150 of them were sent into exile. The Gaza residents among them were taken through the Rafah border crossing which links Gaza to Egypt, according to the Hamas Prisoners’ Media Office. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said one prisoner was transferred to Ramallah Hospital from Ofer Prison, while seven others were hospitalized after they were dropped off in Ramallah. Mr. Shehadeh’s father, Bilal, said he was disturbed by his son’s condition. They had not seen each other since the war began more than two years ago, and in that time, his son had lost roughly 100 pounds. “They were not just deprived of food. They were not even allowed to clean themselves or to have soap,” the father said. “Our priority now is to make sure Nasser gets the medical attention he needs.” Halima Abu Shanab, 53, said she was both overjoyed and alarmed by the sight of her brother, Kamal Abu Shanab. The Israeli authorities said he was convicted of murder and membership in a terrorist organization. “We’re happy, truly happy, that he’s home,” she said. “But his health, it’s really bad. I was not prepared to see him like this.” Mr. Abu Shanab, 51, had spent 23 years in prison. When he emerged from the bus on Monday, he was covered in bruises, Ms. Abu Shanab said. She added that he had a shoulder injury that had not been treated in eight months. His family took him directly to a hospital. “He was beaten badly and humiliated,” she said. “And left with wounds on his knees and body.” The Israel Prison Service said it was not aware of the family’s claims of mistreatment made by the released prisoners and detainees on Monday. “The Israel Prison Service operates in accordance with the law,” a spokesman for the agency said. “We are not aware of the claims described, and to the best of our knowledge, no such incidents occurred under I.P.S. responsibility.” A family disappointed after waiting for a loved one to be released from prison, then finding out that their relative was not among those freed. Credit... Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times This is not the first time Israel has released prisoners or detainees who killed Israeli civilians in exchange for hostages, but it is nevertheless difficult for many in Israel. In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners and detainees for Gilad Shalit , a soldier who had been held captive in Gaza for five years. Several of those released prisoners and detainees — including Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed last year — would go on to plan the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. One of the prisoners and detainees released in 2011 was Murad Abdallah Adais, who was convicted of killing Dafna Meir in 2016. Her daughter, Renana Meir, criticized his release in an anguished essay in an Israeli newspaper. “When the terrorist is let out of prison in the coming agreement, you will pay the price,” she wrote. “Every Israeli in every house in Israel will be less safe.” Others had more mixed feelings. Abraham Moses, 75, the chairman of Israel’s National Organization of Victims of Terror, said he and his children wept when they learned that Muhammad Adel Daoud would be freed. He was convicted in 1989 of killing Mr. Moses’s wife, Ofra, and 5-year-old son, Tal, in 1987. But then Mr. Moses decided that if seeing Mr. Daoud go free could save the families of hostages from that same pain, then his release might be worth it. “Imagine the feeling of families who would embrace their loved ones returning from hell,” he said. Some of the families who were waiting in Ramallah for their imprisoned loved ones left despondent on Monday after learning that their relatives were not among those released. Nuhad Hammami waited anxiously in Ramallah for her brother, Mohammed, who was convicted of murder, according to the Israeli authorities . She stood on her toes to see over the crowd. Then tears began to stream down her face. “His name was on the list of prisoners returning home until this morning,” she said. “Then the list changed, and now we don’t know if we’ll ever see him again.” She was worried that he might have been released and sent to Gaza instead of the West Bank. “Where would he sleep in the winter?” she said, her voice trembling. “Gaza is destroyed.” Most of the released prisoners were residents of Gaza who were detained without charge during the war, including women and children. They were brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where such large crowds gathered that the buses could barely move down the street. Palestinian prisoners arriving in a bus, surrounded by crowds, at Nasser Hospital in the Gaza Strip. Credit... Saher Alghorra for The New York Times The area around the hospital swelled with thousands of people and coursed with waves of joy, grief and disbelief. Armed men, some of them masked, tried in vain to keep order in the crowd, occasionally firing into the air. Many in the crowd pushed toward the arriving busloads of detainees and shouted the names of their missing loved ones. Others packed the balconies of half destroyed buildings to cheer and wave. Inside the buses, detainees pressed against the windows or waved back. Israel has detained several hundred Palestinians during the war on suspicion of direct involvement in the Oct. 7 attacks. It has detained thousands more who are suspected of links to Hamas and other groups but not of involvement in the attack. Most were designated as “unlawful combatants,” which means they can be held without charge or trial under Israeli law. Some of these detainees were released in earlier prisoner-hostage swaps during the war. When the Israeli government agreed to the exchange, it stipulated that no detainees suspected of involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks would be released. Rozan Naif Adwa, 23, came to find her fiancé, Mohammed Khalil, who was detained at a checkpoint in northern Gaza 11 months ago. They had planned to distribute their wedding invitations on Oct. 7, 2023, and had spent the last two years watching the destruction of their homeland. “He came out of one small prison to a bigger one, a devastated prison,” she said, referring to Gaza. “But he will rebuild his home and his life from the beginning.” Earlier in the day, Amani Nasir, 30, joined a crowd in southern Gaza to watch Red Cross vehicles take some of the freed hostages back to Israel. She knew their release meant that Palestinian prisoners and detainees would be coming home soon. “Today feels like the happiest day of our lives,” said Ms. Nasir, who fled her home in northern Gaza during the two-year war. Since then, she said, she had been displaced 19 more times to flee fighting. “We were happy for our prisoners — and for the Israelis, too,” she said. “We love peace and the truce. Just as Israelis worry about their hostages, we worry about our prisoners.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/12/world/israel-gaza-hostages-trump,World,BBC,By Johnatan Reiss,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12gaza-avraham-moses-adel-daoud-lpjm/12gaza-avraham-moses-adel-daoud-lpjm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T17:58:52+00:00,a2b7e6c380f2cf4ce34e343052f61af9e7fd7ea8

Mr. Trump seized on the moment to tell the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, that this is “not only the end of a war, this is the end of the age of terror and death.” Using a line that other presidents have reached for — and often been disappointed — he added: “This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.” He then traveled to Egypt, where dozens of world leaders awaited his arrival for a “peace summit” that offered the pomp and circumstance Mr. Trump is known to enjoy. Banners adorned with his face were dotted along the streets of a Red Sea resort. “From the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, the will of the people meets the resolve of world leaders to end the war in Gaza,” President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said. “They all carry a single message to mankind: Enough war. Welcome to peace.” But at the Egypt summit, neither Israel nor Hamas were participants. And although the White House released what appeared to be a document signed by the countries that did attend, it did not commit the signatories to any specific action. Rarely has an American president, particularly one as divisive at home as Mr. Trump is, been met with such adulation abroad. In Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, tens of thousands yelled, “Trump, Trump,” and in the Knesset some members wore red MAGA-style hats. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

32e02b0df3e3,W.H.O. Warns of Sharp Increase in Drug-Resistant Infections,"antibacterial, drug resistance, bacteria, infection, disease rates, e coli, developing countries, pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, who","Across the world, the spread of dangerous infections that do not respond to antibiotics has been increasing by as much as 15 percent a year, affecting treatment for urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, E. coli and other pathogens that kill millions of people annually, according to a report released Monday by the World Health Organization. The report documents how countries are grappling with the challenge of so-called antimicrobial resistance. It found that one in six infections in 2023 was resistant to the current roster of antibiotic drugs. The drug resistance involves 40 percent of the most common antibiotics used against these infections. Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean had the highest rates of resistance, with one in three infections resistant to antibiotics. That is roughly double the worldwide average and more three times the rates in Europe and the Western Pacific. Overall, antimicrobial resistance was more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, especially those with weak health care systems. “Antibiotic resistance is widespread and threatening the future of modern medicine,” Dr. Yvan Hutin, director of the W.H.O.’s department of antimicrobial resistance, said in a news conference announcing the surveillance results. “Simply put, the less people have access to quality care, the more they’re likely to suffer from drug-resistant infection.” Drug-resistant bacterial and fungal infections kill more than one million people around the world each year and contribute to the deaths of nearly five million others, according to the health agency’s estimates. A study published in The Lancet estimated that more than 39 million people would die from antibiotic-resistant infections in the next 25 years. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

3a8273052df3,"What Are the Abraham Accords, Trump’s 2020 Mideast Deals?","israel gaza war, yom kippur war, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, israel, bahrain, jerusalem, united arab emirates, morocco","When President Trump spoke in Israel on Monday to celebrate the cease-fire in Gaza, he declared that it was time to seek “the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity” for the entire region. The moment carried strong echoes of another speech that Mr. Trump gave in 2020, announcing the Abraham Accords — a series of diplomatic deals that saw Israel establish relations with several Arab countries. On Monday, Mr. Trump praised the accords, saying that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, “did something very special” when he helped to broker them. He also hinted at his longstanding wish to expand them, suggesting that Israel could even make a deal with Iran, its archenemy in the region. Though a comprehensive end to the war between Israel and Hamas has yet to be hammered out , Mr. Trump said the cease-fire meant “the historic dawn of a new Middle East.” What are the Abraham Accords? Signed in 2020 on the White House lawn, the first of the deals known as the Abraham Accords established diplomatic ties between Israel and two Gulf Arab states, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. A similar agreement with Morocco soon followed. Until then, the only Arab states that had formally recognized Israel were Egypt and Jordan. Most others had pledged not to do so until the creation of a Palestinian state. The lack of diplomatic relations meant that citizens of Israel could not travel to those countries, and vice versa. It also forced any trade and security cooperation under the table. Until the Abraham Accords, even direct phone calls to Israel were blocked in several Arab countries, including the Emirates. President Trump has described the Abraham agreements as the crowning foreign policy achievement of his first term, and they have received bipartisan support from U.S. lawmakers. At the White House signing ceremony in 2020, Mr. Trump said that they marked “the dawn of a new Middle East,” speaking of a future in which “people of all faiths and backgrounds live together in peace and prosperity.” What impact have the deals had? The Abraham Accords have created an opportunity for expanded trade, security cooperation and tourism between the countries that signed them. Israeli tourists and investors have poured into Dubai, the biggest city in the Emirates, and technology and energy companies have signed new deals. In 2024, trade between the two countries exceeded $3 billion, and regular flights continue to ferry travelers between the Emirates and Tel Aviv. Morocco has also seen an influx of Israeli tourists. And to sweeten its incentives to sign the deal, the United States agreed to recognize the disputed Western Sahara territory as a sovereign part of Morocco. The impact in Bahrain has been more modest, and protests against the accords have become a regular occurrence in the Gulf nation. The accords have done nothing to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel’s occupation of the West Bank has deepened , rather than eased, contrary to the hopes of Emirati officials when they signed the deal . The current prospects for a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza — a longstanding goal of Arab leaders — appear dim, even though several European countries have recently recognized Palestine. Is this a peace deal? Over the five years since the Abraham Accords were signed, Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, along with other American and Israeli officials, have repeatedly referred to the agreements as a “peace deal.” “The blessings of the peace we make today will be enormous,” Mr. Netanyahu declared from a White House balcony when the accords were announced in 2020. “Ultimately, it can end the Arab-Israeli conflict once and for all.” Scholars of the region say that is merely a turn of phrase , belying the fact that there has never been a war between Israel and the U.A.E. or Bahrain. Morocco has also largely stayed out of the Arab-Israeli conflicts, aside from sending a token force to a 1973 war, more than 50 years ago. In effect, the deals bypassed the central conflict, between Israel and the Palestinians, declaring harmony between parties that were not fighting. Will the Abraham Accords expand? American and Israeli officials have frequently stated their desires, and expectations, for other countries to sign the accords. So far, that has fallen flat. The biggest prize for supporters of the accords would be Saudi Arabia, the powerful, oil-rich kingdom that hosts the two holiest sites in Islam. But years of overtures to persuade Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel have so far failed. The Biden administration took up that mantle fervently, pursuing a deal that was predicated on the United States granting major benefits to the kingdom . Analysts say that Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza, with the immense suffering of Palestinian civilians, has made joining the accords a much harder sell for Arab nations. Saudi officials have insisted recently that they would be unable to recognize Israel without the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel insists that it will never cede East Jerusalem, which it seized in the 1967 war and formally annexed in 1980. Even if the war in Gaza ends permanently, the views of Saudi citizens toward dealing with Israel are overwhelmingly negative . That limits the space that the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has to maneuver for a deal. David E.

Mr. Macron’s public comments on the turmoil were the first since Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu, a centrist and close ally of Mr. Macron, resigned a week ago — only to be reappointed by the French president just days later, on Friday. That move, which capped a week of chaos, infuriated Mr. Macron’s opponents, heralding even more instability as France struggles to pass a deficit-cutting budget by the end of the year. “It is everyone’s duty to work toward stability, not to bet on instability,” Mr. Macron told reporters after landing in Egypt, where he was attending a summit on the peace process for Gaza , adding that he wanted France to “move forward in peace, stability, seriousness.” That will be challenging. Two parties — the National Rally, on the far right, and France Unbowed, on the far left — have already said they will file no-confidence motions against Mr. Lecornu, who is expected to deliver a key policy speech on Tuesday in the 577-seat lower house of Parliament. Other opposition parties have suggested support for such motions, bringing Mr. Lecornu dangerously close to the 288 votes currently required to topple him.

At least 38 people survived, according to an official in the northeastern province of Limpopo, where the accident happened, and a search continued for any other survivors. The passengers were mostly from Zimbabwe and Malawi and were traveling back to their home countries, according to transportation officials from Limpopo. The crash happened about 55 miles from the Zimbabwe border on the N1 highway, a route regularly used by cross-border buses carrying migrant workers and their families. President Cyril Ramaphosa described the crash as a tragedy for South Africa and “our sister states of Zimbabwe and Malawi.” “This is compounded by the fact that this incident has taken place during our annual Transport Month, where we place a special focus on the importance of safety on our roads,” Mr. Ramaphosa said. The bus operator, DNC Coaches, extended its condolences to the families of the passengers who died. Limpopo Transport Minister Violet Mathye said the cause of the crash was being investigated.

4290d13551aa,Is the Fed Too Confident About Inflation? Some Economists Think So.,"banking and finance, us politics, jobs, inflation, donald trump, jerome powell","Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, says there is “no risk-free path” for the central bank now that the labor market has cooled and inflation has picked back up. If officials focus on stamping out price pressures by keeping interest rates elevated, they risk harming the labor market. If they take steps to shore up the labor market by cutting borrowing costs, inflation could prove harder to contain. So far, Mr. Powell appears more willing to take a gamble on inflation. His rationale is that the risks to the labor market have grown much more pronounced after a sharp slowdown in hiring this summer. All signs point to the Fed cutting interest rates for a second time this year when it meets next, at the end of the month. Projections released in September showed that most officials saw room for another quarter-point reduction at its final gathering of the year, in December. But the Fed may not have wiggle room to cut interest rates much more than that if the labor market does not weaken. Doing so would risk inflation getting stuck above the central bank’s 2 percent target, some economists warn. “The idea that we stay at levels that are meaningfully away from target is a real risk for the Fed,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. “Easing policy at the margins will help to keep inflation at higher levels for longer.” Mr. Powell’s more sanguine view on inflation — which is shared by other members of the Federal Open Market Committee — stems from his belief that President Trump’s tariffs will result in only a one-off rise in consumer prices rather than successive rounds that will lead to persistently higher inflation. He has also made the case that a weaker labor market will keep a lid on how much consumer prices can ultimately rise, especially as wage growth stays subdued, unemployment rises and spending slows overall. So far, the impact of the president’s levies — which include broad-based tariffs on nearly all the country’s trading partners as well as sector-specific duties — has been more muted than officials at the Fed initially expected. Not only has it taken longer to show up in the consumer price data than anticipated but the rise in prices for everyday items has also been less intense than expected. But what has made some economists, and in fact some Fed officials , wary is that measures of underlying inflation show that progress has stalled toward the central bank’s target. “That is a signal that there’s more to what’s going on with inflation than just tariffs,” said Loretta Mester, who was president of the Cleveland Fed until last year. One gauge, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is currently running at an annualized pace of 3.5 percent. Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, argues that an even more accurate metric is one that removes travel-related components like airfares and hotel rates, given that they tend to “gyrate wildly.” That measure is running at an even higher annualized pace of 3.9 percent, as of the August data, which is the most recent because of the government shutdown. Mr. Stanley said that metric suggests “progress toward 2 percent is substantially less than meets the eye and certainly insufficient to allow the F.O.M.C. to let down its guard on inflation just yet.” Another point of concern is what happens if the labor market stabilizes rather than deteriorates further from here, a possibility given that some of the recent slowdown in monthly jobs growth stems from a reduction in the supply of workers because of Mr. Trump’s crackdown on immigration as opposed to a pullback in demand for new hires. “The risk here is that we just never get enough weakness to cause inflation to go back to 2 percent,” said Dean Maki, chief economist for Point72, a hedge fund. A “full-blown recession” would eliminate any lingering concerns about services inflation, he added, but so far no Fed official is forecasting such a significant downturn. Neither is Mr. Maki. Instead he expects core inflation to stay above 3 percent most of next year as the unemployment rate rises to 4.8 percent. It stood at 4.3 percent as of August. What has given officials at the Fed some comfort is that expectations from consumers and investors about future inflation over a longer time horizon have so far stayed contained, suggesting that people are not yet losing faith in the Fed’s ability to eventually get price pressures under control again. But for former officials like Ms. Mester, the foremost concern is whether that will start to change. She said the Fed had already lost some of its credibility with the public after inflation surged in the aftermath of the pandemic. It has now been roughly five years since inflation has been at the Fed’s 2 percent target. Some current policymakers at the Fed have echoed that worry. “Two more years would be a long time to wait for a return to our target, and that possibility weighs on my judgment for appropriate monetary policy,” Michael Barr, a Fed governor, said recently. Others have joined him in expressing caution about how much further to lower interest rates, including several presidents across the regional banks like Lorie Logan, Beth Hammack and Jeffrey Schmid. Even Stephen Miran — the newest governor, appointed by Mr. Trump, who has called for substantially lower interest rates — said at a CNBC event on Wednesday that he did not expect inflation to reach the 2 percent target for another year and a half. “If credibility is lost, then it makes the job to get back to 2 percent inflation and full employment much harder, because part of what you’re doing is trying to change behavior,” Ms. Mester said. “People have to believe that inflation is going to be 2 percent or else they’re going to start acting on higher expectations,” she added, “and then that makes it much harder to bring inflation down.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/business/federal-reserve-inflation.html,Business,BBC,By Colby Smith,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15DC-INFLATION-01-hqjm/15DC-INFLATION-01-hqjm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T15:30:21+00:00,b0b2a7b11471db230cd0978cce25d2bd92c82236
2980f1deffd7,Why Bank C.E.O.s See Economic Turbulence Ahead,"internal tag to designate no storyline, david m. solomon, jamie dimon, jpmorgan chase, goldman sachs group, citigroup, bank of america, banking and finance, private equity, artificial intelligence, marc j. rowan","Andrew here. There’s an interesting shift taking place among business leaders in New York City ahead of the mayoral election. While many are privately against Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist and Democratic nominee, some have begun to soften their position publicly — in part because they have become resigned that he will win. We dive into the dynamics at play. We’re also taking a look at Bernhard Warner’s scoop from Tuesday that Stellantis will invest $13 billion in the U.S. The good and the bad of financial giants’ reports Wall Street giants are reporting stellar results for the third quarter, despite broader economic turmoil. But some of their bosses are warning that the good times are under threat. The good news: Lenders’ core operations are flying. JPMorgan Chase reported a 12 percent year-over-year jump in profit. Goldman Sachs announced $15.2 billion in revenue, a record for its third quarter. Citigroup saw profits jump 16 percent from the same time a year ago. And just in: Bank of America topped analyst estimates with $8.5 billion in profit, up 23 percent year-over-year. Morgan Stanley outperformed, too, with a 45 percent surge in profit from the year-ago period. The results suggest the economy is holding up, a blessing for investors looking to them as a stand-in for official government stats that aren’t being published because of the government shutdown. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase told reporters that the hit from tariffs had been “less than people expected, including us.” His C.F.O., Jeremy Barnum, added that “it was the busiest summer we’ve had in a long time in terms of announced M.&A. activity.” And Mark Mason, Citi’s C.F.O., said his bank hadn’t seen an uptick in missed debt payments. But banks see trouble with stock valuations. David Solomon of Goldman said there was no question that there was “a fair amount of investor exuberance at the moment,” much of which was being driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Historically, such periods are followed by a downturn, meaning that “disciplined risk management is imperative,” he added. Dimon told analysts: “You have a lot of assets out there which look like they’re entering bubble territory.” Others are warning about private credit and other lending services. “It does not surprise me that we are seeing late-cycle accidents,” Marc Rowan of Apollo Global Management said at a Financial Times conference on Tuesday, referring to the recent implosions of the heavily indebted auto lender Tricolor and the auto-parts maker First Brands. Dimon was more blunt. “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” he told analysts Tuesday. (He conceded that JPMorgan, which took a hit from Tricolor’s collapse , wasn’t innocent: “We make mistakes, too.”) Are the good times definitely ending? Not necessarily, some finance leaders believe. Jon Gray, Blackstone’s president, said at the FT conference that he “100 percent” rejected the idea that those bankruptcies were “a canary in a coal mine.” HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING Instagram will limit content for teens. Meta said it would use the film industry’s PG-13 rating to determine what teens could see on the social network. The policy will also be adapted for the firm’s A.I. chatbots, as the company has faced grilling from lawmakers over child safety. In other tech news, OpenAI said it would soon allow “erotica” content on ChatGPT, a major change in policy. President Trump says a bailout of Argentina depends on an election success. The president met with President Javier Milei of Argentina , an ally, on Tuesday after the U.S. agreed to provide a $20 billion lifeline to Buenos Aires. But Trump said a key currency swap with Argentina’s cash-poor central bank depended on Milei’s party winning this month’s midterm elections. The planned bailout has so far averted the country falling into a financial crisis, analysts say, but it has come at a political cost to Trump. A conglomerate’s boss is charged in a giant crypto scam. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn filed wire-fraud and money-laundering charges against Chen Zhi, the head of the Prince Group, arguing that he ran an illegal scheme that used imprisoned workers in Cambodia to prey on crypto investors. It is the latest crypto crime ring to be investigated amid a rally for digital currencies. Is Big Business growing to accept Mamdani? For months, many of New York City’s business leaders were — at best — wary of Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist seeking to become mayor, even after he thumped Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Now, with less than a month before Election Day and with Mamdani still holding a strong lead in the polls , some corporate executives are breaking bread with the man whose policies they had vigorously opposed. Mamdani has repeatedly reached out to business leaders and has gained audiences with the likes of Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Mike Bloomberg , The Times reports. He has met several times with business executives, many of whom have been surprised that he doesn’t lecture them and instead absorbs their points of view. That said, some executives have refused to meet with Mamdani, fearing that doing so would be leaked and seen as an endorsement. Mamdani’s inroads with the corporate elite have benefited from some key allies, including: Sally Susman, a well-connected former Pfizer executive, who was impressed by Mamdani’s July meeting with the Partnership for New York City. “There’s something about him that makes people want to help him,” she told The Times Magazine . Robert Wolf, the major Democratic donor and Obama adviser, said that he had started texting with Mamdani. Wolf, a former UBS executive, described the candidate as “more of a progressive capitalist” who he believed understood the importance of the private sector to New York. Some of the thawing relations may come down to this. From The Times : Pragmatically, it may be better to develop a relationship with the probable next mayor than to antagonize him. Wall Street likes a winner and understands the benefits of proximity to power. “I don’t want him to fail,” said Jeffrey Gural, a landlord who met with Mr. Mamdani recently and found him to be “personable” and “smart.” “So, it gave me a one-on-one opportunity to give him my opinion.” Some critics remain unconvinced. Many worry that his policies, including tax increases and a rent freeze, would drive away wealthy New Yorkers, eroding the city’s tax base, and batter the real estate sector. Others are still put off by his unwillingness to condemn the expression “globalize the intifada” or back off his promises to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. “You have to hope to be able to hold two thoughts at the same time,” Jason Haber, a founder of the American Real Estate Association, told The Times: “that Zohran Mamdani is a very nice person, but he’s also a person with very bad policies that will take the city in the wrong direction.” Trade tremors Trade war tensions between the U.S. and China are giving investors a severe case of whiplash. Leaders in both countries aim to project strength, and that has led to some big market swings recently. The latest: President Trump on Tuesday weighed adding cooking oil to the list of Chinese imports he would target. That would be in retaliation for China’s “Economically Hostile Act” of not buying U.S. soybeans, he wrote on Truth Social. China’s cooking oil exports to the U.S. have fallen sharply recently , analysts note. Still, the threat sank Tuesday’s rally, sending the S&P 500 to a loss as investors saw little progress before a November deadline to reach a trade pact and avert bruising retaliatory tariffs. A worsening trade spat could have a big toll. China’s shift from U.S. soybeans could push many American farmers into bankruptcy, barring the passage of a huge bailout package . And data released on Wednesday by Beijing showed that China’s economy was taking a hit as trade tensions sapped consumer spending. The I.M.F. also warned that global growth could slow significantly if the White House and Beijing failed to resolve their dispute. Europe appears to be caught in the middle. The Netherlands last month seized control of Nexperia , a Dutch chipmaker, from its Chinese parent, Wingtech Technology. It also suspended Nexperia’s boss. The move came after the U.S. threatened to put the company on a trade blacklist, The Wall Street Journal reported, showing that the Beijing-Washington dispute has gone global. The E.U. is also considering a requirement that Chinese firms that operate locally in digital and manufacturing markets hand over technology to European companies, according to Bloomberg. Maros Sefcovic, the E.U. trade commissioner, said this would reflect what “European companies have been doing when they’ve been investing in China.” In related news, Tim Cook of Apple pledged Wednesday to bolster investment in China during his visit with China’s minister of industry and information technology, Li Lecheng. Despite Apple’s move to shift manufacturing to India and the U.S., China remains a major production hub. Stellantis’s investment pledge Shareholders are cheering the news that Stellantis, the carmaker that owns the Chrysler, Fiat and Jeep brands, will invest $13 billion to bolster its manufacturing in the U.S. , Bernhard Warner writes. The latest: The European-traded shares of Stellantis were up nearly 3 percent on Wednesday. Its New York-listed shares are also up in premarket trading. Antonio Filosa, Stellantis’s C.E.O. of four months, told DealBook that the plan represented “the largest investment in our 100-year-long history in the U.S.,” the company’s biggest market. It calls for creating 5,000 new jobs at plants across the Midwest, increasing U.S. production by 50 percent over four years and reopening an Illinois plant that was shut in 2023 (while expanding capacity at others). The Illinois factory will assemble the Cherokee and Compass vehicles for Jeep. Stellantis is the latest business to announce a huge U.S. investment initiative, the kind of pronouncement that President Trump tends to trumpet. JPMorgan Chase and Pfizer have made similar announcements recently. The hope is that such plans buy the companies relief from Trump’s trade war. At the White House last month, Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s C.E.O., said its pledge had won some of its drugs a “three-year grace period” from tariff scrutiny. Could Stellantis reap similar benefits? The carmaker is facing roughly $1.7 billion in tariff-related costs this year, largely tied to models produced in whole or in part in Mexico and Canada. Its investment in U.S. production and supply chain capabilities could potentially offset some of the hit from levies, analysts say. Trump’s climate and energy policies were also factors. The administration and congressional Republicans have rolled back emissions regulations that had compelled automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles. Stellantis will now increase production of electric vehicles, hybrids and gas-powered vehicles, including a new large S.U.V. “Basically, the idea of that was to give back to American customers their freedom of choice,” Filosa said.

Some of them even revealed their plans at the White House. The latest to make an investment announcement, though not at the White House, was the top executive at Stellantis. The carmaker that owns Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep and Ram said on Tuesday that it would spend $13 billion over the next four years to bolster production in the United States, its biggest market . It is “the largest investment in our 100-year-long history in the U.S.,” Antonio Filosa, the company’s chief executive, said in an interview with DealBook. Mr. Filosa, who was named to his job in June, said the company had held “very productive talks with the Trump administration” about its investment plans. That conversation began in January when John Elkann, the scion of Fiat’s founding Agnelli family and the company’s chairman, met with Mr. Trump. The Italian-born Mr. Filosa, who joined the company in 1999 and has worked in Europe and led business units in South America and North America, laid out the investment plans in his first English-language interview with a reporter since becoming chief executive. He succeeded Carlos Tavares. The company said this year that it was planning to spend more, even with profits under pressure, but it had not provided some key details until Tuesday.

9e5e82a96ec1,Netflix Jumps Into Podcasts With Spotify Deal,"podcast, video recordings, downloads and streaming, netflix, spotify, youtube, movies, amy poehler, bill simmons, the bill simmons podcast","After months of speculation, Netflix is taking its first step into the world of video podcasting. The streaming giant announced a partnership with the audio company Spotify on Tuesday that would bring numerous video podcasts on sports, culture, entertainment and true crime to Netflix early next year. The deal prevents the shows from airing in their entirety on YouTube, Netflix’s biggest competitor. The 16 shows in the deal are produced by Spotify Studios and The Ringer, the website and podcasting network that Bill Simmons started and that Spotify acquired in 2020 . The shows include two popular true crime podcasts, “Conspiracy Theories” and “Serial Killers”; “The Bill Simmons Podcast”; and “Rewatchables,” which features Mr. Simmons and a roundtable of movie lovers discussing their favorite films. Executives say the editorial content for “Rewatchables” or “The Big Picture,” which reviews new movies, will not tailor topics only to films available on Netflix. “With video podcasts on the rise, our partnership with Spotify ensures we bring the full video versions of these top shows to Netflix and Spotify,” Lauren Smith, a vice president at Netflix, said in a statement. She added: “This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity.” Roman Wasenmüller, a vice president at Spotify, said in a statement that the deal “marks a new chapter for podcasting.” Netflix will not run ad breaks with the initial set of shows, even for subscribers who pay for the less expensive plan that shows advertising during its programming. But the advertising Spotify sells that are integrated into the shows will remain. Spotify and Netflix said they expected to add to the initial lineup in time. Spotify’s most popular podcast, “Good Hang With Amy Poehler,” is not part of the agreement. The podcast industry has been upended in recent years by the popularity of video podcasts and the rise of short-form clips, such as those on TikTok. Traditionally, podcasts generate revenue based on ad sales — and use download numbers to set their rates — but since video podcasts today are consumed in many different forms, often chopped up and distributed across social media apps, their true popularity is not always accurately depicted in episode download numbers. Netflix’s secrecy with its viewing data could add another complication. Netflix has been exploring adding podcasts to its video service for some time. The company’s interest has attracted the attention of podcast executives at other companies, some of whom say Netflix has been courting the same talent they do. The appetite for video podcasts is enormous. According to a recent study by Cumulus Media, 72 percent of podcast listeners say they prefer shows with video. Netflix has dabbled in off-service video podcasts, including “Skip Intro,” which highlights talent from Netflix shows, and “We Have the Receipts,” which delves into Netflix’s reality television programming. Video versions of both podcasts and others appear on the company’s YouTube channel “Still Watching.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/media/netflix-spotify-podcast-deal.html,Business,BBC,By Nicole Sperling and Jessica Testa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/NETFLIX-PODCASTS-1-qtwp/NETFLIX-PODCASTS-1-qtwp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T18:01:12+00:00,9a722f5edbf30a2a2b71d2518c1bc008a10642e4

But after three government upheavals in France since last summer, the damage to the French economy has already been done. Constant political turmoil has dampened growth, increased France’s borrowing costs and stoked growing wariness among investors, who are now thinking twice about betting on France. “This situation has been deteriorating month after month, and political inaction has been more and more frustrating,” said Olivier Redoulès, an economist at Rexecode, a French consultancy. “Companies have been very sensitive to the political situation, and the big question is, what happens next?” France had become increasingly attractive to investors under President Emmanuel Macron. For the last six years, the country has been Europe’s biggest recipient of foreign investment, in large part because Mr. Macron had adopted a pro-business agenda. But analysts say investment and consumer spending have slowed since Mr. Macron abruptly dissolved the lower house of Parliament in June last year in a gamble that was intended to prevent a far-right party, the National Rally, from gaining more power. That maneuver backfired, leading to a deeply divided Parliament. Three successive prime ministers have been ousted since then, after failed attempts to pass a budget that is desperately needed to tackle a surge in France’s debt and deficit. The French economy had already started to slow last year, expanding 1.2 percent, down from 1.4 percent in 2023. But the French economy is forecast to slow more sharply this year, to just 0.6 percent, according to the Banque de France. Although some of that can be linked to a cooling global economy and the impact of President Trump’s tariffs, the sense that France has become an increasingly ungovernable country has factored into the mix. “France has traditionally been the locomotive of Europe,” François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of France’s central bank, told French radio last week. “Now it has become the caboose.” The uncertain outlook has led companies in France to pause investments, with a ripple effect into the economy, said Alain Di Crescenzo, the president of France’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “The first obstacle to business is the economic climate, and political uncertainties add to that,” said Mr. Di Crescenzo, who is also a senior vice president at Schneider Electric, one of France’s biggest companies. “Businesses are cutting back on investment, and cutting back on spending and overhead costs, which means hiring,” he said. “That means less growth and fewer jobs.” Yahya Fallah, an official at France’s Confederation of Small and Midsize Enterprises, said the collapse of three successive governments had dented business morale, especially among entrepreneurs who count on government funding to help lift business activity. “You hear all this news and nobody likes it,” said Mr. Fallah, a co-founder of Open Aleph, a technology start-up. “When you don’t know what the rules will be in one, two, three or even six months, you can’t make decisions.” The political uncertainty raises questions about who is going to keep investing in France, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. “It doesn’t mean French investment is coming to a halt,” he said. “But the interest of foreign investors would be weaker, because there’s a bad image effect.” Mr. Lecornu, who resigned last week only to be reappointed two days later, is looking to prevent the new government from collapsing yet again, a fate that will be decided this week. Lawmakers are scheduled to hold a vote of no-confidence Thursday on the measures he is proposing. France badly needs to pass a budget for 2026 by year’s end to reassure investors, businesses and consumers. Mr. Lecornu’s proposals include suspending Mr. Macron’s 2023 pension law to raise the age at which workers can start collecting pensions to 64 from 62. There will be “targeted and exceptional” tax increases for big businesses, and lower taxes for small companies. The budget also includes major public sector jobs cuts, a freeze on pension payouts and a temporary surtax on individuals with incomes over 250,000 euros a year. After his predecessor was ousted over a plan to cut the deficit to 4.6 percent, Mr. Lecornu said he was open to a smaller effort of around 5 percent. In 2024, France’s budget deficit reached 5.8 percent of its economic output, the largest since World War II, while the debt exceeded €3.4 trillion in September. The country’s sovereign debt rating has been downgraded twice since September. In a sign of hope, France’s socialist party, whose support Mr. Lecornu needs to stay in office, said it would not vote against the budget after he suspended the increase in the retirement age. Even so, the delay on pension reform will cost half a billion euros next year, and €1.8 billion in 2027. Mr. Lecornu warned that those costs would have to come from painful cuts elsewhere in the French economy, likely setting off another political battle before the end of the year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/france-economy-prime-minister.html,Business,BBC,By Liz Alderman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14biz-france-uncertainty-03-hlvz/14biz-france-uncertainty-03-hlvz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-14T17:36:36+00:00,f39e5b625c51cb83cc51301019f107719ee9af57
700ad8911686,Powell Signals Fed Is on Track to Keep Cutting Rates,"banking and finance, regulation and deregulation, us politics, us economy, tariff, interest rate, rare earths","Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, signaled further room for the central bank to lower borrowing costs this year to shore up the labor market despite the recent re-acceleration in inflation. Mr. Powell, speaking on Tuesday at an event hosted by the National Association for Business Economics, deviated little from his recent message that the Fed should be responsive to the slowdown in monthly jobs growth and other signs of softness across the labor market. While he conceded that economic activity was on a “somewhat firmer trajectory than expected,” Mr. Powell stressed that “the downside risks to employment appear to have risen.” That suggests the central bank is likely to proceed with additional cuts at its two remaining meetings this year, one on Oct. 28-29 and another in December. Mr. Powell indicated an inclination to continue lowering interest rates despite the fact that the government shutdown is delaying crucial data releases, including September’s jobs report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week that it would be calling back some employees to produce the Consumer Price Index for September, which was initially set to be released on Wednesday. It will now be published on Oct. 24, meaning Fed officials will have it in hand before they vote on interest rates. Data collection for future reports, as well as the release of other data, will restart only once lawmakers reach an agreement to fund the government. The Fed chair acknowledged on Tuesday that the central bank was missing “important” data but said officials “routinely review a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.” He also highlighted other sources of information the Fed collects, including “a nationwide network of contacts,” who he said provide “valuable insights.” In a moderated discussion after his speech, Mr. Powell said alternative sources of data would not replace government statistics, which he called the “gold standard.” “We’ll start to miss that data,” he said, adding that it will become “more challenging” as the shutdown drags on and additional data is not being collected. The lapse in official government statistics complicates what is already a difficult moment for the Fed, which is grappling with what Mr. Powell has previously described as a “no risk-free path.” He reiterated that challenge on Tuesday, noting that there was “tension between our employment and inflation goals.” The concern is that taking steps to protect the labor market could risk making the recent setback in inflation worse, while a move to tame price pressures could cause undue harm to the economy. “We’re in a difficult situation,” Mr. Powell said. Mr. Powell is among several policymakers at the Fed to view the recent resurgence in inflation as a temporary phenomenon. That stance rests on the assumption that President Trump’s tariffs will result in a one-time increase in prices across a raft of consumer goods, such as food and furniture. Those increases may take time to filter across the economy, Mr. Powell has conceded, but he expects the impact to fade. Other proponents of that view include John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In an interview last week, Mr. Williams, who is a permanent voter on the policy-setting committee, said he did not see “any signs of second-round effects or factors that could be amplifying the effects of tariffs on inflation.” Rather, he said, there are “more downside risks to the labor market and employment, and that is something that takes some of the upside risk off of inflation.” But other officials at the Fed are weighing the risks differently, expressing greater concern about the outlook for inflation even before the latest round of tariff threats from Mr. Trump. Last week, the president vowed to impose 100 percent tariffs on all products from China if Beijing did not ease controls on rare earth minerals. That would come on top of broad-based levies on imports from dozens of countries that were imposed on Aug. 7 and other tariffs on specific products like household furnishings and cars. Minutes from the most recent Fed meeting underscored the divisions between policymakers, with some officials reluctant to support September’s quarter-point cut. Mr. Powell said on Tuesday that the ongoing debate was “healthy.” Beyond the economic outlook, Mr. Powell spoke at length about the Fed’s roughly $7 trillion balance sheet and its use of large-scale asset purchases in the past to support the economy in times of crisis. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently seized on these tools, saying they caused “severe distortions in the market,” worsened inequality and even undermined the Fed’s own political independence. Mr. Powell conceded on Tuesday that the Fed should have moved more quickly to end its purchases of government securities in the aftermath of the Covid-era financial shock and that officials should be “more nimble in our use of the balance sheet.” The Fed is currently shrinking the size of the balance sheet, which Mr. Powell said was in keeping with a “deliberately cautious” plan, given signs that measures tracking the amount of cash in the banking system were starting to show evidence of “gradually tightening.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/powell-signals-rate-cuts.html,Business,BBC,By Colby Smith,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/DC-POWELL-01-pqch/DC-POWELL-01-pqch-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T16:22:05+00:00,d86b925297b2313a4be613c60b204cf4f4a98f1e
6e0b2000374c,Trump’s Trade War With China Catches the World in Its Crossfire,"donald trump, tariff, international trade, china, us foreign policy, us economy, economy, international relations, europe, india, britain, imf, internal-open-access-from-nl","One of the world’s main number crunchers released its latest economic report on Tuesday. But the middling forecast from the International Monetary Fund doesn’t begin to capture the helter-skelter ride the global economy is on. Even as the I.M.F. was preparing its report, a flurry of developments were already altering the picture. New U.S. tariffs on imported wood, furniture and kitchen cabinets that are expected to drive up the cost of home building took effect on Tuesday. So did the opening round of higher port entry fees that China and the United States will impose on each other’s vessels. Tuesday’s turn of the trade wheel was just one click in a series of repercussions set in motion by President Trump’s vow to smash the world’s economic order. More will follow. Last week, Beijing decided to sharply step up curbs on its export of rare earth metals, materials that are essential for the manufacturing of semiconductors, cellphones, wind turbines and nearly every other modern gadget. New restrictions on equipment needed to produce batteries for electric cars are also scheduled to take effect next month. Mr. Trump’s initial fury softened over the weekend, after his response led to the sharpest decline in stocks since April, when the president’s initial barrage of tariffs was announced. Still, his threat to slap an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports was left dangling. “The U.S.-China relationship is highly volatile,” said Richard Portes , a professor at the London Business School. “One doesn’t really know what to expect from one day to the next, and that is typical of the current administration.” The souped-up tension between the two economic superpowers is catching other countries — that is, almost every country — in the crossfire. China’s restrictions on metals and magnets, for instance, would affect European automakers that use those materials and ship them across borders within Europe. And the levies on ships made in China apply even to non-Chinese shipping companies stopping at American ports. On Tuesday, the Chinese government ratcheted up the retaliation by adding five American subsidiaries of the South Korean shipping company Hanwha to its sanctions list, accusing the subsidiaries of “supporting and assisting” the United States in its moves in the shipbuilding industry. Beijing and Washington are also essentially pressuring nations around the globe to take sides. Mexico, one of the world’s biggest buyers of Chinese cars, proposed a 50 percent tariff last month on those vehicles after heavy lobbying from the Trump administration. India, meanwhile, has moved closer to China since the White House, piqued by New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil, imposed tariffs up to 50 percent on Indian goods. In August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the first time in seven years to attend a security and economic conference — a public display by India’s leader that his country has plenty of allies should the Trump administration continue to single it out for punishment. Since Mr. Trump took office, shifts in global trade policy have happened both at high speed and in slow motion, reverberating in broad and unpredictable ways. When Mr. Trump announced his plan this summer to slap 50 percent tariffs on most steel and aluminum coming into the United States, British steel makers felt lucky. Their government had already struck a deal that their steel would be tariffed at only half that amount — 25 percent. But the mood in Britain darkened considerably last week when the European Union announced its own set of punishing tariffs on steel imported into its 27-nation bloc. The policy delivered a gut punch to Britain’s steel industry, which sends nearly 80 percent of its exports to the European Union. Britain, though, wasn’t the target of the policy — just a bystander to moves aimed at Beijing and Washington. The 50 percent E.U. tariff was directed at China, which has been accused of dumping underpriced steel on the global market. The tax was also designed with an eye to putting the European Union in a better negotiating position with the United States. “The Union is ready to work with like-minded countries with a view to ring-fencing their economies from global overcapacity,” the European Union’s executive arm said last week. “We will continue exploring ways of working together with the U.S.” The protectionist impulse is also going viral, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico taking steps to shield their homegrown steel makers. Despite the frequent swerves in trade policy, though, the global economy will remain highly integrated, said Lucrezia Reichlin , a professor at the London Business School, even as the center of gravity shifts toward Asia and away from the West. For now, growth is slowing in both the United States and China , while a pervasive unpredictability characterizes the short- and long-term outlooks. Mr. Portes at the London Business School summed up the dynamic between the world’s two largest economies: “China has stable, clear and determined objectives. The Trump administration changes from day to day, in its views and its policies.” “The degree of uncertainty is huge,” he added, “and that has consequences for the global economy.” Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting from Brussels.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/economy/us-china-trade-tariffs-global-economy.html,Business,BBC,By Patricia Cohen,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14biz-trade-analysis-01-tpjh/14biz-trade-analysis-01-tpjh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T15:07:55+00:00,c000c7b36363c3edae309962bfa712ef5fc33f1c
4d5603ece1b3,Global Growth Remains Sluggish as Tariff Threats Loom,"international trade, tariff, us economy, us politics, economy, protectionism, inflation, imf, donald trump, world trade organization, internal-open-access-from-nl","The global economy is projected to slow this year and next as persistent uncertainty over trade policy and supply chain disruptions continue to weigh on world output, according to new forecasts published on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. said global economic growth would slow to 3.2 percent in 2025 from 3.3 percent last year. Growth is projected to fall to 3.1 percent in 2026, as the protectionist measures being adopted in the United States and around the world take hold. The world economy is slightly stronger than economists at the I.M.F. expected it would be earlier this year. That is because the United States scaled back or delayed many of the tariffs President Trump threatened after taking office and because businesses raced to stock up on goods before tariffs took effect. Many firms have, for now, held off on passing additional costs to their customers. But significant uncertainty remains. New tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets and lumber went into effect on Tuesday. Trade tensions between the United States and China flared again last week, after Mr. Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese imports by an additional 100 percent in response to new Chinese export controls. A protracted shutdown of the federal government in the United States could also weigh on the world’s largest economy this year. “There are increasing signs that the adverse effects of protectionist measures are starting to show,” the I.M.F. report said. “As the global economy slides into a more fragmented landscape, risks to the outlook increase.” The projections are similar to those released last week by the World Trade Organization, which forecast slower trade growth in 2026 but said the world economy had remained more resilient in 2025 than previously expected. The I.M.F.’s economic projections come as finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world are gathering in Washington for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank. Under pressure from the Trump administration, those international institutions are shifting their priorities away from issues such as climate change and the economic impact it is expected to have around the globe. Instead, they are focusing on more traditional core policy issues such as financial stability and economic development. Policymakers are expected to discuss a variety of topics, including details related to the Trump administration’s promised bailout of Argentina, discussions among the Group of 7 nations about additional economic pressure on Russia and conversations between American and Chinese officials that might calm the latest flare of tensions. “World financial leaders will be converging in Washington as their economies struggle to deliver good growth even as the global economic and geopolitical landscape turns increasingly hostile,” said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the I.M.F.’s China division and author of a new book on the unraveling of the world economic order . “As growth slows even moderately, structural issues that have been simmering under the surface will become increasingly apparent and difficult to ignore.” The I.M.F. projects that growth in the United States will slow to 2 percent this year from 2.8 percent in 2024. Growth in the euro area is expected to tick up to 1.2 percent from 0.9 percent. Japan’s economy is poised to strengthen this year, with output rising 1.1 percent, compared with 0.1 percent last year. In China, growth is forecast to slow to 4.8 percent this year from 5 percent in 2024. With domestic demand tepid and trade ties with the United States fraying, growth is expected to continue to decline in 2026, falling to 4.2 percent. Inflation continues to be a major challenge for policymakers as they grapple with the challenges of tariffs and sluggish growth. The I.M.F. said that the impact of tariffs on inflation had been muted so far, but that there were signs price pressures were building in the United States. “In the United States, inflation is expected to pick up beginning in the second half of 2025, as the impact of tariffs is no longer absorbed within supply chains and instead passed on to consumers,” the I.M.F. said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/imf-report-economy-trade-inflation.html,Business,BBC,By Alan Rappeport,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14DC-Global-Econ-sub-bhjv/14DC-Global-Econ-sub-bhjv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T13:00:06+00:00,ed09863133aa9a511f35e5d6382f88f92610298a
600bf2d825f9,Big Banks Credit ‘Resilient’ Economy for Profit Growth,"banking and finance, earnings reports, us economy, tariff, goldman sachs group, jpmorgan chase, wells fargo &, jamie dimon","Even as President Trump’s tariffs and trade restrictions have upended industries and generated a swirl of economic uncertainty, Wall Street keeps humming along. Some of the nation’s biggest banks reported strong quarterly earnings on Tuesday, mostly topping analyst expectations and showing broad growth across their key lines of business. While bank leaders warned about the growing risks of a slowdown, “resilient” was the word many chose to describe the economy. For the three months through September, JPMorgan Chase reported a 12 percent year-over-year increase in profit to $14.4 billion on revenue of $46.4 billion. Investment banking fees rose 16 percent, and credit card and auto lending revenue rose 12 percent, a sign of solid business on both Wall Street and Main Street. But the bank added more padding to its reserve for credit losses, as charge-offs on soured loans ticked upward. “The U.S. economy generally remained resilient,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, said in a statement. “There continues to be a heightened degree of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation.” On a call with reporters, Mr. Dimon elaborated on his comment about asset prices. “You have a lot of assets out there which look like they’re entering bubble territory,” he said. The stock market has set a series of records this year, although it has wobbled in recent days after the latest outbreak of tit-for-tat trade restrictions by the United States and China. The bank is keeping a close eye on the labor market for signs of trouble, Jeremy Barnum, the bank’s chief financial officer, said on the call. “ If that were to deteriorate, we would expect in the normal course to see that flow through to consumer credit,” he said. “It’s not happening yet.” A surge in deal making helped Goldman Sachs earn $4.1 billion in the third quarter, a jump of 37 percent from the same quarter last year. The bank recorded its highest-ever revenue for the third quarter, which totaled $15.2 billion. Its investment banking fees surged more than 40 percent to about $2.7 billion, allowing the division to easily exceed analyst expectations. Citi also beat expectations with a profit of $3.8 billion, up 16 percent from the year before. It recorded revenue of $22.1 billion, up 9 percent, and growth in all five of its major business lines. Mark Mason, the chief financial officer at Citi, echoed the sentiment of other bankers that companies and consumers had proved surprisingly durable. “We’ve been in kind of recession-ready mode for over a year,” he said. But the company hasn’t seen any of the warning signs, like missed payments, that would cause alarm, he added. Wells Fargo reported a profit of $5.6 billion, up 9 percent from the same quarter last year, on revenue of $21.4 billion. It, too, profited from growing credit card spending and balances — as well as higher fees for managing wealthy customers’ assets. Credit and debit card spending has increased among its most affluent clients and lower-income customers, according to Mike Santomassimo, its chief financial officer. “I think that’s a good sign for sort of what’s happening in the overall economy at this point,” he said. The bank celebrated a long-sought milestone last quarter, as the Federal Reserve freed it from the asset growth cap it imposed seven years ago as punishment for extensive misconduct, including the creation of sham bank accounts and improper home foreclosures. “While some economic uncertainty remains, the U.S. economy has been resilient and the financial health of our clients and customers remains strong,” Charlie Scharf, the bank’s chief executive, said in a statement. Since Mr. Trump’s re-election, a wide range of companies have announced plans to invest billions in the United States, often drawing praise from the president. JPMorgan joined those ranks on Monday, saying it would facilitate $1.5 trillion in financing and investments over the next 10 years, focused on industries “critical to national economic security and resiliency” in the United States. The plan includes up to $10 billion in direct equity and venture capital investments by the bank in a group of mostly American companies. “It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing,” Mr. Dimon said in a statement. Asked on Tuesday about the simmering trade tensions between the United States and China, Mr. Dimon took a wait-and-see stance. “In general, the trade effect has been less than people expected, including us ,” he told reporters. “This still is going to play out. Hopefully it won’t have a major effect, but I wouldn’t take it off the table as having any effect.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/banks-earnings-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-wells-fargo-citi.html,Business,BBC,By Stacy Cowley,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14banks-qhmb/14banks-qhmb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T12:30:52+00:00,3e7c6fcd4b9566f97e4d3c32bb9ad5b3f2f06584
78a388359b4e,What Would It Cost to Rebuild Gaza?,"internal tag to designate no storyline, khan younis, israel, palestinians, international relations, middle east, abu dhabi national oil company;adnoc, bp, united arab emirates, israel gaza war, chevron, gaza strip","Andrew here. For the last eight years, I’ve been working on a book about 1929. I sought to write an in-the-room, character-driven narrative about that remarkable period in history, similar to my chronicle of the financial crisis of 2008, “Too Big to Fail.” Along the way, as I combed through transcripts and diaries in the archives, the parallels between the economics and politics of the 1920s and of today became almost eerie. As “1929” publishes on Tuesday, I’ve written an essay for The New York Times Magazine , which will be in print this weekend, about some of those connections. This isn’t to say we will see a repeat of 1929. But there are some important lessons from that period that we shouldn’t forget to keep that from happening. Peace, and deals, in the Middle East? President Trump on Monday declared the war in Gaza over , even as big questions lingered over whether the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas would lead to a lasting peace. The obstacles are many. Regional powers remain far apart on Gaza’s future. Security on the ground is precarious, with no clear idea of how to disarm fighters. And then there are the questions of what it will cost to rebuild, and who will pay. But optimists hope that if the war ends, peace in Gaza could usher in a new wave of deal-making, including for mega-projects that had been frozen during the war, Vivienne Walt writes. Some big deals were affected by the fighting. BP and the Abu Dhabi-based ADNOC were closing in on an agreement to acquire a 50 percent stake in the Israeli company NewMed Energy, which oversees some of the mammoth natural gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean. But the $2 billion deal was suspended last year as Israeli bombs pummeled Gaza. “It was just too toxic for the U.A.E. to deepen economic relations with Israel at the time,” Jamie Ingram, a Middle East analyst and managing editor of the economic newsletter MEES, told DealBook. “This peace agreement could start to unlock investments,” he added. The war did not stifle all business in the region. Despite the global outrage over the war in Gaza, trade continued among countries that signed the 2020 Abraham Accords . Israel did $3.2 billion in trade with the United Arab Emirates last year, up 11 percent year over year, according to The Times of Israel, citing government statistics. (That excluded software and government-to-government deals.) Among the big focuses of trade: The U.A.E. has invested billions in new data centers to power its artificial intelligence ambitions — infrastructure that could see business from Israel’s tech industry. “You could see some real concrete tie-ups,” Ingram said. Morocco agreed this year to buy $120 million worth of military drones from Israel Aerospace Industries, as Israel was seeking to turn its defense-tech expertise into a booming export. Rebuilding a shattered Gaza will be costly. That effort — including the construction of water and sanitation networks, hospitals, schools and thousands of homes — could cost $53 billion , the World Bank estimated in February. The first projects could start within months , with financial support from Brussels, according to news reports. That may set off a scramble for lucrative contracts, with big potential investors eyeing a huge opportunity. “My concern is you end up with backroom deals with private investment funds, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and Israel,” Hugh Lovatt, an expert on Israeli and Palestinian issues for the European Council on Foreign Relations, told DealBook. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING Wall Street giants report solid results. Just in: JPMorgan Chase easily beat analysts’ expectations on the strength of robust trading revenues and higher investment banking fees last quarter. Shares in Goldman Sachs fell in premarket trading despite the company’s results surpassing Wall Street forecasts. With a blackout on official government data during the shutdown, investors are turning to the banks for clues about the economy. Silver soars while cryptocurrency slides. The precious metal set a record on Monday, hitting $50.13 a troy ounce, as its annual performance outstrips even gold’s. It’s another sign that investors are seeking safe-haven assets amid renewed economic turbulence. Falling on the wrong side of the move is crypto, with Bitcoin sliding 12 percent over the past week and other tokens dropping even more sharply. The C.E.O. of First Brands resigns. Patrick James stepped down from the bankrupt auto-parts maker as the fallout from its collapse continued to spread across the financial industry. James will be replaced on an interim basis by Charles Moore. The spat grows Investors are again weighing the possibility that the Trump administration’s efforts to reach a trade pact with China will come up short. Rhetoric from Washington and Beijing, which has run hot and cold over the past week, has just gotten scalding with the latest comments by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Concerns about those tensions are showing in the markets on Tuesday: Global stocks, S&P 500 futures and crude oil prices are in the red. The latest: Bessent lashed out at China in an interview with The Financial Times, warning that new restrictions on exports of rare-earth and other critical minerals could backfire. “Maybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world,” he told The FT. “If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most.” Hours earlier, Bessent had suggested that relations were fine , even expressing confidence that President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China were still set to meet this month to smooth over some of their differences. Beijing isn’t backing down. “ China’s position is consistent ,” a spokesperson for the country’s Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday. “If there’s a fight, we’ll fight to the end; if there’s a talk, the door is open.” The Commerce Ministry is seen as a hard-liner influence within Beijing, seeking more say on the economy and trade talks, according to The FT, which adds that the ministry’s positions are beginning to alarm some close to Trump’s negotiators. Both sides are continuing to escalate as well: The Trump administration on Tuesday began charging a fee on Chinese ships that dock at American ports, which is meant to weaken China’s global dominance in commercial shipping and shipbuilding. Beijing is imposing sanctions on the American business entities of Hanwha Ocean, a South Korean shipping giant. Shares in Hanwha Ocean fell 6 percent Tuesday in Seoul. Wall Street sees trouble ahead. The S&P 500 could sink by as much as 12 percent (from Monday’s close) if the U.S. and China don’t reach a truce by next month’s deadline, when retaliatory tariffs announced by Trump would kick in, Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, warned on Monday . OpenAI’s tightrope act Another day, another mega-deal by OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT: It signed a partnership with Broadcom — its third with a major chipmaker in a month. But the more transactions that OpenAI strikes, the more complicated the increasingly vast business network around the artificial intelligence giant gets. Monday’s deal further underscores OpenAI’s data center ambitions. The start-up will design chips with Broadcom and plans to start deploying them around the second half of next year. The goal: putting in play about 10 gigawatts’ worth of chips — enough to power millions of households. ( Also involved in the project is Arm , the chip designer controlled by SoftBank, according to The Information. Shares in Broadcom and Arm soared on Monday.) The deal came after OpenAI struck agreements to use several gigawatts’ worth of chips from Nvidia and AMD. Unlike those transactions, no equity is changing hands with Broadcom. OpenAI’s deal-making is setting up a tricky tightrope act: The start-up is building a team of rivals to build out its data centers, leading to some unusual circumstances. For instance, money from the Nvidia investments could arguably be directed toward purchases of AMD chips — and in designing chips with Broadcom, OpenAI is reducing its reliance on Nvidia and AMD. The Nvidia deal will dilute OpenAI’s existing investors , including Microsoft, SoftBank and venture capital firms like Thrive Capital, The Financial Times notes. But OpenAI argues that everyone benefits if the agreement expands business: “Most people would prefer to have a smaller piece of a bigger pie,” an unnamed executive told The FT. Expect more deals from OpenAI. Among them will be ways to further support its data center initiatives, including $25 billion in financing for a 500-megawatt facility in Argentina. There will also be transactions to keep funding OpenAI’s huge running costs, something that skeptics worry about given the company’s enormous losses. But one of the start-up’s big business partners isn’t worried: “Of course” OpenAI can afford to pay $60 billion a year for cloud computing, Clay Magouyrk, a C.E.O. of Oracle, told CNBC. The Nobel Prize that explains how we got rich This year’s Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt for work that explains how the world has sustained — for the first time in history — two centuries of economic growth. In other words, they answer the question: How did humans get so rich ? Mokyr explained that sustained economic growth requires two types of knowledge. The first type is propositional knowledge, which is about knowing why things work, through fields like physics, mathematics and biology. The second is procedural knowledge, which is about knowing how to do things, like cook or operate a loom. At the start of the Industrial Revolution, Mokyr, an economic historian, argued that the two forms of knowledge were applied in a sustained and symbiotic way that led to two centuries of growth. “What Mokyr taught economists is that it’s not knowledge per se that makes the difference, but the way it is organized,” Anton Hughes, a historian, wrote for the Substack “Works in Progress.” Mokyr received one half of the Nobel. Aghion and Howitt explained the role of “creative destruction,” an endless process in which new products displace older products. Aghion and Howitt, who split the second half of the award, argue that “competition for profit is what causes you to put in the effort to make a better product,” Brian Albrecht, the chief economist for the International Center for Law & Economics, told DealBook. “That in turn drives economic growth,” he added. For example, the release of the iPhone decimated BlackBerry’s market share. The laureates warned that growth is not inevitable. Immigration and openness to trade are key components for growth, the winners told The Times . Aghion expressed optimism that A.I. could be a large growth driver, but favored policies that promoted competition and did not consolidate power to just a few winners.

On Tuesday, General Motors said that it would record a $1.6 billion hit to its earnings, mainly to reflect the drop in value of plants, equipment and other assets related to its electric vehicle operations. The pace of sales for battery-powered cars and trucks has been slowing since the beginning of 2024, and is now expected to tumble after Congress and President Trump eliminated, on Sept. 30, a federal tax credit of $7,500 that was available to purchasers of new models. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, G.M. said that it would take a $1.2 billion accounting charge “as a result of adjustments to our E.V. capacity” and a $400 million cash hit related to canceling supplier contracts associated with E.V. investments. G.M. said the $1.6 billion charge would be taken as a special item against its third-quarter earnings. “The reassessment of our E.V. capacity and manufacturing footprint, including our investments in our battery component manufacturing, is ongoing,” the company said in the filing, warning that it was “reasonably possible” that it could face more charges in the future. In recent investor presentations, G.M.’s chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said the company had not yet been able to earn a profit on its electric cars. Now that it expects lower sales, the company is working to focus on making them at lower costs. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A growing number of hotels built in places like former prisons, cult compounds, defunct military installations and graveyards are banking on dark, dramatic histories. There’s real estate and commercial opportunism, for sure. Some hotels have met the demand for narrative with in-house historians . But there’s also a fascination with being immersed in locations where forebears confronted terrible circumstances. Perhaps even the most troubled places can find redemption through thoughtful design and the passage of time. Here are seven places to stay where the mood has a hint of the macabre. Troutdale, Ore. McMenamins Edgefield McMenamins Edgefield , about 15 miles outside Portland, Ore., offers a relaxing atmosphere where guests can sip craft beer, book a massage or swing a golf club. Few guests realize that they’re staying at what was once known as the Cedars, believed to be among the first detention centers for women accused of carrying sexually transmitted infections. The Cedars opened in 1917 as part of a public panic around social hygiene, fueled by the fear of male troops being infected.

adc5c7fe1a9d,Renewable Energy Is Booming Despite Trump’s Efforts to Slow It,"us politics, renewable energy, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, energy industry, wind power, solar energy, nuclear energy, price, federal aid, corporate tax, construction, batteries, electric power, oil and gasoline, natural gas, joe biden, jennifer m granholm","President Trump is poised to preside over a renewable energy boom. Yes, really. The administration and its allies in Congress have rolled back clean energy tax credits and thrown up roadblocks to renewable energy projects — efforts that, in the long run, will mean fewer wind and solar farms will be built than otherwise would have. But any meaningful slowdown in the growth of renewable energy and battery storage in the United States is likely to take a few years. That is because companies are racing to install solar panels, wind turbines and batteries the size of shipping containers before federal tax credits expire or become harder to claim. The pipeline is so big that analysts widely expect the United States to add record — or near-record — amounts of renewable energy and batteries through 2027. BloombergNEF, a research firm, recently raised its forecast for how much wind, solar and batteries the country would add next year by more than 10 percent. “There’s this huge hurry-up that is taking place,” said Thomas Byrne, chief executive of New York-based CleanCapital, which develops, owns and operates solar and battery storage projects. Wind and solar projects must be under construction by July to be eligible for federal tax credits that Congress voted this summer to eliminate, years earlier than previously required. (Battery installations have longer to get started. ) To hit that deadline, many developers have ordered custom power transformers — devices used to increase or decrease voltage — solar panels and other equipment much sooner than they normally would have. Placing such orders is one way to demonstrate to the Internal Revenue Service that a project is underway. Only relatively big companies can afford to spend such huge sums upfront, and analysts expect them to start buying smaller projects whose backers are strapped for cash. To ensure its projects would still qualify for credits, CleanCapital this summer bought about $25 million worth of solar panels it does not yet need. The company plans to store the panels in a warehouse it is renting in San Bernardino, Calif., for $145,000 a month. “This rush is real,” Jennifer Granholm, the energy secretary for President Joseph R. Biden Jr., told reporters recently in New York. “You’ll see an uptick in the next two years, and then you’ll see a diminishment after that, unless something changes.” That so much renewable energy is poised to be built despite federal opposition reflects just how much momentum the sector has — not just because of subsidies, but because there is tremendous demand for new sources of energy. Solar and batteries can be installed much faster than natural gas and nuclear power plants. Solar and batteries have also become cheaper, while the cost of building gas power plants has soared . This year, renewable energy and batteries will make up around 93 percent of the capacity added to U.S. grids, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. “We have never seen this kind of demand, ever,” said Sandhya Ganapathy, chief executive of EDP Renewables North America, a leading energy developer. For that reason, the company’s development plan looks much as it did before Congress rolled back the tax credits, she said. That said, the Trump administration’s efforts to stymie renewable energy will take a toll. Beyond tax credits, there are federal permits, which Mr. Trump has said his administration will not approve for wind or “ farmer destroying Solar .” The Paris-based International Energy Agency recently almost halved its expectations for how much solar and wind energy capacity the United States will add over the next five years. The bulk of that effect will be felt beginning in 2028, the last full year of Mr. Trump’s presidency. Between permits and the time it takes to connect to the grid, companies can pull forward only so many projects. Already, some smaller solar firms are laying off staff or preparing to shut down . Some developers are focusing on building batteries that charge when electricity is cheap and plentiful and release it when energy demand soars. Such batteries are in high demand to help balance the wind and solar projects built in recent years. Meantime, offshore wind has become all but untouchable, largely because of the administration’s attacks on the industry. “This is the death knell of offshore wind,” said David Giroux, chief investment officer for T. Rowe Price Investment Management. “Any time you increase uncertainty around the ultimate return on an investment, you either have to get a higher return to compensate you for that risk, or more likely you just won’t take that risk in the first place.” Ultimately, the loss of renewable energy tax credits is likely to raise energy bills , because it can take years to build alternatives like gas or nuclear power plants. Existing gas plants are also likely to be used more. “There’s not going to be as much supply as expected,” Mr. Byrne of CleanCapital said. “Necessarily, prices will go up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/energy-environment/trump-renewable-energy-batteries.html,Business,BBC,By Rebecca F.

In recent years, Uniqlo’s affordable, well-made basic clothes have struck a chord, especially with younger American shoppers, fueling a rapid business expansion. The United States is now a pillar of the growth strategy of Japan’s Fast Retailing. Mr. Yanai, 76, came of age in postwar Japan, steeped in American culture. He wore Converse and drew inspiration for Uniqlo from casual wear brands like Gap. Conquering the American market is also a matter of personal legacy for Mr. Yanai, whose Uniqlo empire today comprises more than 2,500 stores globally. “I want to succeed in America,” Mr. Yanai said in an interview in a sunlit office in New York’s Meatpacking district. It was the preppy youth styles of the East Coast that opened his eyes to clothing in the 1960s and 1970s, Mr. Yanai said. So, he said of the market, “I feel the most attachment to it.” After opening its first store in New Jersey in 2005, Uniqlo’s North American business didn’t turn profitable until 2022. The market’s expansion since then helped Fast Retailing report a record annual net profit of $2.8 billion on Thursday. In the United States, “finally, we got to the entrance point,” Mr. Yanai said. Yet Mr. Yanai’s optimism is shadowed by his growing alarm over the political and economic direction of the country that played a foundational role in Uniqlo’s identity.

a4c68563296e,U.S. Starts Charging Chinese Ships to Dock at Its Ports,"us foreign policy, international trade, port, tariff, ships and shipping, donald trump, china, us","The Trump administration broadened its trade war with China on Tuesday, as it began imposing fees on Chinese ships docking at American ports. The long-planned action is intended to counter China’s dominance of commercial shipbuilding and help revitalize the United States’ own shipbuilding industry, which has withered over the years. China’s Ministry of Transport threatened retaliation on Friday, saying it planned to hit American vessels with fees when they docked in China. The shipping clash comes as trade relations between China and the United States are again wobbling. Last week, after China announced more stringent restrictions on rare earth minerals , President Trump threatened to impose more tariffs on the country, before tempering his tone somewhat. Supporters of the United States’ shipping measures say that China has used subsidies to gain an advantage in shipbuilding, and that the fees are a way to deter ocean carriers from buying Chinese ships. “Anything we can do to chip away at the disparity in shipbuilding that exists between the United States and China is to our benefit,” said Mihir Torsekar, a senior economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that supports many of Mr. Trump’s trade actions. The fees will take effect the same day as new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets and lumber . The shipping levies stem from a trade investigation started under the Biden administration and must be paid by ships owned by Chinese shipping companies. Non-Chinese shipping lines will have to pay fees when they send Chinese-built ships to American ports. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

c290c49475c3,Trump Ramps Up Trade War as New Tariffs on Lumber and Furniture Take Effect,"international trade, tariff, us politics, wood, donald trump, m farooq kathwari","President Trump ushered in new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets and lumber on Tuesday, adding a fresh round of levies as he once again threatened to expand his trade war with China. Tariffs ranging from 10 to 50 percent on foreign wood products and furniture snapped into effect just after midnight. The tariffs are meant to encourage more domestic logging and furniture manufacturing. But critics say the levies will raise prices for American consumers and could slow industries including home building that rely on materials from abroad. The tariffs add to import taxes that President Trump has already imposed on cars, steel and other goods. And they take effect as Mr. Trump is engaging in a high-stakes game of chicken with China, one of America’s biggest trading partners, which could end up derailing trade and slowing the U.S. economy. On Friday, the president said he might impose an additional levy of 100 percent to all products from China beginning Nov. 1. Beijing last week placed restrictions on its exports of rare earth minerals, which could be crippling for American and European makers of semiconductors, electric vehicles and other products. The S&P 500 index ended Friday down more than 2 percent, its steepest one-day slide in six months. But stocks rebounded strongly Monday after a social media post by Mr. Trump saying, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” “Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment,” the president wrote early Sunday. “He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” On Sunday, the president appeared to walk back some of his earlier threats. He said “right now” the plan was to put tariffs on China on Nov. 1 but also added: “Let’s see what happens. November 1st is an eternity.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that China was “purposefully not buying our Soybeans ,” calling it an “Economically Hostile Act,” and that in retribution the United States was considering terminating cooking oil imports from China, as well as potentially other business. The United States “can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves,” he said. On Tuesday, Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said on CNBC on that U.S. and Chinese officials had discussed the rare earths issue as recently as Monday, and that whether the United States chose to impose the tariffs on Chinese products would depend on Beijing’s next moves. “We can’t have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place where they want to have veto power of the world’s high-tech supply chains,” Mr. Greer said. The Trump administration on Tuesday also started imposing fees on Chinese-owned ships docking in American ports, to try to revitalize American shipbuilding. China’s Ministry of Transport threatened retaliation on Friday, saying it planned to hit American vessels with fees when they docked in China. On Tuesday, the Chinese government placed sanctions on five subsidiaries of Hanwha, a South Korean company that is helping the United States build ships. The president is facing a legal challenge at the Supreme Court that could declare his tariffs on China, as well as other countries, illegal. The court case does not pertain to the president’s tariffs on furniture and lumber, which were issued under a different national security-related trade law, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Some critics have called it a stretch to issue the furniture and lumber tariffs under that law. A proclamation put out by the Trump administration in late September said wood products were “used in critical functions of the Department of War,” including building infrastructure for personnel and for transporting munitions, and therefore deserved protections. Scott Lincicome, the vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, wrote in a blog post this week that the idea was “absurd.” “If war broke out tomorrow, there would be zero concern about American ‘dependence’ on foreign lumber or furniture, and domestic sources would be quickly and easily acquired,” he said. The tariffs going into effect on Tuesday include: 10 percent on imported wood and timber, much of which the United States gets from Canada. 25 percent on imported upholstered furniture, including sofas and chairs, which is set to rise to 30 percent on Jan. 1. 25 percent on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, set to rise to 50 percent on Jan. 1. Some American manufacturers lobbied for the tariffs, saying they need protection from a flood of low-priced foreign goods that threaten to put them out of business. But the tariffs will pose a challenge for many retailers that import products from around the world. Farooq Kathwari, the chief executive of Ethan Allen, a furniture retailer, said his company was better positioned than most because it manufactured nearly half of its products in the United States. Much of the rest is made in Mexico and Honduras. “Tariffs are affecting us less, but it certainly is going to affect our industry,” he said. Some manufacturing is likely to move back to the United States because of tariffs, Mr. Kathwari said, but it will take time. The high cost of labor is among the challenges that have made it difficult for Ethan Allen, which has factories in Vermont and North Carolina, to make furniture in the United States, he added. In particular, high medical costs are making America “very uncompetitive,” he said. “Getting manufacturing started in the U.S. isn’t easy,” Mr. Kathwari continued. “We have all these hurdles.” Arin Schultz, the chief growth officer at Naturepedic, an organic mattress and furniture manufacturer, said he was raising prices and considering switching suppliers to deal with the tariffs. The company makes its mattresses at its factory in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, but it imports furniture and materials including textiles from Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Pakistan. Naturepedic also planned later this year or early next year to start selling an organic upholstered headboard made in India, which would be subjected to Mr. Trump’s tariffs on upholstered wooden furniture. Even before the latest tariffs on wooden products, the company intended to raise prices 5 to 10 percent on average on its products beginning in November now that it has exhausted the stock of raw materials it bought before tariffs took effect. “We’re not trying to pass the cost off to our consumers completely,” Mr. Schultz said. “We’re still going to be eating a good amount of it.” Some economists expect that the higher price of lumber, along with home furnishings, will slow the pace of home building in the United States. That could set back the Trump administration’s goals of improving a weak housing market. “It runs counter to the goals of making housing more affordable,” said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, a real estate brokerage. “In the end, you’re just going to get fewer homes built.” Anirban Basu, the chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade association, said the tariffs could benefit some domestic producers including custom upholsters, domestic cabinet makers and carpenters. But many of these industries are labor intensive, making it hard to manufacture in a country like the United States where labor costs are high. “What that means is, the prospects of those forms of production moving to America are rather slender,” Mr. Basu said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/economy/trump-tariffs-lumber-furniture-china.html,Business,BBC,By Ana Swanson and Sydney Ember,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14dc-tariffs-glfz/14dc-tariffs-glfz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T04:01:05+00:00,565cd2167c2f2682e6e0b82e2b60de2dca1b09f8

One is a provision stating that journalists could be deemed a “security risk” based on several considerations, including whether they disclose classified or even unclassified information without the Pentagon’s authorization. Media lawyers worry that the stricture could expose reporters to punishment for engaging in routine reporting. The document replaces a simpler, one-page form that outlined access limitations for journalists, according to the Pentagon Press Association. Implementation of the new policy is on a fast track: Journalists have until Tuesday at 5 p.m. to decide whether or not to sign the form. Those who do not must turn in their credentials a day later. Other news outlets, including The Guardian and CNN, have also said they would reject the policy. The announcements reflect the news media’s wide-ranging frustration with efforts by Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, to curtail the physical movement of reporters in the building and impose fresh limits on their activities.

edde82dc1f69,"First Brands’ C.E.O. Steps Down, While Its Accounting Is Questioned","first brands, bankruptcy, debt, banking and finance, jefferies group, ubs, blackrock","The embattled chief executive of First Brands, an American auto-parts maker that filed for bankruptcy last month amid an uproar over its lending and accounting , resigned on Monday. Patrick James, a Malaysian-born businessman who founded First Brands more than a decade ago in Ohio, stepped down as the company said it would focus on “stabilizing” its global operations while undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. First Brands named Charles Moore as its interim chief executive. Since September , Mr. Moore had been the company’s “chief restructuring officer,” and has been involved in reorganizing the troubled enterprise. “Mr. James has always prioritized the company’s interests above his own, and he remains deeply committed to the success of the business and the maximization of value for the benefit of its customers, suppliers, employees and lenders,” a spokesman for Mr. James wrote in an email. A manufacturer of car parts including oil filters, spark plugs and windshield wipers, First Brands grew rapidly from its 2013 founding and used loans to acquire 15 competitors. As of last year, the company said it employed 26,000 people and had sales of around $5 billion. But some of First Brands’ creditors say the auto-parts empire was built on questionable accounting practices, which have drawn attention to the big banks that aided its financing. These include Jefferies, UBS and BlackRock. Last week, representatives for one of First Brands’ creditors said in a court filing that as much as $2.3 billion of assets had “simply vanished.” Total losses could be in the billions of dollars, and the bankruptcy has raised concerns about the fast growth over the past decade of the loosely regulated private credit market. While First Brands held $6 billion in high-yield, or “junk,” debt on its balance sheet, its current crisis stems from “off balance sheet” debt from private credit lenders. This summer, when the company hired Jefferies to help renegotiate the terms of the debt on its balance sheet, its lenders began asking further questions about its finances, discovering that it had been carrying billions of dollars in additional loans. In court filings, some of First Brands’ lenders said this private debt had not been fully disclosed. Lenders also say the company pledged the future proceeds from some of its unpaid invoices to multiple creditors. “Our immediate priority is to ensure stability and dependability for our employees, customers, and partners,” Mr. Moore, First Brands’ new leader, said in a statement.

The streaming service quietly acknowledged the subtle branding change on Monday in the ninth paragraph of a news release announcing a Dec. 12 streaming date for the Brad Pitt summer blockbuster “F1: The Movie.” “Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity,” it said without further elaboration. Apple’s website , though, was still referring to the streaming service as Apple TV+ on Monday afternoon. With the change, Apple TV will no longer be part of the lengthy roll call of streaming services that use the plus sign, including AMC+, Discovery+, Disney+, ESPN+ and Paramount+. (For a few weeks in 2022, there was also CNN+ .) Apple still has Apple Fitness+ Apple News+ and iCloud+. For many streaming services, the naming convention of adding a “plus” signaled an expanded and exclusive list of offerings beyond the standard service. But that was never the case for Apple TV. Apple TV Plus — its full name at birth — began streaming on Nov. 1, 2019, putting the tech company in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO. It received a lot of attention for “The Morning Show,” a star-studded news drama, but it carried seven other new series as well. In addition to “The Morning Show,” Apple TV+ scored a major success with the 2021 film “CODA,” the first movie from a streaming service to win the Oscar for best picture . The heartwarming fish-out-of-water soccer comedy “Ted Lasso,” starring Jason Sudeikis, will return for a fourth season, Apple TV announced in March. There is potential for confusion with the rebranding, because Apple also offers a set-top box and a content-aggregation app with the name Apple TV. The company did not respond to a request for comment on Monday afternoon. When a rival streaming service, HBO Max, changed its name to Max two years ago, there was widespread confusion within the entertainment industry and among consumers. In May, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that the streaming service would be renamed again, restoring the app’s old name. It’s once again HBO Max .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/business/apple-tv-no-plus.html,Business,BBC,By Adeel Hassan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13xp-applet1-cpqv/13xp-applet1-cpqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T20:52:54+00:00,a44a2b2a911040746ded0a405428088514b5fc52

Accident","lendingtree, car crash, atv;off-road vehicles, obituary, douglas r lebda","Doug Lebda, the chief executive and chairman of LendingTree, an online loans marketplace, died on Sunday after an all-terrain vehicle accident on his family’s North Carolina farm, according to a company spokeswoman. He was 55. LendingTree, which Mr. Lebda founded nearly 30 years ago, named its chief operating officer, Scott Peyree, as its new chief executive. “Doug was a visionary leader whose relentless drive, innovation and passion transformed the financial services landscape, touching the lives of millions of consumers,” the company’s board said in a statement. Mr. Lebda started LendingTree in 1996 after a bad experience trying to obtain a mortgage for a home in Pittsburgh. He based the company in Charlotte, N.C., and quickly made the city his home, recalled Pat McCrory, formerly the mayor of Charlotte and governor of North Carolina. “He loved to talk politics and I loved to talk politics, and we became a good match,” said Mr. McCrory, who sat on LendingTree’s board before he was North Carolina’s governor. He recalled Mr. Lebda resisting the pull of relocating the company to other cities and praised him for his contributions to entrepreneurship in the state. LendingTree went public during the dot-com boom and was later acquired by IAC in 2003, taking Mr. Lebda to New York. Five years later, IAC spun off the company, allowing Mr. Lebda to take the helm again. A football fan, Mr. Lebda was also a minority owner of his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers. Mr. Peyree called the news of Mr. Lebda’s death “devastating.” “I look forward to leading our team and continuing our shared vision with Doug into the future,” he said in a statement. Mr. Lebda is survived by his wife, Megan, and his three daughters, Rachel, Abby and Sophia. “Our hearts are broken, but we are also deeply grateful for the love and support that has poured in from across the world,” Ms. Lebda said in a statement. “Doug’s legacy will continue in the company he built, the lives he touched, and the example he set for all of us to lead with kindness, courage, and compassion.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/business/doug-lebda-lendingtree-accident-death.html,Business,BBC,By Ryan Mac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/business/13BIG-LENDINGTREE/13BIG-LENDINGTREE-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T18:09:21+00:00,5a4d52619499b4c632b057204ac02fdabc37bc04
a26ef3e4e385,Investors Fear the Return of the U.S.-China Trade War,"internal tag to designate no storyline, international trade, donald trump, china, soybeans;soy, rare earths, artificial intelligence","Andrew here. Lots of news this a.m. We dive into the latest in the U.S.-China trade battle, and JPMorgan Chase just announced a huge new financial commitment in the U.S. I also spoke to Stan Druckenmiller by phone about the U.S.’s $20 billion bailout of Argentina’s economy. Some critics conjectured that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent did this to rescue the investments of his friends on Wall Street. One of the people who was reported to have been a big holder of Argentina equity or debt was Druckenmiller, who worked with him at George Soros’s investment firm. That speculation was wrong, Druckenmiller told me. He had been a large holder of Argentina equity or debt — past tense — in the spring and the summer, as indicated in a regulatory filing . But he told me that he sold out of his position before the U.S. government injected money, and therefore wasn’t a beneficiary of the rescue. Indeed, he said that unfortunately for him, he sold the very last part of his stake just before the announcement. “While I did not have a position in Argentina when the Treasury currency intervention was announced, I am rooting for Milei as a beacon of capitalism and think his success is absolutely in America’s interest,” Druckenmiller told me, referring to President Javier Milei of Argentina. Trade trouble S&P 500 futures, crypto and oil prices have all rebounded this morning as investors again pin their hopes on Washington and Beijing dialing back trade tensions. That is a stark reversal from Friday’s sell-off after President Trump spooked markets by threatening to impose steep tariffs on China, apparently in retaliation for Beijing erecting new trade barriers on exports of rare earth materials and magnets. The latest: Trump tried to calm nerves yesterday, writing “ Don’t worry about China , it will all be fine!” on social media. He added that President Xi Jinping of China “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I.

2ca6339b0ca5,Three Share Nobel in Economics for Work on How Technology Drives Growth,"nobel prize, economics, internal-open-access-from-nl, philippe aghion, joel mokyr, peter howitt","The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded on Monday to Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University; Philippe Aghion of Collège de France, INSEAD and the London School of Economics; and Peter Howitt of Brown University for their work on how innovation drives economic growth. The three economists shared the prize for research that explains the relationship between technological progress and sustained economic growth that has improved living standards, health and quality of life for people around the world. The prize committee said that their work would help ensure that growth was maintained and could be steered in the direction to support humankind. For most of human history, there was very little economic growth, John Hassler, the chair of the prize committee, said in a ceremony announcing the award. Despite important discoveries that improved living conditions, growth leveled off. But over the past two centuries, that changed. “Sustained economic growth, driven by a continuous stream of technological innovations and improvements, has replaced stagnation,” Mr. Hassler said. The award for the economists’ work comes as artificial intelligence has become an increasingly dominant force in the global economy and has the potential to spur another technology-driven boom. But other policies are expected to restrain economic growth, such as the Trump administration’s tariffs and protectionist policies like China’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals and battery-making equipment. On Monday, the laureates warned against policies that could hamper growth, including by restricting immigration and erecting trade barriers. Mr. Mokyr, an American-Israeli, also teaches at Tel Aviv University, was awarded half the prize for his work in explaining how sustained economic growth became the norm. He showed that for innovations to succeed and become a self-generating process, people needed a scientific explanation for why the breakthroughs worked. Before the industrial revolution, a lack of this knowledge made it difficult to build on new discoveries, the committee said. Mr. Mokyr’s work, such as his book “A Culture of Growth: Origins of the Modern Economy,” has also emphasized the importance of society being open to new ideas and allowing change. Mr. Mokyr was at his vacation home in Western Michigan when he got the news of his prize. In an interview with The New York Times, he said he was preoccupied by the news of Israeli hostages being released and had forgotten the Nobel Prize announcement until he noticed congratulatory emails and a missed call from Sweden. “Then I called them and they told me the good news,” he said. Mr. Mokyr said he was optimistic about the prospects for more economic growth because of the “human capability of manipulating and harnessing the forces of nature to its own needs.” Science is enabling greater understanding of how to use the laws of nature effectively, he said, adding that humanity’s ability to discover new phenomena is leading to “all kinds of things that we never dreamed about before, including artificial intelligence, mRNA and genetic engineering.” The last two decades have been “an age of radical innovation,” he said, adding that he expected those advances to continue. Mr. Aghion and Mr. Howitt shared the other half of the award for what the committee described as “the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction.” They built a mathematical model for growth, with creative destruction as a core element. The committee described creative destruction as “an endless process in which new and better products replace the old.” They used the example of the telephone, in which each new version made the previous one obsolete, from the rotary dial phone in the early 1900s to today’s smartphones. Mr. Aghion and Mr. Howitt’s work shows how economic growth can continue despite companies being sidelined by the innovation of other firms. Their work can support policymakers in creating research and development policies, the committee said. The laureates’ work shows “we should not take progress for granted,” Kerstin Enflo, a member of the Nobel committee, said during a news conference in Stockholm. “Instead, society must keep an eye on the factors that generate and sustain economic growth,” she added. “These are science-based innovation, creative destruction and a society open for change.” Mr. Aghion said that the prize came as “a huge surprise.” “I can’t find the words to express what I feel,” he added by telephone at the news conference in Stockholm. A Swedish reporter broke the news to Mr. Howitt, he said in a news conference arranged by Brown University, adding that he was thrilled but “somewhat in shock.” He said that his work on creative destruction dated to the theories of Joseph Schumpeter, a 20th century Austrian economist, but he added there was still “conflict at the heart of economic growth” because innovations also lead to job losses. That conflict still needs to be solved, he said. All three laureates all warned about government policies that could suppress innovation and restrict economic growth. The biggest advances in technological progress have involved cooperation between governments, universities and businesses, Mr. Howitt said, “and I hope that will continue in the future, although I see dark clouds ahead.” People who invest time and money in knowledge are compensated by patents and peer recognition, a system that requires a “government that considers science and technology to be high priorities,” Mr. Mokyr said in the interview. “Those things are no longer as self-evident as they used to be,” he added. Some governments are pro-growth and innovation, like China, but others appear more skeptical, he said, without naming a government. Innovation can solve two of the world’s biggest challenges, climate change and aging populations, he said. And for that innovation to take place, the government has to encourage science and “create an environment in which the best and the brightest can do the work that they need to do,” including immigration, Mr. Mokyr said. “Any policy that discourages immigration, at any level, in my view is harmful to our hopes for continued innovation and progress.” Mr. Aghion said in the news conference that forces like protectionism and tariffs are obstacles for growth. Trade barriers and deglobalization make markets more fragmented and reduce opportunities to exchange ideas, he said. “Openness is a driver of growth,” Mr. Aghion said, adding that he sees “dark clouds” accumulating. “I’m not welcoming the protectionist wave in the U.S.,” he said. He also called on European countries not to let the United States and China become the world’s only technological leaders, and to encourage high-tech innovations of their own. Considering the threats to economic growth, Mr. Aghion said there needed to be innovation to support green growth, because companies would not “spontaneously” pursue it. At the same time, artificial intelligence had “fantastic” growth potential, but there needed to be competition policy so that A.I. innovators would not stifle rivals, he said. “Those are very exciting questions that keep us busy,” he said. Who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2024? Last year, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson shared the award for their work on how institutions are formed and contribute to a country’s prosperity. Who else has won a Nobel Prize this year? The prize in physiology or medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries about immune systems. The award for physics was given to John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis for their work in quantum mechanics and electric circuits. The prize for chemistry was shared among Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi for the development of metal-organic frameworks. The literature prize went to Laszlo Krasznahorkai , a Hungarian novelist, for his “compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art.” The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to María Corina Machado , an opposition leader in Venezuela, for “tireless work promoting democratic rights.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/business/nobel-prize-economics.html,Business,BBC,By Eshe Nelson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13biz-nobel-econ1-kjzp/13biz-nobel-econ1-kjzp-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-13T09:56:28+00:00,85155911a7bef9575f83c5cd3b56222f48c355ba

Last year, a start-up called Swarm Defense Technologies moved into an 8,000-square-foot section of the building to begin making drones for defense. By this summer, demand for its drones had grown so rapidly that the company took over the entire 14,000-square-foot factory. Today, 47 Swarm employees work in the cavernous space pumping out thousands of drones each month for the U.S. military and other clients. The drones, a little over 10 inches long and less than two pounds, can be used to test anti-drone systems and to simulate attacks. That has made Swarm’s factory a hive of activity in an area where dozens of “For lease” signs are visible. “There was a huge demand for drones like ours to provide targets for anti-drone systems or to train drones on,” said Kyle Dorosz, 33, a co-founder of Swarm. He added that “everything about making drones in this place feels right,” since it was “in the DNA of this place.” Swarm is one of hundreds of defense technology companies that are reviving manufacturing in once-vibrant industrial cities across the Midwest and Northeast. Drawn by local talent, cheap labor and state cash incentives, these companies are building the weapons of the future in old factories or are constructing state-of-the-art sites in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Delaware. In January, Anduril, an artificial-intelligence-backed weapons manufacturer, announced that it was building a $1 billion factory in Ohio to make drones and other A.I.-enabled weapons. It has since said it also plans to open factories in Rhode Island and Mississippi. Regent, a shipbuilding start-up, is constructing a factory in Rhode Island to make electric sea gliders for military purposes. And UXV Technologies, a Danish drone and robotics company, opened a manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania last year. The locations of the factories are not just good business but also good politics. President Trump, who has unveiled major defense projects since taking office, has pushed for more domestic manufacturing while levying steep tariffs on imported goods. He has also barred the U.S. military from buying products like drones from foreign adversaries such as China. At the same time, state lawmakers and local representatives are eager to attract defense tech firms to create jobs. “America is waking up to the fact that our national security depends on making more stuff in America,” said Senator Jon Husted, Republican of Ohio, adding that places like his state “have a competency in making things.” Mr. Husted, whose father worked at a General Motors factory that later shut down, said he was “thrilled” when he heard about Anduril’s Ohio project this year. “I’ve seen the other side of this, where it was tough going for manufacturing for a long time,” he said. Christian Garrett, an investor at the venture capital firm 137 Ventures, which has invested in defense tech companies including Anduril and Palantir, said he had pushed start-ups to think strategically about where to construct their factories. Industrial towns in the Midwest and Northeast are appealing because building there can help to curry favor with the federal government and military, he said. “We’re looking at the government and the Pentagon as the end customer,” Mr. Garrett said, adding that the government sees “that supporting these companies means bringing valuable jobs to these states.” With advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, young defense tech firms will probably never employ hundreds of thousands of laborers. Still, Mr. Garrett said, the companies can train workers in skills that could translate to other tech jobs. Deciding to build a factory in Ohio was easy, said Zachary Mears, Anduril’s senior vice president of strategy. The company already had a factory at its headquarters in Costa Mesa, Calif., but needed to expand to meet demand for its products. Ohio offered a $310 million grant and tax-incentive package, he said. The facility, which is being built from scratch, is expected to be completed early next year. At five million square feet, the space will be modular so it can be configured for production of different products. Anduril said it would employ 4,000 people there. “The access to work force, the existing infrastructure and the logistics of the site all just made sense,” Mr. Mears said. Workers in former factory towns often have unique skills for defense tech companies, said Billy Thalheimer, the chief executive of Regent. His start-up is building a factory on the coast of Rhode Island near North Kingstown, partly because residents have generations of experience in boatbuilding. “Rhode Island is actually Mecca for this kind of talent,” said Mr. Thalheimer, 33, adding that it was more affordable to hire locally than to relocate people with boatbuilding expertise from out of state. In March, his company signed a $10 million deal to supply the Marine Corps with its vessels. Maddie Macfarlane, a former Navy officer, said she joined Regent last year as a global supply manager because the job allowed her to continue living in Rhode Island and doing work she believed in. The state’s boatbuilding heritage meant “there are lots of skilled workers,” she said, adding that the nearby Naval War College helped create a “pipeline for defense.” But Aaron Slodov, the chief executive of Atomic Industries, a manufacturing firm in Warren, Mich., who co-founded a conference dedicated to domestic manufacturing , cautioned that building in former industrial towns “takes time and long-term planning.” Companies face supply chain complexities, and it can take years to manufacture at large volumes, he said. Still, companies like Swarm offer a case study of what can happen. Mr. Dorosz and Ryan Sigmon, who were drone enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, founded the start-up as Firefly in 2017 to make drones for light shows. It largely sold drones to local entertainment companies. Last year, Mr. Dorosz and Mr. Sigmon decided to shift to making drones for defense purposes and renamed the company Swarm. They found the empty factory in Auburn Hills, which Qualcomm had used for making wireless computer chips. The space was easily converted to build drones, thanks to local welders and workers who had experience building assembly lines, Mr. Sigmon said. The Army, the Air Force and the Navy now buy the drones, which each take under five minutes to make, Mr. Dorosz said. Swarm still makes drones for entertainment purposes as well, he said. “We’re just excited to be making this here,” he said of the factory. Nearly every person working there had a parent or a grandparent who worked on an assembly line at one of the auto factories nearby, he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/technology/defense-tech-manufacturing-midwest-northeast.html,Business,BBC,By Sheera Frenkel and Kenny Holston,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/26/multimedia/RUSTBELT-SWARM-04-zlcq/RUSTBELT-SWARM-04-zlcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:01:06+00:00,da40103c4abf415e1d64d171eebf6bc1457148f3

He would take his bond salesmen to lunch at the Bankers Club, perched atop the Equitable Building at 120 Broadway , and point to the city below, stretched out in miniature. “There are six million people with incomes that aggregate thousands of millions of dollars,” he’d say. “They are just waiting for someone to come to tell them what to do with their savings. Take a good look, eat a good lunch and then go down and tell them.” For Mitchell, finance and the new instruments of wealth — stocks, margin loans, investment trusts and even exotic foreign bonds — were not to be hidden away but promoted like any other product. “It has always seemed to me that there is, and always has been, too much mystery connected with banking,” he liked to say. He wasn’t alone in preaching the gospel of access. John Raskob — a top executive at General Motors, a born promoter and the man who built the Empire State Building — famously declared, “Everybody ought to be rich!” He explained: “I didn’t see why the working men and women of our country should not be let in on the tremendous profits being made in America today.” Raskob set out to create one of the first mutual funds, explicitly designed to give “the little fellows” a chance to join the boom. Nearly a century later, we are in the grip of a sweeping new age of financialization and innovation — the boldest transformation in money and investing since the 1920s — that is also driven by the idea of expanding access to markets. Private equity, venture capital and private credit, once the preserve of institutions and wealthy individuals, are now about to be repackaged for the masses, even woven into 401(k) retirement plans. Crypto tokens are being sold as a way to buy slices of private firms like SpaceX and OpenAI, in the gray zone of securities law. It all comes amid a new stock boom, fueled by a mania for A.I., and with a new administration in Washington that is determined to loosen rules — creating a permissive spirit similar to the one that passed for innovation in the 1920s. The Trump administration is working on rolling back key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, easing capital requirements for midsize banks and sidelining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — an agency born after 2008 to police predatory lending. Congress, for its part, has advanced measures like the Genius Act and, more recently, the so-called Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act — billed as modernization and, in practice, opening the gates for crypto and other speculative products.

Where he once called the Police Department racist, he now says he esteems police officers and owes them an apology. (He has yet to deliver a public one, though he said on “The View” that he had begun privately apologizing to some of the department’s roughly 30,000 officers.) Where he once opposed the test required to attend the city’s specialized high schools, he now says he would keep it. He also says he now recognizes the “ important role ” the private sector plays in addressing the city’s housing crisis . He makes a point of publicly embracing Dan Doctoroff, a deputy mayor for economic development in Mr. Bloomberg’s administration, and of expressing concern about real estate insurance costs. In a sparse conference room with rickety chairs at his Manhattan headquarters, Mr. Mamdani has addressed anxiety about his inexperience by saying he hopes to surround himself with a Lincolnesque team of rivals not afraid to express differing opinions. He has said he would emulate parts of Mr. Bloomberg’s managerial style. “When I met him the first time, I shared with him a quote by Aristotle,” Sally Susman, a senior Pfizer executive, said. Ms. Susman, who emphasized that she was not speaking on Pfizer’s behalf, later helped organize two sessions with business executives and Mr. Mamdani. In the first session, he repeated the Aristotle quote back to her, she said. “He is a good listener, he is smart and he picks up on things.” Some businesspeople have refused to meet with Mr. Mamdani for fear it will leak out and be seen as an endorsement. Even so, Mr. Mamdani has spoken briefly with Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and met with Kenny Burgos, who runs an association that represents landlords of rent-stabilized buildings.

9e3901d38736,Global Markets Whipsaw on Latest Tariff Drama,"us politics, international trade, us foreign policy, tariff, rare earths, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us, internal-open-access-from-nl","Global markets diverged on Monday. Stocks in Asia fell in their first reaction to a renewed outbreak of hostility in the trade war between Beijing and Washington, while markets in the United States and Europe rebounded as U.S. officials began to try to cool tensions. The S&P 500 index rose 1.6 percent on Monday, its biggest rise since May, helping to regain some ground lost in the previous trading session, which had recorded the steepest decline in months . Mr. Trump had posted on social media Friday that he was considering a “ massive increase in tariffs ” on Chinese products and threatened to cancel a planned meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Following the sharp market response, however, Mr. Trump and his allies have struck a more diplomatic tone toward China. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on Fox Business on Monday that the two sides had “substantially de-escalated” and played down the possibility of steep new tariffs. Mr. Trump said on social media on Sunday that the United States did not want to “hurt” China, adding that “it will all be fine!” The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, which is driven by big companies like the chipmaker Nvidia, gained 2.2 percent. Nvidia has been caught up in the fight for technological primacy between the United States and China. Markets in Europe also traded mostly higher, with the Stoxx 600 index up slightly. But stocks in Asia fell on Monday — in the first chance for investors to respond to Friday’s development — with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropping roughly 1.5 percent. Benchmark indexes in South Korea and Taiwan fell about 1 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index also declined slightly. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday. Monday’s losses in Asia were less than those in U.S. markets on Friday. Mr. Trump’s latest threats, which included a 100 percent tariff on Chinese products starting on Nov. 1, came in response to China’s announcement that it would curb exports of some rare-earth minerals needed to make high-tech products including semiconductors, electric vehicles and jet fighters. The recent bout of volatility was the most notable since April, when markets plunged after the United States and China announced that they would impose tariffs of more than 100 percent on each others’ goods. They agreed in May to temporarily slash the tariffs, and investors took that move as a sign that their trade conflict was easing. The softening of Mr. Trump’s Friday tariff threat could be seen as another sign that market declines act as a “consistent brake on policymakers,” Henry Allen of Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Monday. “There are large incentives to avoid sell-offs, and we’ve seen numerous policy reversals under market pressure,” he added. Even so, Beijing’s trade curbs and Mr. Trump’s tariff threats show how quickly calm can give way to confrontation between the world’s two largest economies. The latest developments “raise the possibility that the two countries could once again enter into a trade war,” said Takahide Kiuchi, the executive economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. “If this were to happen, the impact on the global economy would be severe,” he said. The key question for investors is whether the threats are serious or merely attempts to gain negotiating leverage ahead of bilateral talks between China and the United States set for later this month, the investment bank Goldman Sachs wrote in a note. “We lean toward the latter interpretation and expect the ultimate resolution will be an extension of the current tariff pause,” it said. As of last month, the trade tensions with the United States had not slowed Chinese shipments overseas, according to data released by the Chinese government on Monday. In September, overall exports grew 8.3 percent, compared with a year earlier. Shipments to the United States fell 27 percent, but China offset that downturn with strong exports to the European Union, Southeast Asia and Africa. Relations between China and Europe took a hit after the Dutch government said late on Sunday that it was taking control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, because of “ serious governance shortcomings .” Wingtech, the chipmaker’s parent company, said in a filing that it strongly opposed the Dutch government’s action, which it described as driven by “geopolitical bias.” Wingtech’s shares fell 10 percent in Shanghai on Monday. Investors getting to grips with geopolitics are also gauging the impact of the U.S. government shutdown as it approaches its third week. The closure was “starting to affect the real economy,” Mr. Bessent said on Fox Business. Traders are about to get a batch of information about the state of the U.S. economy from companies’ latest quarterly earnings. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson and other economic bellwethers are set to release earnings on Tuesday. JPMorgan said on Monday that it would facilitate some $1.5 trillion in financing and investments over the next 10 years, focused on industries “critical to national economic security and resiliency” in the United States. “It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing,” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive, said in a statement.

The Facebook group was removed by the company “following outreach” by the Department of Justice, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post . The page was used “to dox and target” immigration agents in Chicago, she added. The Facebook group, called ICE Sighting-Chicagoland, had more than 80,000 members before it was removed. Meta spokesman Francis Brennan confirmed on Wednesday that the page was taken down for “violating our policies against coordinated harm,” without providing further details. Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, was the latest tech giant to remove content in response to government pressure. Last week, Apple and Google removed apps used to track immigration agents from their app stores. That included ICEBlock, a free app with hundreds of thousands of users, which let people anonymously share the locations of ICE agents within a five-mile radius. As President Trump has sent ICE agents to conduct raids in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., residents have also relied on Facebook groups to share information on the agents’ whereabouts.

On Tuesday, it took them a step further. Instagram, which is owned by Meta, said it would begin limiting the content its teenage users can see, based on the PG-13 ratings system used by the film industry. The policy, which will roll out by the end of the year, will also apply to conversations with the company’s artificial intelligence chatbots, which lawmakers are investigating for having inappropriate sexual chats with children. By choosing the PG-13 standard, Instagram aims to make its new policy familiar to parents, said Max Eulenstein, the app’s head of product management. PG-13 movies are generally allowed to have some swear words, mild violence and partial nudity, although Meta said it would not recommend content with nudity to teen users. “Our North Star in the teen experience is parents and what they’re telling us they want for their teens, and that’s what led to this development and why we focused on the PG-13 standard,” Mr. Eulenstein said in an interview. Meta, which also owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger, has long contended with concerns over how its apps affect children and has promised to protect minors from inappropriate content since 2008 . Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, has been grilled by lawmakers over child safety issues. Meta faces personal injury lawsuits in state and federal court that accuse it of harming young people with an addicting product. Instagram has hundreds of millions of teenage users, and the changes are its most significant update to teen content moderation since last year’s policy overhaul, Mr. Eulenstein said. As part of those initial changes, the accounts of people under 18 were made private by default, which meant that only followers specifically approved by an account holder could see their posts.

f2722dbe00ce,OpenAI Inks Deal With Broadcom to Design Its Own Chips for A.I.,"computer chip, artificial intelligence, computers and the internet, tech industry, data center, broadcom, openai, nvidia, sam altman","After signing deals to use computer chips from Nvidia and AMD , OpenAI plans to design and deploy its own chips as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars building new computer data centers. The maker of ChatGPT said on Monday that it would build new chips with Broadcom, a chipmaker based in San Jose, Calif. Beginning in the second half of next year, the two companies plan to deploy enough chips to consume 10 gigawatts of electricity, an amount that could power millions of households. OpenAI previously said it would deploy enough Nvidia and AMD chips to consume 16 gigawatts of power. “Developing our own accelerators adds to the broader ecosystem of partners all building the capacity required to push the frontier of A.I.,” OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, said in a statement. The company’s agreement with Broadcom is the latest in a series of deals it has made with various partners as it works to build data centers across the globe. OpenAI is already building a facility in Abilene, Texas , and plans additional data centers in other parts of Texas, New Mexico, Ohio and in the Midwest. OpenAI is among many tech companies that are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the construction of new data centers for artificial intelligence. OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft plan to spend more than $325 billion combined on these facilities by the end of this year alone. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, dominates the market for chips used to power A.I. technologies like ChatGPT. But many companies are now designing chips that aim to challenge its dominance, including tech giants like Google and Amazon, venerable chipmakers like AMD and start-ups like Cerebras and Groq. Google also partners with Broadcom in designing its A.I. chips. OpenAI’s agreements with Nvidia and AMD also provided the start-up with capital needed to build its data centers. Nvidia said it intended to invest $100 billion in the start-up, while AMD agreed to essentially give the company 160 million shares of AMD stock, which could amount to 10 percent of the chipmaker. Broadcom is not investing in OpenAI or providing stock to the start-up. By designing its own chips, OpenAI can reduce its dependence on chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD and gain more leverage as it negotiates agreements with those companies. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in 2023 for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied those claims.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/technology/openai-broadcom-chips-deal.html,Technology,BBC,By Cade Metz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13openai-broadcom-wqpc/13openai-broadcom-wqpc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T13:00:07.545000+00:00,7ba69ff202b0ff309d10f0a3b7548f987cdcd5b8
c4dd417d55d3,The Chicago Rat Hole Was Not Made by a Rat,"chicago, rat, rodents, concrete, sidewalk, squirrel, research, fossil, social media, biology letters journal, your-feed-science","In January 2024, Chicagoans paid their respects to a peculiar attraction: a rodent-shaped hole stamped into a slab of sidewalk on the city’s North Side. Nicknamed the Chicago Rat Hole or “Splatatouille,” the indent became a social media sensation, attracting locals and tourists alike to glimpse the vestige of a vanished vermin. Many filled the hole with offerings like coins, candles and miniature plastic rats. Initially, the origin story of the hole seemed straightforward: a brown rat scurried onto a wet layer of concrete and became trapped. There were no signs of escape, so the rat most likely died and was somehow eventually removed, leaving behind a cavity as the concrete dried. The series of events seemed plausible in Chicago, which was named the country’s “rattiest” city for the 10th year in a row in 2024 by the pest control service Orkin. However, there has been little evidence to tie the rat hole to its eponymous rodent. A team of researchers recently analyzed the anatomical dimensions of the rat hole to identify the critter that left the sidewalk impression. Their findings, published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters , reveal that another rodent is responsible for the hole. “We can affirmatively conclude that this imprint was not created by a rat,” said Michael Granatosky, an evolutionary biomechanist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Dr. Granatosky became aware of the site during a stint in Chicago conducting postdoctoral research. He specializes in studying the evolution of animal movements, and the rat hole reminded him of a modern trace fossil , capturing a moment in time, but with a creature creeping onto wet concrete rather than a floodplain or another prehistoric surface. He thought studying the rat hole may provide insights into interpreting much older traces. However, accessing the physical rat hole proved difficult. The concrete cavity was filled by the city, re-excavated by residents and eventually deposited in City Hall . So the team sifted through photos that had been posted online, which offered views of the impression from several different angles. The team used the coins and other offerings placed inside the hole like scale bars, which helped them calculate the rat hole’s width, and the length from snout to tail of the animal that made it. To put the hole’s dimensions in context, the scientists measured mammal specimens in museum collections. These skins belonged to local rodents like mice, rats, chipmunks and muskrats, as well as several species of squirrel. Statistical analyses revealed that the size and shape of the hole closely aligned with larger-bodied rodents, particularly tree squirrels in the genus Sciurus. The team concluded with nearly a 99 percent likelihood that the rat hole was left by either an eastern grey squirrel or a fox squirrel, both found within Chicago’s city limits. A squirrel creating the hole is not a complete surprise. Unlike nocturnal rats, squirrels are active during the day, when construction workers may pour concrete. The lack of footprints around the impression also makes it likely that the animal landed on the sidewalk from above, perhaps after a fall from a tree. Longtime residents of the neighborhood have confirmed that a tree once stood near the impression. Additionally, it would be difficult for a feature as delicate as a squirrel’s bushy tail to leave a mark in concrete. That the team remains unable to pinpoint the exact species of squirrel that left the mark highlights how difficult it is to connect trace fossils to animals, even when researchers have a creature’s outline to work with, according to Dr. Granatosky. “In the case of a recent example like the Chicago rat hole, we should have no problem identifying the track maker,” he said. “But we were still only able to get it down to the genus.” Winslow Dumaine, a local artist and board game designer who helped embed the rat hole into the public mind with a much-circulated post on X , thinks that correctly identifying the critter that made the hole will not change how Chicagoans view the lost landmark. “The exact dimensions and causality of the Chicago rat hole were not the driving force of the story,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how it was made, but that it brought us together.” He also notes that many Chicagoans still refer to the city’s tallest skyscraper as the Sears Tower despite its name changing to the Willis Tower in 2009 . “Besides, squirrels are just zhuzhed-up rats,” Mr. Dumaine adds. “Don’t let the tails fool you — they eat garbage too.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/science/chicago-rat-hole-squirrel.html,Science,BBC,By Jack Tamisiea,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14HS-tb-rat-hole-wzhp/14HS-tb-rat-hole-wzhp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T23:01:05+00:00,66ea3cd11e6c6ad0f2b8d49c931b9e819611b9bb
664199543dc7,Wildfire Plus Rain Brings Risks. Scientists Are Trying to Warn Residents.,"climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, research, wildfires, landslides;mudslides, rain, la wildfires, tonto national forest, los angeles","The sound of rock shattering echoed across the dry channel in the Tonto National Forest as Jorge Santiago, a 23-year-old geology student, drilled a 10-inch hole in the limestone rock that once cradled a stream. Mr. Santiago was among the researchers from the University of Arizona who earlier this year inserted pressure transducers, bullet-shaped objects that can be used to measure water levels, into the walls of the dry streambed. They were not expecting the water to return to the stream. Instead, they were using the transducers to measure something else entirely: the possibility that water-laden rocks, soil and debris could barrel downhill from hundreds of miles away after rain falls on an area burned by wildfire. It’s a scenario that emergency managers across the world are increasingly preparing for. As nations continue to burn fossil fuels and generate the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet, the risks of both extreme wildfire and major rain events are rising. In Southern California this week heavy rains raised concerns of landslides sweeping over fire-scarred terrain. On Tuesday officials issued evacuation orders for more than 100 homes near the 2024 Airport Fire burn scar and the Palisades Fire that struck in January. The orders were lifted by Tuesday evening, but the threat shows the long-lasting dangers of wildfires. Hundreds of miles away from Los Angeles in a pine forest in Arizona, Luke McGuire and a team of researchers spent the summer gathering data to better understand the threats posed by post-fire disasters. Their work comes as research shows that post-fire debris flows could become larger, more destructive, and more common on a hotter Earth, according to a study published last year. Ann Youberg, the environmental geology chief at the Arizona Geological Survey, first installed a pressure transducer after the 2017 Pinal Fire, a fire caused by lightning in a strand of forest in southern Arizona. Over the last seven years they’ve installed more than 40 pressure transducers, which each cost about $500. They lose about 20 percent, Dr. McGuire said. Data from the pressure transducers is recovered after a debris flow, which can travel at speeds of up to 100 miles an hour, annihilating neighborhoods. In the Southwest, more than 90 percent of debris flows happen during the first two years after a wildfire. Researchers return to the site, and by chain saw, shovel and sheer force, they try to retrieve the rammed-in transducers and upload their data. That information could lead to better modeling of how and where a deadly landslide could strike. “As we see fires expanding into new areas across the Western U.S., they’re happening in areas where we’ve never collected any data,” Dr. McGuire said, “so all of our models are extrapolating.” Researchers from the University of Arizona and the geological survey are trying to add a couple of monitoring sites every year to their portfolio. Their research is becoming more important as fires get bigger and hotter, leaving severely burned soils in their wake. At the same time, a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, dropping heavier rain over the singed soil. That combination of intense burn and intense rain, plus steep slopes, means post-fire disasters could become more dangerous in parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest that have few defenses , like concrete basins carved into the foothills surrounding Los Angeles that can catch debris before it reaches homes. Post-fire hazards like flash floods and debris flows are most likely to occur in areas that have seen moderate to high levels of burning, where the soil is so charred it can’t absorb more water. While debris flows are increasing across the globe, they’re more common in places with more fires, more rain and more mountainous terrain. Brendan Murphy, a geomorphologist at Simon Fraser University, who once worked with Dr. Youberg, has documented an increase in debris flows in British Columbia, where extreme wildfires have been spiking since 2015. The scars from the 2021 Lytton Fire, which burned more than 206,000 acres and a tiny mountain town reliant on tourism , produced roughly 300 debris flows, destroying portions of the Trans-Canada Highway and producing more post-fire hazards than any one wildfire in California, according to Dr. Murphy. With grants from Canada’s Forest Service, he’s started to install monitoring equipment after major fires. With his students, he raked through satellite images of old fires and scoured unpublished government reports looking for historic evidence of debris flows. While an official report in 2020 noted 36 debris flows, by August of 2024, Dr. Murphy had found more than 1,400 post-fire debris flows. “A lot of this increase has to do with the changing fire size and fire severity, but also the convergence of a severe wildfire and then an atmospheric river,” Dr. Murphy said, referring to a patch of very wet air that moves in from the Pacific before hitting the mountains and dumping heavy rain. In addition to the pressure transducers, researchers install rain gauges that measure the intensity of rainfall. Dr. Youberg has been working on ways to help local governments identify strategies to mitigate the threat from a debris flow. “Let’s figure out where the problems are before the fires start,” Dr. Youberg said as she hiked through the Tonto. The growing awareness of debris flows in places like Southern California can also create anxiety among local residents every time it rains. “Our job has gone from not just telling people where the problems might be after the fire, but just as importantly, where and when we don’t have to worry about it,” said Jason Kean, a landslide hazard researcher for the United States Geological Survey. After the devastating fire on Maui , officials asked the landslide hazards program to assess the risk of post-fire debris flows in Lahaina, but because there were no steep slopes nearby, Dr. Kean and his colleagues were able to reassure residents. “I doubt we would’ve been asked to do that 10 years ago because nobody was thinking about it,” Dr. Kean said. “But now they do.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/climate/wildfire-flash-flood-landslide-risk.html,Science,BBC,By Austyn Gaffney and Anna Watts,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/21/multimedia/00cli-fire-landslides-07b-wglt/00cli-fire-landslides-07b-wglt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T17:48:19+00:00,5a059b53798423f80817d0140d0b2dcdd7849e14

The office where Daniel Ksepka was working was overrun with ants. On the wall above the desk were army ants, bull ants, leaf-cutter ants and turtle ants. On a shelf were two honeypot ants that looked as if they had yellow balloons where their stomachs should have been. Kspeka, the curator of science at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn., did not call an exterminator. There was no need to: None of the ants in the office were real. The ones on the wall were drawings. The honeypot ants were plastic models made on the museum’s 3-D printer in preparation for an exhibition called “ Ants: Tiny Creatures, Big Lives ” that will open on Nov. 13. “I love ants,” Ksepka said. “They keep the world running.” Let him count the ways. “They are architects,” he said. “They are farmers.” They construct elaborate nests, stockpile food and tend fungal gardens. Some harvester ants in East Africa even collect bones — the remains of birds, lizards and pygmy mice. Some can snap their jaws shut in one-tenth of a millisecond. But the ones waiting to ruin a picnic or parade across the kitchen floor are usually harmless. “If you take the food away, they’ll go away,” he said.

b8f39a0aba86,Art and Data Team Up Against Climate Change,"art, climate change;global warming, flowers and plants, desert, museum","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. In a digital time-lapse by the London-based artist studio ScanLAB , a tall saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert slowly falls, its parched branches crumbling to the ground. Known to live to 150 years or more, the saguaro is a symbol of resilience, weathering the extremely hot, dry summers in the region by subsisting on water stored from the rainy periods. Encompassing over 100,000 square miles across Arizona, California and northwestern Mexico, the Sonoran Desert is home to an abundance of well-adapted plants like the saguaro. With increasing temperatures and longer droughts, however, these steadfast species are struggling to survive. “In recent years, the Sonoran Desert has been the driest and hottest we’ve seen, and it is expected to get worse,” said Raul Puente-Martinez, research botanist and curator of living collections at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. “We are having to rethink how to care for our plants as the climate changes. When I speak with other botanical gardens, I say that maybe you haven’t seen it yet in your communities, but it’s just a matter of time,” he said. A few years ago, the garden invited ScanLAB to create a digital installation that explores how the changing climate was affecting plants, including the now fallen saguaro. ScanLAB is among a handful of artist-led groups using data to explore the climate crisis, giving visual forms to complex and daunting subjects, not to spark fear but rather to educate on the facts. Using tools like three-dimensional scanners and collaborating with local photographers and scientists, ScanLAB created time-lapse artworks of sites across the garden and the Sonoran Desert — as well as of blooming cactuses scanned inside its studio in London — returning to some places for a full year. The team also featured sites like housing developments encroaching on the garden and straining waterways to highlight potential causes of the changes to the environment. The resulting digital artworks debuting this fall in “Framerate: Desert Pulse” show the fragility of the local flora, as well as its resiliency and beauty, with plants growing and vibrant blooms opening and closing. “It gives you a sense of time outside your perception,” ScanLAB co-founder William Trossell said. “There’s a lovely dance that occurs. Cacti are breathing, moving and are responsive to the environment.” While “Framerate” offers a glimpse of a future that is already occurring in some climates, other artists imagine a world past the point of survival. One such project, the Danish artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen’s “Boreal Dreams” (2025), debuted earlier this year in “Northern Lights” at the Fondation Beyeler near Basel, Switzerland. The digital installation, which exists via an interactive website, features simulations of the boreal forest at five temperatures starting with ambient (usually surrounding temperature) and increasing to nine degrees Celsius when the forest is “only a memory,” says the explanation on the screen. Created with data from the Marcell Experimental Forest — the Minnesota research center studying the effects of global warming — Steensen’s installation envisions desolate futures. While visitors to the Beyeler could watch the forest cycle through climate zones on a screen outside the museum, users who engage with the project’s website have a more intimate interaction, navigating the landscape at each temperature and reading devastating details of how ecosystems deteriorate as the permafrost melts, water evaporates and species disappear. Inspiring a visceral awareness of the changing climate, the work includes a soundtrack designed to summon dreams of the boreal forest. Near Boston, at the MIT Museum, the fiber artist Janet Echelman is taking a more abstract approach to visualizing climate change with her sculptural installation “Remembering the Future” (2025). On view in the museum’s lobby and visible to passers-by, the braided fiber work resembles a three-dimensional web hanging above the stairs. Guided by MIT’s Raffaele Ferrari, professor of oceanography and co-director of the institute’s Lorenz Center for climate research, Echelman used climate data from the last ice age to the present, as well as projected future environments, to create a geometric design. “I am acutely aware of, and overwhelmed by, news about the climate,” Echelman said in an interview. “It feels like data is coming at me and I don’t have the tools to make meaning of it.” To translate this feeling into a visual form, Echelman worked with Caitlin Mueller, MIT associate professor of building technology, whose lab developed a tool to model the netlike structure of Echelman’s knotted and intertwined fibers as complex as the data itself. To accompany the sculpture, Mueller created an interactive tool accessible through a kiosk and website that brought audiences behind the scenes in how she and Echelman engineered the design. “It’s a high-fidelity digital twin of the sculpture generated through our computational simulation that you can orbit and pan through to get perspectives that you can’t see physically in the space,” said Mueller. For Echelman, giving viewers agency to interact with the design is an important part of the piece. “You’re not just looking at the work, you’re being brought in, because you are a designer, too,” she said. “We are all designing the future through our actions.” At the Whitney Museum, “The River is a Circle” (2025), an animation by Marina Zurkow and James Schmitz on the fifth-floor terrace, takes this message further, inviting viewers to see the past, present and future as coexisting. The software-driven artwork illustrates the Hudson River split horizontally to show activity above and below the water, depicting tide levels, sunrise and sunset — calculated by the work itself through existing data — as well as marine traffic and weather obtained from live, external applications. The visuals include Atlantic sturgeon and objects like doughnuts to represent police boats. Others resemble islands carrying iconography of New York’s history from Lenape settlements to today, all shown together without concern for chronology. To these, the artists added potential future scenarios: “One terrible one, if everything is business as usual and one not so bad future,” Zurkow said. In the terrible future, islands with gated and surveilled communities float along the water. In the less dreadful scenario, they carry objects like solar panels emblematic of renewable energy. “There was never going to be a positive future in the work, that’s no longer possible,” Zurkow explained. “But things don’t have to be terrible if we don’t let them. We are part of climate systems, not passive subjects,” she said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/arts/design/climate-change-art-museum.html,Science,BBC,By Annabel Keenan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-climate-2-Stills-02-vljf/19sp-finearts-climate-2-Stills-02-vljf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:00:13.845000+00:00,6ea7aef2a982917fbcd972f64708df0ea8fec847

Arranging suitable accommodations for an unexpected visitor can be a challenge, especially when the guest is 11 feet tall and 27 feet long. The American Museum of Natural History has done it twice in less than a year for one of the world’s largest and most complete stegosaurus skeletons. The skeleton, aptly named Apex, is on loan to the museum. It includes about 80 percent of the dinosaur’s estimated 320 fossilized bones. The time from discovery to display was so swift that the museum was challenged to find space suitable for showing it — though there was never a doubt it would do so. “To get something this complete, in such good shape, is very rare,” said Melissa Posen, the vice president of exhibitions at the New York museum. The museum first installed Apex last December in an atrium of the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation, five months after the hedge fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin bought the 150 million-year-old fossil at auction for $44.6 million , about 10 times the presale estimate. The display gave the public an opportunity to see the elephant-size skeleton, with its distinctive rows of bony plates along both sides of its spine, but there was not enough time for museum staff to prepare informational and educational exhibits, or for paleontologists to fully examine individual fossils. So the institution took Apex out of public view in early September, a museum spokeswoman said, to move the dinosaur, which dates from the late Jurassic period, to a more suitable location. Its new home is adjacent to the museum’s established dinosaur and fossil halls, which also house well-known reptiles like T. rex and titanosaur . Moving Apex to the fourth floor also allowed the museum to include more displays and other information about the dinosaur. The relocation required the fossil’s finder, Jason Cooper, a commercial paleontologist, to remove each fossilized bone from the armature, or metal framework, that gave the assemblage the familiar stegosaurus shape. One of his colleagues, Zoltan Faltay, made the armature to display the fossils at the Sotheby’s auction in July 2024 . When Apex was moved, the armature was taken apart and moved as well. The disassembly of Apex gave the museum’s scientists an opportunity to meticulously document the size, shape and structure of each fossil. That data will be made available to paleontologists around the world and could help them provide answers to fundamental questions about stegosauri, such as how quickly they grew and how long they lived. Apex was scheduled to reopen to the public in its new home in mid- to late- October. It is expected to remain there until late 2028, when Griffin could extend the loan. While Cooper said the move could have been accomplished in less than a week, the museum took Apex off display for more than a month to give scientists time to digitally document each of the roughly 250 fossils comprising it. “This period of a month when the specimen is unmounted, that was our opportunity to study various aspects of the bones,” said Roger Benson, the museum’s curator-in-charge of fossil amphibians, reptiles, birds and plants, early in the move process. “We already had great 3-D surface models on the skeleton, but those models generally don’t tell us what’s restored and what’s original.” Disassembling the dinosaur by extracting each fossil from the armature and nestling them in custom-fitted polyurethane foam pads inside handmade wooden crates took less than two days, as did reversing the process on the fourth floor. Cooper managed the work on both ends with the help of two employees. In the interim, Benson and Robert Smyth, a postdoctoral researcher on a three-year fellowship funded by Griffin, used a variety of processes to gather the fossils’ images. Structured light technology let them make exceptionally detailed external 3-D images and print 3-D copies; infrared scans enabled them to distinguish original fossil bone and keratin from restorative materials; and CT scans revealed the interior structure of each fossil. “It precisely and very fully and clearly shows the difference between real material and restored material in three dimensions,” Benson said. “That’s particularly important for the skull. The skull, you see, has a lot of original material, but it can be quite difficult to tell original from restored material just by looking from the outside.” Collecting as much data as practicable in the limited time available was important because Apex is owned by an individual, not an institution. That has raised concern about how much access scientists will have to such an important fossil find. “The fossil is privately owned, but one of our jobs here is to really precisely record scientific data — accurate, high-resolution scientific data — that can be available in perpetuity,” Benson said at the peak of his data-gathering endeavor. “That’s why this is a really crucial period for us.” Benson also had Griffin’s permission to take a small sample of Apex’s biggest bone, its 45-inch-long femur. The scientist said he was interested in the internal structure of the bone, which grew layer by layer, leaving a record of the animal’s life. “That includes things like annual growth marks, which are a bit like tree rings,” he added. Combining information from Apex, which he described as “a big old individual,” with information from other stegosauri of different sizes and ages could help paleontologists learn more about the life history of the slow-moving herbivores. Apex is unlikely to settle the debate over the purpose of a stegosaurus’s signature physical trait, the ostentatious bony plates running down its spine (likely “ornamental structures similar to plumage on birds or the frill of some lizards,” Benson said). However, Apex may help paleontologists deduce how fast stegosauri grew and how long they tended to live. Judging by its large size and fused vertebrae, Apex had a long life and peaceful death. The skeleton shows no sign of battle wounds or post-mortem scavenging by other animals. “If you combine size, completeness and bone preservation, it is the best stegosaurus I’ve seen,” Rod Scheetz, curator at the Brigham Young University Museum of Paleontology, told The New York Times after inspecting the fossils before they were sold. Cooper said he discovered Apex while he and a friend were looking for fossils on property Cooper owns in Moffat County, Colo., near a town appropriately named Dinosaur. “We actually found two stegosaurs that day,” he said in an interview at the museum at the start of the disassembly process “They were a few hundred meters apart. I initially thought this was the less-complete of the two because he was curled up backwards. His back was sticking out so I thought the whole business end was gone.” So Apex “sat in the ground while we excavated the other one,” Cooper recalled. “He was in the ground for over a year. “Once we got into it we realized he was curled back on himself. It was a super happy time,” he said. “I got everyone — the whole crew — in there and we were able to do all the mapping and excavation in 10 days, because it was October and we didn’t want to leave it over the winter.” Discovering Apex certainly has raised Cooper’s public profile. Displaying Apex is set to do the same for the American Museum of Natural History. Stegosaurus is one of the best-known dinosaurs among the general public, but there’s still a lot to learn. Having a nearly complete skeleton of one can help answer those scientific questions. It is also a spectacle that can make a lifelong impression. “We want people to say ‘wow!’ when they see it,” Posen said.

d21fe90c7d08,A Furious Debate Over Autism’s Causes Leaves Parents Grasping for Answers,"autism, genetics and heredity, parenting, motherhood, fatherhood, doctor, rumors and misinformation, vaccines immunization, tylenol, us politics, robert f. kennedy jr, donald trump, simons foundation","The first time Bill heard the term “autism” applied to his little boy, “it felt like a curse word,” he said. Yes, little Billy was slow to learn language and did not seem to engage with people. But autism? What was in store for him? Would he be able to live independently? Drive a car? Get a job? Marry? And why? Why did his beautiful, 3-year-old toddler have this disorder, Bill, who asked that his last name not be used to protect Billy’s privacy, recalled wondering. “I want to know what causes it,” he told Cathy Lord, a clinical psychologist and autism expert in a three-hours-long Zoom session from her office at the University of California, Los Angeles. Bill, in his apartment, told Dr. Lord that he had gotten a lot of suggestions from friends and relatives, and especially from social media. His wife did not take Tylenol, but could it be red dyes in food that were the culprit? Or, as he saw on TikTok, a lack of vitamin B6? “Do you think it has anything to do with vaccines?” he asked Dr. Lord. Billy is fully vaccinated. For Dr. Lord, such questions are all too familiar. Clinicians who treat autistic children must help their young patients’ families navigate a cacophony of theories and advice. As autism diagnoses have risen over the last decades and debate over its causes has intensified, they have been forced to explain to desperate parents the few knowns and the many unknowns about what leads to autism’s development. Now that the federal government has entered the fray, often giving advice that doctors have to dispute, some families wonder whom they should believe. Joseph Buxbaum, a neuroscientist who studies the genetics of autism, said families of autistic children that he has worked with for a decade or more are not sure what to think when they hear President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, talk about autism, blaming it on discredited theories like vaccines or unproven ones like acetaminophen , the active ingredient in Tylenol. “Even people who trust us and know we disagree vehemently, it affects them,” Dr. Buxbaum, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said. “It’s a shocking time.” Decades of scientific research point most compellingly to genetic mutations affecting brain development as a primary driver of autism. Researchers have already identified hundreds of mutations linked to the disorder. And while most scientists say genetics likely interacts in some way with environmental factors, research has disproved some of the most widespread notions and has produced weak or conflicting evidence for others. Yet Mr. Kennedy, who has referred to the rise in autism cases as an “epidemic,” has been dismissive of genetics research, calling it a “dead end.” “Genes don’t cause epidemics,” he said in the spring . “You need an environmental toxin.” Like other parents, Bill said he had heard plenty about the rising incidence of autism, with cases increasing to one in 31 children from an estimated two to four children per 10,000 in 1980. He has to wonder, he told Dr. Lord, whether the soaring rate indicates that something in the environment is causing the disorder. Not necessarily, Dr. Lord said. “Mostly the numbers are bigger because the categories are so much larger now,” she said. When she began studying autism 50 years ago, she told Bill, the disorder only included the most severe cases. Now there is an autism spectrum that includes people who have trouble reading social cues or making friends, as well as those who are severely disabled. Awareness has also played a large role in the increased prevalence, Dr. Lord said, along with special services for children with an autism diagnosis and increased screening by pediatricians. Assuaging Bill’s fears that maybe he or his wife did something to cause Billy’s autism, Dr. Lord pointed out that autism rates are similar in different countries, despite vastly different environments. Dr. Lord and others who have spent decades studying autism tell their patients that the only consistent and well-documented explanation for autism is mutations in genes critical for brain development. But genetic mutations still only explain about 30 percent of cases, typically those with the most severe forms of the disorder. The role of genes has been known about since the 1970s. Autism, studies found , was more likely to occur in identical twins than in fraternal twins, who do not share the same genetic makeup. A landmark publication in 2007 showed that children with autism were much more likely to have so-called de novo mutations, spontaneous mutations that were not present in their mother’s or father’s genome. Such mutations often occur in the sperm or eggs even before a baby is conceived. The more researchers looked, the more mutations — de novo and inherited — they found. In the most recent work, led by Dr. Buxbaum, an international consortium funded by the National Institutes of Health found, more than 250 different genes that, when disrupted, make profound autism extremely likely. Different people may have different mutations within the same gene, but in every case, the mutations alter the gene’s function. Dr. Buxbaum’s colleague will present the work at next week’s meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. “These are not little flags in the genome that are pointing at some susceptibility,” Dr. Jonathan Sebat, a geneticist at the University of California, San Diego and lead author of the 2007 study, said. “These are causal mutations.” In contrast, studies have so far found only weak evidence for environmental factors — like pollution or certain chemicals — that might contribute to autism. They find correlations, but not causal evidence. Some doctors are increasingly offering genetic testing to parents when their children are diagnosed. Dr. Audrey Brumback, a pediatric neurologist at the University of Texas at Austin, said she offers genetic testing to most of the patients she diagnoses with autism even though, as she cautions the parents, a relevant genetic mutation will be found in only one out of four cases . “Every mother that comes in the door is blaming herself because she had a half a glass of red wine in the second trimester, or took a Tylenol for one headache she had during pregnancy, or had a stressful experience during pregnancy,” Dr. Brumback said. She explains that the chances of finding a de novo mutation go up if a patient has severe autism and other, co-occuring conditions, like epilepsy, movement disorders or an intellectual disability. For patients who receive negative results, she will often suggest getting retested in the future, in case scientists have discovered a new mutation that could be a match. “Finding those answers for families — that in itself is therapeutic,” Dr. Brumback said. Sometimes a genetic diagnosis also helps unlock specific interventions that might help their kids, she added. “They’re searching for a specific condition based on the underlying cause, rather than consuming all of Facebook.” When testing does find a related genetic mutation, some parents who have spent decades wondering why their child developed autism say they have found solace. LeVar Baxter, a police officer who lives in Gerbersville, Pa. said that had been the case for him. When his son, Khalil, was an infant, he hit his developmental milestones ahead of schedule. Mr. Baxter and his wife confidently predicted that Khalil would be walking by the time he was 9 months old. But everything changed when Khalil was about 4 months old. He regressed, losing his developmental skills. Now 21, he is a seemingly happy young man who, Mr. Baxter said, smiles every day. But he does not talk, and he cannot live independently. Mr. Baxter had not been able to put the worries out of his mind. Did he or his wife do something that brought on Khalil’s autism? Was it caused by something in the environment? Or, he wondered, could it be the vaccines his baby received? “We know some people are allergic to milk or to peanuts,” he said. “Is it possible some people are allergic to vaccines?” After seeing a notice that the Simons Foundation was seeking families who would be willing to provide samples for genetic research, Mr. Baxter decided he would do it. “I wanted to know if I had a gene that I’d passed on to Khalil,” he said. Ten years went by. Then, last year, he said, he got a letter from the Simons Foundation. They had found a gene. Mr. Baxter was almost afraid to find out more. That notification, he said, “reset my anxiety.” The mutation, he learned, is a rare one, CLCN4, associated with neurological development and speech. “I couldn’t believe it,” Mr. Baxter said. “The first question I asked was, ‘Was there anything I did or that I could have done differently?’” No, the counselor told him. Her analogy: Carmakers make a million cars a year. One of those cars will have engine troubles from Day 1. “That took a major burden off my shoulders,” Mr. Baxter said. “For a long time, I had carried this guilt, letting doctors vaccinate him. I had blamed myself.” At Dr. Lord’s suggestion, Bill, Billy’s father, also decided he wants genetic testing for his son. He knows that even if a mutation is found, there is not much he can do about it. For now, Dr. Lord told him the good news is that Billy does not have severe autism. But the disappointing news is that she cannot predict what he will be like when he is older. Bill was still sanguine. “My wife says I’m a helicopter dad,” he said, adding, “Whatever I am, I will be there for him.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/health/autism-parents-genetics-vaccines-tylenol.html,Science,BBC,By Gina Kolata and Azeen Ghorayshi,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/00-HS-autism-parents-01-zfpk/00-HS-autism-parents-01-zfpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T15:22:34+00:00,05366c92b02642ded6086d9bed260a8af1d987e9

But on Tuesday dozens of miners and their families will be in a more unusual position: protesting the Trump administration outside the Labor Department building, arguing it has failed to protect them from black lung disease, an incurable illness caused by inhaling coal and silica dust. They have been waiting months for the government to enforce federal limits on silica dust, a carcinogen that has led to a recent spike in the disease. But mining industry groups have sued to block the rule, and the Trump administration has paused enforcement while the lawsuit plays out. Labor unions, Democrats and a growing number of miners accuse the Trump administration of ignoring workers while using hundreds of millions of dollars in federal subsidies to bolster the companies that operate coal plants and mining operations. “The companies might be getting a handout, but the miners ain’t getting none,” said Gary Hairston, 71, a retired coal miner from West Virginia who is the president of the National Black Lung Association. Mr. Hairston has been living with black lung disease since he was in his 40s. Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that President Trump “cares deeply about unleashing America’s energy potential, as well as standing up for those who fuel our country” like coal miners.

Containing the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a decade ago cost the United States $5.4 billion globally and more than $70 million domestically, the strategy report notes , adding, “As we have unfortunately seen all too frequently, an outbreak anywhere in the world can quickly become a threat to Americans.” Yet, the freeze on America’s foreign aid in January disrupted many programs that extinguished outbreaks. Citing “waste, fraud and abuse” at federal agencies, the administration also laid off thousands of scientists, including many who worked on preventing and containing infectious diseases. Since the spring, the administration has restored some programs and rehired some scientists. And on Saturday, it rescinded the layoffs of hundreds of infectious disease experts fired in error just a day earlier. But many others placed on administrative leave are still awaiting word on their next career steps. The Department of Health and Human Services “has preserved the expertise necessary for pandemic preparedness, and our agency remains committed to infectious disease research, surveillance and response,” a spokesman said. “We continue to support this critical public health priority through ongoing monitoring, vaccine development and partnerships at home and abroad,” he added. But some experts worry that the loss of this particular kind of expertise leaves Americans vulnerable to new pandemic threats. “The diseases aren’t going away,” said Dr. Lorin Warnick, dean of Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “The risks are even higher now.” We spoke with four well-regarded infectious disease scientists about their work, their lives now and the state of the nation’s pandemic preparedness. Three years ago, Sarah Paige led a team at the U.S. Agency for International Development that helped to contain an Ebola outbreak in Uganda. Jobless since the collapse of the agency, Dr. Paige, 51, is now freelancing for a for-profit company reviewing research proposals, even as Ebola is again spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “I just wanted to do something and have meetings, because in the afternoons I get so lonely,” she said recently. Dr. Paige studies the links between people, the environment and diseases. Early in her global health career, at Kibale National Park in Uganda, she saw baboons break into people’s kitchens and red colobus monkeys terrorize children and dogs. Witnessing the interactions, she was struck by the realization that diseases can jump from people to animals, not just the other way around. Several years after completing a doctoral degree on those relationships, she applied to work at U.S.A.I.D. During the virtual job interview, agency officials unexpectedly asked her to turn on her camera. It was 9 p.m., and Dr. Paige appeared onscreen, mosquitoes and other insects swirling around her headlamp. She got the job. In September 2022, she led the agency’s response to Ebola in Uganda, working closely with other American agencies. Dr. Wilberforce Owembabazi Ndyanabo, her colleague at the time, said she was particularly adept at “navigating the gymnastics” of quickly mobilizing people and funds. But the success came at a cost, Dr. Paige said. She developed early-stage liver disease, high blood pressure and shingles, and returned home. Last January, she went back to U.S.A.I.D., convinced she would stay there for the rest of her career. But just weeks later, the Trump administration began dismantling the agency. Dr. Paige’s job, and the agency, dissolved on July 1. She still struggles, she said, with what she sees as “the abrupt demonization of everybody” who worked there. And she worried that the nation was even less equipped to cope with a pandemic than it was before Covid-19. The next large outbreak, whatever it turns out to be, “is getting closer,” she said. But with the dismantling of public health structures and rising vaccine hesitancy, “we’re just not prepared,” she said. Dr. Paige’s husband, a chef, can support the family. But the sudden loss of her work, especially as Ebola rages on, has plunged her into a deep depression, she said. To keep busy, she volunteers at an animal shelter and takes long walks with her dog. But she feels, she said, as if she were “walking through mud.” Dr. Jonathan Mermin fed the five chickens in his backyard, collected and washed their eggs, baked bread, and dried grapes as a snack for his wife. It was a glorious day in May in Atlanta. But his daily tasks were far different from what they were six weeks earlier, when he was overseeing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s work to contain H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases. In April, Dr. Mermin, 60, known as Jono to friends and colleagues, was placed on administrative leave and reassigned to the Indian Health Service. He is still waiting to hear what he is supposed to work on. The division of H.I.V. prevention, part of the center he directed, was dismantled and then restored, but the administration is once again preparing to shut it down . If Congress does not save the division, he said, “we won’t be able to detect outbreaks, and we won’t be able to respond to them effectively, putting more people at risk for getting H.I.V.” Dr. Mermin has kept in close contact with his former colleagues and employees, and plans to find another job. Still, he said, he is dismayed at having to leave the C.D.C. He has spent nearly his entire career at the agency, staying on as a civilian after retiring last year from the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service as a two-star rear admiral. During the first Trump administration, Dr. Mermin was instrumental in shaping the strategy called Ending the H.I.V. Epidemic, which was widely lauded as a success . He was “not political in any sense,” said Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant health secretary during that administration. Under Dr. Mermin’s leadership, new H.I.V. infections in the nation dropped by 36 percent, and resurgent sexually transmitted infections showed the first signs of a plateau nationwide. He also directed health departments to spend the bulk of their money on prevention. It was “a very precise and scientific and logical approach” to make the biggest impact for the least money, said Greg Millett, who worked as a deputy for the Office of National AIDS Policy in the Obama White House. Now, however, Dr. Mermin is spending his days at home with his chickens and his misbehaving cat. The fate of the H.I.V. division hangs in the balance, and he worries that lawmakers may not realize its importance. “What if no one cares?” he said. Animal Threats The administration’s new strategy notes that three-quarters of emerging infectious diseases, like bird flu, spread from animals. To fully contend with such threats, scientists need more than a medical degree. They need experience with animals, a familiarity with diseases and a deep understanding of public health. Dr. Stéphie-Anne Dulièpre checked every box when she arrived at U.S.A.I.D. in October 2024. She was a licensed veterinarian, had worked at the Agriculture Department, and had studied public health at Johns Hopkins University. But she lost her position only a few months later when U.S.A.I.D. was shuttered. “It’s devastating because I have barely scratched the surface of what I can do with all of my skills,” she said. Dr. Dulièpre lived in Haiti until age 11. She said she grew up alongside dogs, goats and chickens; brought home “insects upon insects” to study; and could tame the most feral cat. Her deep connection to animals eventually led her to study veterinary medicine at Cornell, even though only about 2 percent of veterinarians identify as Black. “The typical veterinarian is not a Black woman, let me just say that,” she said. “I had no one that I knew that took the path ahead of me.” At U.S.A.I.D., Dr. Dulièpre’s skills made her an asset for several projects on emerging zoonotic diseases, recalled Stephanie Martz, her supervisor at the time. One project in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, involved helping farmers care for captive wildlife. Visiting staff members had to stay at a hostel that had a tarantula living behind the toilet. The team was certain she would back out of the project when she heard about the spider. “But she was like, ‘No, sign me up, I’m going to go,’” Ms. Martz said. “We knew she was going to be a good fit.” Since U.S.A.I.D.’s collapse, Dr. Dulièpre has been working as a veterinarian to pay bills and $125,000 she still owes in student loans. “I’m still searching,” she said, “looking around to see where else I can use these skills.” The Vaccine Specialist Dr. Emily Erbelding’s undoing may have begun during the coronavirus pandemic. An infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health, she was a leader of Operation Warp Speed, President Trump’s project to rapidly develop Covid vaccines during his first term. But the division she led at the N.I.H. also oversaw a grant to EcoHealth Alliance that became a central focus of the controversy over the origins of the coronavirus. The grant was funded after a peer review, and she canceled it when problems arose. Still, along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, she has borne much of the blame, and her involvement may have led to her being ousted from the agency in April, she said. Immediately after Mr. Trump took office in January, the spreadsheets began arriving at the N.I.H. One executive order demanded that studies that collected gender identity information either drop that aspect or cease altogether. Then came orders to terminate grants intended to increase diversity, equity and inclusion; awards to Columbia University and scientists in South Africa; and funding for foreign collaborators . “It made me heartsick to look at the spreadsheets,” Dr. Erbelding said. Employees were crying in her office or in the bathroom almost every day, she said, adding, “There’s just a lot of idealism that’s being crushed.” Dr. Erbelding became focused on infectious diseases while in medical school at Indiana University. A fellowship at Johns Hopkins coincided with dual epidemics of H.I.V. and syphilis in Baltimore. In 2010, she became deputy director of the N.I.H.’s AIDS division, just as the rollout of H.I.V. drugs was expanding. She later led a division that dealt with other infectious diseases, including those that may cause pandemics, helping to develop vaccines against them. Then came an actual pandemic. Dr. Erbelding was there from the first planning meeting for a vaccine in January 2020. She made sure the clinical trials included specific populations — children, minority groups, people with H.I.V. If there were another pandemic, she said, the thinned-out federal agencies might not be able to support another effort like Warp Speed. “You’re destroying something with these draconian cuts that took years to build,” she said. “It can’t be rebuilt as fast as it was taken down.” At 64, she is not ready to stop working. She rows in Baltimore three or four times a week when the weather cooperates, and regularly competes in regattas, returning with bloody blisters on her hands. Focusing on her stroke “cleanses the mind really nicely,” she said. “You can forget about all the ills of the world.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/health/trump-layoffs-scientists-public-health.html,Science,BBC,By Apoorva Mandavilli,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/19/multimedia/00HS-scientists-top-vmfg/00HS-scientists-top-vmfg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:00:11+00:00,0c05c1fd81e59f99b7509af8b2019e47837d6745
67b5813d8bf4,‘Greaser’s Palace’ Contains a Million Laughs … or None,"movies, restoration and renovation, anthology film archives","The missing link between the “sick” humor of the early 1960s and John Waters’s early 1970s outré antics, Robert Downey Sr.’s low-budget farces, “ Chafed Elbows ” (1967) and “ Putney Swope ” (1969), trafficked gleefully in the tasteless. Made once he found a producer, Downey Sr.’s “ Greaser’s Palace ” (1972), a million-dollar “western,” was something else — not tasteless so much as what the Russian Futurists called “a slap in the face of public taste.” Rarely shown since its release, Downey Sr.’s magnum opus has been preserved by Anthology Film Archives, where it screens for a week in new digital and 35-millimeter restorations starting Friday. “Greaser’s Palace,” set mainly in its titular frontier saloon, the domain of a murderous, constipated tyrant known as Seaweedhead Greaser (Albert Henderson), features spectacular New Mexico scenery and a cast of scuzzy varmints. On one hand, it’s a hippie anti-western in the tradition of “Little Big Man,” “The Last Movie” and “El Topo,” which, as an incomprehensible parable about a showbiz messiah, “Greaser’s” appears to parody. On the other hand, it’s a movie that flaunts gags so daringly unfunny it might have been Andy Kaufman’s bible. Moreover, as befits a project bankrolled by Cyma Rubin, a neophyte producer who conquered Broadway with her 1971 revival of the 1925 show “No, No, Nanette,” “Greaser’s” is also a musical. Sort of. Boss Greaser exploits and occasionally shoots his subjects, including his son Lamy, known as Homo (Michael Sullivan), while his daughter Cholera (Luana Anders) taunts the saloon’s sex-starved customers with a ballad called “The Harlot’s Bed.” The star entertainer arrives after a pioneer family is killed by a hooded character later identified as the Holy Ghost. Jesse (Allan Arbus, resplendent in a snazzy pinstriped zoot suit, his luxuriant Jewfro crowned by a flat-brimmed hat) paraglides down to perform miracles-cum-party tricks, among them an unconvincing tap dance on water.

Onlookers egged him on. “You’ve got to do it!” a woman shouted from across the street. “My family would be disappointed if I didn’t!” he called back, continuing his gyrations. The man, Matthew Craugh, 32, from Carson City, Nev., was doing the Truffle Shuffle, re-enacting a scene from the 1985 adventure-comedy film “The Goonies,” in which Chunk, played by Jeff Cohen, does a humiliating dance at the request of his friend Mouth (Corey Feldman). Decades’ worth of fans like Mr. Craugh have made pilgrimages to Astoria, Ore., the small town where “The Goonies” was set and mostly filmed. For the 40th anniversary of its release, an estimated 10,000 people gathered in Astoria over one June weekend this year. Astoria, in turn, has mostly embraced the fans of the movie — which has a Facebook page with more than two million followers — aiming to turn them into a boost to the local economy. Many of the sites from the film still stand, and the town, on a peninsula near the mouth of the Columbia River, also offers visitors a rich history, a lively dining scene and easy access to state parks and beaches. “Iowa has the ‘Field of Dreams’ and it’s an incredible place to go, but it’s just a field,” said Mike Schulte, a longtime “Goonies” fan who has visited Astoria three times, including once for his movie review podcast, “ The Confused Breakfast ,” which he hosts with two friends. “There were five of us out there basically on a ‘Goonies’ adventure for a couple of days, like finding hidden treasure and finding film locations,” Mr. Schulte said. “It really ingrained itself as a top core memory of my life.” Perfect Place for a Shipwreck The plot of “The Goonies,” directed by Richard Donner and featuring young up-and-comers like Martha Plimpton, Sean Astin and Mr. Feldman, centers on a treasure hunt. A group of teenagers facing the foreclosure of their Astoria neighborhood, affectionately called the Goon Docks, embark on a hunt for pirate treasure, pursued by the Fratellis, a family of bumbling criminals. As I drove across the four-mile Astoria-Megler Bridge toward town, I recalled watching the film when I was young and hearing endless references from my Gen X siblings. I wondered how the film, and four decades of economic change, had transformed the once-gritty logging town. Would it live up to the film’s famous catchphrase, “Goonies never say die”? I was planning a three-pronged pilgrimage: First, I would visit the Oregon Film Museum , which features “Goonies” exhibitions. Then I would head for the Goon Docks and check out the house where Mikey and his brother, Brand (Josh Brolin) lived. Finally, I’d finish my trip 25 miles south, in Ecola State Park, the setting of the Fratellis’ hide-out and the spot where the Goonies used a doubloon to find the pirate ship. (Disappointingly, the scene at the end when the ship sails out of the cave was shot in California.) Astoria is a perfect setting for a movie about pirate treasure. Fast currents, shifting sandbars and tumultuous weather have led to more than 2,000 recorded shipwrecks in the area, known as the “Graveyard of the Pacific,” and the craggy coastline could conceal just about anything. In a telephone interview, Mr. Feldman, a.k.a. Mouth, agreed. “Where else can you do it? Where you’re going to be off the coast of a fishing town and you’re going to have these great rock formations, where there is this possibility that some ship went into an open cave at some point,” he said. ‘OK to Be a Chunk’ At the Oregon Film Museum ($6) — which was used as the jail in the opening scene of “The Goonies” — visitors can pose in the cell where Jake Fratelli (Robert Davi) made a run for it and gawk at the gadget-laced outfit worn by Data (Ke Huy Quan). A replica of the Fratellis’ Jeep Cherokee, complete with bullet holes, sits outside. In one section, index cards invite visitors share their feelings with prompts like, “I love ‘The Goonies’ because … ” and “Tell the Goonies why you’re here.” Over the years, the board has filled up with stories of cancer survival and lost loved ones. A veteran wrote about watching “The Goonies” for comfort before going out on patrol in Afghanistan. “I have hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of notes,” said Mac Burns, the museum’s director, in a phone interview, citing a few examples: “‘We’re here celebrating a birthday.’ ‘We’re here celebrating an anniversary.’ ‘This movie taught me it was OK to be a Chunk.’” Nearby, at the bowling alley where Chunk, mesmerized by a police chase, smashes a pizza and a milkshake against a window, visitors can re-enact the scene with Chunk-like Hawaiian shirts provided. The bowling alley is still in business. The lanes were mostly filled when I visited on a Wednesday afternoon. A few blocks from the Goonies House, I stopped in at the Astoria Coffee Company, which has the feeling of a “Goonies”-themed general store, with books, T-shirts, games, prop replicas and other souvenirs. The Goonies House, built in 1896 and bought by an entrepreneur in 2023, features a Rube Goldberg-like machine outside that, as in the film, can open the gate (though this one substitutes a mechanical chicken for the live one). It draws a steady stream of visitors — and Truffle Shufflers — and the new owner has restored the entire place to appear as it did in the movie, down to the attic where the Goonies found the treasure map. In the movie, the working-class neighborhood surrounding the house faced the threat of development, echoing the real Astoria of the 1980s, when fishing and logging jobs were vanishing. “The town was a little depressed,” said Mr. Burns. “In 1900, you might send a group of 40 or 50 guys into the woods to chop down some trees if you’re a logger. And now you have to send five or six guys because of mechanization.” These days, Astoria counts more bustling breweries than a weekend visitor can sample, and many of them serve some combination of local oysters, chowders and fried seafood. Even businesses not associated with “The Goonies” gravitate toward merchandise with a pirate theme. One tiki bar, Dead Man’s Isle , sells a drink called Mutant Skull, which you can sip from a mug shaped like a warped cranium. A Rock and an Old Coin On their quest for treasure, the Goonies use a doubloon with holes in it to view a giant rock and place the pirate ship on an old map. That landmark, Haystack Rock, sits just offshore about 25 miles southwest of town in Cannon Beach, visible from a viewpoint at Ecola State Park. A sign commemorates the scene and the former location of the fictional abandoned restaurant that served as the Fratellis’ lair. The set is long gone, but a hiking trail through an oceanside forest offers a close-up look of the landscape featured in the film. After buying some of the reddest roadside strawberries I had ever seen, I walked farther south along Cannon Beach to get a better view of Haystack Rock, which loomed much larger than I had ever imagined when I was watching the movie. With fog above the water, it almost seemed impossible there wasn’t a pirate ship loaded with treasure lurking somewhere among these rocks. The conditions were perfect. Now, if only I had a doubloon and a treasure map.

522f1f34f408,Julia Roberts and Luca Guadagnino on ‘After the Hunt’ and Daring to Be Ambiguous,"movies, julia roberts, luca guadagnino, after the hunt","Julia Roberts is used to press-tour pleasantries. What has surprised her during the weeks spent promoting her new drama, “ After the Hunt ,” is how eager journalists and audiences have been to debate what the film is really about. “This movie has brought out a lot of really interesting questions and conversations in a way that is terribly pleasing,” she said. “My castmates and I were talking about how this is the only press junket we can remember where we’re not just like, ‘OK, here’s that question for the 24th time.’” Directed by Luca Guadagnino, “After the Hunt” stars Roberts as Alma, a Yale philosophy professor who is revered by a coterie of confidants that includes her colleagues Hank (Andrew Garfield) and Kim (Chloë Sevigny), her student protégée, Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), and her husband, Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg). But after Maggie accuses Hank of sexual assault, this tight-knit circle begins to unravel as Alma wrestles with the question of where her loyalty really lies. Though the movie brushes against hot-button topics like cancel culture and #MeToo, Guadagnino (“Challengers,” “Call Me by Your Name”) never wanted “After the Hunt” to be received as a polemic. “My idea was of an ambiguous movie that lets the audience think for themselves and make up their own minds,” he said. One thing, however, is perfectly clear: Roberts and Guadagnino have formed a strong bond. When I met them over soft drinks at a Los Angeles hotel, the 57-year-old actress beamed at her director, 54, and spoke about how that affection extended to castmates like Edebiri, whom she recently hosted at her home for an early birthday celebration. “Everybody was so endlessly enthusiastic about being with Luca and making this movie and it’s just such a great feeling,” Roberts said. “I don’t care if people believe us or not. It’s just so true how much we really enjoy one another’s company and points of view.” Her director concurred. “For me, she’s the embodiment of cinema,” Guadagnino said of Roberts, hinting that their collaboration could continue: “There is no wrapping. We have life ahead of us and life together, for sure.” Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Julia, what has been most satisfying about the conversations people have had after watching this movie? JULIA ROBERTS I think people don’t realize how much they miss talking. For some reason, I was thinking this morning about when my kids were young and we showed them “Stand by Me,” and our daughter said to me, “I’m going to give you my phone.” And I said, “OK. What do you want me to do with it?” She said: “You just keep it. I don’t want it. Seeing that movie, I just thought if those boys had phones, they wouldn’t be talking to each other like that. They wouldn’t have gone looking for that body, they wouldn’t sit around the fire and share these stories.” She could see how it was getting in the way of things. All that’s to say, we love talking to each other and sometimes we forget how important it is. When you’re reading the script for a movie like “After the Hunt,” are you already picturing yourself in it? ROBERTS I guess I do in some way. But sometimes, I’m also busy casting the other parts as I’m reading, just so it feels like watching a movie. Sometimes, I’m cursed with the feeling that I have to finish a script. I know people who can read 30 pages and be like, no . LUCA GUADAGNINO Oh, you read all of it? ROBERTS Somebody wrote it all down, and they probably cried some tears! And I just think: “Who knows? Something might happen on Page 52.” GUADAGNINO Statistically, if it hasn’t happened by Page 20, it doesn’t happen. Julia, is there anything that intimidated you about taking on this character? ROBERTS Oh, everything. You have to humanize it to portray it. And then going into the classroom, where she’s imparting her brilliance on these young minds, it was so intimidating doing those scenes. God, all these eyes just looking at me! But at the same time, there’s something thrilling about really pretending to be that person who knows more than anybody else in the room. And this is a story full of characters who think they know the most. ROBERTS It’s a big smarty-pants-off. When you first read it, did you know how you wanted to portray Alma? ROBERTS I have instincts, but I don’t have any answers. I collaborate with Luca. GUADAGNINO And yet, you had this major instinct that she had to be blond. Why, do you think? ROBERTS Cold. Austere. I think any character you play, the more visual assistance you have for it, the better — the clothes, the shoes, the makeup, the hair. Gena Rowlands , her look was our inspiration. It’s not really a normal thing to have a woman who has a shape of hair like that. There were so many little details that contributed to what I was trying to say that then I didn’t have to say anything — I just had to enter the room. What’s it like to embody that formidable persona? ROBERTS What I appreciate about Alma is that she can be cold and rigid, but she also is deeply hurt and carries a lot of pain. And I think casting Michael Stuhlbarg as Frederik was kind of finding the right hair color, because their relationship is so critical and so important. It’s two imperfect people being completely devoted to each other. It’s like the saying, “If you want an interesting relationship, stay in one.” GUADAGNINO I love that. What was your own college experience like, Luca? GUADAGNINO In Palermo, I was alone more than anything else, and I didn’t like being there. I think I stopped being lonely the moment I started to meet artists I admired, people that were very creative in a way of being and very singular. ROBERTS At 17, you knew you wanted to be an artist. GUADAGNINO Yeah. I knew that when I was 6 or 7, actually. I did a play at 16 at high school that caused me to repeat the year. They got a scandalous play. What was so scandalous about it? GUADAGNINO I took two texts by the great Ionesco and made them into a sort of variety show. There was this park where I used to hang out, and I became friends of a group of amazing trans people. This was 1987 and they were so wonderfully performative, and I was so inspired by that, that I invited them to perform in the play. But they weren’t part of the school, and that was enormously scandalous. When people saw it, they were speechless. So when I did “The Protagonists” 13 years later and presented it [at the Venice Film Festival] and there were a lot of walkouts, I was already a veteran of that. I didn’t give a [expletive]. So even at a young age, you were eager to tweak academic institutions. GUADAGNINO I was going to grab the opportunity to make what I wanted. I started the year convincing the headmaster to let me direct the play instead of a professor. I don’t know how; clearly, I’m good at convincing financiers. With [“After the Hunt”], we said to them, “We want to build everything in London,” and they said, “Yeah.” ROBERTS Only Luca can get people to go, “It sounds like a great idea!” Is it true that you planned to age Chloë Sevigny up to be sort of a Fran Lebowitz character? GUADAGNINO Not like Fran Lebowitz, but I wanted the character to be much older. We tested that with makeup. It was very successful. ROBERTS It looked amazing. GUADAGNINO But to convince me that I’m wrong takes one word sometimes. Chloë said, “Are you sure? I think I look like a crocodile.” And that was it. Say no more. The characters can be vicious to one another and yet, it’s somehow cathartic to watch their confrontations. GUADAGNINO Because it’s entertainment. It’s cinema. ROBERTS Especially when what they’re saying aligns with what you’re thinking. Julia, when you’re watching the movie, are you ever the one gasping at what your character says? ROBERTS Playing it feels correct. Watching it feels brutal. But it’s also fun because I can almost feel Luca somewhere in the room smiling. But when you have that camaraderie behind the scenes, does it give you more permission to be vicious when you need to be? ROBERTS Oh, yes sir. In fact, I think that being together at my house had that big of an impact on our ability to be very committed to what we were doing because we were safe. We knew who we were as opposed to rehearsing for a week, and two days later, getting shoved up against a wall or slapped in the face. The film’s tagline is “Not everything is supposed to make you feel comfortable.” Do you feel the younger generation is too comfortable, or in need of a prod? GUADAGNINO I don’t like generalizations. I do believe the needs of Maggie are not met in the gaze of Alma, and that triggers this tug of war between the two women. More than they are representing some generations, they are completely encapsulated in a world where they want to be the most powerful person. I would not think, generally speaking, it’s a Gen Z representation. I like to think about this movie the way you think of a movie by George Cukor or Mike Nichols. It’s more like cinema. If people call you a provocateur, do you embrace that? GUADAGNINO No. I’m kind and nice and a great chef. Provocateurs can be great chefs. GUADAGNINO I don’t want to be considered someone who does something for the sake of it. ROBERTS Just for the reaction. GUADAGNINO Right, that’s something that I don’t like. I am so lucky that I can do things in a very distinct, profound way with artists like Julia. I think sometimes you do something that is intense and people are going to be reflective on that intensity. But, no, I don’t think I’m a provocateur. So when the opening credits employ the same font and format Woody Allen used, that’s not a provocation? Not even a little bit? GUADAGNINO It’s beautiful. It’s so graphically arresting, and it is a canon of the history of cinema. Sure, but given how the movie touches on cancel culture … GUADAGNINO I thought that was the best way to create the titles for this movie. The next one [in “Artificial,” starring Garfield as OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman] is going to be a homage to Pablo Ferro’s title credits for “Philadelphia” by Jonathan Demme. Every movie is different, but I think I’m a film historian, and I love cinema. I’m not salacious. ROBERTS You’re a cinéaste. GUADAGNINO But I did have to make a phone call and say, “Julia, do you mind if we put you in alphabetical order?” She said, “Of course.” ROBERTS I love alphabetical order. I think it speaks to the collaboration. The movie begins in 2019 and ends as Trump is taking office, though you finished filming before his election. GUADAGNINO When we wrapped, we knew we were going to add this moment of 2025. So we were ahead of it. Did you have a sense as you were shooting of what January 2025 was going to look like? GUADAGNINO 85 percent. I was sure the Republicans were going to become the new government, and I knew the title — “After the Hunt” — had to apply to that moment. The movie coagulates in that final two scenes completely. College campuses have become a battleground for this administration. What do you think they would make of this movie? GUADAGNINO It would be interesting. Maybe it’s too elaborate, the philosophical concepts that Julia speaks. They would not understand.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/movies/julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-after-the-hunt.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Kyle Buchanan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-02-hwpg/julia-roberts-luca-guadagnino-02-hwpg-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-15T09:02:09+00:00,bc5743d31029298c684b428765eccdaea05fd516
f5c7f6354a36,"Alfa-Betty Olsen, Behind-the-Scenes ‘Comic Conspirator,’ Dies at 88","alfa-betty olsen, comedy, writer, marshall efron, mel brooks, the producers, get smart, the great american dream machine, obituary","Alfa-Betty Olsen, an unsung wit who became a trusted accomplice to Mel Brooks in the ridiculous, encouraging the irreverent tone of his sitcom “Get Smart” and his movie “The Producers” — and who was a longtime writing partner to Marshall Efron on projects like the quirky PBS series “The Great American Dream Machine” — died on Oct. 5 in Manhattan. She was 88. Her cousin Norma Levett confirmed the death, in an assisted living facility. Ms. Olsen, who had known Mr. Brooks socially, recalled being hired as his recording secretary on a tight deadline as he and Buck Henry were completing the TV pilot episode of the spy spoof “Get Smart.” “One day, he said, ‘You can type, and I can’t,’” she said in a PBS interview in 2018. “‘And I have to hand this in on Monday.’” Her job, while sitting at a typewriter in the corner of a small office, was to jot down rapid-fire one-liners and bonkers concepts like the shoe phone as “Mel and Buck threw around ideas and jokes and things.” Asked if the job required more than being a stenographer, she replied , “Whoever runs the typewriter has a lot of power.” In his 2021 memoir, “All About Me! My Remarkable Life in Show Business,” Mr. Brooks recounted that Ms. Olsen “nailed down every thought and every crazy joke and brushstroke of madness we threw out. Nothing escaped her.” “Get Smart,” an Emmy Award-winning show starring Don Adams as the bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart, ran on NBC from 1965 to 1969 and on CBS from 1969 to 1970. Ms Olsen witnessed the production of “The Producers” as the casting director and, in Mr. Brooks’s words, a “girl Friday.” The movie, released in 1967, follows a failing producer, Max Bialystock (played by Zero Mostel), and his meek accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), who scheme to fleece their investors (all little old ladies) by mounting “Springtime for Hitler,” a Broadway musical celebration of the Third Reich that they mistakenly expect — and are counting on — to be a flop and make them rich in the process. In a low-budget project that was purposefully steeped in extravagant bad taste, Mr. Brooks wrote that he relied on Ms. Olsen’s sound judgment and encouragement. “I would say things like, ‘Can I do this? Is this too crazy?’” he wrote. “And she’d say, ‘No, never too crazy for you.’” Ms. Olsen was given the task of hiring the cast and helping to shape the script, which won an Oscar for best screenplay. After conducting musical research at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts, she noticed the Revson Fountain at the complex and thought it would be an ideal location for Bialystock and Bloom to celebrate their corrupt union. Mr. Brooks agreed. The nighttime scene culminates when Bloom runs and skips around the edge of the fountain. As jets of water soar into the air, Bloom gleefully proclaims, “I’m Leo Bloom! I’m me! I can do whatever I want!” One character Ms. Olsen cast was Franz Liebkind, the mentally unbalanced, helmet-wearing Nazi who wrote “Springtime for Hitler” as a tribute to the Führer (“a terrific dancer”). Dustin Hoffman, a young theater actor then, lobbied for the role, Ms. Olsen told Vanity Fair. “But of course that was impossible,” she said. “Nobody wanted him to be the German.” (Mr. Hoffman did not play any role in “The Producers” but soon went on to star in the Mike Nichols film “The Graduate” with Mr. Brooks’s wife, Anne Bancroft.) Another actor, Kenneth Mars , was called in to audition for the role of Roger De Bris, the flamboyantly gay director of “Springtime,” but Mr. Mars preferred Liebkind, and an initially reluctant Mr. Brooks relented, at Ms. Olsen’s insistence, by her account. (Christopher Hewett got the part of De Bris.) When she was asked in 2012, for an “American Masters” documentary about Mr. Brooks, if any cast members had objected to the “Hitler stuff” in the film, she said one of the showgirls who appeared in the “Springtime for Hitler” title number “kind of objected to wearing swastika pasties.” Alfa-Betty Olsen was born on Nov. 30, 1936, in Brooklyn to Alf and Borghild (Seime) Olsen, Norwegian immigrants. She graduated from high school at 16 and from the University of Iowa in 1957 with a bachelor’s degree in sociology. Ms. Olsen’s career was largely under the radar — first with Mr. Brooks and finally with Mr. Efron, notably partnering with him on “The Great American Dream Machine,” a short-lived mix of short comic films, cartoons, music, investigative journalism and humorous sketches that premiered on public television in 1971. Mr. Efron was a writer of the show and one of its stars. In a newspaper column that year, the writer Greg Vitiello lauded her as Mr. Efron’s “comic conspirator” in segments on flags, water beds, auto graveyards and much else. Another segment, about “how to write your own famous last words,” featured Mr. Efron encouraging viewers to plan ahead for those final seconds because, “in all your life, you will have only one opportunity to die.” They collaborated again on “Marshall Efron’s Illustrated, Simplified and Painless Sunday School,” a Sunday morning show on which Mr. Efron humorously enacted Bible stories for children. It premiered in 1973 and ran for four seasons. “Everybody thinks we outraged the fundamentalists, but it’s not true,” Ms. Olsen told The Boston Globe in 1981. “We received awards from church groups, and letters saying Sunday schools were using our show as part of their studies.” Ms. Olsen and Mr. Efron, who lived six floors apart in the same building in Greenwich Village for many years, stuck to the religious theme when they wrote a book, “Bible Stories You Can’t Forget — No Matter How Hard You Try” (1976). One story noted how irritable it made Joseph’s siblings to hear how good he always was, making his bed and taking all his own dishes to the sink “without anybody having to ask him.” Their other books included “Omnivores: They Said They Would Eat Anything — and They Did!"" (1979), a humorous examination of high and low cuisine (featuring an “affidavit” from Mr. Brooks attesting to seeing the authors eat what they claimed), and “Gabby the Shrew” (1994), a children’s book about a mole-like mammal, with illustrations by Roz Chast. “I remember that she was lovely — funny and sweet, and a perfect partner in some undefinable way for Marshall Efron,” Ms. Chast said in an email. Ms. Olsen left no immediate survivors. Her marriage to David Miller ended in divorce. Mr. Efron died in 2019. When “The Producers” received an Oscar for best screenplay, Mr. Brooks did not mention Ms. Olsen in his acceptance speech. But in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio, Mr. Brooks’s biographer Patrick McGilligan said Ms. Olsen had been happy to work for little recognition just to be in the same orbit of show-business personalities she admired. Mr. McGilligan called her a “very funny, smart, serious writer who had not really the same drive and ambition to blaze her name in the sky the way Mel does, and was happy to serve for a while as his muse and as his typist and as his secret helper.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/arts/television/alfa-betty-olsen-dead.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Richard Sandomir,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12olsen-1-wctf/12olsen-1-wctf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T21:55:49+00:00,4a6f9622bf505bfb046ee409defdc60bd7b665e1
23820086e633,Diane Keaton’s Only Documentary Was About the Afterlife,"movies, diane keaton, heaven","The actress Diane Keaton, whose death was announced on Saturday , appeared in over 60 movies and produced about a dozen. She was also a director, with a brief but rangy résumé that includes features, music videos, a TV movie, an after-school special and episodes of the television series “China Beach,” “Pasadena” and “Twin Peaks.” In 1987, she also wrote and directed her sole documentary, “Heaven,” a surreal mix of interviews and archival footage exploring popular ideas of the afterlife. In 2021, in an interview for the Golden Globe Awards, she described the movie as having clarified her own personal beliefs, beliefs that she described as being very simple. “Why would there be such a place as hell, for any of us?” she told the interviewer, adding, “I just don’t believe that.” Much of “Heaven” takes place in a white room striped in odd, elegant shadows. Seated at a table, interviewees answer questions such as “Is there sex in heaven?” and “What are the rewards of heaven?” The interview subjects — ministers, atheists, children, courting couples, several of Keaton’s family members and the boxing promoter Don King among them — variously describe heaven as an open space; as gleaming with diamonds and gold; and as a young boy says, “all white, like marshmallows.” Several people assert, in perfect confidence, that you can’t get fat in heaven. Between the interviews, Keaton layers a dense collage of archival film clips from movies like “Metropolis,” “Green Pastures” and “Stairway to Heaven.” In 1987, Keaton told an interviewer for Vanity Fair that finding and editing the clips had been a particular pleasure. “Maybe what I’d like to do in heaven is look at images forever and select them,” she said. Keaton had long been preoccupied with the afterlife. In that same interview, she described herself as having grown up as a morbid child with a fear of death. The oldest child of an Irish Catholic father and a Methodist mother, both of whom abandoned religion in the 1960s, she had an early interest in Christianity out of a desire to get to heaven. As an adult, she identified as an agnostic. “But I understand the longing and the need for more,” she told the interviewer. “For something better, fuller.

b9bba4241442,Woody Allen Remembers the ‘Magical’ Diane Keaton,"movies, personal profile;people story, actor, oscars, woody allen, diane keaton, annie hall, take the money and run","Diane Keaton “was so charming, so beautiful, so magical, that I questioned my sanity,” Woody Allen recalled thinking not long after meeting the actress in the late 1960s. “I thought: ‘Could I be in love so quickly?’” Keaton, whose death at 79 was announced on Saturday, would quickly become Allen’s creative muse as well as his romantic partner and eventually, after their split, a trusted friend. “Why we parted, only God and Freud might be able to figure out,” Allen, 89, wrote in a remembrance published on Sunday in The Free Press. He reminisced about their connection, which began with her audition for Allen’s play “Play It Again, Sam.” Keaton would star opposite Allen in that production, and her performance eventually earned her a Tony Award nomination. Nearly a decade later, Keaton’s star ascended with her performance in “Annie Hall,” Allen’s 1977 rom-com masterpiece . It won four Academy Awards, including best actress for Keaton and best picture. Keaton appeared in eight Allen movies overall, including “Manhattan,” “Interiors” and “Radio Days.” Perhaps more important, he wrote, she was his most discerning and trusted critic. Keaton insisted, against Allen’s judgment, that his early movie “Take the Money and Run” (1969) was funny and original. After the film was a success, he never doubted her instincts again. “I showed her every film I made after that, and grew to care only about her appraisals,” he wrote. As time went on, “I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton. I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it,” he wrote. “For all her shyness and self-effacing personality, she was totally secure in her own aesthetic judgment.” Keaton remained loyal to Allen amid the abuse allegations he faced. In 2018, on Twitter, she wrote : “Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him.” She included a link to a 1992 interview Allen had done with “60 Minutes” in which he defended himself. In his essay, Allen shared personal memories about his time with Keaton, including about her struggle with the eating disorder bulimia, which she wrote about in her 2011 memoir , “Then Again.” He also recalled meeting Keaton’s family for the first time, at Thanksgiving in Southern California, where she was from. “This was Keaton’s world, her people, her background,” he wrote. “It was amazing that this beautiful yokel went on to become an award-winning actress and sophisticated fashion icon.” After her death, the world is a drearier place, he concluded. “Still, there are her movies,” he wrote. “And her great laugh still echoes in my head.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/movies/diane-keaton-woody-allen.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Maya Salam,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/13cul-keaton-allen-fclj/13cul-keaton-allen-fclj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T16:34:37+00:00,6df0fbcc7db57da15a6ee19e834a13cf3f304e77
ba28985d2418,"Toby Talbot, Impassioned Promoter of Art Films, Dies at 96","toby talbot, daniel talbot, movies, documentaries, lincoln plaza cinema, new yorker films, theaters, new yorker theater, manhattan, obituary","Toby Talbot, who with her husband, Dan, cultivated an erudite and eclectic audience of American cinephiles by exhibiting and distributing foreign and independent films in art houses in New York City and across the country, died on Sept. 15 at her home in Manhattan. She was 96. The cause was complications of Guillain-Barré syndrome, her daughter Sarah Talbot said. For six decades, Toby and Dan Talbot operated four pioneering art-house cinemas on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (the New Yorker Theater, from 1960 to 1973; Cinema Studio, from 1977 to 1990; the Metro Theater, from 1982 to 1987; and the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, from 1981 to 2018). The Talbots introduced audiences to avant-garde films by Federico Fellini , Werner Herzog, Robert Bresson , Claude Chabrol , Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Ousmane Sembène . “We often will play a film that we know has no, quote, commercial value,” Ms. Talbot told The New York Times in 2017, “but we admire it and respect it and would like to share it with our audience.” The future filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich , who lived in the neighborhood and was then in his 20s, befriended the Talbots and suggested old and lesser-known movies for the New Yorker to show under the title “Forgotten Films.” The theater’s entranceway was the site of the communications theorist Marshall McLuhan’s memorable cameo role in Woody Allen’s Oscar-winning 1977 film, “Annie Hall.” (The Talbots had by that time sold the theater to the Walter Reade Organization, which would continue to operate it until 1985.) Ms. Talbot, who had a bachelor’s degree in Spanish, was also education editor of the Spanish-language newspaper El Diario Nueva York and translated into English “Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number” (1981), the Argentine journalist Jacobo Timerman ’s harrowing memoir about being kidnapped and tortured by his country’s military junta. Ms. Talbot taught Spanish at East Rockaway High School on Long Island and Spanish literature at Columbia, New York University and elsewhere, as well as a documentary film class at the New School. She wrote dozens of books, including a combination memoir and biography, “A Book About My Mother” (1980), and a novel, “Early Disorder” (1980, under the pseudonym Rebecca Joseph), about a teenager with an eating disorder. After her husband died in 2017 at 91, she edited his memoir, “In Love With the Movies” (2022), which featured a foreword by Mr. Herzog. Ms. Talbot’s dozens of books included a combination memoir and biography, published in 1980. Credit... Farrar, Straus & Giroux From 1965 to 2009, the Talbots’ New Yorker Films distributed more than a thousand titles, including Claude Lanzmann’s nine-and-a-half-hour Holocaust epic, “Shoah” (1985). Dan managed operations at the New Yorker Theater. Toby, who resisted his decision to sell the theater to focus on film distribution, exercised veto power over the film offerings. Her mother ran the candy concessions, lox and carrot cake included. Her father stood sentry in the lobby, which became a salon for film buffs. The New Yorker, on Broadway and West 88th Street, had been known as the Yorktown before the Talbots took over. They renamed it after a Miami Beach hotel run by Ms. Talbot’s uncle Harry and refurbished it with 900 seats from the recently shuttered Roxy. It opened as a revival house with a double feature: “Henry V” (1944), starring Laurence Olivier, and the 1956 French short “The Red Balloon.” It featured madcap comedies starring the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields; it also presented “Point of Order!” (1964), a documentary about the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings that Mr. Talbot helped produce, and the city’s first full-length public screening of “Triumph of the Will” (1935), Leni Riefenstahl’s propaganda film documenting the 1934 Nazi Party Congress rally. “The theater became a cocoon for young people getting schooled in film,” Ms. Talbot wrote in 2009 in “The New Yorker Theater and Other Scenes From a Life at the Movies.” “We thought of it as our living room, playing movies we wanted to see.” “We were our best audience,” she added. “It was a place of communion, where the customers, the owners, the programmers and the filmmakers all seemed to be part of the same family.” The six-screen Lincoln Plaza, located in the basement of a high-rise apartment building, featured a statue of Humphrey Bogart and had lavender-painted walls bedecked with posters promoting abstruse French movies. Dan Talbot died a week after the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas’ landlord declined to extend the lease. “The Talbots have been crucial to the formation, sustenance and perpetuation of film culture in New York — for that matter, in the United States,” the movie critic Richard Brody wrote in The New Yorker at the time. The last film shown at the Lincoln Plaza, on Jan. 28, 2018, was “Darkest Hour,” a 2017 biopic about Winston Churchill starring Gary Oldman in an Oscar-winning performance. Toby Tolpen, the elder of two daughters, was born on Nov. 29, 1928, in the Bronx to Jewish immigrants from Poland. Her father, Joseph, owned a window-washing company. Her mother, Bella (Neger) Tolpen, looked after the home. Toby was raised in the borough’s Pelham Parkway section and graduated from Christopher Columbus High School before receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1949 from Queens College. In addition to her daughter Sarah, she is survived by two other daughters, Nina and Emily Talbot; a sister, Roslyn Gamiel; and four grandchildren. Toby, who had been an inveterate moviegoer since childhood, met Daniel Distenfeld on her way to a movie theater in the Bronx. They married in 1951, the same year Dan, a book editor, changed his surname — because, his daughter said, antisemitism was rampant in the publishing industry. Opening a movie theater around the corner on Broadway was adventitious. Dan had wanted to start a bookstore in New Hampshire, and the couple would often rattle off their favorite films as they drove up to scout locations for the store. When they learned that her sister’s accountant had bought a movie theater, the Yorktown, the Talbots decided on a whim to lease it. Her husband’s decision to sell the New Yorker to focus solely on film distribution, she said in 2009, was “the only moment I considered divorce.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/movies/toby-talbot-dead.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Sam Roberts,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/10Talbot--jzqk-print3-SUB2/10Talbot--jzqk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T12:38:56+00:00,6bafc5c530592ccbf1e0328033a56ea390052346
7237866709f7,The Writer Who Turned Gossip Into Art,"linda rosenkrantz, art, writer, peter hujar, ira sachs, ben whishaw, peter hujar's day, personal profile;people story","Rosenkrantz’s ear for spoken language is on dazzling display in “Talk,” where the repartee among three friends (Rosenkrantz is Marsha, Raffael is Vincent and the actress Nancy Fish is Emily) follows the texture of actual conversation, in all its hilarity and strangeness. The trio slalom from topic to topic: One moment, someone is soliloquizing about love; the next they’re bantering about the art world, then wondering if raisins are fattening. “I’m beginning to feel very alone here,” Vincent says. “These peaches were not washed, I can feel the dirt on each one.” As they lie on the beach or cook dinner together, their chatter moves among registers, high and low, sacred and profane, cerebral and corporeal. “No performance, nothing; it was real chemistry between the three of us,” says Fish, who has chosen to remain anonymous all these years because, as she says, “I didn’t want my embarrassingly open mind to be public.” (When I ask if she cares if I name her, Fish, now 90 and living at the Motion Picture Home for retired members of the film industry in Woodland Hills, says, “That would be embarrassing if I did.”) Reading the book can feel voyeuristic, like eavesdropping on a private group-therapy session. Because the dialogue is honest and searching but also raw (Emily: “He must have a beautiful little penis”), the book was controversial. We look through the yellowed clippings Rosenkrantz has saved, laughing at the headlines. “In Talkathon They Tear Selves Limb to Limb,” reads one. “Which Was Your Favorite Abortion?,” reads another. And my favorite: “Three Swingers Probe Libidos.” We find a note from Harvey Ginsberg, her editor at Putnam: “Herewith the reviews so far. As predicted, they either love you or they hate you.” In 2015, New York Review Books republished “Talk” after it had spent decades out of print, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. “Rosenkrantz captures the psychodrama of all-consuming friendship with an honesty that qualifies as its own kind of boldness,” Judy Berman wrote in The Guardian. The culture had finally caught up with Rosenkrantz’s Warholian premise — reality television is ubiquitous, nearly everyone is starring as the main character of their own social-media feed and the nonfiction novel has been heralded as autofiction. Yet what’s remarkable about “Talk” is Rosenkrantz’s almost total lack of solipsism. She was not the protagonist but the observer, the chronicler of a social scene, a conduit for other people. She allowed her subjects to express themselves without judgment, shame or embarrassment — a freedom that, in our censorious moment, seems revolutionary. ALTHOUGH HE WAS primarily known as a portrait artist, Hujar photographed a variety of subjects: nudes; animals; the New York cityscape; catacombs in Palermo, Italy. But even when capturing a copse of bare silvery trees, a lone cow or the Hopperesque glow of a gas station by night, his photographs possess the stillness and fundamental solitude of portraits. “The signature move in his art is to lavish a portraitist’s attention upon a subject that defies it,” Joel Smith, the photography curator at the Morgan, has written. This is also his signature move in “Peter Hujar’s Day,” in which the photographer’s verbal recollection amounts to a self-portrait of sorts. “It’s like he’s translating what his photography does into words, both allowing himself to be a subject and making himself a subject at the same time,” says Andrew Durbin, 36, the author of a forthcoming biography of Hujar and Thek, “The Wonderful World That Almost Was.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/t-magazine/linda-rosenkrantz-peter-hujars-day.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Amanda Fortini,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/t-magazine/13tmag-rosenkrantz-slide-2OKJ-copy/13tmag-rosenkrantz-slide-2OKJ-copy-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:01:04+00:00,3b90da9a51aeb628fc9f283893088137d9460505
2f83f065cc18,"How D’Angelo Made His Masterpiece, ‘Voodoo’","pop rock music, r&b, d'angelo, j dilla, ahmir thompson;questlove, james poyser, voodoo","When D’Angelo wrapped up his debut LP, “Brown Sugar,” he was proud of the results. But one thing about the 1995 album bothered him: It sounded a bit too smooth. In the transition from his home demos to the studio, some of the material, he later said in an conversation with Red Bull Music Academy , “got a little homogenized.” For his next project, his goal was to funnel his creativity, “straight from the cow to the glass.” If “Brown Sugar” put D’Angelo on the map, “Voodoo,” which arrived in January 2000, solidified his legacy as a generational musical force — a singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who spearheaded an earthy yet state-of-the-art fusion of gospel feeling, R&B yearning, jazz spontaneity and head-nodding hip-hop groove. The key was a freewheeling studio atmosphere cultivated by a group of musicians who called themselves the Soulquarians. The name was a reference to the Aquarius birth sign of all four founders: D’Angelo; the Roots drummer Questlove; the producer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter James Poyser; and the rapper-producer J Dilla. From 1996 through 2002, this core group and various associates — including Common, Erykah Badu, A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip and the jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove — took up residency at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village. Hugely inspired by Jimi Hendrix, who commissioned the facility, D’Angelo insisted on focusing the group’s energy at the building. “He just knew that place was so blessed,” Questlove later recalled in a Red Bull Music Academy interview . “He said, ‘Yo, man. It has the blessings of the spirits. We have to go there. It’s only right.’” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Is This the Future?,"parks, architecture, restoration and renovation, electric power, manresa wilds, allison mcchord, austin mcchord, scape, big bjarke ingels group, norwalk ct, connecticut","The hike up to the roof involved Escher-like flights of metal stairs and grated catwalks like high wires, dangling above a spectacular abyss of rusted machinery. The ’60s-era control room, straight out of “Apollo 13,” opened onto a turbine hall the size of the concourse at Grand Central. I was blown away. I caught up with Manresa Wilds the other day, in Norwalk, Conn. For an unnamed fortune, a billionaire couple is paying to turn a decommissioned oil-fired electric power plant and its 125-acre brownfield peninsula into a public park, nature retreat and community hub. Suburban Connecticut is not the Bronx or Brooklyn. But my visit got me thinking about an ongoing quandary: What can be done with America’s obsolete infrastructure? New York has been trying for years to shutter some of its filthiest power plants. A fleet of “peakers” still plagues some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods. Peakers are aged gas- and oil-fired facilities costing taxpayers a king’s ransom to operate. They mostly sit idle, waiting for electricity demands to spike during heat waves. Once in operation, they’re notorious polluters, contributing to high asthma rates in communities nearby. The New York State legislature not long ago ordered the closure of peakers, encouraging a shift to greener technology at the plants or other uses, but the transition is harder and taking longer than neighbors and climate advocates have hoped. That said, outmoded power facilities, like all technologies, will eventually need to be replaced or repurposed. And obsolescence is always an opportunity for reinvention. The architectural term of art is adaptive reuse. There are countless examples of successfully converted power stations. The former Bankside Power Station in London, by Giles Gilbert Scott, became the Tate Modern museum. A one-time generating facility in Brooklyn is now Powerhouse Arts . In Paris, a decommissioned plant morphed into part of the Athletes’ Village at last year’s Summer Olympics and now belongs to an emerging neighborhood for mixed-income housing and other development. From the roof of Manresa’s plant, squinting across the Long Island Sound, I made out the Manhattan skyline through the morning haze. Osprey and deer have colonized the shore and populate a dense waterside birch forest that sprang up where the plant dumped its coal ash before switching to oil during the 1970s. It was all raw and beautiful. Completed in 1960 by Connecticut Light & Power, with a smoke stack that still towers over the region, the plant outlived its usefulness and shuttered in 2013 after Hurricane Sandy flooded the site. A private equity firm acquired the property to build high-end housing. As The Times reported last year, the billionaire couple, Austin and Allison McChord, who own a home nearby, had a better idea. They established a nonprofit, bought out the investors and enlisted SCAPE, the fine, innovative New York landscape architecture firm founded by Kate Orff. She and her colleagues have since been cooking up habitats, beaches, thermal pools and a boat launch for the park. The McChords also hired the New York office of BIG, the Danish architecture firm headed by Bjarke Ingels — which once installed a ski slope on a power plant in Copenhagen — to reimagine Norwalk’s somnolent plant as a home and hub for the park. BIG is picturing parts of the plant becoming a swimming pool and educational spaces. The firm will release more details in the coming months. Connecticut’s governor and Norwalk’s mayor are behind the project so far, and no wonder: the McChords aren’t asking for a public dime. They instructed SCAPE to lead community engagement efforts that began in March and by now have solicited feedback from some 3,000 Norwalkers. The site was also partly opened this summer to school groups and others . The bright, shining future I glimpsed in Connecticut is not a world dependent on beneficent billionaires. That is not a plan. It was about finding the public promise of nature’s return on a blighted waterfront that was merely seen as another luxury real estate opportunity. Allison McChord is a registered architect; Austin, a self-described fanboy of old factories. Taking me around the site, they made plain how much they rightly prize the plant as a time capsule of midcentury industrial architecture. The trick will be reconciling the scale of activities they imagine happening there with the concerns neighbors have about traffic and with the vulnerabilities of a flood-prone peninsula. Manresa’s brownfield remediation won’t start until Connecticut’s Department of Energy & Environmental Protection signs off on the park plan. Various other state and local hoops remain, including a rezoning of the land for a park. It’s encouraging to see a public-spirited project that hasn’t yet gotten bogged down by red tape or NIMBY opposition . But we’ll see. Since the 1960s, America has edged toward a vetocracy. The McChords are determined to complete the park ASAP, in phases, the first by 2027, the majority by 2031. That’s a brisk timeline by current standards. The challenge today is not know-how or a lack of imagination, or even necessarily money or generosity, as Manresa suggests. It’s whether we can get out of our own way.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/arts/design/manresa-wilds-connecticut-power-station.html,Culture,BBC,By Michael Kimmelman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/00kimmelman-manresa-01-gvhq/00kimmelman-manresa-01-gvhq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:01:59+00:00,0421277749e8e6ae30085fb3abfa2a504b2e6f83
f28f660ffaf8,He Won a Tony. Then Came the Hard Part: Facing His Demons.,"theater, off broadway theater, berkshire theater group, greenwich house, ari'el stachel","When Ari’el Stachel took the stage of Radio City Music Hall in 2018 to accept the Tony Award for his performance in “The Band’s Visit,” he seemed on top of the world. “I want any kid who’s watching to know that your biggest obstacle may turn into your purpose,” he said at the end of his emotional speech. But at an after-party later that night, he had to keep bolting to the bathroom for paper towels to blot the flop sweat caused by his social anxiety and lifelong sense of inadequacy. That juxtaposition between publicly celebrating a professional triumph and privately wrestling with personal turmoil is the focus of Stachel’s new Off Broadway solo play, “Other,” which opens Sunday at the Greenwich House Theater. It is in previews now, and scheduled to run through Dec. 6. The play tells “the story of a guy who, in what should be the greatest time in his life, crashes the hardest and has to go on a hunt to understand why this is happening,” Stachel, 34, a warm, voluble presence, said in a recent interview. In the play, Stachel candidly recounts the challenges he has grappled with: his identity issues as part Arab and part Jew (his mother is an Ashkenazi American; his father a Yemenite Israeli); his effort to fit in with middle school classmates by passing for Black on the basketball court; the distance he publicly put between himself and his thick-bearded, dark-skinned father amid anti-Arab sentiment after 9/11; and his push to land more complex acting roles than stereotypes like “Terrorist No. 2.” Written by Stachel and directed by Tony Taccone, the production also has moments of levity, like when Stachel jokes about the excuses he gave for his profuse, anxiety-induced sweating (spicy curry, a rushed bike ride, faulty air-conditioning). And at times Stachel even breaks into song, gracing the audience with the mellifluous voice that helped win him a Tony. He takes the audience back to the Bay Area in the mid-1990s, where he grew up and where he first experienced outsiderness. At 5, he received a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Stachel recounts how his therapist encouraged him to name the voice in his head that was “telling you something bad might happen if you don’t do things a‬ certain way.” Stachel settled on naming it Meredith, after the evil stepmom in the movie “The Parent Trap.” He was the only “brown kid” in his Jewish day school, where a classmate taunted, “You’re too dark to be Jewish!‬” When his father surprised him after school one day, a friend asked, “That yo pops? Yo daddy A-Rab?‬” As he recounts in the play, the young Ari’el stammered in response: “Ummm, man … well … um … that’s not actually my dad … that’s my … uncle … through marriage. …‬ It’s a long story, but my aunt married him, and my real dad died … so … he raises me and calls‬ himself my dad.‬” ‭For years, Stachel struggled to figure out who he was and where he belonged. “I skipped my high school graduation so that I wouldn’t be seen with my dad,” he says in the play. “I was living a double life.” The first time he told his father about having disavowed him as a child was onstage when he performed the play in Berkeley, Calif.; he couldn’t bring himself to do it any earlier. “When I saw him after, it was like a truck ran through him,” Stachel said in the interview. “I think he felt like he wasn’t able to fully protect me. I don’t see it that way. I just see it as: It’s life. You’re beautiful. Dad, I write this to honor you. I write this to honor your lineage.” Stachel attended Oakland School for the Arts, which led him to New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. Eventually, he started getting bit parts on TV shows like “Blue Bloods” and “Jessica Jones.” “It was not just an escape professionally, but it was my lifeline — my whole life,” Stachel said of acting. “That raw ability to transform came as a survival mechanism that I later learned could be a profession.” Then came his breakout performance as a womanizing, soulful trumpet player in “The Band’s Visit,” which follows the adventures of a touring Egyptian band stranded in an Israeli village. He received the Tony for best performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical. (In his review, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times that the actor’s “smooth jazz vocals dazzle in the style of his character’s idol, Chet Baker.”) Though appreciative of being featured in the acclaimed production, Stachel said the experience was fraught. He said he was not considered for the Israeli roles. Some Middle Eastern actors and fellow cast members questioned why an Israeli was playing an Arab part, even though Stachel is also Arab. And he didn’t feel comfortable in this interstitial state — which made him start thinking about creating his own theatrical work. “There was never quite a place of rest,” Stachel said. “Part of why I wrote this play is that I have never seen my culture reflected, ever: a Jewish person with roots in the Arab world. “I didn’t write this play to wave a flag,” he continued. “But I certainly don’t mind that people will come face to face with a Jewish story that is not the Jewish story we’ve heard over and over in this country. It’s time to widen that canon.” In 2018, Orin Wolf, the lead producer of “The Band’s Visit,” encouraged Stachel to send pages of his work-in-progress to Taccone, then the artistic director of Berkeley Rep Theater, where the play ultimately had its first production in 2023. The show subsequently had a run at Theater J in Washington, D.C., in January 2025, then last summer at Berkshire Theater Group, which also hosted a reading of it in 2024 — all with the previous title, “Out of Character.” Taccone urged Stachel to focus the play on his anxiety, given the prevalence of mental health issues among young people. “It’s become the touchstone in our world now for generations of kids,” Taccone said. “He’s tapping the cultural zeitgeist. It’s a widespread phenomenon and everyone is relating to it.” The director also said he initially responded to Stachel’s “level of honesty and transparency,” as did the actress LaChanze , who became the play’s lead producer in New York. “It will create a space of empathy and understanding,” she said. “Right now we’re in a time when we are all so polarized, and I think it would be really helpful for us to see each other as human beings.” The road after “The Band’s Visit” wasn’t always smooth, which Stachel hints at in the show. In 2021, he left the Public Theater’s adaptation of “The Visitor” out of concern over the musical’s depiction of his Arab American character. (At the time, the theater said in a statement that they had “made a mutual decision that he will step away.”) The show was based on Tom McCarthy’s 2008 film about two undocumented immigrants who help a white middle-aged professor get a new lease on life. The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in Israel occurred between the play’s first two productions; so Stachel incorporated a reference to the Israel-Gaza conflict in his script, in particular how he straddled his own Arab and Jewish identities. “It was not about the conflict at large, but about how I was trying to piece together this fracture within my family and within my social groups,” he said. “I tried to be a unifier.” He also talks in the play about deciding to weigh in on the war on social media (“I can try to be a bridge”), only to regret it in the face of harsh blowback. Particularly contentious, he said, was his Instagram message to Zohran Mamdani, the New York City Democratic mayoral candidate, in which he urged him to “name anti-Semitism clearly,” and said he was willing to partner with him “to create a coalition of Jews and Muslims of every race, every background who believe in a New York that belongs to everyone without erasure.” Going forward, Stachel said he would like to take part in more projects that represent his identity and experience — projects that “start conversations” and that give opportunities to others with his cultural background. Stachel says he has “a kooky dream” of doing a Yemenite “Fiddler on the Roof.” While he still sweats under stress, Stachel said his anxiety doesn’t usually get the better of him these days. Ironically, performing the play — wrestling with that fear night after night — is a kind of therapy all its own. “I only like to live at the depths of my soul,” he said. “That level of intensity is like a sedative for me. I go onstage and I just ring myself out, and now I’m open and other people are open.” Indeed, his remaining discomfort is outweighed by the strong response he has been getting from audiences, who greet him at the stage door to share their own struggles — of discrimination, of being disabled, of having had parents in an internment camp — and express gratitude for his having made them feel seen and less alone. “My favorite part of the show is after,” Stachel said. “I believe that it’s actually a service. The way that it cracks people open makes it worth it. “That has been the reward of this, which is why the cost doesn’t really matter,” he added. “Because, why else be an artist?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/theater/ariel-stachel-other.html,Culture,BBC,By Robin Pogrebin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15cul-ariel-stachel-promo/15cul-ariel-stachel-gtpb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T15:09:48.895000+00:00,9006a0d37856f215c73900aa08487f4c498bfdba
f23020797038,"Fall at City Ballet: Promotions, Debuts and Transcendent Dancing","dance;ballet, new york city ballet, dominika afanasenkov, india bradley, david gabriel, megan fairchild, alexei ratmansky, episodes, square dance, the goldberg variations, theme and variations, voices","The fall season at New York City Ballet was not always a triumph of programming, but it was a triumph of dancing. And by dancers who are currently fighting for better pay . (They boycotted the red carpet and dinner at the company’s recent fall fashion gala because of it.) I missed the “Eclectic” program, though miss may not be the right word. It didn’t seem super strong on paper and included no ballets by George Balanchine, the company’s founding choreographer. It’s not really a post-Balanchine world when his ballets are still more innovative than most of the new ones kicking around today. As for the dancing, the season was partly a celebration of Megan Fairchild, the longtime principal who is retiring in the spring. She bid farewell to Balanchine’s challenging “Theme and Variations,” dancing with the boundless energy and fluent feet of her early days. In a curtain call after her final “Theme,” she flung her arms into the air as if she had just won a gold medal at the Olympics. Fall also featured the debut of Ryan Tomash, a principal at the Royal Danish Ballet, now on leave, who joined City Ballet as a soloist. He’s the whole package. Tall, he’s an effortless partner to tall women like Isabella LaFreniere and Miriam Miller, as well as a dancer alive to the fun or poetry of a role, as was apparent even in just a few sightings. Last week, six new soloists were announced: Victor Abreu, Dominika Afanasenkov, India Bradley, Naomi Corti, Mary Thomas MacKinnon and Andres Zuniga. They’re all worthy, and Bradley made history as the company’s first Black female soloist. That is a win. There were talented dancers before her who should have been promoted, starting with Debra Austin , the first Black woman to join City Ballet, who eventually became a principal at Pennsylvania Ballet. But Bradley is deserving, and she’s not alone. The makeup of the company is finally starting to reflect New York City. And the company abounds with talent. When the eye keeps being drawn to the same dancer, that’s a sign, and this fall those signs were like billboards for standouts like Olivia Bell, Owen Flacke, Kennard Henson, Allegra Inch, Ava Sautter, Charlie Klesa, Grace Scheffel, Mckenzie Bernardino Soares and Mia Williams. Below are highlights from the fall season. Best program: All Balanchine II Programming by a single composer or aesthetic theme has become a bore, a drain of sameness. But the lineup of “Square Dance,” “Episodes” and “Western Symphony” — three Balanchine classics with different looks and sounds — offered a fulfilling mix of music and mood. The range was the draw, going from the brisk, vibrant “Square Dance,” set to Corelli and Vivaldi, to the austere, frigid-cold world of “Episodes,” set to Anton von Webern, and then landing in “Western Symphony,” a slice of cowboy heaven. With Karinska's costumes — the details, the colors — and music by Hershy Kay, “Western” was a joy bomb. There were debuts. In the Allegro, Alexa Maxwell danced with sparkling glee alongside a vigilant Alec Knight. The Adagio featured Olivia MacKinnon, performing with more daring than usual opposite Victor Abreu, who dances big and with such good taste — even as a cowboy. And in the Rondo, LaFreniere, with an insouciance somehow elegant and loose, came to life with Tomash, who was wild yet classical. They were in it from the start, willing us to have more fun than they were having. It might have been a tie. Romance, Mystery, Bravura: ‘Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3’ Balanchine choreographed “Theme and Variations,” the final movement of Tchaikovsky’s Suite No. 3, in 1947. In 1970, he choreographed the rest of this Suite — three sections that take place in a dreamy ballroom. In the opening “Élégie,” Miller, dancing with Tomash, was almost unreal as she stretched her body to soak in every last note and lingered on the edges of movement that revealed the risk in her lyricism, the romance of dancing without boundaries. In “Valse Mélancolique,” the second section, Emilie Gerrity, sumptuous, and Preston Chamblee, increasingly commanding as a presence and partner, danced with spaciousness and mysterious heart. And in her “Theme and Variations “ debut, Indiana Woodward, opposite Joseph Gordon, was all glittering warmth. The tempo was breakneck, yet she brought her finesse and ebullience to the part, as well as her shining eyes, which are both welcoming and vulnerable as they show a touch of surprise at how Balanchine’s choreography lights up her body. Two Sides of Bach: ‘The Goldberg Variations’ Sigh, programming. Pairing this Jerome Robbins ballet, which lasts nearly 90 minutes, with the already substantial “Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3” wasn’t the best idea. “Goldberg” is a stand-alone ballet, a two-part dance experience that washes across the stage with a subtle power. Are there sections that drone on? Sure. But by the end, it’s transporting, sometimes gloriously so. It opens with a couple, wearing Baroque costumes, dancing to the music’s theme, before a youthful cast, in sleek modern dance wear, perform variations, some playful, some pensive. In Part One, David Gabriel displayed his usual classical radiance but also showed a kind of playful confidence that has been brewing all season. Ashley Hod and Emma Von Enck paired up for a duet in which they partnered each other with tender clarity. Holding hands — as one faces front and the other the back — they plié and rise while casually bumping hips. The second half has a more classical, formal atmosphere with a new set of dancers in tutus and jackets. Over the course of three nights, it was rich with pairings, including Afanasenkov and Peter Walker; LaFreniere and Tyler Angle; and Tiler Peck and Chun Wai Chan. There was ease in the way they danced with the music instead of to it, which allowed the choreography to unfold with an unfussy naturalism. A New Calling: ‘Voices’ The season needed more Alexei Ratmansky. “Voices” (2020) , in which five women dance to selections from Peter Ablinger’s “Voices and Piano,” returned to the repertory. The voices are the recorded speeches of luminaries — many of them artists. Dancing to the voice of the jazz musician and D.J. Bonnie Barnett, Emily Kikta was a force, harnessing her strength with bursts of wild intelligence. In another section, Nina Simone speaks about freedom. Corti, a newly appointed soloist, danced this section with bracing clarity, but the ballet took on a more yearning quality this time around. Now with rights increasingly under threat, the tone of the solos in “Voices” has changed — they seem more determined, more resolute. In the final group section, near the end, we hear the voice of the painter Agnes Martin, who says, “You’re not a mystic when you respond to beauty.” Those words are a reminder that the beauty of ballet is a spiritual sensation as much as a visual one. It expands beyond the surface. And it is for everyone.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/arts/dance/new-york-city-ballet-fall-season.html,Culture,BBC,By Gia Kourlas,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/15cul-nycb-notebook-qjcp/15cul-nycb-notebook-qjcp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:04:22+00:00,173d0bfae81ab635ab879fd12f7eb37fcf1818e5
b28caa81b0c9,Expansive Battles and Paper-Thin Bad Guys,computer and video games,"Battlefield 6 is built around a familiar question: What is the point of war? Why fight, when all the old standbys like honor and patriotism ring hollow? When all your struggles amount to nothing? When your biggest enemy is yourself? The franchise’s familiar large-scale shootouts, during which dozens of players fight on maps full of jeeps, tanks, planes and destructible buildings, are distractions full of memorable highs and lows. Nearly every 30-minute multiplayer match has moments when you’re facing insurmountable odds as your position is pummeled by waves of enemies, until a break in the action allows your squad to burst bellowing forth from cover and leap over obstacles in a last-ditch attempt to capture the enemy point, all while tank rounds and machine gun fire pound the walls overhead. Meaningless battles work when you’re playing online as nameless, faceless combatants, in it for the ride rather than the destination. Conquering the point feels properly triumphant, even though you’ll inevitably have to trade it back later — even though the match will end and reset itself, and you’ll have to start over again. In a few rounds, we’ll switch sides and my former ally will become my enemy. It’s harder to turn that meaninglessness into a compelling single-player narrative, which only exposes how empty Battlefield is at its core. The scripted six-hour campaign attempts to craft a world with a real sense of conflict, with real enemies who supposedly have different interests and ideology than me, who commit real atrocities and present a real threat to my existence. But none of this manifests in the narrative, which is vague and hazy at its sharpest moments. Soldiers scream in ambiguous, globally diverse accents. They wear armor and drive vehicles emblazoned with a clean, corporatized logo. The story starts in a fictional near-future, with the dissolution of NATO and the rise of a private military contractor called Pax Armata, which has taken control of several former NATO nations across Europe and Asia. We control members of a Marine special forces unit as they run around the world trying to take down a group with no real objective besides chaos. Pax clearly has no national interests. It’s simply a convenient artificial boogeyman, a conglomeration of bodies to shoot at in various global theaters. Battlefield 6’s war is truly postwar. It has been stripped of the normative messaging — competing ideologies, battles over sovereignty, questions of justice and security — that accompanies modern wars. All we need to know here is that America is under attack and there are bad guys who need shooting. “I’ll leave the politics to you, sir,” one Marine tells the president, a sentiment that perfectly sums up the whole enterprise. In place of any real politics are the brain-dead jingoisms your squadmates quip while freewheeling through points in Spain, Egypt, Tajikistan and the United States. During a mission in New York, your commander barks, “‘Never again’ — that means not on our watch, got it?” Another Marine casually drops “shock and awe” into conversation. They’re clumsy signifiers, stale from overuse during America’s distended war on terror. The firehouse where your team helps protect the president during the New York mission is festooned with Sept. 11 remembrance imagery. The heavy-handedness of all these messages is confusing, considering the anonymity of your supposed enemy. Much of the campaign’s plot revolves around the mystery of who is behind this curious organization. We get few answers in this direction but do meet its ostensible face, Harris, a former Marine who’s working for the bad guys because he was captured and disfigured in a past mission. All of this destruction, all of these dead bodies amount to a disappointingly simple vendetta. “What are we dying for?” Harris asks us with a pointed expletive. “Don’t you want to die for something real?” With this, the game’s villain puts a point on the story’s dilemma: There’s no glory in performing as a warrior for an empire so large it has no real enemies to fight. But aside from platitudes about being there for your squadmates, no concrete solutions are put forward. Your team ends up going rogue in order to seek out solutions on its own, an all-too-common motif in modern military shooters (most recently in the rebooted Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series), where libertarian themes of self-reliance and individual bravery often sneak in. The story and context of Battlefield 6’s campaign may provide the backdrop for each of the game’s nine multiplayer maps, like one on the ruined streets of Downtown Brooklyn and another in a cramped Cairo marketplace. But the imprecise nature of this mode means it doesn’t have to answer any of the campaign’s thorny questions. That the teams in an online session are evenly matched doesn’t require explanation, doesn’t require an unwieldy plot reveal explaining how the opposing force is funded by a shadowy tech billionaire or whatever. They simply are, as a function of the constraints and expectations of balanced competitive play. The tensions and conflict present in the multiplayer mode more closely resemble a team sport than a war. There are those rounds where one side runs away with the game, others where the underdog flips the odds and comes out on top. They’re fun, they’re spirited and the adrenaline pumps freely, but they don’t really have anything to do with real military engagements outside of their surface aesthetics. Within this unreal space it begins to make more sense that Battlefield 6’s primary developers, the Swedish studio DICE, would choose to make a game where grizzled American operators swaddled in high-tech kits rampage around the world. Beyond the clear visual parallels, it doesn’t feel anything like the images that scroll past on our social media feeds every day. That makes it easy to have fun in this unmoored soldiering fantasy. The hollow sense of purpose spun up by the campaign all but fades, and is easily discarded. We can enjoy the drama of playing within these ruins for a while, fighting only ourselves.

5edd87cb2ac0,"Review: At Limón, a Pony Club and a Pretender","dance;ballet, joyce theater, limon dance, dante puleio, jose limon","A man lies on his belly in the shape of a cross. Another man, naked, hangs over him, dangling nearly cruciform from a horizontal pole. The naked man descends, walks to the other’s head and slowly squats. The prone man rises, revealing that he has a horse’s tail. The two men merge into the form of a centaur. This is the arresting opening of “Jamelgos,” a work by the Mexican choreographer Diego Vega Solorza that had its world premiere at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday as part of Limón Dance Company’s early start on its 80th anniversary season. (The company was founded in 1946.) The opening is arresting especially for its potential connections to the work of José Limón, whose dances had an ambivalent attitude toward Catholic iconography and often focused on a power struggle between two men. That Vega Solorza, well known in his country but not here, is from the same region of Mexico as the Americanized Limón is the kind of resonance that a legacy company looks for when trying to freshen its repertory. The rest of “Jamelgos,” alas, is a disappointment. Out of fog more dancers emerge, with white ponytails on their heads and rears. (“Jamelgos” is slang for emaciated horses.) They wear hooded leather jerkins that expose their midriffs and upper thighs. In a series of fade-in-fade-out scenes, they swish their tails in bands of light and strike martial poses in fast and slow motion. Last year, Vega Solorza sold props and costumes from his works at Art Basel Miami Beach, and those for “Jamelgos” (by Julio César Delgado) have a fetishistic allure. It’s the choreography that’s lacking. You might think there’s nothing worse than boring, joyless depictions of group sex, but then strobe lights start flashing. In a program note, Vega Solorza presents all this as a rebellion against fixed ideas of masculine strength. But a rebellion in dance requires more kinetic imagination. That goes for revivals, too. On this program, “Jamelgos” is paired with a new production of Limón’s “The Emperor Jones” (1956) that seeks to downplay race and dial up homoerotic subtext. Such re-examinations of the company’s classics are permissible, even necessary, yet this one doesn’t come to life. “The Emperor Jones” is based on Eugene O’Neill’s 1920 play about a Pullman porter who convinces the people of a Caribbean island to make him emperor. This revival changes the setting to an urban one, outfits its protagonist with a fedora and exchanges his throne for an outsized leather armchair. The intended effect, I think, is to evoke film versions of “Scarface,” but the giant chair makes Jones (Johnson Guo) look more like a boy playing dress up. Jones is a pretender, yes, but he nevertheless needs believable prowess and physical charisma. In the film of Limón in the role, the choreographer conveys a prideful pleasure in motion that Guo’s performance misses, the shading that creates character. I was concerned that an amplification of subtext would make Limón’s work, not the most subtle to begin with, unbearably broad. And this production does overemphasize the gun hanging between Jones’s legs to a cartoonish degree. But I would have welcomed more homoerotic tension between Guo and Joey Columbus as the manipulating Man in White (originally the White Man). Any kind of tension would have helped. For all its updating, the production feels dutiful, not fully inhabited. Dante Puleio, the Limón company’s artistic director, is clearly trying to shake up the troupe’s fusty image. More power to him. Relevance matters to the survival of institutions like this. Fully imagined and embodied dancing matters more, though.

8ead3e930a5c,"D’Angelo, Acclaimed and Reclusive R&B Innovator, Dies at 51","d'angelo, obituary, r&b, pop rock music, black people;african american;african-american, video recordings, downloads and streaming, internal-open-access-from-nl","D’Angelo, the acclaimed neo-soul singer who found fame in the 1990s and early 2000s with an innovative and sensuous take on 1970s R&B, as well as with a risqué music video that briefly made him a pop culture phenomenon but helped drive him into nearly a decade of seclusion, died on Tuesday. He was 51. His death was confirmed in a statement by his family, which did not say where he died but gave the cause as cancer. During the first phase of his career, leading up to his triumph with the 2000 album “Voodoo,” D’Angelo was a leading light of a revolution in soul music, melding the seductive melodies of classic singers like Al Green and Marvin Gaye with the beats and urgency of hip-hop. His biggest songs, like “Lady,” “Brown Sugar” and “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” were hailed as supreme examples of the trend, which sought not a revival of Black pop traditions but a transformation of them. Each of those tracks became a Top 10 hit on Billboard’s R&B chart, D’Angelo went into heavy rotation on Black radio stations and “Lady” went to No. 10 on Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100 chart. D’Angelo’s signature vocal style was a delicately expressive falsetto that, like Prince’s, could build to an ecstatic wail. Also like Prince, he arranged his music meticulously, served as his own producer and played guitar. Critics exalted him as a worthy successor to the greatest traditions of Black pop. “He is R&B Jesus, and I’m a believer,” Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice in 2000. “Untitled,” which unfolds slowly, at an erotic tempo — it runs to more than seven minutes in its full album version — also crossed over to the wider pop market, thanks in no small part to its music video . In the video, D’Angelo stood against a dark backdrop as a Black Adonis in cornrows, apparently naked except for a gold chain with a crucifix. (The video framed its lower edge just below his waist.) The camera slowly scanned his muscled, sweat-drenched physique as he brought the song to an orgasmic climax. The video established D’Angelo as an unabashed sex symbol — The New York Times called it “ pure beefcake ” — and bolstered his commercial power, sending “Voodoo,” the album that the song appeared on, to No. 1 for two weeks. In 2001, “Voodoo” won best R&B album at the Grammys, and “Untitled” took best male R&B vocal performance. But D’Angelo, the son of a Pentecostal minister who sometimes described his art in spiritual terms, grew uncomfortable with being pigeonholed as a heartthrob. After a breakdown on tour, he fell into a depression and struggled with alcohol and drug abuse before going to rehab. “‘Untitled’ wasn’t supposed to be his mission statement for ‘Voodoo,’” his former manager, Dominique Trenier, told Spin magazine in 2008. “I’m glad the video did what it did,” Mr. Trenier added, “but he and I were both disappointed because, to this day, in the general populace’s memory, he’s the naked dude.” D’Angelo’s album “Voodoo,” from 2000, won a Grammy Award for best R&B album. Credit... Virgin Records D’Angelo also chafed at the description of his music as simply neo-soul. “I never claimed I do neo-soul,” he said in a Red Bull Music Academy interview in 2014. “When I first came out, I used to always say: ‘I do Black music. I make Black music.’” For much of the rest of his career, D’Angelo would vanish from the public eye for years at a time. After “Voodoo,” he did not release another album until “Black Messiah,” which he produced himself, in 2014. That album brought two more Grammys. His absences further cultivated his mystique among his fans, as well as drew concern. In May he withdrew from a festival performance in Philadelphia, citing a recent surgery. D’Angelo was born Michael Eugene Archer in South Richmond, Va., on Feb. 11, 1974. His father was a Pentecostal preacher and his mother was a legal secretary. As a child, he played organ and was part of the choir at his father’s church. He also spent time poring through the broad-ranging record collection of an uncle, and studied classical music briefly. After moving to Chesterfield, Va., for high school, he started a hip-hop group, IDU — which stood for Intelligent, Deadly but Unique — with friends, and appeared in talent shows. At 16, after winning a local contest, he came to New York to compete in Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater — where, he said, he won with a cover of Johnny Gill’s New Jack Swing track “Rub You the Right Way.” He soon returned to New York looking for a record deal. Auditioning for a music publisher, he performed a Jodeci song, a gospel song and a Miles Davis song: three distinct strands of his musical obsessions that he would soon intertwine. By his late teens, he was calling himself D’Angelo, a nickname that was said to be derived from Michelangelo. He was signed to EMI, and his first album, “Brown Sugar” (1995), laid out much of the approach that he would follow throughout his career: dense, soulful songs with multilayered vocals — all sung by D’Angelo himself — that drew from Prince, classic soul and traces of the gospel music he grew up with. “Brown Sugar” was D’Angelo’s debut studio album in 1995. Credit... EMI Records Driven by its title track and “Lady,” the album’s popularity grew steadily, reaching No. 4 on Billboard’s R&B chart and No. 22 on its all-genre Billboard 200 chart; within a year it went platinum. To follow up “Brown Sugar,” D’Angelo gathered a group of collaborators, including the drummer and producer Questlove, the keyboardist James Poyser and the hip-hop producer J Dilla. Calling themselves the Soulquarians — and sometimes joined by Erykah Badu, Common and Mos Def — they hunkered down at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, and some days spent as much time listening to music as recording it. “The best way to describe the process is very much like a sculpture,” he once told Rolling Stone . “You’re just constantly chipping and chipping away at it. I’ll work on something for a minute, and, once I feel like I’m starting to fixate on it, I put it away and go to another one.” At the same time, D’Angelo was becoming a bona fide celebrity. According to a profile in GQ magazine published in 2014, Madonna invited him to sing “Happy Birthday” to her at her 39th birthday party, in 1997. While recording “Brown Sugar,” D’Angelo became romantically involved with the soul singer Angie Stone. In 1998, they had a son together, Michael D’Angelo Archer II, also known as Swayvo Twain. D’Angelo had two other children, but complete information about his survivors was not immediately available. Stone, who was also an early rap pioneer, died in a car crash in March, at 63. The making of “Voodoo” stretched on for nearly two years in the studio. When released, it was received as a triumph. According to GQ, George Clinton, the funk icon behind the groups Parliament and Funkadelic, compared the album to Gaye’s 1971 landmark album “What’s Going On.” In the troubled wake of “Voodoo,” D’Angelo decamped to Richmond. In 2005, he was given a three-year suspended sentence for cocaine possession, and that same year he crashed his Hummer on a road near Richmond, breaking his ribs. He returned to performing in 2012, though he was no longer the svelte, muscular figure of his “Voodoo” days. “Black Messiah,” credited to D’Angelo and the Vanguard, was made with a team of collaborators that included Questlove, the jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the stalwart R&B drummer James Gadson. In a review in The New York Times, Jon Pareles and Jon Caramanica called it “a knotty, inward-looking, musicianly album made to reveal itself slowly.” The album and its release were partly political statements. D’Angelo and his label, RCA, rushed to release it as a response to the killing of Black men that year, including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. “The one way I do speak out is through music,” D’Angelo told his tour manager, Alan Leeds, as reported in The Times . “I want to speak out.” After the release of “Black Messiah,” D’Angelo said that he was working on a companion album, going through the surplus of songs he had written for that album, some of them more explicitly political. That album was never released, although he didn’t vanish from public view as completely as he had in the decade before. He contributed a song, “Unshaken,” to the soundtrack for the 2018 video game “Red Dead Redemption 2” and collaborated with Jay-Z and Jeymes Samuel on “I Want You Forever,” a slow jam from the soundtrack of Samuel’s 2024 movie “The Book of Clarence.” Throughout his career, D’Angelo sometimes described his creative process in terms that mirrored his religious upbringing. “I learned at an early age that what we were doing in the choir was just as important as the preacher,” he told GQ in 2014. “It was a ministry in itself. We could stir the pot, you know? The stage is our pulpit, and you can use all of that energy and that music and the lights and the colors and the sound. “But you know,” he added, “you’ve got to be careful.” Gavin Edwards contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/music/dangelo-dead.html,Culture,BBC,By Ben Sisario,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/14DAngelo-bltz-print1-SUB/13DAngelo-bltz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T16:21:46+00:00,7806310165bac9724b46a829660102b8a18556cc

This track pays tribute to “the cherry in my chocolate-covered dreams,” a faraway woman who’s “the finest little thing that my eyes ever saw.” His solo falsetto duets with a tenor choir — all D’Angelo’s voice — while organ chords lend a gospel undercurrent to his yearning. ▶ Listen on Spotify , Apple Music or YouTube ‘Jonz in My Bones’ (1995) Written with Angie Stone , “Jonz in My Bones” depicts an all-consuming need. It could be love, but it could also be an addiction. “This feeling that I got won’t leave me ’lone,” D’Angelo sings. That need is strong enough to keep him unmoored, emotionally and harmonically; simmering keyboard chords, a wandering bass line and D’Angelo’s layered vocals keep everything in limbo. ▶ Listen on Spotify , Apple Music or YouTube ‘Devil’s Pie’ (1998) D’Angelo recognized and confronted the temptations of fame and wealth in “Devil’s Pie”: “I myself feel the high from all that I despise,” he admitted. A lumpy backbeat, a skulking bass line, vocal harmonies that gather and dissolve at whim, and a whistling, skittering sample make the song simultaneously jaunty and sinister, a self-indictment that he struggles to escape. ▶ Listen on Spotify , Apple Music or YouTube ‘Untitled (How Does It Feel)’ (2000) “If you’ll have me, I can provide / everything that you desire,” D’Angelo promised in “Untitled.” This slow-motion come-on works up to multiple peaks, easing back and building again, ending with ecstatic falsetto cries. It established D’Angelo as a sex symbol with a video that lingered over his naked, toned body. But the unwanted aftermath of the video — tour audiences shouting “Take it off!” — pushed him toward years of reclusiveness. ▶ Listen on Spotify , Apple Music or YouTube",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/music/dangelo-songs-playlist.html,Culture,BBC,By Jon Pareles,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/00dangelo-playlist-gvzf/00dangelo-playlist-gvzf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T20:06:16+00:00,fc9c4aadaa80a035dcc1349447ebe39daa3caeab

Luckily, “Good Night, and Good Luck” is now available on demand, if you were otherwise engaged on that summer night, or missed the stage run. In this adaptation, written with Grant Heslov, from his own film from 2005, Clooney portrays Murrow at a fraught time in 1953, when the reporter took a principled stand against Senator Joseph R. McCarthy’s paranoia-infused anti-communist investigations. While Murrow is the story’s grimly stern heart and soul, David Cromer’s stylish production (smoothly captured by Micah Bickham) feels like a true ensemble piece. Fun fact: Clooney was not new to the live-broadcast experience — in 2000, he was in the Cold War drama “Fail Safe,” which aired live on CBS and is available on various platforms . ‘The Shark Is Broken’ Stream it on BroadwayHD . In Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws,” the shark hunter Quint, portrayed by Robert Shaw, ranked right below the toothy killing machine in terms of obsessive intensity. Nearly 50 years later, Ian Shaw revisited that highlight of his father’s career in “The Shark Is Broken.” Starting Oct. 16, you can stream a capture of the play, which Ian Shaw wrote with Joseph Nixon, and was recorded during a spring tour of Britain and Ireland. (A production ran on Broadway in 2023.) The show is essentially a backstage comedy taking place on the movie’s set. Ian Shaw portrays his hard-drinking father, Robert, who kills time with his co-stars Roy Scheider (Dan Fredenburgh) and Richard Dreyfuss (Ashley Margolis) on the boat Orca in between repairs to the faulty mechanical sharks they are supposed to act against. All told, this is a pretty entertaining way to watch a son honor his dad, and maybe settle a few accounts. ‘Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes’ Listen on Audible . Hugh Jackman’s enviable biceps and chiseled jaw may have played a teeny part in making him a star, so curious minds will want to know: How does he fare in an audio production? In this particular new release from Audible, at least, Jackman is superb — which is especially crucial because his character handles much of the narrative heavy lifting. The production had a stage life at the Minetta Lane Theater this spring, when Jesse Green praised Hannah Moscovitch’s “terrific, tightly plaited knot of a play” in The New York Times . The story of an affair between a novelist-turned-college-professor (Jackman) and one of his students (Ella Beatty) is told almost entirely from his perspective, until a late twist makes you reconsider everything that preceded. Conveniently, now you can just start back from the beginning and check out the clues you might have missed. ‘Phantom of the Opera’ Stream it at N.Y.U. Skirball . A couple of years ago, the maestro of digital live theater Joshua William Gelb staged and livestreamed a creepily effective “Nosferatu: A 3D Symphony of Horror” from inside his apartment. The show, which you can watch for free on YouTube , put the evocative power of sound design to spooky good use. From Oct. 23 to Nov. 3, Gelb and his Theater in Quarantine company return with another Halloween-appropriate live production, once again in partnership with N.Y.U. Skirball: a retelling of “Phantom of the Opera” created with Normandy Sherwood. Because Theater in Quarantine likes to challenge itself, this production will allow viewers to toggle between the performance and, as Gelb put it, “a phantom’s eye view of how we make digital magic.” ‘Bus Stop’ Stream it on YouTube . William Inge’s “Bus Stop,” from 1955, is a bittersweet, wonderfully evocative snapshot of loneliness and the need for connection that takes place in a Kansas diner, where bus passengers are marooned by a storm. A film adaptation starring Marilyn Monroe had its charms, but it took liberties with the story and rounded out some of its sharper angles. In this HBO broadcast from 1982, a touching, vulnerable Margot Kidder takes on the Monroe role of Cherie, whose singing skills don’t quite match her nightclub ambitions, and she is well paired with Tim Matheson as a smitten, rough-around-the-edges cowboy. While the picture quality of this YouTube upload isn’t optimal, the ensemble cast makes up for it, a rogue’s gallery of terrific character actors, led by Joyce Van Patten as the diner’s owner and Pat Hingle as a smooth-talking lech who was cut from the movie.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/theater/george-clooney-good-night-and-good-luck.html,Culture,BBC,By Elisabeth Vincentelli,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/streaming-theater-lcbz/streaming-theater-lcbz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:02:29.042000+00:00,bed776cf630016214a7d3dd449f9f04148b677de
f46c57526ea7,The Conductor Who Set the Course of Music in the 20th Century,"pierre monteux, classical music, personal profile;people story, the rite of spring","On the back wall of a little wooden concert hall near his home in Hancock, Maine, the conductor Pierre Monteux posted 20 rules for students attending his summer school, L’École Monteux. Some rules related to baton technique, stipulating that the first beat of a bar should always be clear, the last always notched higher than the first. Some spoke to the trust that a conductor needed to place in the players of an orchestra, and others to the faith that one should try to keep in audiences. Several insisted on the dignity of the profession; no fewer than three mandated that a conductor should never, ever bend down. John Canarina, Monteux’s biographer and a regular pupil in the 1950s, pointed out that there was “nothing philosophical or metaphysical” about these strictures, that they offered merely “practical advice.” Only a few of the rules, indeed, were explicitly aesthetic. “Don’t permit the orchestra to play always a boresome mezzo-forte” was one. “Don’t adhere pedantically to metronomic time” was another. Perhaps the most crucial was also the most opaque: “Don’t fail to make music.” However you define music, Monteux rarely failed to make it. One of the most important musicians of his or any era, Monteux became widely known in 1913, after he stayed “nerveless as a crocodile,” in Stravinsky’s words , while conducting the turbulent Ballets Russes debut of “The Rite of Spring.” His career, and his life, were still three years from their end when, as “a lovable old penguin with the mustache of a gourmet,” in the telling of one English writer, he signed on as the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1961, at age 86. Throughout, Monteux had a reputation for making music with balance, with energy, with decency and with taste — for “pure glow and luminosity, loveliness, brightness, and sheer auditory incandescence,” the critic Virgil Thomson once wrote. Monteux also had that rare talent for making it seem like he wasn’t the one making music at all. He dismissed colleagues who “gyrate upon the dais” and patrons “so intent on seeing” that “they forget the composer, the composition and the hard work of the orchestra in their adulation of the conductor.” He had no desire (or any real need) to express his deepest self through his art , and no pretension to stating a grand artistic case. “He conducts Bach and Beethoven and Debussy, bringing out their essence,” one critic commented in 1936. “He does not conduct Pierre Monteux.” The “Rite” might have danced Monteux to fame, but even Stravinsky admired that he had “never looked for his own glory in it.” Some listeners consequently heard a certain unoriginality in Monteux’s work — the conductor Fritz Reiner once strongly implied that he was a “mediocre man, with no personality” — while others saw him as a musician for aficionados, even for intellectuals. Dedicate any time to his recordings today, and it is hard to understand either charge. His Haydn is spirited; his Brahms is shapely; his Tchaikovsky has the right blend of structure and melodrama. His Debussy and Ravel are as gorgeous as his Scriabin , but beauty is not their outright aim; they have a propulsion to them, a strength. In a sensational account with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, his “Rite” still astonishes, singing as it sears. It took confidence to conduct like this, and perhaps what Thomson called a “Gallic clearheadedness,” but Monteux did not feel entitled to take the same liberties as colleagues like Wilhelm Furtwängler or Leopold Stokowski. Thomson once described another conductor’s interpretations as “authoritative but gentlemanly,” elaborating that “no matter how wrong one may think him about any given musical rendition, there always seems to be room for his conception and for one’s own in the concert hall.” He was writing about Serge Koussevitzky , the music director of the Boston Symphony after 1924, yet the judgment applies more precisely to Monteux, Koussevitzky’s predecessor — except that it is difficult to imagine Monteux sounding all that wrong in the first place. MONTEUX WAS BORN in Paris in 1875, not long after Ravel. His father had traded the métier of a shoe seller for another at the billiards table; his mother was a piano teacher. Pierre initially studied the violin, enrolling at the Paris Conservatory and finding work at the Folies Bergère, before he took up the viola as well. As a teenager he became the violist of the esteemed Geloso Quartet and a principal of one of the better ensembles in city, the Orchestre des Concerts Colonne; at 20, he added the role of assistant conductor, holding it for 17 years. Even as a maturing musician, Monteux had remarkable opportunities to encounter the creative artists of his time. As a chamber musician he played Brahms for Brahms and Grieg in the presence of Grieg. He conducted a Saint-Saëns oratorio with Saint-Saëns at the organ. He learned “La Mer” under Debussy’s baton and was seated in the orchestra of the Opéra-Comique for the debut of “Pelléas et Mélisande.” The composer, Monteux later recalled , “did not want anything shimmering .” Those connections weren’t as important to Monteux’s trajectory, though, as his brief collaboration with Stravinsky. The Colonne was the Parisian house orchestra for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, and in 1910 it was in the pit for the premiere of “The Firebird.” The following season, Monteux was handed rehearsal duty for “Petrushka,” and ran it solidly enough to be given the premiere as well. After that, he became Diaghilev’s conductor of choice, touring with the company and introducing Ravel’s “Daphnis et Chloé,” Debussy’s “Jeux” and, most infamously, the “Rite.” It’s worth dwelling on what Monteux did for these works, so central to the course of music in the 20th century. No music is guaranteed a future, however important it may eventually seem; witness the demise of the Franck Symphony , which Monteux endured so often that he ended up “tired to death” of it. But Monteux did more than just premiere “Petrushka” and the “Rite.” Despite his misgivings about the “Rite” especially — it apparently gave him a headache when Stravinsky first played it for him on the piano — he took responsibility for them. In 1914, Monteux moved both works off the ballet stage and into the concert hall; the musicologist Richard Taruskin has argued that Monteux’s orchestral performance that April “rescued” the “Rite” from infamy and “set the score on its inexorable path of conquest.” Then Monteux kept playing the scores for another 50 years, giving listeners the feeling, deceptive yet characteristic, that they were encountering the works themselves, unaltered and unadorned. When the New York Times critic Olin Downes heard Monteux give the Carnegie Hall premiere of the “Rite” in January 1924, for example, he felt able to review the piece without saying much about Monteux beyond that he was there. Only that March, when Monteux and the “Rite” came back, did Downes correct the omission. “It is difficult to think of a conductor who would have interpreted the music with such fire and enthusiasm for every measure,” he wrote , “at the same time that he kept a perfectly cool head and the most complete technical control of his forces through it all.” IT’S STRANGE that Monteux came to prominence through such a notorious scandal, for the rest of his life passed without causing serious contention. He served in the trenches during World War I, turned an American tour with the Ballets Russes into brief control of French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera, then, after 1919, restored the Boston Symphony to glory as it emerged from the most difficult period in its history. “It is to him,” Thomson recalled of hearing Monteux as a Harvard student then, “that I owe my conception of what an orchestra should sound like.” Cast unhappily aside for Koussevitzky in Boston, Monteux went on to posts in Amsterdam and Paris, and, from 1936, enjoyed a long tenure at the San Francisco Symphony. That orchestra wasn’t among the more virtuosic ensembles of its time, but Monteux’s traits shine in their recordings: the rhythmic definition of Debussy’s “Images” ; the storytelling in Berlioz’s “Symphonie Fantastique” ; the sanity that disciplines their Beethoven . The best of those albums was made in 1960, as part of a reunion that took place eight years after Monteux had left the West Coast: Strauss’s “Tod und Verklärung,” surpassingly direct, and Wagner’s “Siegfried Idyll,” beaming with contentment. Rather like his contemporary Bruno Walter , it was only as Monteux passed into his eighth and ninth decades that admiration turned into veneration. Unlike Walter, though, Monteux lost little of his musical vigor with age. He returned to the Boston Symphony at the request of Charles Munch in 1951, then often thereafter. Some of the musicians he had hired decades earlier were still part of the ensemble, including the concertmaster Richard Burgin . In the studio, they made some essential recordings, including “Petrushka,” “La Mer” and the last three Tchaikovsky symphonies . Collections of radio broadcasts suggest that their live performances could be even more electrifying than those they gave for microphones alone; a Tchaikovsky Fifth, relayed from Tanglewood in 1959, is so incendiary that the crowd breaks into applause before its finale even gets to the coda. The Boston Symphony recordings, though, are not quite so touchingly affecting as those that Monteux made in London. Among them are an exhilarating Sibelius Second , big and bold and sweeping; an “Enigma” Variations that lends Elgar the formality of Brahms; a Berlioz “Roméo et Juliette” of unceasing flow; a “Prélude à l’Après-midi d’un Faune” with striking momentum and barely a shimmer in earshot; a “Daphnis” of unquestionable mastery. Most moving of all, perhaps, is one of the last pieces that Monteux recorded, in February 1964: the Ravel ballet “Ma Mère l’Oye,” with a concluding “Le Jardin Féerique” of inconceivable tenderness. “Through a long life to hear music with unfailing freshness — surely the gods have few finer gifts to bestow,” Ross Parmenter wrote in The Times after hearing a Monteux performance in 1957. “One could not help feeling that he, perhaps almost more than any musician in our generation, has been endowed with that gift most abundantly.” The gift of Monteux making music, thankfully, is one that keeps on giving.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/music/pierre-monteux-conductor.html,Culture,BBC,By David Allen,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19cul-monteux-essay-01-kmgh/19cul-monteux-essay-01-kmgh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T09:02:02+00:00,de35100712ece2118d960b214aa12c52ccbaf250
0dae6df9ada6,"In a New Memoir, Kevin Federline Sounds an Alarm on Britney Spears","kevin federline, books, you thought you knew, britney spears, pop rock music, divorce, wills and estates, personal profile;people story","In a new memoir, Kevin Federline, the dancer, D.J. and ex-husband of Britney Spears, provides his perspective on their strained relationship, and says he is concerned that the decision four years ago to release the pop star from her conservatorship may have been ill-advised. In “ You Thought You Knew ,” due Oct. 21, Federline, 47, charts his path from teenage knucklehead growing up in Fresno, Calif., to husband and father of two children with the singer. He and Spears finalized their divorce in 2007 after three years of marriage and then began a prolonged, messy custody battle that ended in 2008. In his book, Federline recounts his version of that dispute and talks of Spears’s use of drugs and alcohol and angry outbursts during the late stages of their marriage. In the 18 years since their split, Federline has observed his ex-wife largely from a distance as the pair co-parented. “We haven’t spoken in years,” Federline told The New York Times in an interview. But he writes about becoming increasingly concerned with what he describes as Spears’s erratic behavior, which he learned about mostly secondhand from their two sons, Sean Preston, now 20, and Jayden James, 19. In his book, Federline recounts his version of his custody battle with Spears. In one chapter, he recounts the time when the boys, as teenagers, declared that they did not want to go back to their mother’s house for several reasons, including fear. “They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep — ‘Oh, you’re awake?’ — with a knife in her hand,” he writes. “Then she’d turn around and pad off without explanation.” In the penultimate chapter of the book, Federline fully expresses his concern. “The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it’s racing toward something irreversible,” he writes. “It’s become impossible to pretend everything’s OK,” he adds. “From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we’re getting close to the 11th hour. Something bad is going to happen if things don’t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding the pieces.” In a statement, a spokesman for Spears said, “With news from Kevin’s book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.” In that memoir, which is being turned into a film, Spears disputes that she ever had significant substance abuse issues and characterizes her custody battle with Federline as traumatizing. She writes that Federline had not let her see her sons for weeks on end and “tried to convince everyone that I was completely out of control” as part of his bid for full custody years ago. Federline, who has also dabbled in reality TV, said he had not discussed the contents of the memoir with Spears. “I’ve never, ever, once, been against Britney,” Federline said in the interview. “I’ve only tried to help my sons have an incredible relationship with their mother. And it’s hard because when I really reflect on everything that’s happened — my kids do not know the woman that I married. And I’ve spent two decades trying to bridge that gap.” Spears has expressed interest in repairing her relationship with her sons and several times within the last year, she has published posts on social media marking their time together . Spears rose to the pinnacle of pop stardom, then was placed in a conservatorship that oversaw her finances and personal affairs in 2008 after her mental health struggles spilled into public view. In the book, Federline discusses the evening when Spears was whisked away to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and placed under a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold following a three-hour standoff involving their children. “It was one of the hardest nights of my life,” Federline writes. “I felt sick over what she was going through. This was someone I had loved. Someone I had built a life with. The mother of my children.” A Los Angeles judge terminated that conservatorship in 2021 after finding that it was “no longer required.” Federline says in his book that the so-called “Free Britney movement” — the push by fans and supporters to have the conservatorship terminated — may have “started from a good place,” but he writes it vilified people around Spears so intensely that now professionals with the ability to help his ex-wife may be too afraid to step in. “All those people who put so much effort into that,” he writes, “should now put the same energy into the ‘Save Britney’ movement. Because this is no longer about freedom. It’s about survival.” In recent months Spears has again drawn the attention of the tabloids — and reportedly raised the concern of some in her circle — with posts on social media that include a video of her dancing in a mansion that appeared to have dog excrement on the floor and with a bandaged knee, writing on Instagram that “it snaps out now and then, not sure if it’s broken.” Though Federline, in his book, concedes he does not know the perfect “solution” moving forward, he asks that anyone “who has ever been moved by Britney” stand by his children and their mother. “Now, more than ever, they need your support,” he writes. “I’ve been their buffer for years, but now it’s bigger than me. It’s time to sound the alarm.” Julia Jacobs contributed reporting from New York.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/music/britney-spears-kevin-federline-book.html,Culture,BBC,By Matt Stevens,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14cul-Federline-book-zqmp/14cul-Federline-book-zqmp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T09:00:20+00:00,4565f703589916f5856ca75456125c999d4c432a
145f37dd4ad2,"After D’Angelo Bared It All, His Career Was Never the Same","d'angelo, r&b, pop rock music, black people;african american;african-american, video recordings, downloads and streaming, paul hunter, personal profile;people story","The video for “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” helped turn D’Angelo into a cultural touchstone. “The most controversial music video to air in years,” a New York Times article called it in 2000 , “it depicts the muscular, cornrowed singer, adorned only in a crucifix necklace.” The clip supercharged D’Angelo’s career and also helped derail it. And it certainly wasn’t his idea. A reserved visionary, D’Angelo — who died of cancer at 51 on Tuesday — was never a prolific artist as he helped usher in the neo-soul movement three decades ago. Five years elapsed between his groundbreaking debut album, “Brown Sugar,” and his acclaimed 2000 follow-up, “Voodoo.” “Untitled,” a crooning ballad written and produced by D’Angelo and Raphael Saadiq, was envisioned as a nod to Prince’s impact and legacy. D’Angelo’s manager, Dominique Trenier, saw the song as an opportunity to increase the singer’s popularity and sex appeal. He wanted the video to convey a piercingly intimate encounter. “We didn’t want an onscreen love interest,” Trenier told The Times in 2000. “We wanted him to be able to make contact with whoever was watching it one-on-one.” To achieve that, he wanted D’Angelo to appear naked — or as naked as could be portrayed in a video that would endlessly loop on MTV and BET. “Initially, to him, it seemed completely bonkers,” Trenier told Spin Magazine in 2008. “He didn’t quite get what I was saying. He kept going, ‘What do you mean, naked?’” He wore a necklace, but naked ultimately meant a muscular D’Angelo posing for a lingering shot that focused on his lips, chiseled arms and abs as sweat dripped from his torso. “I was skeptical at first when Dom came to me,” D’Angelo said in 2000. “I was like, ‘Yeah, is this really gonna work?’ But when I got there to do it, I felt pretty comfortable.” D’Angelo told the writer and filmmaker Dream Hampton that he discussed the video’s concept with Trenier for about a half-hour. “Then we didn’t talk about it again,” he said. “I just showed up. And it was really about concentrating on my performance. I had to sing the song 17 times.” The video was shot in New York City and directed by Paul Hunter. In showing a Black male body on sexualized display, the clip immediately stood out. It landed during an era of “Total Request Live” that typically aired sanitary offerings from boy bands such as ’N Sync and the Backstreet Boys alongside videos featuring the largess of hip-hop’s bling era and the video vixens within. Before the video, D’Angelo was known primarily as an artist. Now he was a sex symbol. On tour supporting “Voodoo,” fans often screamed and pleaded for D’Angelo to strip onstage. That kind of attention was not the type that D’Angelo had striven for. In the ensuing years, he fell into addiction, suffered from writer’s block and mostly turned away from making music until “Black Messiah,” which arrived in 2014. As he stayed in seclusion for more than a decade, the sight of him in the “Untitled” video was still the image much of the world was left with. “I feel really guilty, because that was never the intention,” Trenier, who died in 2016 , said in 2008. “‘Untitled’ wasn’t supposed to be his mission statement for ‘Voodoo.’ I’m glad the video did what it did, but he and I were both disappointed because, to this day, in the general populace’s memory, he’s the naked dude.” For decades, the true message of the video went over nearly everyone’s head, Hunter and D’Angelo disclosed in a 2012 GQ interview. “Most people think the ‘Untitled’ video was about sex,” Hunter said. “But my direction was completely opposite of that. It was about his grandmother’s cooking. Think of your grandmother’s greens, how it smelled in the kitchen. What did the yams and fried chicken taste like? That’s what I want you to express.” D’Angelo agreed: “It’s so true,” he added. “We talked about the Holy Ghost and the church before the take. The veil is the nudity and the sexuality. But what they’re really getting is the spirit.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/music/dangelo-untitled-video.html,Culture,BBC,By Jonathan Abrams,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/arts/14cul-dangelo-untitled-still/14cul-dangelo-untitled-still-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T21:04:34+00:00,a12a7e425d0213e764beea419ae778218d57d18a

Here was one unsuccessful attempt: “They don’t sound anything like Ween, but they sound like they probably like Ween?” Blank stare. I also described the band’s lead singer, Cameron Winter, as seeming like the victim of a wizard’s spell, one which made him sing for the rest of his life like Julian Casablancas — and he is miserable about it. I’m not sure that gets any closer to capturing the bizarro magic that oozes out of this record. Maybe I should just say “go listen to Geese” and leave it at that. A highlight from “Getting Killed” kicks off this roundup of recently released tracks that I think are worth your time. It also includes another band with an animalistic moniker ( Gorillaz ), two different collaborations between an established star and an underground hero ( Hayley Williams teaming up with Jay Som, and Oklou with FKA twigs ), and an unconventional love song about letting one’s freak flag fly (from one of contemporary pop’s true weirdos, Doja Cat ). Gather your flock and press play. I may be stomped flat, but my loneliness is gone, Lindsay 1. Geese: “Husbands” “I’ll repeat what I say, but I’ll never explain,” begins the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, in an offering that sums up his inscrutable but somehow emotive lyricism. “Husbands” is a lurching dirge that seems as if it’s teetering on the edge of complete collapse, mirroring how Winter’s soulful warble perpetually sounds like it’s about to fall out of tune. But as the song progresses, it slowly steadies itself into a sturdy rhythm and allows an off-kilter beauty to emerge. ▶ Listen on Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube 2. Doja Cat: “Stranger” “I believe the weirdest ones survive,” sings Doja Cat — from experience, if that truly bonkers performance on a recent “Saturday Night Live” episode is any indication. Doja’s bright and infectious new album, “Vie,” is less confrontational than her 2023 LP, “Scarlet,” but she hasn’t exactly sanded down her spikiest edges. That’s evident on “Stranger,” a surprisingly tender song that defines true love as feeling comfortable being your weirdest possible self in front of someone else. On a bed of dreamy synths cut through with ribbons of saxophone, Doja sings, “Nothing you do could freak me out.” How sweet!",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-geese-neko-case.html,Culture,BBC,By Lindsay Zoladz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14amplifier-nl-qgkw/14amplifier-nl-qgkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T18:00:04+00:00,cbf4db1b6e101f6a756305230a295b82218daa77

Malala became a feminist and political icon at 15 years old, after a member of the Taliban tried to assassinate her while she was riding the school bus. She was targeted for saying that girls should have the right to go to school. At 16, she wrote a memoir about the experience. And at 17, she became the youngest person to ever win the Nobel Peace Prize. For years, the world has known her as this extraordinary young activist. But now she has a new memoir out. It’s called “Finding My Way.” And in it, she talks about learning to do ordinary things — make friends, find her personal style, study for exams, go to parties, even fall in love. Malala, welcome to “Modern Love.” malala yousafzai Thank you. anna martin We are so happy that you’re in the studio with us.

And I was like, about what? Like, who wants to write if there’s nothing meaningful? But the timing of “Finding My Way,” my new memoir, just felt right. And I knew there was something to share that is meaningful to people. anna martin Tell me more about how you knew the moment was right to begin writing. I love that you waited, even though people were clamoring, it sounds like. How did you know the time was right? malala yousafzai I was reflecting on how I had become a young woman. I was known in the public eye as a girl who was shot by the Taliban at age 15. And I was still meeting people who would see me as that girl. And I wanted to reintroduce myself beyond those titles, beyond those headlines. And I wanted to show that, now, I have experienced much more. I had this incredible time at college. I made incredible friends. I had my first love. I am married. I have been going through other challenges and difficulties, from mental health to even coming to a decision about marriage itself. But this is all a part of me. And activism is, of course, the mission of my life. But I’m more than that as well. And I wanted to share the personal story. So these are the true reflections of me. anna martin This is, I think, very important. And part of the reason I loved this book so much is, you are so immediately recognizable — your name, your face, your work. And I loved how this book, it talks about big things, certainly, but at the same time, there were all of these small, ordinary, everyday details about your life that I thought just added such dimension. I felt very grateful that you were sharing those things with us. malala yousafzai I think we see this perfect image of everybody on social media. Or the way people usually tell their story is, like, they somehow knew how to figure it all out. But I had to be very honest that I was actually very shy at school. I was so scared that I will never be able to make any friends. So in college, of course, I was there because I wanted to study at Oxford. But more than anything, I just wanted to make friends. I did not want to feel alone anymore. anna martin Before you went to college, when you were a teenager, it seemed to me, reading this book, that you had quite a serious life. You’re flying to speak with world leaders and be on panels. You’re doing public activism work. What was it like for you to be doing all of this stuff so young and so close to the attack? What was that like? malala yousafzai When I look back, I feel very different because now, I see how I had somehow accepted the global recognition I was given, and I felt like people were defining me when I was still in a coma. They were calling me brave, courageous. An activist speaks truth to power — all of that. And I was like, wow, I’m 15. I have to start my school again and figure out my life — anna martin In the UK. malala yousafzai — in a new country, in the UK. So much to process, yet this is now the mission of my life. Somehow, I was forcing myself to accept that. In school, I had literally no friends. I only made one best friend by the end of my school time. I would still talk to my old friends from Pakistan, have those long calls with them. And the rest of my time, I was either with the family at home, or I would be traveling, doing speeches and conferences. So my exposure was very limited. Actually, I had not seen boys my age. anna martin Because you went to an all girls’ school? malala yousafzai I went to an all girls’ school. And it was just older people. anna martin They weren’t so amazing at age 15. I’ll just share that as someone who was around those. malala yousafzai I know. anna martin [LAUGHS]: malala yousafzai I found out when I went to university. anna martin You found out. You were like, OK, I wasn’t missing anything. Yeah. malala yousafzai No. I was like, oh, I’m glad I saw it. And now I know. But — anna martin They smell kind of weird, don’t you think? malala yousafzai A lot of things. I think that could be a different podcast for us. But it was just this feeling that I was not living the life a child should be living at age 15. So at college, like, much later, when I was not being watched by my parents, when I felt I could be myself, and there are not these work people after me asking me to do this and that, and I thought I had just more control over my life, that’s when I was like, OK, I’m going to just hang out, do these crazy things. Somebody wants me to climb the rooftop, I will. Late night parties? anna martin We’re going to get to that. We’re going to get to that. malala yousafzai I will. anna martin Oh! malala yousafzai Yeah, I think that’s — I thought that college would be just this limited time of my life where I get to do anything I want. And then after that, maybe I’ll just go back to the old serious life. But I was like, this is that time, the three years where I’m studying at Oxford. Maybe I can be more adventurous. anna martin Right before you go to Oxford — this moment in the book tickled me so much — you’re trying to figure out what to pack, what to wear. malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin Because your mom had chosen your outfits, right? malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin Do you remember — I mean, of course, it’s your life. But why don’t you share what you did in order to figure out what to pack? I loved this detail. malala yousafzai I know. I love my mom, but she’s a very strict mom. And she was always deciding what I should be wearing. Same for university. She said, let me pack everything for you. So it was traditional dresses, shalwar kameez. And my mom always got me a size bigger than mine somehow. And it’s just no sense of fashion, none of that for me. anna martin Much love, Mom, though. malala yousafzai I know, I know, but — and for me at university, it was about me feeling like every other student. And I did not want to stand out. Because of course, when I wear my shalwar kameez, the traditional Pakistani dress, I do stand out. And people have seen me in the public eye in those outfits. So I wanted to just wear a jumper, just some jeans. anna martin A sweater. Again, I’m decoding. malala yousafzai Sweater. anna martin [LAUGHS]: malala yousafzai Trousers. anna martin Pants. malala yousafzai A hoodie, pants. Oh, my goodness. anna martin [LAUGHS]: No, I’m joking. Now it’s become kind of a bit, but — malala yousafzai Sorry, America. anna martin — the UK — no, it’s totally fine. I’m translating for them — malala yousafzai Casual. anna martin — so they’ll understand. malala yousafzai Very, very, very casual — anna martin Very casual. malala yousafzai — clothes that you just assimilate, and you are like any other student. anna martin Right. malala yousafzai That’s what I wanted. I was like, I just want to be a normal student. So, yeah, my mom would put a Pakistani dress. I would remove it and put in a jumper. And somehow, I found a way out through that. And I took these more casual clothes. And my search on Google at the time was “Selena Gomez 2017 casual outfits.” anna martin Was it like a lot of infinity scarves? Do you remember those things? malala yousafzai Yes, and just, like, those long sort of gemstone kind of necklaces. anna martin Yes! We were — so it looked like chandeliers. malala yousafzai Yeah. anna martin Why were we dressing like that? malala yousafzai I don’t know. Too many scarves around their neck. [LAUGHS] anna martin So many infinity scarves when it wasn’t even cold, I will say. malala yousafzai No. But I want to forget all of those outfits — anna martin You’re right. We should move on, yeah. malala yousafzai — that I wore once. I was like, OK. anna martin We should move on. We should move on. [laughs] So you get to Oxford with a suitcase full of Selena Gomez casual. malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin Who were the people you were drawn to as friends? malala yousafzai Wow. I was exploring the whole university. I was saying hello to almost everybody because there was no criteria for me. I wanted to meet as many people. There were incredible people in my subject group. Every friend was unique in their own way. And we had a lot in common, but also very different experiences in terms of our background, where we had come from. There was always something to talk about and always something to learn when you were with friends. They made Oxford life more fun for me because this was a time when I was not being asked about what it was like meeting that president, and so what do you do through Malala Fund? It was about, how was your essay last week? Wasn’t that question so hard? Did you figure it out? This tutor is, like, so annoying. Or — anna martin [LAUGHS]: malala yousafzai — can we skip this lecture, please? anna martin Yeah, yeah. malala yousafzai These were the conversations. And that’s exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be a student. I wanted to be treated as a friend. And all of these people, the incredible friends I made at Oxford, made me feel like I was their friend. And I felt so secure with them, not being judged. And yeah, this was the most precious thing from college. anna martin You are making friends. You’re doing all these totally normal college activities. malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin And yet, you do have a security detail that follows you on campus. Are they quite literally everywhere with you, just a few steps behind? Or how was that? malala yousafzai Yeah, they’re following you. They are non-uniform. And they want to keep it as normal for you as they can. anna martin Sure. malala yousafzai But there is a point where your friends are like, we see these strangers behind you every day. Are you OK? Are they following you? And I’m like, no, no, they’re just taking care of me. Don’t worry. [LAUGHS] anna martin They would come to parties and stuff? malala yousafzai Yeah. anna martin OK. That’s fine. malala yousafzai Yeah. I mean — anna martin Some older guys at the parties. malala yousafzai Yeah. Quite older, yes. anna martin Quite older. They could blend in. You also got up to some mischief in college in the dead of night. Tell me about that. malala yousafzai Yeah. So in college, I found out about rooftop climbing. And this is a secret thing that these students do where they’re like, we want to get in trouble. So in our college at Oxford, there is the bell tower. And it’s not easy to get up there. So you have to go up to the top floor — anna martin Describe it for me, in case I want to ever go to Oxford and climb this. malala yousafzai I think you should not do that. anna martin You’re right. malala yousafzai I think it’s not allowed anymore, but — anna martin Copy that. malala yousafzai So you go up to the top floor of the main Talbot Hall. anna martin OK. malala yousafzai And you get into this small room there. And there is a small window. And you open that window. You sneak out through the window. And there is this narrow roof path. But it’s very narrow. anna martin I’m getting so anxious — malala yousafzai Like one person — anna martin — but keep going. Yes. malala yousafzai You could put one foot at a time, basically. anna martin Like, show me with your hands how narrow is it. malala yousafzai It’s this narrow. anna martin Don’t you even say that. malala yousafzai It’s very narrow. It’s basically like the roof’s the edge, the side. anna martin You’re clinging on, basically malala yousafzai And then there’s another part where you have to jump to, now, this next part of the roof. It’s very scary. So I had that mysterious friend who took me there. And they were helping me. And so they jumped before, and then I jumped after. anna martin It’s night, right? malala yousafzai It’s midnight. It’s very late at night. anna martin Are there lights around? Describe it. And put me in that moment with you the first time. So it’s dark outside. You’re looking out, right about to take that jump. What’s going through your mind? malala yousafzai It’s very dark in the college. It’s quiet. And I felt like it was just me who was in control of what was happening. And we were about to climb the rooftop. It was a very risky journey because you are walking on this very narrow path of the roof. And one misstep, you will fall from the fourth floor of the building. I don’t think you will survive. And you go up to the bell tower, and you sit in there. And you could see the bell above you. And it’s just so beautiful. You look down. You could see the whole college. You’re wondering who’s doing what in their room. Some have their lights on. And some might be sleeping right now. You look at the library. Who’s still studying [LAUGHS]: at midnight? anna martin Not you. malala yousafzai And you look down, and you are like, hmm, are these the college security? I hope they’re not looking for you. And I had just told my security that night that I was done with everything. You guys can go to bed. So I was just looking at their room as well — anna martin You were really alone. malala yousafzai — and hoping that they do not suddenly wake up and look for me. It was a moment where I felt so close to nature, so close to myself. I could hear my heart. And it was just a magical, beautiful moment. And there I was, sitting with a stranger, just doing something that I should not have been doing. But I was OK to get in trouble. I wanted to try things without feeling like anybody was watching me, anybody was judging me or commenting about me. It sounds too dramatic when I talk about it, but it was — anna martin No, it doesn’t. malala yousafzai — truly a moment when I felt that I am living the true college experience. anna martin It is, to me, a really profound moment of reckoning and introspection for you, right? And you spoke about how you’d accepted this role other people had put you into, and certainly, that you’d also stepped into on your own, with your work and your fund. But this is a thing — and I say this with utmost care — it’s a stupid thing to do because it’s so far up. malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin But it’s like, you’re doing it because you want to. Right? malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin You’re doing it because you’re like, let’s do it. malala yousafzai Yeah. And that was my first time, but not my last time I went there. anna martin And why did you keep doing it? malala yousafzai It’s really hard to explain. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai Trying climbing to the rooftop made me connect to a part of me that I thought had gone missing. I was a very adventurous person growing up in Pakistan. I loved to try new things. I was adventurous. And when my life took a sharp turn, and I started a new life in a new country, I just thought I could never connect back to that old self. Or I would just never know what I would have been like if none of these things had happened, if I hadn’t been attacked, if I hadn’t started this activist life in a new place. That when I was in college, and when I was climbing rooftops, I felt like I was connecting with that old part of me. With time, I have become that person, that I try new things. I don’t care if I do it wrong or if I get judged for it or what people think about it. With time, you just realize you have to live your life. And you can’t just dictate yourself or do the self-sabotage on yourself, where you feel like you are expected to live your life a certain way. And if you do it otherwise, then somehow you are not satisfying the expectations. So college was a time when I was slowly testing it. anna martin I mean, what you’re saying is really important, I think. It wasn’t so much a discovery of a part of yourself. It was rediscovery. malala yousafzai Yes. Yes. anna martin Now, this is a cheesy question, but bear with me. I wonder — and you can feel free to say no — but when you were up there, did you picture younger you, the one who had that adventurous spark? malala yousafzai Yes. I could see the younger Malala. I am not a person who thinks too much about the past because my life has changed so much that if I put myself in that place where I’m thinking what it could have been like, you can never be satisfied, imagining your life differently. So in college, rather than thinking too much about what it would have been like if I were here as just a normal student and with no recognition, and people knew nothing about me, and they were maybe not watching me — and it felt like that. And I’m not saying that people are actually watching you and — anna martin Of course. malala yousafzai — people are actually commenting about you. Sometimes they do. That’s sometimes how the social media world appears. anna martin You have a level of scrutiny on you that is — malala yousafzai But it’s how you feel because it affects you so much. I usually say, it doesn’t affect me, or it shouldn’t. I agree with that. I don’t let it affect my work. But in the end, the truth is, yes, it does, even if you are trying to fight it back or try to not let it distract you. But it is somehow influencing you. anna martin You mean this sort of people watching you — malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin — this feeling. Yes. malala yousafzai Yes. So in college, I felt like the eyes were not on me. anna martin Oh. malala yousafzai And I was in my own secret world. And I thought, I don’t know how I’m supposed to be, but I’m going to experience these things, these emotions. And that will tell me something about myself. anna martin I’m going to jump. malala yousafzai I’m going to jump. I’m going to climb. I’m going to swim. No, I can’t swim. anna martin No swimming. malala yousafzai No swimming. [MUSIC PLAYING] anna martin Stay with us. [MUSIC PLAYING] I appreciate that your book doesn’t paint too rosy a picture of college, right? You were having this freedom, and you were going to parties, and you had these friends, and you were pulling all-nighters, but you also dealt with some quite difficult stuff. Can you describe — you do this so vividly in the book. Can you describe the first time you had what you later found out was a panic attack? malala yousafzai Yes. This panic attack was a life-changing moment because I was attacked at age 15. I healed from a bullet, and I thought the recovery is done. But many years later, when I had the first panic attack or the trauma or the flashbacks of what had happened, it made me feel like everything was coming back, as if it had never gone. I felt like I was reliving those moments. So it happened this one night where, initially, it felt like a normal night because I was working on my essay, and I had an essay crisis. I was struggling. So — anna martin Classic. malala yousafzai — this friend called me to the college gardens, and she said, yeah, let’s hang out. Some friends are here. I was like, maybe she might just give me her notes. anna martin [LAUGHS]: malala yousafzai So let’s go and see her. I go there. We are chatting. And I see this thing for the first time, and it’s called bong. anna martin It’s a bong. Right. malala yousafzai It’s a bong. And it’s basically weed. And but it’s a different way of inhaling it. anna martin Totally. malala yousafzai So — anna martin It is tricky, I will also say. malala yousafzai It is tricky. And I had no idea how to take it and what it was and how quickly it affects you. But my friend seemed fine. And on the first attempt, I coughed. And then on the second attempt, I felt I inhaled it, and it went all in. And I don’t know where time went. But that was the turning point. It felt like a sharp turn where, immediately, my body froze. I could not understand time or the surrounding anymore. And I thought I was reliving the attack, that I could see the gunman, that I was experiencing that near-death experience where I felt like, maybe I am dead. Maybe this is afterlife. Am I alive or not? I just lost sense of reality. I had many panic attacks after that. My body would be sweating. I would be shaking. My heart would be throbbing. I could not sleep. As soon as I would try to close my eyes, I felt like it was a nightmare again, and I would die. It was so scary. I thought nobody would understand it. I could not even talk to anybody about this. Because how do you explain to somebody that I’m experiencing all of this? And yeah, an attack happened many years ago. And I was completely normal yesterday. Like, I never thought this would happen. It was so unexpected. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai I’m so glad my friends were there for me. They helped me in this time. They could not explain it to me. They were not like my therapists. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai But they did small things, like sharing meals with me or doing a sleepover. Like, their sleepover — anna martin I remember that. malala yousafzai — was everything. That was the first time I could actually fall asleep for the first time. They have no idea, but they — I’ll always remember that. And then, in the end, it was another friend of mine who told me that I should see a therapist. I was so skeptical. anna martin Had you seen a therapist up to that point? malala yousafzai No. The first time I had seen a therapist briefly was at the hospital in Birmingham — anna martin Wow. malala yousafzai — when I was recovering from the bullet injury. anna martin Immediately after. malala yousafzai Yes. At the time, I had to go through so many other surgeries for the physical body recovery that I thought, what is this person asking me? How do I feel? Like, come on. Like, look at me. I’m recovering. What has feelings got to do with any of that? I felt work kept me busy and distracted. And I just had no idea that something like this bong experience could trigger and bring back the trauma and PTSD, all of these things I had heard of, but I just never understood what that actually means when you experience it. When I had my first therapy session, it was a crazy experience because I was telling everything to the therapist. And I was hoping that she would give me the medication or whatever cure they have. anna martin Right. malala yousafzai And soon I realized that that’s not how it works. You have to accept and embrace it, that now this is a part of you. You cannot banish it magically. With time, it can get smaller and smaller, and it will affect you less and less. But you have to be willing to accept and live with it. I no longer see it as, yeah, four sessions or 10 sessions. I think I’m going to — anna martin Am I fixed yet? malala yousafzai — be fixed by then. anna martin Totally. malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin I mean, I really appreciate you sharing it, that it is so — it was terrifying even reading about it. I mean, it really was. And it strikes me, just as you’re talking, we spoke about this roof experience, experiences, as this moment of discovering that your past was still with you. malala yousafzai Yeah. anna martin And I’m realizing that this panic attack was also, like, the shadow side of that, right, with the past, with the more full embrace of the past. It’s not just the adventures and that spirit. It’s also the attack. malala yousafzai Yes, and I think that’s the part maybe that frustrated me the most. Because when you are labeled as a brave girl who has overcome an attack and is not afraid of the Taliban, and suddenly, this moment where you’re witnessing that moment of fear again, and you feel the gunmen are right in front of you again, or you feel you have lost your life again, it’s scary, but it’s also embarrassing. Like, I was feeling embarrassed a bit — anna martin Wow. malala yousafzai — that somehow I had failed in meeting that label of being brave and courageous. I was in South Africa for this campaign that we are doing for Afghan women. I was giving the Nelson Mandela lecture. And we were bringing attention to what’s happening in Afghanistan under the Taliban since they took power four years ago, is a gender apartheid. Like, it is systemic oppression. Anyway, that was a visit there. I gave a speech. And there, I also had a panic attack. anna martin Oh my gosh. Like, onstage or off — malala yousafzai No, it was, like, after I had done all the events, the press, the speeches. There was nothing triggering. And just all of a sudden, when I went to bed, in the middle of the night, I just felt like I was — I felt I could not breathe anymore. And my husband was with me. He helped me through the whole night. But I was shaking. I was shivering. anna martin Oh, this was more recently. malala yousafzai Yeah, just, like, a few years ago. anna martin Wow. malala yousafzai But just to say that even in moments when I go on the stage and give a speech to stand up for women, and I say that we are not afraid of the extremists, and then I go back to my room, and that night, I’m shaking, I’m shivering because I’m having a panic attack, and I don’t understand, because yet, inside me, I know I can continue this fight, and I will keep on doing it. But physically and mentally, my body is responding in a way that I have no control on. But that doesn’t stop me from doing what I want to do. I will advocate for the rights of Afghan women and girls. We will stand up to all extremists, including the Taliban. We will have a better future for women and girls when they can just choose their own future, whatever they want, just having more freedom and liberation. But it’s not an easy journey. And we have to be honest about it, how it can overwhelm us, how it can affect our own mental health. And so I’m sharing just a part of that in my book. anna martin It’s powerful. And I appreciate you sharing it with me here. And I think of this word you used, embarrassing. malala yousafzai Yeah. anna martin Can you tell me more about that word? Because I think I understand, but it’s a harsh word to turn on yourself, and I wonder about that. Why did it feel embarrassing to have a panic attack? malala yousafzai It felt embarrassing because I thought I had failed in meeting up the expectation of being brave and strong. When people tell you that you stood up to the Taliban, how did you do that? How could you be so brave? I did not even have an answer to that. I would just simply say, education is my right. Why should anyone take it away from me? And now, many years later, when I had these panic attacks, and I was just suddenly scared, it’s not that the Taliban were standing right in front of me, but I felt it. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai It’s something I wish I can just make disappear. But that is to say that it is still brave when you are embarrassed, when you are scared, when you are afraid, but you still get up and do what you believe in. I think that is true bravery. [MUSIC PLAYING] anna martin We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] I want to get us into this zone of talking about romance and dating and love because it’s a beautiful part of your book as well. You mentioned that you just weren’t around guys so much before you went to college, and then you were around them. But where was your confidence in terms of dating boys romance? malala yousafzai I was more of a coach at the beginning when it came to love life conversations. I was giving advice to my friends. Like, if a guy is not replying to your texts for three days, it means — anna martin Not that that’s happening to me, but what do you think it means? malala yousafzai He doesn’t want to talk, you know. And I don’t think he deserves you. It’s — anna martin Hear that. malala yousafzai Yeah, in all. Like, anyway. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai And my friends were just so shocked that I knew so much about guys and dating. And I told them I have never dated a guy. I don’t even know what that is, but I would sometimes just joke with them that I’m more of a coach than a player. And the coaches know more than the players. anna martin You’re observing. malala yousafzai Observing, yeah. anna martin You were taking yourself off the field, to continue that metaphor. And really, that actually is the language I would use. You’ve taken yourself out of the game. Can you describe why? Why was dating not so much on your radar? malala yousafzai There were two reasons for that. One was more my personal decision, and the second one was cultural. When I was attacked by the Taliban, the bullet caused injuries, including my hearing loss and also my facial symmetry. So I had become very insecure. I thought my smile was never the same. And the facial symmetry wasn’t there anymore. I received so many surgeries to work on repairing the facial nerve. Even my last surgery was to do that. And I thought like, oh, to grapple with it the best way is to just say, never date a guy or — and if I’m honest, I just thought nobody would like me and all of that. But that was just a whole different thinking. And then on the other hand, it was also the cultural pressure. Because in our culture in Pakistan, girls are not allowed to date. anna martin Sure. malala yousafzai It’s different in the cities, but in a lot of the villages, in most of Pakistan, girls are even punished for it if they’re found dating or texting a guy. And there’s crazy things, like honor killings. And so I thought, OK, that’s supposed to be a bad thing. And why put my family in trouble? Why make my mom and dad angry? Even though I knew we were now in a different country and slightly different culture. But that is still there in the back of your mind. So in college, I thought, yeah, these two things, I should just stay away from boys. anna martin I mean, you’re mentioning the insecurity, and you share a bit about that in the book. And there is one quote that really struck me. You were talking about grappling with self-image. And you said, “My face and body were now meant for service, not romance. You don’t need to be attractive to be an activist, I told myself.” I was struck by that. I mean, unpack that quote for me. What did that mean? You didn’t have to be attractive to be an activist. So it wasn’t on your mind? malala yousafzai I thought that activism was now the mission of my life. And I did not have to think about looking pretty for that. On the other hand, I thought that to have love in your life, you needed to be looking all perfect and needed the facial symmetry. And so, yeah, I thought, OK, I can’t have all of that, but at least I can do my activism. anna martin Did you think you’d ever be in a relationship? Like, was that something that — malala yousafzai No. [LAUGHS] anna martin No. Really? malala yousafzai I never thought that. No. anna martin And how did that make you feel when you were, to play to life, and truly, I say, without any kind of valence, positive or negative? How did that make you feel to contemplate a life without a romantic relationship? malala yousafzai My life changed completely when I was in love with a person. I could not fix my thinking. Before that, I was the strong advocate against marriages. I had told all of my college friends that do not get married, or at least, I’m not getting married. These boys are just a waste of time. I was so against the institution of marriage in itself. I was questioning it because growing up, I had seen how girls were forced into marriage, or they were married off when they were still children, and that is still a reality for many girls. So I thought, why would even I consider it? I’m an advocate for girls’ rights. This is the last thing I’ll think about. And here I was, in love with a guy. And I knew that culturally for me, to be with this guy, I need to be married to him because in our culture, I cannot just live with a guy. And my parents would never allow that. It’s hard to explain the cultural part because it becomes a controversy, and there’s a lot of backlash if you do not follow the traditions. And the tradition is that you have to marry. And it’s usually your parents agreeing and all of that. You cannot technically be dating or be in love. I was happy that my parents were OK with me seeing the guy. But my mom put so many restrictions. She told me — and this was before COVID — that you have to be 6 feet apart. anna martin So she kind of started that trend, it sounds like. malala yousafzai She started that, before we had those germs. anna martin [LAUGHS]: Looking at a future without a romantic relationship, did it make you feel — I don’t know — malala yousafzai It made life easier for me. anna martin Huh. That’s — OK. malala yousafzai I thought life would be so easy if there were no relationships, no love life to think about, and no marriage and all of that and kids and family stuff. I was like, ew, stay away from all of that. Work, work, and work. And I will be honest that becoming an activist at a young age and not knowing so much about what the lives of activists from history have been really like — so in my head, I thought Martin Luther King, Jr. or Mother Teresa or Dalai Lama and Nelson Mandela all had these lives which were all about work, even though they had wives and kids and all of that. There’s this perception that you have that life all has to be about work. It can never be about you, about your love. And these are all sacrifices and compromises you have to make. But when I fell in love — [LAUGHS] anna martin Now let’s bring this man on stage. Tell me about the guy you fell in love with. malala yousafzai So I met Asser at university. He was visiting a friend who was studying there. And the moment I saw him, I knew that he was my type. He was tall, handsome with trimmed beard and just wide shoulders. And I thought, oh my God, I had pictured this guy in my imagination, and somehow, I see him in reality. anna martin Ugh. malala yousafzai There is this 3D print of him. anna martin Ugh! You are making me jealous, girl. malala yousafzai Yeah, with a cute smile. And he was just laughing the whole time. And he was funny. And he was cracking jokes and laughing at my jokes. And I was like, wow, he is the one. anna martin Well, that’s the dream, isn’t it? malala yousafzai Yeah. Bur if you ask him, the story that he has starts at a different point. And I’m like, ugh, let’s not even talk about it. anna martin Let’s not think about it. Let’s just say you had wide shoulders, and you were tall. malala yousafzai Yeah. I was like, can you just simply say, yeah, I fell in love with you the moment I saw you? He’s like, no, I have to be truthful. I was like — anna martin No, not all the time. malala yousafzai But then he reminds me. He says, you have to remember that you were Malala to me. And sometimes he says this joke that my right shoulder was telling me that there’s one person in the world that you don’t want to offend or break the heart of. It’s Malala. And then my left shoulder was telling me that if you break Malala’s heart, you are going to be her enemy number one. And you do not want that life. So — [LAUGHS]: anna martin So basically, both angels and devils were telling him like, do not F this up, basically. malala yousafzai He was like, I was just so scared. He said, do you think somebody meets Malala and immediately would say, yeah, I want her to be my girlfriend, or I want to marry her? He said, like, no. He’s like, of course, you are so fun. And I was so happy that we were becoming friends. But I could not imagine it. And I was like, OK, fine, fine, you can get away with it. One story I remember, which is really funny, when we were still getting to know each other, I took him to see this movie, which was “Toy Story 4.” anna martin OK, yeah. malala yousafzai And I was like, flirty and all of that. And I was like, why is this guy so nervous and sort of tight and just like — anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai Why can’t he just — why can’t he just relax? And I asked him. And he’s like, you know you have security? anna martin [LAUGHS]: malala yousafzai And they’re standing right behind me. anna martin He’s like, uh, maybe those two massive guys? malala yousafzai Yeah, and he wanted to be relaxed and all of that. So — anna martin [LAUGHS]: malala yousafzai Later on, I understood. I was like, oh, yeah, poor thing. I never thought about it from his perspective. anna martin That’s so — you’re like, loosen up. He’s like, um — malala yousafzai Exactly. anna martin [LAUGHS]: malala yousafzai We’re just watching a movie. Enjoy. Have fun. Be yourself. anna martin “Toy Story 4.” I didn’t even know they had “Toy Story 4.” malala yousafzai Yeah. anna martin How did he make you feel? As you hung out with him more and more, as you talked, as you got to know him as a person, not just a hottie, yeah, how did he make you feel? malala yousafzai Whenever I was with him, I felt that I was loved. And he made me feel like the present me is — you know, like, when you meet people, they have this fixed image of you? And they feel like they know who you are? anna martin Well, I will say you more so than someone else. Of course. Absolutely. malala yousafzai But with him, I felt like I could grow as a person. anna martin I like what you’re saying. As opposed to a fixed idea of who you were, this vaunted, brave activist, it was like, things felt like they could change, like they could mold, like they could grow, like they were flexible, almost. malala yousafzai Yes. And when I think about a life partner, this is the person you want with whom you can grow. anna martin Right. malala yousafzai You will never be the same person as you are in this moment. He will also not be the same person as he is in that moment. And when you start your life together, you can grow together. I immediately felt that with Asser, that he is so adventurous. He likes trying new things. He’s funny. Life just looks more fun with him. And I was imagining a life with him, and I thought, wow, it just looks so good. So I was very happy that I was technically dating him and that I was seeing him. But at the same time, I was reminding myself that no, I’m supposed to be an activist, and I can’t get married. And this is all a distraction. And — anna martin Right. malala yousafzai — then — anna martin And you were so staunchly opposed. You write, you were so opposed to marriage as an institution. malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin Because of what it represented, the patriarchy. You didn’t want to be controlled. Yeah, how did you reckon with those things? What a bummer to really like this guy and be like, this could be — malala yousafzai I know. anna martin — serious, but also, I’m staunchly opposed to marriage. malala yousafzai I will be honest that I liked Asser, and everything was going well. I was also scared if Asser would be the same person as he is now. And I had heard so many stories of girls who find out that the husband is not the guy who they thought would be — anna martin You mean after they get married, yeah. malala yousafzai After they get married, and things change. Or then they have these expectations from each other. Like, the husband is expecting the wife to do certain things or do chores or change her career path and all of that. And I knew that this was never going to happen. I knew that I knew about my rights. And I am an activist for girls everywhere. I can fight for myself. But it just felt like I just did not want it to be a situation where, now, suddenly, I was getting married. And this guy was like — I was like, I have to fix another guy, and I have to fix another problem while I’m advocating for so many other things, I do not want it to be like another journey of activism for me. I was like, if marriage makes life easier and happier, then I should consider it. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai In the end, we spent some time together in Lake Placid in the US. And this was the first time when it was just the two of us. And we had the best time together. And I had prepared a whole list of questions because I thought, I’ll ask him everything and figure out who he truly is. And I was like, I just want to know everything about this guy. What is inside his mind? What he’s showing, what I see right now is all good. It’s like 10 out of 10. But is there something mysterious in his mind that I need to know? It’s like, a flaw! anna martin You’re an investigative journalist. malala yousafzai I know. Seriously, yeah. I should change my job. anna martin Come work for — malala yousafzai And I realized that he was this person the whole time that I saw him. It’s like, you keep looking. You keep peeling it off. And it’s like a layer after a layer, but it’s still the same thing. anna martin Yeah. Was there a moment where you realized that, yeah, that he was who he said he was? Was there — I don’t know — you look at him at breakfast, and the light’s hitting him. And you’re like, that’s it. That’s him. Was there a moment — malala yousafzai I still feel that. [laughs] When he is kind to somebody, when he cares about his family members and friends. He shows up. He checks on people. He looks after me. He’s just so nice to me. I can’t tell you. He can listen to me rambling at midnight when he’s so tired and exhausted. anna martin The yap does turn on at midnight, huh? malala yousafzai Yeah. And yeah, that’s the thing. And he cares about what I eat. And if I’m busy with my work, he makes sure that I have some fun time. So he would arrange sports in the middle of it to say you need to relax. You need to take some time off. So my life is sort of still the same, but I feel happier that he’s with me now. anna martin In this moment, in Lake Placid, which is fun that it was there — it’s such a — it’s cool, but yeah. You realize that you’re ready to marry. In fact, the chapter ends with you saying, I’m ready to do this. What was it about that trip that changed your mind? Was it your mind changed about him, or your mind changed about the institution of marriage, or both, or neither? Like, what shifted? malala yousafzai Oh, definitely not about the institution of marriage at all. That is easy to answer. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai We have to question marriage. We have to make this an open conversation because it is still affecting the lives of tens of millions of girls every year. And even in places where women have more equal rights and even in developed countries, marriage still means more compromises for women. So I think that’s a whole separate conversation. And I don’t have all the answers. But I think it’s important for us to doubt it, to question it. In Lake Placid, I was sure about getting married to Asser was because I knew he was the right guy. He seemed to be this kind, sweet, and the best guy I’d ever seen. I had the best time with him. And I love him for sure. But I started loving myself as well. And that’s the difference he made in my life, that I felt that I should love myself, and I should be OK accepting that he loves me, too. And I realized I don’t have to ask him every question about, so what do you think about four marriages in Islam? Or what do you think about a woman earning more than the man? And he was like, yeah, if she earns more, that’s fine. He’s like, I’ll be a happier man. anna martin He was like — malala yousafzai I was like, ugh, you just get it right every time. anna martin But it is so interesting. It’s, like, this list of you tried to itemize all of the things that could go wrong, right? And it’s very beautiful to me that at the end of this trip, you realized you didn’t have to do that. malala yousafzai Yes. He was quite surprised. He was like, so where are the questions? Like, when are you going to ask me? anna martin Ripped up the paper. Yeah. malala yousafzai I was like, I know. anna martin Because you knew the answer was — was what? It’s not even about the answers to those questions. The answer is, he loves you, right? malala yousafzai Yeah. anna martin And I love myself. malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin We talked about how your feelings about marriage as an institution haven’t changed. You’re still committed to doing — to advocating for women’s independence and right to choose decide whether they want to get married. And I guess I wonder, now, you are a wife, right? Has that changed — what does that mean to you? How were you able to — yeah, what does that mean to you? malala yousafzai Those words still sound quite heavy, wife and husband. anna martin Do you use different words? malala yousafzai Yeah, bestie. anna martin You use bestie? Oh, I love that. Yeah. malala yousafzai We don’t call each other husband and wife. It’s when people ask us or when people bring it up, that’s when we’re like, oh, so we are husband and wife. OK. anna martin Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Does it feel — so that word doesn’t feel like it fits so much? malala yousafzai I have a very stereotypical idea of what a wife means. And I hated the word, genuinely hated the word. Growing up, I thought, ugh, you want to be a wife? Come on. And a husband, I was like, just — because you grew up with it, you cannot suddenly take it away from yourself. And I just thought that was not a cool thing, to be a wife. anna martin Do you feel married? I guess, that’s really the question I want to ask. Like, do you feel married? malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin Yeah. malala yousafzai It’s about redefining what marriage is. I know that a lot of people will be already embracing it in this new way, where it means equal partnership between two people, where they respect each other, and they love each other. And they make lives easier for each other. They make lives more fun for each other. But where I come from and what I have experienced, seeing things like child marriages and just how women’s futures change completely with marriage, I cannot fully take it away from me that I still have that traditional idea of it. And that just causes that trigger for me. And I sometimes think that am I giving up to the old systems? But I know it is different. It is different when you are in a new country. It’s different when you are redefining it. It’s different when the partner actually has good values and has a common understanding of — anna martin Respects you. malala yousafzai And respects you. And he’s like, yeah, marriage, whatever. I just want to be with you. Like, that’s the most important thing for him. [laughs] So that changes everything. I’m like, yeah, sure, let’s call it marriage. Let’s call it whatever we want to call it. It’s about us sharing this journey of life ahead together. anna martin I want to turn back to your book. I’m struck that the title, “Finding My Way,” is — it’s an active title. It’s not — malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin —“I Found My Way.” malala yousafzai No. anna martin It’s “Finding,” right? You’re in the process of. I wonder, what do you feel like you’re still figuring out about yourself? malala yousafzai I actually wanted a title like “Finding My Way” because I do not feel comfortable with books that feel like they have cracked the code and figured it all out, that if you read this book, you have no worries in life anymore. That’s just not the reality. “Finding My Way” is a true reflection of what the journey is actually like, where things are happening for the first time. You may not have even planned them to be a part of your life. You are having these experiences in college, like bong. anna martin Like bong. [LAUGHS] malala yousafzai Or you are climbing rooftops. That was never part of my plan. Getting ghosted by my crush, that was never part of my plan. Nearly failing my exams? That wasn’t part of my plan. These things happen. You meet the love of your life at a time when you are like, wait a second. I’m sort of still in university. I wish this — I wish I was not thinking about marriage and all of these things right now. Or like, you’re recovering from the bullet of the Taliban and having your last surgery, and the Taliban take control of Afghanistan. And you have to think about evacuating the people who you were supporting and at the same time, thinking about the future of women and girls and what does that mean for you. All of these things is about finding your way. You do not have the answer immediately, but it is embracing those moments and accepting the emotions and the feelings you’re going through. You cannot make them disappear. Asking for help when you need to, talking to your friends and family, your colleagues, and knowing that together, you will be able to make a way through it. You will find your way through it. anna martin You’re 28 right now? malala yousafzai Yes. anna martin What would you say to 15-year-old Malala? malala yousafzai Oh. [laughs] I might give her my book. Girl, read this book. There is so much ahead of you. anna martin Oof. malala yousafzai There’s so much ahead of you. Do not get distracted by what people around you are telling you, who you are supposed to be, what media outlet wants to speak to you, and how you need to go and give a speech at this conference and that event. Follow your heart. Make friends. Be cheeky sometimes. It’s OK if you don’t know all the answers. It’s OK if you get scared. That’s all fine. You will find your way through it. anna martin Malala, thank you so much. What a pleasure to have this conversation. malala yousafzai Thank you. So nice speaking to you as well.

8ced085035a2,One Way to Shake Up Museum Curation? Hand the Keys to the Kids.,"museum, youth, college, art, social media, museum of fine arts boston, orange county museum of art, clyfford still museum, university of california, irvine, chris atkins, orange county ca, colorado","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. Ask Helen Han why museum visitors should take seriously an exhibition curated by teenagers rather than by experienced museum professionals, and she sums it up this way: a show like the one she helped curate at the UC Irvine Langson Orange County Museum of Art offers more, not less. The 17-year-old senior at University High School in Irvine, Calif., talks about the diligent work that went into “Piece of Me,” an exhibit within the museum’s larger biennial (through Jan. 4). Organized by 15 members of the Orange County Young Curators program, it started with surveying the museum’s collection, choosing a theme and selecting work, then collaborating with in-house conservators, designers and installers, and finally composing the wall text. But more important, she said, the group created something the staff could not: an authentic, teen eye on art. “I feel like this is bringing an insight into the teenager’s mind, something you might not have necessarily seen before,” Han said in a phone interview, explaining the exhibit creation process. “ So, that’s something audiences should definitely consider.” That combination of authenticity and rigor is driving several museum shows this fall — including at the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston — each curated by young people with guidance from the museum staff. All three aim to be equal to any other exhibition at their institution. These shows fit within a broader cultural trend, in which institutions invite outside, nonprofessional curators to help organize exhibitions as a way to democratize their storytelling. This practice has been gaining steam, with the Tucson Museum of Art last year publishing a tool kit for peer institutions interested in what they call community-based curation. “It’s a real show and we ran it through our full museum process,” said Chris Atkins, the director of the Center for Netherlandish Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, who coached five high school students from the museum’s Curatorial Study Hall through the creation of “Curated by Teens: Death as a Constant Companion,” which runs through Nov. 30. “Death” is installed in the center’s Gallery for Innovative Scholarship, a space for changing exhibitions usually programmed by guest curators from a regional university, like Yale or Brown. “But this time we skipped a level and went from graduate students to public high school teenagers,” Atkins said. The Curatorial Study Hall, which started in 2019, is an internship for five juniors and seniors who meet Wednesdays during the school year, culminating in an exhibition. Previous experience in the museum world is not a requirement, and “their level of art history is not high,” as Atkins described it. But the students are put through the paces. In this case, they started with a deep dive into the museum’s vast holdings of Dutch and Flemish art and conversations with Atkins and other staff members about how a show might come together. After culling through numerous images of hunted animals, butcher shops and skulls — all frequent still-life subjects in Dutch and Flemish art — the students chose death as their theme. Then they did what curators do: they developed a checklist, arranged the order, oversaw installation and wrote wall text. Atkins said the curators’ confidence grew throughout the school year, as hours of mentoring instilled such confidence in them that they pushed the museum’s usual boundaries. For example, they insisted on including one work with deteriorating paint, badly in need of restoration. “Like most museums, that’s not the type of picture we would normally put on the walls,” Atkins said. The teens argued that there was precedent in the museum’s galleries showing the art of ancient Greece and Rome, where fragments of statues were on display routinely. So why not put a damaged object into their show? That was a “completely logical question,” Atkins said. The curators got their way. A similar curatorial autonomy animates the Clyfford Still Museum’s “Tell Clyfford I Said ‘Hi,’” a show organized by children of the Colville Confederated Tribes in Washington state, which runs through May 10. The original plan, according to Bailey Placzek, the museum’s curator of collections, and Nicole Cromartie, the director of education and programs, who organized the project and worked with the students on the curation, was to have each of the 100 student co-curators select a single piece of art. Some kids decided not to choose any, and some chose two or three. One 7-year-old insisted that nine of her choices, which she grouped together on a wall during a mock setup of the show, get into the final event. “Her name is Vivian, and she was very upset that she could only choose one,” said Placzek, who let Vivian have her way. “We documented that wall, and we have completely replicated it in the exhibit.” The exhibition was, they said, nearly 10 years in the making, including time spent by the museum introducing itself to the tribes, getting to know families and community leaders and eventually figuring out how to create an exhibit in Denver. The museum was driven by Still’s own history. Years before he became a well-known Abstract Expressionist, he was a student at Washington State College (now Washington State University), not far from the land where the confederated tribes live. He spent time on their reservation, eventually working with Worth Griffin to found a summer art camp there in the late 1930s, the Nespelem Art Colony. Still made many sketches of the landscape and people that are now in the collection of the museum, which has long had a goal of connecting the work to the present-day tribes. Part of that process involved showing replicas of the work at tribal gatherings as a way of introducing the museum. “And they started to see all of these images of their grandparents and great-grandparents,” Placzek said. “It was this moving moment where they were like, ‘I don’t know who you are, but I know who this is.’” For the current show, Placzek and Cromartie collaborated with children, ages 3 to 14, from three schools and their teachers. They showed them copies of both the sketches and Still’s later abstract paintings and encouraged the children to choose works they connected with — no matter the bond. Nikolai Kolb, 11, chose a 1936 village streetscape, dominated by a large, white building in the center. “I picked it because it reminds me of a Chinese restaurant that I always used to go to when I was a kid,” he said during a video interview the day of the show’s opening, which many of the curators and their families attended as the museum’s guests. (The trip included a Colorado Rockies baseball game). That might not be the usual curator way of speaking, but that is the point. The Still has worked hard to widen the concept of expertise over the painter’s work and it has, in recent years, relinquished curatorial control for individual shows organized by other artists, Still’s daughter and even Denver-area residents under the age of 8. Letting children of the Colville Confederated Tribes pick the works, then decide how to arrange the exhibit, choose wall colors and contribute to the audio guide is way of expanding that mission — and of giving museum visitors an alternative way of seeing Still’s abstract art. “They don’t have all these ideas that you need to have expertise, like so many adults do,” Placzek said of the students. “So it’s really an exciting and joyful process to see young children experience this work, which intimidates so many people.” For the Orange County Museum of Art, getting a youth perspective on things meant starting an entire new program with its Young Curators group, said Courtenay Finn, the chief curator. Last year, the museum was preparing for this year’s California Biennial and wanted to include a section that captured the experiences of young people at the current moment. “But we realized we couldn’t make a show about what it means to be a teenager without inviting teenagers to speak for themselves,” said Finn. “We actually delayed the opening of the Biennial so that we could launch the program.” The museum’s curatorial and education staff put together a framework and spread the word among local schools. They asked applicants to prepare essays reflecting on their own lives and responding to a work in the collection. More than 140 applications arrived, and 15 juniors and seniors from 12 Orange County municipalities were selected, Finn said. The students met weekly for two semesters. “We told them do whatever you want to do. If you want to make a show about climate change or gardens or portraits, the collection is there for you,” Finn said. Ultimately, they chose to do a show about the pressure of growing up in a social media world where everything is posed, public — and scrutinized. They built their checklist around Alison Van Pelt’s 2004 “Britney,” an oil and graphite portrait of Britney Spears, whose life under the microscope mirrored their own experiences, Finn explained. Interestingly, all of the objects in “Piece of Me” were created before the curators were born, though they all stay on theme. One example is Ed Templeton’s 1999 “Teenage Smokers, ” a grid of 24 small photo portraits of young people with their cigarettes. It has an Instagram feel. And there is that little bit extra for visitors, a sincerity that only comes from giving up authority — as the museums in Denver and Boston did — and trusting outsiders. “I think the fact that we were given the platform to communicate our voices in this day and age was really important,” the curator Han said. “I’m a firm believer that everyone should be heard, no matter what.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/arts/design/museum-curation-children-teenagers.html,Culture,BBC,By Ray Mark Rinaldi,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-kidcurators-01-hkmb/19sp-finearts-kidcurators-01-hkmb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:01:28.152000+00:00,7e710a9defe34f6892b48d78838e1ead86dd45d1
16b95afce457,Looking at Sexuality With a Medieval Sensibility,"art, museum, middle ages, gender, sex, the cloisters, metropolitan museum of art, western europe","“I think if people enter the show with an open mind, they’ll see that we’re not overreading here,” said Thebaut, who, with Holcomb, sought feedback on the exhibition from an advisory committee of community leaders, scholars and members of the clergy, including a Roman Catholic priest. Roland Betancourt, a professor of art history at the University of California, Irvine, who was consulted in the show’s early planning stages, said written historical evidence that medieval conceptions of gender were fluid was “often pretty spectacular.” Contemplations of this subject appear “in literary texts,” he added. “We have them in medical manuals. We have these in theological works as well.” But museum shows, he said, rarely reveal them to the public. “Spectrum of Desire,” which focuses largely on the Met’s collection but also incorporates loans from other institutions, “represents not only years of scholarship, but really allows new perspectives to come to the fore,” said Max Hollein, the Met’s director and chief executive, during a video call. It’s possible to see that gender binaries, for instance, were often “thrown out the window,” Thebaut observed, in the show’s delicately carved ivory pieces, where it is difficult to tell who’s male and who’s female. In the section “Marriage, Sex and Chastity,” a richly decorated 15th-century saddle includes both courtly and bawdy images, including one in which a woman clutches a man’s chest from behind.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/arts/design/cloisters-sexuality-middle-ages.html,Culture,BBC,By Laurel Graeber,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-cloisters-02-ptzj/19sp-finearts-cloisters-02-ptzj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:00:50+00:00,1bb835a45555caa457367e567750d72e05b8e809

A life-size cow made out of butter. Quilts created by incarcerated men. Many, many versions of the Declaration of Independence. With the nation’s 250th birthday upcoming in July, museums and historical societies are opening exhibitions this fall commemorating the event with shows as diverse as the country itself. Viewers will have their choice of exhibitions highlighting state fairs, prison art projects and the international impact of the country’s founding documents — just a few of the many events, some of which have started rolling out. The anniversary comes at a time when the Trump administration is mandating that cultural institutions and educational organizations re-examine how they view, present and teach topics like citizenship, free speech and even slavery. In August, the Trump administration published a list of Smithsonian exhibits and programming it objected to, including those it said promoted homosexuality and “woke” activism. The administration and Smithsonian executives are still in talks about how to handle some of these issues, but most museums, which are private, are unaffected by the White House demands. “We are the guardians of authentic materials, documents, objects and art, and it’s really our job to tell these stories,” said Louise Mirrer, president and chief executive of the New York Historical, which is offering two commemorative exhibitions and an online project this fall. “I am hoping that people will take away from the whole range of exhibitions that we’re doing that democracy was achieved as a result of a struggle and that it was hard fought and hard won.” And she added, “that it is something that needs to be safeguarded.” “ On Our 250th ,” created by the New York Historical in collaboration with 26 other historical societies and museums nationwide, allows people to post on a website their birthday wishes for America and hopes for the future of its democracy. Scattered like Post-it notes across the web page and signed only with first names and states, the wishes tend to focus on living together more harmoniously; for example, Myair of Michigan writes succinctly, “No racism.” About 10,000 notes have been posted so far, both online and on physical walls set up in participating museums, said Ken Weine, senior vice president and chief content officer for the museum. The notes are monitored for hate speech and highly partisan content before they are posted, he said. An exhibition, “ Stirring the Melting Pot: Photographs from The New York Historical Collection ,” running from Nov. 28 to March 29, highlights a fundamental part of the nation’s history and the so-called American experience. It includes about 100 photos of immigrants throughout the last century, from well-known images of tenement life in the early 20th century to less-familiar scenes surrounding the General Slocum disaster of 1904, when a ship carrying more than 1,300 passengers for a day trip up the East River in New York caught fire. The final death toll was 1,021, the largest in the United States until it was surpassed on 9/11. The photos show how the countries from which immigrants hailed shifted over the decades — as did the landscape of New York City itself — as new arrivals’ places of worship, schools and restaurants replaced those of the previous influx. “The style and variety has changed,” said Valerie Paley, director of the museum’s library. “The built environment has changed. But the vitality hasn’t changed.” A second exhibition at the New York Historical, “ Declaring the Revolution: America’s Printed Path to Independence ,” focuses on 67 pieces of printed material on loan from the David M. Rubenstein Americana Collection, such as official documents, as well as pamphlets, broadsides and journals. It runs from Nov. 14 to April 12. The Declaration of Independence makes two appearances in the exhibition: its first newspaper printing, in the Pennsylvania Evening Post in July 1776, and a rare copy from 1823. The original is in the National Archives. One of the more unusual items is a 1773 slave petition for freedom written by literate enslaved men from Boston and addressed to Massachusetts elected officials. “Increasingly, Americans were using the metaphor and symbolism of slavery to describe their relationship with the British crown,” said Mazy Boroujerdi, the exhibition’s curator. That didn’t go unnoticed by actual enslaved people; the petition noted that “we expect great things from men who have made such a noble stand against the designs of their fellow-men to enslave them.” The four men were petitioning to be allowed a day a week to earn their own wages to buy their freedom. The petition was met, Boroujerdi said, “with something close to silence.” The ongoing impact of the Declaration of Independence — nationally and internationally — is the subject of “ The Declaration’s Journey ,” running through Jan. 3, 2027, at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. Demonstrating the complicated history of the Declaration’s meaning, the exhibition opens with a juxtaposition of the Windsor chair that Thomas Jefferson is believed to have used when drafting the Declaration of Independence in the summer of 1776 and the prison bench from Martin Luther King Jr.’s cell in Birmingham, Ala. While in jail, King wrote his famous 1963 “ Letter from Birmingham Jail ,” in which he quotes the Declaration. The exhibition showcases about 120 documents and artifacts connected to different independence movements and representing around 20 nations. It includes one of the first original printings — a broadside — of the Declaration of Independence, once owned by a Philadelphia merchant, Jonas Phillips, who tried to send it in late July 1776 across the Atlantic to one of his contacts in Amsterdam. It was intercepted at sea by the British, said Matthew Skic, the museum’s director of collections and exhibitions, and ended up in the British national archives. It will arrive shortly after the exhibition opens, Skic said, returning to Philadelphia for the first time in two and half centuries. An exhibition at the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., looks at the country’s history through a completely different lens: state fairs. The Renwick is part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The Smithsonian is offering a variety of programing leading up to the birthday, including the reopening of a historic carousel on the National Mall and a sweeping exhibition about the nation’s founding at the National Museum of American History. Both are scheduled to open in March. “ State Fairs: Growing American Craft ,” which will run until Sept. 7, brings together two floors of more than 240 artworks from state fairs in 40 different states and four tribal nations. Mary Savig, curator in charge at the Renwick, said when she started thinking about creating the show five years ago, “we thought it would really align well with the 250th.” The first state fair took place in Syracuse, N.Y., in 1841 and many others “started when migration was happening from the east to the west. It was a way of establishing the culture of the state through these craft competitions.” Which brings up the butter cow. Competitive butter sculpting is a staple of some fairs (see “ Butter ,” a 2011 movie about such a competition at the Iowa State Fair). The full-sized Jersey cow was carved by Iowa State Fair’s official butter sculptor Sarah Pratt over one week in July and is exhibited in a custom-built, life-size refrigerated case, Savig said. Some 800 pounds of butter were brought in from Minnesota; the artist processed the butter in one room and then, bucket by bucket, moved it into the refrigerator to carve it. “That was a challenging logistic,” Savig said. She added that the exhibition had not been reviewed by the Trump administration. Other items include quilts, painted porcelain and crop art, which is a popular competition at the Minnesota State Fair; it’s art made from seeds native to the state. On view is a replica of Dolly Parton, with straw as her hair. The exhibition is a way to portray the country’s history through fair craft, but it’s not simply looking backward. Savig said many state fairs have seen an increase in the number of visitors every year. “I think there might be a predisposition to think that the work is going to feel nostalgic or nationalistic, but I think the works feel very much reflective of the current moment,” she said. Perhaps not surprisingly, quilts, which have a long and significant history in the United States from antebellum times, appear in a few of the exhibitions commemorating the country’s 250th. Besides the Renwick show, the Fairfield University Art Museum in Connecticut exhibition “Stitching Time ,” which runs until Dec. 13, highlights 12 quilts created by men incarcerated in Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola prison. It is one of three exhibitions tied to the 250th anniversary offered by the museum. The quilts are part of the Social Justice Collaboration Quilts Project, which coordinates the quilting initiative within and outside the prison. One quilt in the exhibition, “Red, White and Baldwin,” appears at first glance like a traditional quilt with multicolored squares; a closer look shows some of those squares are portraits of James Baldwin, the writer and Civil Rights activist. Another is covered with the name of Eric Garner, who was killed by New York police in 2014, and his last words, “I can’t breathe.” “These are artworks,” said Carey Mack Weber, the museum’s executive director. “They are truly pouring their souls into these and expressing their feelings on their political views, on their collective history.” As to how these connect to the 250th anniversary, she said, “When you look at the beautiful artwork, you’re also forced to grapple with the realities of incarceration,” she said, adding, “this is an area where we can think about trying to create a better future.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/arts/design/museums-us-250th-anniversary-exhibitions.html,Culture,BBC,By Alina Tugend,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-birthday-02-hmgw/19sp-finearts-birthday-02-hmgw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:00:36.177000+00:00,3d1313443c1f95ff1cbb99201d1d46c61e07633b
23337e2ffa51,Great Historical Horror Novels,"books, genre-books-historical-fiction, victor d lavalle, lone women, stephen graham jones, the buffalo hunter hunter, toni morrison, beloved, tananarive due, the reformatory","There’s something about a contemporary setting that interrupts my enjoyment of a horror novel. We simply have too many tools for avoiding danger at our disposal. Couldn’t a phone flashlight illuminate the danger ahead in that damp basement? Wouldn’t a quick reverse image search reveal that, actually, that grimoire seems to be authentic, so it’s probably not a great idea to recite its demon-summoning incantation? (Although, let’s be real, A.I. might get it wrong and lead the character astray anyway.) But stick your horrors in a bygone era and you’ve got a perfect pairing. While I adore reading (and writing) a genre-bending novel, wedding historical fiction and horror doesn’t require much bending at all. Turning back the clock strips the characters of modern tools and makes the physical realities of the setting much crueler. There are no cars to whisk you away from danger, no GPS to guide you home, no hydrogen peroxide to disinfect that bite. Your weapons are crude; your ability to wield them against whatever demons come your way is probably even cruder. And when the sun sets, the darkness is that much darker. For the characters of my favorite historical horror novels, something even more sinister often prowls the horizon. Colonialism, with its oppressive racist structures, diseases and massacres, can be crueler than any serial killer or Slender Man that stalks contemporary horror. Many of these books wield the themes and motifs of the subversive Gothic tradition to challenge traditional power structures. Their plots excavate histories long suppressed by dominant narratives — both official and fictional — and give voice to characters whose tragedies and triumphs traditionally have not taken center stage in mainstream horror. Here, they step into the light. by Victor LaValle Montana in the early 20th century was a brutal place — and it is especially brutal for Adelaide Henry, a young Black woman who fled California with a steamer trunk full of horrific secrets. While there are human and supernatural antagonists aplenty in “Lone Women,” the most terrifying element may be the stark natural setting. The isolation of homesteading and the frigid clutches of the Montana winter could prove just as deadly as the darkness within Adelaide’s trunk. Read our review . by Stephen Graham Jones If you doubt that yet another “new take on vampires” could provide anything truly novel, allow Jones to prove you wrong. This deliciously nested tale weaves together layers of unreliable narration, historical records and oral history to craft the legend of Good Stab, a Blackfeet man turned otherworldly creature who, in the face of massacres both human and animal, unleashes some monstrous violence of his own. Jones is widely considered a reigning master of the horror genre, and with good reason: I ripped through this novel at such a feverish pace, my smart watch started chirped nervously over my spiking heart rate. This is our October Book Club pick. Read our review , and join the conversation . by Amanda Jayatissa In 19th-century Sri Lanka, the daughter of a demon-priest investigates a series of violent attacks occurring in her village. Her aim is to clear her father’s name, but she soon discovers that something sinister, and perhaps supernatural, is afoot. Jayatissa’s chops as an award-winning thriller writer shine in this bloody, folklore-steeped and deeply atmospheric post-colonial Gothic. It had my heart pounding until the final, gut-wrenching twist; I simply had to blurb it. Read our review . by Carolina Flórez-Cerchiaro A real-life mansion in Colombia, located next to a pounding waterfall, served as the inspiration for Flórez-Cerchiaro’s debut horror. Is the house haunted in real life? Perhaps. In the novel? Definitely. If the setting of “Bochica” doesn’t have you hooked, the book’s emotional core might: Years after her mother’s tragic death, Antonia returns to La Casona, the luxurious hotel that was once her childhood home, to unspool dark family secrets and uncover the truth of what really happened to her mom. by S.T. Gibson The immortal vampire is the perfect vehicle for exploring different eras of history in fiction, and Gibson wields this trope with deliciously Gothic panache in her queer reimagining of one of the original Big Bads. “A Dowry of Blood” tells the story of Constanta, Dracula’s first bride, as she and her fellow consorts try to break free of their beloved — and profoundly toxic — husband. Come for the classic tale retold; stay for Gibson’s lush, hypnotic storytelling. by Toni Morrison The brutal horror of this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel lies in a simple question: What would you do to keep your children safe? For Sethe, the novel’s formerly enslaved protagonist, her heart-rending answer to that question has led her home in 1873 Cincinnati to be haunted, and spitefully so. I am not a scholar of the Gothic, merely a humble practitioner, but I would argue that “Beloved” is the foremost example of the haunted house novel in American literature. I have never wept harder while reading than when I returned to this book as a new mother.

The protests, known collectively as Fall of Freedom , will take place on the weekend of Nov. 21. Organizers, including the visual artist Dread Scott and the playwright Lynn Nottage, describe the effort as “an urgent call to the arts community to unite in defiance of authoritarian forces sweeping the nation.” Planners have intentionally provided only loose guidelines to participate, suggesting, for example, that museums might highlight artwork in their collection that explores censorship and that bookstores might organize drag queen story hours or showcase banned books. The protests will amount to a “nationwide wave of creative resistance” designed to “celebrate the experiences, cultures and identities that shape the fabric of our nation,” according to the group’s mission statement. Many organizations — including galleries, theaters and comedy clubs — are expected to devise their own events. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles will host a “Wear Your Rights” silk-screening workshop on Nov. 21, while the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art in New York plans to transform one of its galleries into a library of books underscoring the history of pushback by queer artists against censorship and discrimination. Other participants will include the artists Marilyn Minter and Robert Longo, the filmmakers Ava DuVernay and Michael Moore, the writer Jennifer Egan and the musician Amanda Palmer, as well as cultural organizations like the Brooklyn Public Library, Dallas Contemporary and the Woolly Mammoth Theater Company in Washington, D.C. “The action is artistic expression,” Nottage said. “Expression is one of the essential ingredients in the American narrative, and it can’t be stymied or silenced.” Egan said President Trump’s polices had left her “stunned,” adding, “I welcome this spur to act alongside other artists and insist on our right to think and speak freely.” Planning for the national action began less than a month ago, when Scott convened a group that included Nottage and the curator Laura Raicovich . The group envisioned Fall of Freedom as the art world’s first nationwide response to the Trump administration’s efforts to influence cultural life in America, which have included demanding oversight of the Smithsonian and purging the board at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts of Biden appointees. Trump also installed himself as chairman of the center. “It is really important for us as storytellers to be heard,” said Nottage, who has won the Pulitzer Prize for drama twice. The Kennedy Center was considering staging one of her musicals, she said, but when the Trump administration changed the leadership there , her team decided not to pursue the engagement. Nottage said those changes and other actions by the Trump administration had made clear to artists that they must abide by the White House’s views of U.S. history and cultural life. (In March, for instance, Trump issued an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” claiming that the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.”) “Unless you adhere to a certain kind of narrative,” Nottage said, “you are not going to receive support.” Representatives for the Kennedy Center and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Asuka Hisa, the director of learning and engagement at the ICA Los Angeles, likened Fall of Freedom to the No Kings protests against the Trump administration that took place in cities like New York and Chicago and in rural communities in June. “This is not your usual march in the streets,” Hisa said. “It’s protest in the form of engagement with arts, culture and the contemporary issues of our time.” Participants in her museum’s silk-screening workshop, she said, would be invited to print the Fifth Amendment, which includes the right to due process, onto their clothing. Scott, one of the country’s most influential artist-activists, who in 1990 helped overturn a federal law banning the burning of the American flag, said that Fall of Freedom should be seen not just as a protest but also as a chance for people to recognize the importance of artistic expression. “We are not only giving people permission to be punk, but we are encouraging rebellion,” he said. “If you want to phrase that as punk, I would say, ‘Guilty as charged.’” Raicovich, who resigned as director of the Queens Museum in 2018 after a disagreement with its board about an event featuring Mike Pence, then the vice president, that was sponsored by the Israeli government, said she hoped Fall of Freedom would build solidarity among artists from different backgrounds. “As we hope to convey with this project,” she said, “art matters and courage is contagious.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/artists-trump-protests-fall-freedom.html,Culture,BBC,By Zachary Small,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/14cul-freedom-protest-lhkt/14cul-freedom-protest-lhkt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T22:00:06+00:00,34bfc76a489958462c0aeceaf3d738c9691a1286
b354a6be26e9,Jen Tullock Multitasks in ‘Nothing Can Take You From the Hand of God’,"theater, off broadway theater, playwrights horizons, jared mezzocchi, frank winters, nothing can take you from the hand of god, jen tullock","The machinery of imagination is a delicate thing, easily gummed up. It’s vital that it works smoothly at the theater, where the whole enterprise is an agreement between the people making a show and the people watching it: The artists do some pretending, and the audience completes the picture by filling in the blanks. In the new solo play “ Nothing Can Take You From the Hand of God ,” Jen Tullock, best known for the Apple TV series “Severance,” gives a quietly blazing performance, embodying multiple roles in a fragmented tale about family and religion, homophobia and belonging, failures of love and failures of memory. Believing her is no trouble. The show’s abundant live video of Tullock, conversely, is an obstacle to imagination. Written by Tullock and Frank Winters, the play began as a screenplay, so it is understandable that the use of multiple cameras is built into its staging. But given the combined strength of their script, her performance and the other design elements in Jared Mezzocchi’s production for Playwrights Horizons, that impulse feels like a remnant that should have been jettisoned. Inspired by Tullock’s evangelical Christian upbringing in Kentucky, “Nothing Can Take You” is the multilayered story of Frances Reinhardt, a lesbian author. Her new book, “Never the Twain Shall Meet: Losing God and Finding Myself,” which includes an account of romance with another young woman on a missionary trip, has drawn a legal threat from her childhood congregation back in Louisville. So Frances returns to her hometown to salvage the situation. Her mother, Raelynn, whom she blames for harrowing abuse, and her brother, Eli, live there still, as does Agnieszka, who was Frances’s first love. All of them remain practicing Christians, all of them care about her, and none of them remember the past in quite the way she has painted it. “Now let me ask you a question,” the pastor of the church says, with folksy menace. “Do you ever worry if you made any of it up?” Across the country in Los Angeles, Frances’s agent is in a sustained low-key panic at the threat to the project, barraging her with phone calls and dictated texts. “I know you are literally in the film ‘Deliverance’ down there,” she says, but the reality is more evolved and complex. In Louisville, the mellowly bro-style Eli now leads his own less rigid Christian fellowship, and the comically chatty Raelynn is proud of Frances’s professional success. Agnieszka has a show-tune-singing little boy, and Frances’s old guy friend has a husband. “I see y’all’s mother from time to time,” the friend says. “She even came to the wedding.” Layered throughout, in intermittent voice-over (also by Tullock), is the sound of a polished Southern California interviewer leading an onstage conversation with Frances about her book. A play like this is a showcase for range, which Tullock, in the shape-shifting tradition of Anna Deavere Smith, demonstrates unequivocally and with an impressive array of accents. It is also a challenge to empathy: Can one actor find the humanity in each of the many characters? Tullock does not play favorites, and Frances — who grew up comforted by faith and community — is as flawed and stumbling a mortal as any of them. On Emmie Finckel’s set, the well-crafted lighting (by Amith Chandrashaker), projections (by Stefania Bulbarella, who also designed the video) and sound (by Evdoxia Ragkou) help denote when Tullock becomes a new character, and orient us inside the scenes. These elements facilitate imagination. When I say that the cameras do the opposite, it’s not that they make the audience seem extraneous, like last season’s Broadway production of “ The Picture of Dorian Gray ,” a multicharacter solo show that felt to me like watching a film shoot. Tullock is so alert to the room that she ad-libbed an acknowledgment, in character, when someone’s phone went off. But she is right there in front of us, in a small theater with just eight rows of seats. Live video of her takes up an enormous amount of attentional bandwidth while solving no storytelling or sightline problem. And it is too literal not to distract the mind’s eye. This production recalled for me the oft-quoted advice attributed to Coco Chanel: “Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.” The video is the bauble the play doesn’t need.

9b6e9e4d5dab,Recalling the Edmund Fitzgerald and the Song That Honored It,"shipwrecks, museum, great lakes, pop rock music, gordon lightfoot, the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. When visitors clamber aboard the 617-foot-long Col. James M. Schoonmaker next month, they will not be exploring a decommissioned Great Lakes freighter. Instead, they will be walking the decks — OK, pretending to walk the decks — of one of the most fabled ships in American maritime history, one that was about 100 feet longer but of similar design and vintage. That vessel’s sinking in a storm on Nov. 10, 1975, killing all its crew, has become the stuff of legend: the Edmund Fitzgerald . “It’s a touchstone of American history,” said Chris Gillcrist, director emeritus of the National Museum of the Great Lakes in Toledo, where the Schoonmaker is permanently docked. The Titanic, he said, was a British-registered liner and in international waters when it sank. “When you’re talking about an American shipwreck, you have to talk about the Edmund Fitzgerald,” he said in a telephone interview. For the disaster’s 50th-anniversary weekend, Nov. 7 to 10, guided one-hour tours — a total of 40 — will allow the Schoonmaker’s visitors to get a better sense of life on the Edmund Fitzgerald, which over the course of its 17 years of service typically carried iron ore from Minnesota to the steel mills of Detroit and Toledo. “The two boats are fundamentally the same,” Gillcrist said. In addition to showing what life would have been like on the Edmund Fitzgerald (named after the chairman of the ship’s owner, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company), the tours will also examine the various theories as to why it went down in Lake Superior that night. Some say it was a hatch errantly left open; others believe that huge, storm-tossed waves broke the ship in half.

Credit... via GLSHS What defines the public memory of the Edmund Fitzgerald is no mystery, however: Of all the shipwrecks in the recorded history of the Great Lakes, it is the only one to have been immortalized by a hit single. The Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot ’s haunting ballad “ The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald ” was released in August 1976, less than a year after the disaster. The nearly six-minute song — far longer than most singles at the time — soared to the top of the American charts, peaking at No. 1 on Cashbox’s and No. 2 on Billboard’s. Lightfoot, who died in 2023, had other big hits during his five decades as a performer. But his homage to the Fitzgerald — which he played on a 12-string acoustic guitar in a 6/8 time signature that one critic said gave it the “feel of an epic ballad” — he considered his best. It may also have had the most impact. “We can’t memorialize all of the thousands of shipwrecks on the Great Lakes,” said Bruce E. Lynn, executive director of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point, Mich., in a phone conversation. “But the Fitzgerald is the one that most people know about, because of the song. It’s a driving factor in bringing people to the museum.” This is why many of the more than 25 U.S. and Canadian institutions devoted to the history and culture of the Great Lakes are developing ways to spotlight the ship, the story and the song during the 50th-anniversary weekend of the sinking. The most ambitious commemoration is by the National Museum, where the tours on the stand-in Schoonmaker are part of a slate of activities , starting on Nov. 7 with an event at a local brewery, where a new copper ale (branded the Toledo Express, the Fitzgerald’s nickname) will debut. The program will also serve what is believed to have been the crew’s last meal: chicken paprikash. A visit to the museum revealed that it also has a permanent Fitzgerald display, including a life raft, oars from the ship and a computer simulation allowing visitors to explore the wreck. But “from the very beginning, we were thinking that at least part of what we’d do for the anniversary would be in partnership with others,” Kate Fineske, the museum’s executive director, said. On Nov. 9, a special guest will perform. Fineske knew that Lightfoot’s daughter Meredith Moon, 31, and the youngest of his six children, was a musician in her own right. “We heard Meredith was out there,” Fineske said. “We weren’t sure she was interested in participating, but decided to ask.” As part of the commemoration, Meredith Moon, the daughter of the Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot, will perform her father’s song “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.” Credit... Somi Benson-Jaja First, the museum reached out to the Valentine Theater in Toledo, suggesting that Moon perform on its stage that weekend. “I had been thinking how we could collaborate with other local cultural institutions,” said Abby Glanville, executive director of the Valentine, which opened in 1895. “The timing was perfect,” she noted, and Moon was called.

Ashley Streichert Lovejoy “For me, it was a ‘yes’ right away,” said Moon, who lives in Southern Ontario. “Normally, I try to maintain my own identity as a musician and stay away from playing my father’s songs. But this is not just playing songs to sell tickets and make money. It’s a way to honor those lost in the tragic sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald, and a way to honor my father.” But before she can perform the song, she admitted during a phone interview, she has to learn it. “I haven’t even played it yet,” said Moon, who recently released an album, “From Here to the Sea,” on Compass Records. “I’m going to figure it out a couple weeks before, so that I’m fresh and excited to play it.” Other Great Lakes museums have commemorative plans as well: Some of the families of those lost on the Edmund Fitzgerald are expected to attend the 50th-anniversary observations at the shipwreck museum on Nov. 10. Located on the shores of Lake Superior, about 17 miles from where the Fitzgerald sank, the museum has related displays: Those seen on a visit to the building included the ship’s bronze bell, which was recovered by an expedition to the wreck site in 1995. It will be rung 29 times, for each of the crew who died, when the families gather for a private memorial service, which will livestream. There will also be a public ceremony. The Dossin Great Lakes Museum in Detroit permanently displays the ship’s 12,000-pound bow anchor (lost in the Detroit River in 1974) and the pilot house of a local freighter that braved the gale force winds to search for the Fitzgerald. It already holds an annual observance of the sinking, “so the question was, ‘How do we make it bigger for the 50th?” said Bill Pringle, curator of collections for the Detroit Historical Society, which oversees the Dossin. The answer: a new event, a maritime brunch , featuring a chef-prepared meal based on the Fitzgerald ’s galley menu (the choices include, yes, chicken paprikash), while screening a series of video interviews recorded for the anniversary. (The brunch is sold out, but there is a waiting list.) “We wanted to include as many perspectives as possible,” Pringle said. “We’re talking to Great Lakes historians, experts on the Fitzgerald, folks who are involved in fan sites, authors, divers, about why it still holds such a strong place in our memories.” In addition, on Nov. 10, the Dossin will hold its 26th-annual Lost Mariners Remembrance , honoring all sailors lost on the Great Lakes, with live music and a wreath ceremony. The kind of collaborations the National Museum has engineered can be valuable. “The partnership with the brewery is brilliant,” said Susie Wilkening, a museum consultant based in Seattle. “Our research consistently shows that younger adults are more likely to enjoy food-related programming, so that will be appealing to a broader audience.” She added that “creating a package of events like this is a good idea if it makes people feel like they are getting “‘behind the scenes’ access.” Margaret Milnes, vice president for visitor journey at Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut, said, “The idea of turning that vessel into the Edmund Fitzgerald is absolutely fabulous.” She also praised the tie-in to the song: “Whenever a maritime museum, large or small, connects with new audiences via a trending story in the broader culture, that’s a win.” Moon may earn new audiences herself when she performs her rendition of the song, which in this stanza offers a heart-rending requiem for a lost ship and its crew: Does anyone know where the love of God goes When the waves turn the minutes to hours? The searchers all say they’d have made Whitefish Bay If they’d put 15 more miles behind her. They might have split up or they might have capsized; They may have broke deep and took water. And all that remains is the faces and the names Of the wives and the sons and the daughters.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/design/edmund-fitzgerald-wreck-museums.html,Culture,BBC,By John Hanc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-shipwreck-10-kbcj/19sp-finearts-shipwreck-10-kbcj-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-14T17:56:14.586000+00:00,e12eab6e53aea1f2efd185e459331dab7a8e287c

The Weatherbird, who has appeared on the front page of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch every day for nearly 125 years, is a bit of an equalizer, even in divisive times. “You know, people will always disagree with an editorial,” said Dan Martin, who has been drawing the Weatherbird for 39 years. “People will say a news story is slanted, or the photograph should have been of something else.” But the Weatherbird? “People have been complaining about newspapers for 250 years,” said Martin, a soft-spoken man with the same occasionally cheeky humor as the bird. “And this is the one thing they generally don’t complain about.” The Weatherbird, considered the oldest, continuously running daily cartoon in American journalism, is the subject of an exhibit, “Behind the Feathers: A Century of Weatherbird History,” which opened in June and runs through Feb. 15 at the Field House Museum in downtown St. Louis. The exhibition includes drawings of the Weatherbird over the decades, profiles of the artists who have drawn him, Weatherbird collectibles, fan art and instructions on how to draw the Weatherbird on your own.

You have to move your body through the space in order to see what is revealed.” Often what is revealed in the mirrors are different angles of your own self. The figures selected from the manuscripts are nonbinary, queer and from other worlds. “The piece is playing with the norms in the context of West Asian and Muslim countries, which are very heteronormative in culture,” Allahyari said. Bringing different body movements into the experience is a way to encourage constant movement and rethinking, she added, as well as of incorporating pleasure in that physicality and play. Some figures are also talismans that offer protection. “Looking at the walls, the protection becomes part of the feeling — of community, gathering, safety,” she said. “This is how I feel with my friends on the dance floor. In the diaspora, in a community of immigrants, this is an alternative way of feeling at home.” Large-scale dance practices have been common in cultures of West Asia for thousands of years, especially in the wedding context, said Roshanak Kheshti, an associate professor of theater, dance and performance studies at the University of California, Berkeley; her work focuses on sound and performance, rooted in diasporic contexts. She explained that in the 1990s, the intersection of queer culture with these dance traditions, along with a confluence of political and historical events, led to the emergence of a robust rave culture globally. “You have cultures from the region that expect spaces of joy-making, dance and celebration, and you have queer culture similarly doing this, and they meet in the underground in raves and club nights,” Kheshti said in a phone interview. “This is because of an emergence of L.G.B.T. politics we didn’t see before, and also because of the diasporic communities we are talking about being resettled at that time.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/arts/design/san-francisco-asian-art-museum-rave.html,Culture,BBC,By Bonnie Tsui,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-raveculture-01-mkqt/19sp-finearts-raveculture-01-mkqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T17:53:11.220000+00:00,b1e8c5fc0c0175af862dc0472d3ecc5c819c36cf

ccd611a757d2,"Review: ‘Are the Bennet Girls OK?’ Well, Their Mother Is Magnificent.","theater, are the bennet girls ok?, off broadway theater, bedlam theater, caroline grogan, zuzanna szadkowski, eric tucker","Jane Austen was cuttingly succinct in her characterization of Mrs. Bennet in “Pride and Prejudice,” describing her as “a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.” Throughout the novel, Mrs. Bennet remains fussily, infuriatingly laser-focused on plotting to advance her daughters’ marital possibilities to ensure the Bennets’ future financial security. In most screen adaptations, Mrs. Bennet’s wince-inducing meddling is played for laughs — and a distraction from the obstacle-strewn paths to coupled contentment for Lizzie and Mr. Darcy and for Jane and Mr. Bingley. But in the funny and engaging production of Emily Breeze’s “ Are the Bennet Girls OK? ,” from the Bedlam theater company and briskly directed by Eric Tucker, Mrs. Bennet is the magnetically commanding anchor of the show. In her rich performance, Zuzanna Szadkowski makes us see the gritted desolation at the heart of Mrs. Bennet’s bustling desperation. (The production, now scheduled to run at West End Theater through Nov. 9, comes almost a decade after Bedlam’s acclaimed 2016 adaptation of Austen’s “ Sense and Sensibility .”) The looming threat of Mr. Collins’s inheritance of the Bennet family home remains the engine driving Mrs. Bennet to marry off her second-eldest child, Lizzie (Elyse Steingold), to him. After Lizzie declines, the show focuses on her and her sisters’ awry romances and also the turmoil within a family facing an uncertain material future. The play’s profanity-laden conversations and emotional explosions flow from the pain and absurdities inherent in a social system of marriage, money and subservience that constrains women’s choices. Austen’s opening sentence of the novel — “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife” — has been meaningfully changed here, with Mrs. Bennet remarking, “Well, it’s a truth universally acknowledged that a girl with a sister must be in want of another sister so they can complain about the first sister together, and each of my girls has four sisters so —.” Moments later, she says of her daughters: “They roll their eyes at me. Do yours do that? Do they roll their eyes at you like you’re stupid and you’ve never done anything in your entire life?” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

On Monday, Swift announced two tour-related projects that would be coming to Disney+: “The End of an Era,” a six-episode docuseries about the development and “inner workings” of the tour, with two episodes released per week, starting on Dec. 12, and “The Final Show,” a concert film of the last date of the tour, in Vancouver, B.C., also arriving on Dec. 12. The equivalent sales figure attributed to “Showgirl” is a composite that incorporates the album’s popularity on streaming services along with purchases of the full album. A breakdown of those numbers illustrates how thoroughly Swift has dominated every format available to her. The album sold 3,479,500 copies as a complete package on CD, vinyl LPs, downloads and even cassette. In the age of streaming, crossing a million sales at all has become a rare accomplishment: So far this year, the biggest non-Taylor Swift tally for traditional sales is the Weeknd’s “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” with a bit more than 500,000. Moving a million in a single week is a feat achievable by a vanishing few. Other than Swift or Adele, the last artist to do it was Lady Gaga, who sold 1,108,000 copies of “Born This Way” in May 2011 — just before Spotify arrived in the United States . “Showgirl” sold an astonishing 1,334,000 copies last week as a vinyl LP, breaking a modern-era record for first-week sales set by Swift herself just last year, when she sold 859,000 vinyl copies of “ The Tortured Poets Department .” As has become her signature in recent years, Swift sold multiple editions of her album. By week’s end there were 38 in all, according to Billboard, including 27 physical iterations (18 CD versions, eight vinyl LPs and one cassette). There were also 11 downloadable versions, which sold for as little as $4.99 and came with bonus goodies like acoustic tracks and excerpts from Swift’s “voice memo” recording drafts.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/arts/music/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-first-week-sales.html,Culture,BBC,By Ben Sisario,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/13cul-taylor-chart-mpwt/13cul-taylor-chart-mpwt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T18:09:08+00:00,8743758025afd81498201ac3236548167bd61c10

According to ARTnews , 77 paintings and 236 other objects were returned. In 1995, the remaining objects were transferred to the Federation of Jewish Communities of Austria . They were auctioned in 1996 by Christie’s, raising more than $14 million to help needy Holocaust victims and their heirs. Mr. Esterow sold ARTnews in 2014, after its circulation had risen to 80,000, for an undisclosed amount to a private asset management firm owned by the Russian entrepreneur Sergey Skaterschikov. Afterward, Mr. Esterow contributed freelance articles to The Times and continued to report on the Nazi looting. In 2016, Austria’s consul general, Georg Heindl, honored Mr. Esterow and Mr. Decker on behalf of the country, saying they had “contributed to Austria facing its past honestly and thereby becoming, in a way, a better country.” Milton Esterow was born on July 28, 1928, in Brooklyn. His father, Bernard Esterow, owned a small grocery. His mother, Yetta (Barash) Esterow, managed the home. At 10, Milton published a neighborhood newspaper that he sold for two cents a copy. On joining The Times, his first assignment as a copy boy was to buy the latest edition of The Daily Racing Form for the managing editor, who placed his horseracing bets with Mr. Esterow’s boss, the chief copy boy. After being promoted to reporter in 1948, Mr. Esterow dropped out of Brooklyn College, figuring he would learn journalism by practicing it over studying it. An early lesson in the importance of attention to detail came that year, when he was assigned to cover a murder in a Bronx apartment.

This is Emperor Jones, the lead character in José Limón’s 1956 dance. Limón based his work on Eugene O’Neill’s 1920 play, one of his earliest experiments in anti-realism, and one of the first American plays with a complex Black protagonist. “There is something not altogether ridiculous about his grandeur,” O’Neill wrote of Emperor Jones, a Pullman porter who kills a man and flees to a Caribbean island where he manipulates the local population into making him Emperor. “He has a way of carrying it off.” Limón’s dance captures these qualities: the effort to intimidate that does not quite succeed, the tinseled grandeur. Limón, a Mexican-born American modern choreographer and dancer, cast himself in the title role. (A film of that performance can be found online .) At a recent rehearsal of the Limón Dance Company, with Johnson Guo in the lead, the character felt strangely familiar, less like fiction and more like a commentary on the present day. Dante Puleio, the company’s director, agreed. “The original story is about an escaped convict,” he said in an interview, “a felon who becomes a tyrannical leader.” About a year and a half ago, Puleio considered reviving the work. “I didn’t feel the imagination had to go far to draw a contemporary parallel to that reality.” “The Emperor Jones” will be performed as part of the company’s 80th anniversary season at the Joyce Theater (Oct. 14-19), which also includes a world premiere by the Mexican choreographer Diego Vega Solorza.

Mr. Watkins, 48, was assaulted Saturday morning at the Wakefield Prison, the West Yorkshire Police said in a statement on Saturday that did not identify him by name. He was pronounced dead after officers and emergency responders arrived, the police said. Two of Mr. Watkins’s fellow inmates — Rashid Gedel, 25, and Samuel Dodsworth, 43 — were arrested on suspicion of murder and were taken into police custody, the police said Saturday. The two men appeared in Leeds Magistrates’ Court on Monday morning, the BBC reported . Wakefield, in West Yorkshire County, is a high-security prison for men, including those who have been convicted of sex offenses. In 2013, Mr. Watkins pleaded guilty to 13 charges. His offenses included attempting to rape a baby, sexually touching a 1-year-old, encouraging a fan to abuse her child and making child pornography. Mr. Watkins was sentenced that year to 29 years in prison and six years of probation. In his sentencing remarks, Judge John Royce described Mr. Watkins as a sexual predator who used his power “to induce young female fans” to help satisfy an “apparently insatiable lust and to take part in the sexual abuse of their young children.” Mr. Watkins “plumbed new depths of depravity” with his actions, the judge said. Two other defendants, the mothers of children Mr. Watkins was accused of abusing, were sentenced to 14 and 17 years, according to sentencing documents. They were not publicly identified. Lostprophets, formed in Wales in 1997, found global success in the 2000s with hits including “Burn Burn,” “Last Summer” and “Last Train Home,” which reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Alternative Songs chart in 2004. In 2008, the band jointly headlined the Download Festival, a British rock and metal event. The group’s last record, “Weapons,” was released in 2012. The group disbanded after Mr. Watkins was arrested. “We can no longer continue making or performing music as Lostprophets,” the group wrote on its Facebook page at the time, The Guardian reported .

2ae4822c2b74,"Music Influenced This Art. Now, Experience Them Together.","art, music, peter doig, serpentine gallery, london","If you believe looking at paintings is a three-dimensional experience, if you are drawn to the synesthetic and how one medium can bleed into another, if you like it L-O-U-D, then Peter Doig’s “House of Music” is for you. Through Feb. 8, the Serpentine Galleries in London are hosting what is billed as the first exhibition to explore the influence of music on the oeuvre of the Scottish-born painter who has spent decades splitting his time among Trinidad, Canada and Britain. It is also the first show in which Doig, who always paints to music (country is a current favorite genre), has included a continuously playing soundtrack from the 300 albums in his vinyl collection. The show also features special guests who will play their own set of influential tracks every Sunday. The relationship between music and the visual arts is long and varied, with some notable 20th-century pairings. In 1911, the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky — who titled his wildly colorful abstractions as if they were pieces of music — wrote, “Lend your ears to music, open your eyes to painting, and … stop thinking!” Inspired by the New York jazz scene, Piet Mondrian painted his raucous visual jitterbug, “Broadway Boogie-Woogie” (1942-43). Jackson Pollock, as he splattered streams of paints across canvasses laid on the ground, was listening to Duke Ellington. And Faith Ringgold was likewise inspired by Duke Ellington and other Harlem greats. “Music is a life force,” she said in a 2006 interview. “I try to interpret the music in my work. You can’t see the music, but you can feel it.” The same might be said of the vivid, luminous canvases arrayed across this four-room exhibition that Doig has titled after the lyrics of “Dat Soca Boat,” a 2011 song by the Trinidadian calypsonian musician Winston Bailey, known as Mighty Shadow. The musician himself appears in “Shadow” (2019), standing and staring out to sea, a lighthouse and a boat visible in the hazy distance. He is wearing the skeleton costume that he donned for performances, and over his shoulder is slung a yellow guitar (calling to mind Pablo Picasso’s 1921 “Three Musicians”) that seems to glow, as if hot with the promise of music. Doig has selected 22 works, spanning 2002-2025, whose connections to music are varying degrees of obvious: stacks of speakers that resemble geometric abstractions; girls roller-skating in dusky, sfumato atmospheres, blurred with motion; portraits of musicians like Shadow and the Trinidadian poet and artist Emheyo Bahabba (also known as Embah), with whom Doig shared a studio for 14 years. Sound is also a sculptural presence in the show. A set of “high fidelity” 1950s wooden Klangfilm Euronor speakers is split between two spaces, where clusters of lounge chairs are installed so that visitors can take their time listening to the music that Doig typically plays in his studio as he works. The huge speakers, which would have originally been invisible behind cinema screens, stand illuminated like monstrous ears, a reminder that the act of listening, like looking, is reflexive: You get what you give. Most phantastic, in the old-fashioned sense of the word — imaginary, marvelous, able to produce appearances — is the installation in the central room of an enormous speaker produced by Western Electric/Bell Labs in the 1920s and ’30s. So early in cinema technology that it was technically still called a “loud speaking telephone,” the metal object that curves like an ear canal hangs from a scaffold in the show’s central room, where visiting artists and musicians will at various points share the sounds behind their own art. (I rushed to put a session with musicians Cat Power and Lizzi Bougatsos in my calendar. Ed Ruscha, Brian Eno and Arthur Jafa are among dozens of others on the bill.) You might also glimpse Laurence Passera, the sound-system expert who salvaged this marvel of a speaker from a cinema in Wales, overseeing its amp like the Wizard of Oz as it hums and emits sounds richer and warmer than those to which our digital age is now accustomed. (According to Passera, it’s thought to be the very speaker that played Elvis Presley to a young Tom Jones for the first time.) Of Doig’s works in the show, a large, richly hued canvas titled “Music of the Future” (2002-2007) best exemplifies the diffuse and surprising sense of possibility that emerges in the pairing of sound and image. The work was inspired by an early evening in Trinidad, when Doig heard a steel band practicing for Carnival. Its players barely perceptible in the low light, the sound took on a muscular, almost visual presence. In the hallucinatory green-and-blue painting, we pick out small figures along a watery shore, encouraged by the music that drifts through the gallery space to linger longer. It’s impossible to predict what will be playing in “The House of Music” on any given day. It might be Aretha Franklin’s “Spirit in the Dark,” Bobbie Gentry’s “Penduli Pendulum,” Shadow’s “Little Boy Blue” or something encountered for the first time. Either way, it will change, in the best way possible, how and what you see. You can feel the music, and maybe you can see it, too.

139f4a180180,Marc Maron on the End of His Landmark Podcast,"podcast, personal profile;people story, comedy, marc maron, barack obama, wtf with marc maron","On a drive to lunch one sunny recent afternoon in Glendale, Calif., the comedian and actor Marc Maron was contemplating the term “burnout,” trying it on and inspecting it from different angles, like a new pair of pants he wasn’t sure were to his taste. Maron had used the word a few times in a June episode of his podcast, “ WTF With Marc Maron ,” in which he announced that he and his founding producer, Brendan McDonald, would be ending the influential show after 16 years . Many responses to the news had echoed the term (including Howard Stern’s “I was burned out in 1996”) and now Maron seemed to worry that he’d sounded weak, or self-aggrandizing. “The fact is, we’ve been doing this a long time,” he said, turning the wheel of his tan Toyota Avalon, a graveyard of empty seltzer cans, coffee cups, and Zyn packets. “And now we kind of want to live our lives. That may be burnout, or it may just be the natural course of things.” This cycle of conjecture and revision — Maron grasping for, and occasionally reaching, some kind of emotional truth — was the essence of “WTF.” Over more than 1,600 episodes, he engaged in raw and personal dialogues with a staggering array of comedians, artists and public figures. Among them were Robin Williams, Lorne Michaels, Louis C.K. and Barack Obama, who became the first sitting president to appear on a podcast when he was a guest in 2015. Yet some of the show’s indelible moments came from Maron himself. In discursive audio diaries that opened each episode, he exorcised a lifetime of petty and profound demons — including troubles with home repairs, sobriety, cat ownership, anxiety and the sudden death five years ago of his partner, the director Lynn Shelton — long before they could be metabolized into stand-up material. For the podcast’s final episode, released Monday, Maron, 62, met again with Obama. In a departure from his usual procedure, in which guests are interviewed in the tchotchke-filled garage unit of his suburban home here, they spoke at Obama’s office in Washington D.C. For Maron, the interview was a fitting capstone — particularly at a time when, he said, “many people live every day on edge and in fear about the future of this country.” “It’s hard to find a way through, in terms of hope,” Maron added. “So, I went to the hope guy.” I spoke to Maron twice — in person in August and by video call last Friday — about saying goodbye to what he called “the crown jewel” of his legacy, how he feels about his heirs in podcasting and his plans to direct his first feature film. These are edited excerpts from the conversations. Why President Obama for your final guest? The first time was an important turning point, certainly for me personally. For a sitting president to come to my little garage at my house , it was a big deal. And I think it was a game-changing episode for podcasting in general, in terms of the attention it brought the medium. I was happy to see him again and to talk about the current administration and the world we’re living in now, but also, you know, to honor my show. Were there any conditions for the interview? Things he wouldn’t discuss? No. Neither time. There were no conditions, no vetting of questions and no requests for a pre-edit. How do you think it went? The last time, there was a motorcade and Secret Service and many staff involved — and he was still disarming and grounded and present. This time, it was more casual — just me and him in his office — so I knew it would be even better and that turned out to be true. He was very aware that he was our last guest and that our last episode meant something, to me and culturally. How does it feel to be officially done with the show? Well, I guess it’s real now. We’ve certainly had a big enough runway up to this. And I’ve had time to sort of adjust and adapt. But it’s going to be an interesting time, in terms of decompression and getting out of the habit. To me it’s an opportunity to kind of be like, you know, Who am I? What do I do with this mental and emotional and creative time? So, I feel OK about it. It’s sad, but I don’t feel any regrets. How has the outpouring of responses been sitting with you? Hearing from the fans has been very moving for me. There’s a part of me that feels a responsibility to these listeners. I get all kinds of emails, stuff that I would never have expected, from people who I helped to get sober, who I helped pull off the ledge of depression, or people who are just sensitive and like-minded and appreciate hearing me work through being in the world. They live in my head, as well. So it makes me sad that they are not going to have this anymore. Are there things that you feel disappointment over, that you weren’t able to accomplish? I’ve heard you talk about being upset that you never won a Peabody Award. The Peabody — I thought that, out of all of them, we deserved that. I got it in my mind that it has some integrity within the world of journalism and artists. I used to think it was because we cuss, or because of the name of the show, but then Amy Schumer won one. The truth is, it could just come down to one person not liking it, for whatever reason. You grow to learn that none of this stuff is a meritocracy. You’ve also had some words lately for Dax Shephard, the actor and host of “Armchair Expert.” You essentially accused him of aping your show. That was half a joke. Look, I didn’t invent interviewing, but I do think I helped create the space for intimate interviews of a certain type. It just feels like he kind of modeled his method after me a bit. If somebody capitalizes on something that you do, and then they go on to make a lot of money , there’s a point where you’re sort of like, “All right.” But, you know, you can’t carry that [expletive]. After a certain age, what the hell good is it going to do to be resentful of that? White guy comics with podcasts have become remarkably influential, with people like Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Schulz interviewing then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2024 campaign. You’ve joked that you feel like you “released the kraken.” Where do you think things stand now? These guys have proven that their fan bases can be tribalized into something that I think is fundamentally dangerous. It’s still within the parameters of free speech — you can do whatever you want. And if you want to be used by the dominating propaganda arm of a fascistic momentum against democracy, well, I hope you’re happy with your show. You’re working on developing a feature film to direct, based on the novel “No One Left to Come Looking for You” by Sam Lipsyte, a friend of yours. What about directing appeals to you? There are things that you see yourself doing when you’re younger, and, as a film nerd of sorts, directing a movie is something I’ve always wanted to do. The book is very funny and specific and it takes place in a world that [Lipsyte and I] spent time in: New York City in the early-to-mid ’90s on the Lower East Side. I related to the spirit of the young characters — they’re sort of realizing that there’s a big world out there, and it’s not great. You started the podcast in your late 40s and have talked about feeling like success found you late in life. Do you think it came too late? No. If you’re honest with yourself, I think a lot of times success didn’t come because you weren’t ready for it. When I auditioned for “Saturday Night Live” [in 1995], I wasn’t ready for that. By the time the podcast started, I’d let go of all the other dreams, but when they started to happen, I felt like, “OK, I’m ready for it now.” I could show up and do the work in a way that I wouldn’t have been able to previously. I’m not mad that my success came when it did. I’m just glad that it came, because it would have been a much sadder life if it hadn’t.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/arts/marc-maron-wtf-podcast.html,Culture,BBC,By Reggie Ugwu and Chantal Anderson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13CUL-MARON-FAREWELL-promo/13CUL-MARON-FAREWELL-ktmp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:03:18+00:00,6c5be35f60799fde0ecb1088a47d0920a0c1eb79
e5a8135d5083,"When Baryshnikov Wanted a Challenge, Twyla Tharp Delivered","dance;ballet, american ballet theatre, twyla tharp, mikhail baryshnikov, susan jaffe, jake roxander, isaac hernández, push comes to shove","The star of Twyla Tharp’s first work for American Ballet Theater was the most famous dancer in the world. His dramatic defection to the West had made headlines. His technique, his athleticism and his theatricality were superlative. But Mikhail Baryshnikov wasn’t in the mood to play a prince. “He came to be challenged and that was my mandate,” Tharp said in an interview. “Make movement that he’d never done and perhaps nobody had ever done, and let’s see if it’s doable.” In “Push Comes to Shove,” Tharp’s 1976 ballet set to Joseph Lamb’s “Bohemia Rag” and Haydn’s Symphony No. 82 in C Major, Baryshnikov played a sly master of ceremonies whose body is first set in motion to a rag, hips softly swiveling below an ever-fluid spine. He tosses a bowler hat in the air. “We have the prince, the king,” Tharp said. “We must have the crown — it just happens to look like a vaudeville bowler.” The sparkling, playful “Push,” a masterpiece revived as part of Ballet Theater’s fall season at Lincoln Center, is saved for last in the program: “ Twyla@60: A Tharp Celebration, ” which debuts on Wednesday and includes the company premiere of “Sextet” (1992), a rarely seen work for three couples, and “Bach Partita” (1983), a glorious large-scale ballet. Tharp has created 16 ballets for American Ballet Theater — more than any other choreographer. The company’s artistic director, Susan Jaffe, who as a dancer performed in each of the works on the “Twyla@60” program, said that Tharp has been an indelible influence on her. “After really understanding Twyla’s work and understanding how to approach it, I became a much better dancer,” Jaffe said. “A much better swan queen.” Jaffe wants her dancers to be immersed in Tharp’s choreography, which marries precise, clean ballet technique with a jazzy looseness and the weight of modern dance. “A lot of the contemporary work, yes requires plié, yes requires a lot of upper body articulation,” Jaffe said. “But with Twyla, it’s in the ankles, the knees, the hips, and also how the body negotiates the different transference of weight.” Sascha Radetsky, a former soloist who is now the artistic director of ABT Studio Company, brings in as much Tharp repertoire as he can for his young dancers. They are now learning “Cornbread,” a bubbly, virtuosic pas de deux from 2021, memorably performed by Tiler Peck and Roman Mejia of New York City Ballet. Tharp’s complex ballets teach dancers “how to pace themselves,” Radetsky said, “to find places to vary the attack and to breathe and to not let the effort show. To be so grounded and natural while still achieving the precision and refinement that she requires. But doing it as if it’s a walk in the park.” A Tharp work offers a dancer more than steps, but there are those, too. Because of Ballet Theater’s emphasis on story ballets, weighty roles can be hard to come by, which is frustrating with a company so rich with talent. But in Tharp’s ballets — as in those by George Balanchine — everyone dances. The steps have substance, not because they are tricky but because of their emphasis on crystalline technique. Isaac Hernández, a principal of simmering power and theatrical depth , said that Tharp keeps reminding him to use his technique — to improve it, to be exacting with it. “At the beginning, I was like, ‘But I have technique,’” he said. “And she was like, ‘No, you’re cheating. You are finding the easiest ways to do this. Just do it right.’” Hernández is one of two dancers cast as the male lead in “Push.” The other is the soloist Jake Roxander, whose youthful charm matches his dazzling, natural line. The two men are completely different, but both completely right. One exudes a hint of danger, the other is a quicksilver sprite. But the most important quality they can bring to the role is themselves. Tharp, Hernández said, has been clear that her goal is not for him to recreate what Baryshnikov did but to put himself in the choreography. Recently he had a breakthrough after he arrived at rehearsal in a dark mood. “‘I know you’re probably having a hard time right now,’” he recalled Tharp telling him. “‘I want to hear nothing about it, just dance.’” He gave her just what she wanted, but the next day — he was in a calmer state — his performance was more precise than daring. Hernández said that on that occasion Tharp told him, “‘You have to tame the lion, but you have to show me the lion, too.’” The role is not about effortlessness and ease, but an underlying tension — a push and a pull. “It’s been really interesting to work with someone that is so perceptive about feeling and intention and also so committed to making it something remarkable,” Hernández said. “Because she keeps telling me, ‘I know it’s good. You’re good. It’s not a bad show. You could do it like that sometimes, but it’s not extraordinary.’ She was like, ‘I want this to be extraordinary.’ That’s inspiring.” When she was choreographing “Push,” Tharp said that Baryshnikov didn’t speak much English yet. His attention span was short. But she marveled at how he didn’t fixate on what he looked like. “For a dancer of that caliber and reputation to not be concerned that he’s going to look like a fool is very unusual,” she said. “But he had the curiosity, and he also had the physical stuff to take it on.” Baryshnikov was, she added, way overqualified for the job. “He had the proportions, he had the power, he had the charm, he was a good actor,” she said. “He had a zest for a moment.” But there were gaps in his skills, however tremendous. As a ballet dancer who had spent years turning his feet out, he didn’t have much experience working with his feet in parallel. He needed to learn how to initiate movement from the torso instead of driving it from the legs. There was frustration that led to gestures she used in the ballet, like running his fingers through his sweaty hair with exhaustion. “I mean, the guy was lost, right?” Tharp said. “He doesn’t speak English. He has no family here. He doesn’t know where he’s living. And so, yeah, the classic one is walking up to the mirror and putting his hair back like looking, Who am I? What am I doing here ?” But Baryshnikov, despite his struggle with the movement, forged ahead using his comic flair and his way of mixing a deadpan gaze with feats of virtuosic brilliance. Tharp, as her title proclaims, pushed him in every aspect, and he soaked it up. “The big ace in the hole was that everybody is being so serious and so reverential about this amazing great classical artist,” Tharp said. “It’s like, Oh, yay, good! Let’s be a clown. Let’s show them what’s really hard. Or push that envelope so far that it just becomes a totally different creature. So that was the goal.” Who anticipated Baryshnikov would appear on a stage tossing a hat? “When the expectation was torqued to that degree, people were just set back on the heel,” Tharp said. “And then immediately you loved the guy. He’s doing something that appears so easy and so simple, but as you watch it, you see this extraordinary accomplishment underneath it all.” The ballet, in four movements, has a large cast with the male lead ricocheting between two forces, a pair of female dancers — one tall and the other tiny (originally Martine van Hamel and Marianna Tcherkassky). For its new male stars, the pressure to dance a role created for Baryshnikov adds another layer to an already daunting challenge. Roxander, long enamored of Baryshnikov, was so young when he first saw him in the video for “Don Quixote” that he thought his name was Don Quixote. “It’s a little nerve wracking, but I welcome that with open arms,” he said. “You have to try to be yourself.” Lately, Tharp has spoken to Roxander about the mix of charisma and arrogance in the role — what is behind its mystery? “How do I let the character shine through?” Roxander said. “Why did Misha make those choices, why did he do the steps this way? How much of it was just him not being able to help being him and how much of that was the character? And that’s why it’s such a blessing to work with the choreographer of the ballet one-on-one.” During the rehearsal process, Tharp asked Hernández and Roxander to look at the original studio tapes, which were recorded when the material was first being made. “If you take his solutions to the problem, it is always going to be his,” she said, referring to Baryshnikov. “But if you get told, ‘OK, this is what you’re trying to do, you’re trying to go forward and backward at the same time,’ they’re going to resolve it in a way that is not going to look like someone else. It’s going to look like themselves.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/arts/dance/twyla-tharp-american-ballet-theater.html,Culture,BBC,By Gia Kourlas,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19cul-twyla-push-qtgj/19cul-twyla-push-qtgj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:01:27+00:00,0e0def31039096589ad84197cad0c632b0ff2204
21fc3c748123,Tim Curry Isn’t Done Yet,"tim curry, vagabond, books, writer, theater, actor, personal profile;people story, genre-books-audiobooks","If there is one element that deters notable people from memoir writing, it is the pressure to tell all. Certainly that prospect put off the British actor Tim Curry, 79, a raconteur extraordinaire who entered the pantheon when he played the corseted, platform-heeled, insatiably libidinous Frank-N-Furter in the 1975 cult classic “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” “I always remember Errol Flynn’s memoir, which was called ‘My Wicked, Wicked Life,’” Curry said over lunch last month in Hollywood, and laughed that dark, molten lava laugh of his. “I thought, ‘Not me, buddy.’ But it was a very sellable title. I’m sure it whisked off the shelves.” Tiny correction, close enough: The title was “My Wicked, Wicked Ways.” Curry’s lively new memoir, “Vagabond,” is fairly short on wickedness, unless his thickly cocaine-dusted New York 1980s count. A self-portrait refracted through his most significant roles, the book does include a certain amount of searingly intimate detail, notably about the life-altering stroke that he suffered in 2012, and from which, he said, “I’ve been recovering for quite a long time.” But the particulars of desire, sex and romance in his personal history? He breaks his book’s fourth wall to tell readers that those will not be forthcoming. “I guarantee you, if it matters,” he writes in the introduction, “that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I’m not interested in your romances.” Then, with the confrontational panache of Frank splashing the camera lens with water in “Rocky Horror,” he adds: “And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are — respectfully — none of your [expletive] business.” Even with that boundary firmly drawn, memoir writing is a vulnerable occupation. Slipping into characters is what Curry does. In autobiography, that option was not available. “You don’t have anywhere to hide,” he said. “You’re trying to be as honest as you can be. Otherwise there’s not much point, I don’t think.” But Curry’s résumé will tell you that he has always liked a bit of daring: fresh out of the University of Birmingham, getting naked in the original 1968 London production of “Hair”; a few years later, strutting Frank’s stuff at close range to live audiences in the stage musical “The Rocky Horror Show,” well before it became a film sensation. Curry is a lion in winter now, getting around in a wheelchair and with his stamina not what it was since the stroke brought his life to a frightening interregnum. Yet he is still drawn to creative risk, unready to pack it in as an artist. “I can’t quite imagine retiring and not ever working again,” he said. He has thought about it, of course he has, but “trying to stretch” creatively is the stronger impulse. On that score, he is “cautiously pleased” with “Vagabond,” albeit with a couple of regrets. “I regret some of the language in my book,” Curry said. “I have a very rich Anglo-Saxon vocabulary. And it’s certainly for real. It’s certainly the sound of my voice. But perhaps I could have honored my language more.” I may have argued with him about that, on the grounds that his profanity is highly entertaining. (“It’s too easy to work blue,” he said.) I may have told him that he does cartwheels with language, and so what if he swears at the same time? That may have made him laugh until he coughed. Another book regret, more poignant: “I think I could have maybe treated my mother better.” The long recovery “Vagabond” was always going to be his memoir’s title — because as the son of a Royal Navy chaplain, he had a peripatetic early childhood; because his actor’s life was similarly roaming; and, he said, “because in the 17th century in the criminal code, actors were lumped together with thieves and vagabonds.” Curry has been in Los Angeles for decades now, longer than he’s ever lived anywhere, but he grew up mainly on the coast of bleak postwar England, where he was the little brother to a big sister, Judy, four years older. He remembers their mercurial mother’s rages, which he later channeled into some of his more alarming characters, including the predatory supernatural clown Pennywise in the 1990 TV horror mini-series “It.” He remembers the gentleness and humor of their father, who died when he was 12 — a loss that informed his approach to the sweet scoundrel pirate Long John Silver in the 1996 movie musical “Muppet Treasure Island,” whose young hero is an orphaned boy. Each of those roles gets a chapter in “Vagabond,” as do the wily butler Wadsworth from the 1985 movie “Clue,” and the jaunty King Arthur from the 2005 Monty Python hit musical “Spamalot,” Curry’s fifth Broadway show, which landed him his third Tony Award nomination. For someone who has dedicated his career to performing fictional characters, he is refreshingly free of pretense. Over lunch, he paused to ask his caregiver Ramon Garcia, who sat next to him at the table, to adjust him in his wheelchair. Then, returning to the interview, Curry said, “Let’s continue working” — work being what an interview is, despite journalistic convention favoring the artifice, when a famous performer is involved, that it’s all just a friendly hang. He was similarly frank in discussing his stroke, which occurred on July 13, 2012, while he was having a massage, and brought him “way too close to death.” “It’s a curious experience,” he said. “I didn’t know it was happening at the time. They told me at the hospital and operated on my brain and removed, I think, two blood clots, which is a sort of grim picture. I found that very difficult to cope with as an image. There’s a German play called ‘Danton’s Death,’ where he says, ‘If you cut off the top of my head and paddled around in my brains, you would never know me.’ And it felt like somebody had paddled around in my brain.” Marcia Hurwitz, Curry’s manager, has worked with him since the late 1980s. The two are so close that she was his emergency contact, as she learned when she got the call from the hospital. She also soon heard from the gossip outlet TMZ, which she said had been tipped off immediately, because Curry had arrived under his own name. Squashing any coverage by refusing to talk, she then kept the news from coming out for nearly a year. “I put him under an alias so nobody knew,” she said. “And when I moved him from one hospital to another, we did it in the middle of the night.” An actor’s body is his instrument, and Curry’s had been altered radically. The stroke paralyzed his left side and, for a miserable while, obstructed the path between what he wanted to say and what came out of his mouth. “I think my father had a stroke when he was 45 and died later from pneumonia,” he said. “And I kept remembering my mother talking about going to see him in hospital. He could only blink for yes and no. I dreaded that. I didn’t want that to happen to me. It was very peculiar not to be able to speak, and to find a voice again was difficult.” For Curry, physical therapy was exciting, because he could make progress, but speech therapy was ineffective — “a joke, really,” he said. His voice — so precise, so actorly, so British — returned on its own, then? “It just sort of crept back,” he said. “My major instrument.” He laughed a small, ironic laugh. Despite how difficult it is to imagine anyone other than him speaking words written in what is so clearly his voice, it is remarkable that he chose to narrate the audiobook of “Vagabond.” He has scores of voice credits in film, TV and video games, and many audiobook credits, too . But this is his first book narration since Ruth Rendell’s crime novel “Portobello” in 2010. Recording “Vagabond” took more than a month, Hurwitz said. But Curry, determined that it be “as authentic as possible,” wasn’t about to hand the job off to some other actor. Still, narrating his own history presented a challenge. “Because very often when I would sort of get either into an anecdote or a description of some place, I would inevitably go there,” he said. “And it would be hard to concentrate.” He got through it, though, and in the audio he sounds authentic as can be: older and unprettified, more tentative in tone, yet unmistakably Tim Curry. ‘Exploring all our contradictions’ Curry is not a person who lives in the past (“I never did, never have, never will,” he said), and he hadn’t made a habit of revisiting old memories. Nonetheless, he told me, he always thought he would write a memoir — even if, as Hurwitz noted, it took “major persuading” to get him finally to do it. He spoke his memories aloud into a recorder, and a collaborator, Domenica Alioto, helped to organize them. It’s a fun read, thanks to Curry’s dry sense of humor (some wickedness there, actually; he never punches down, but Charlie Sheen gets a bop on the nose). There is also some exploration of his guiding philosophies — like one that dates to a brandy-soaked, gap-year night in Marrakech, where he was traveling with his boarding school friend, the future art critic Richard Cork. They made a pact there and then, committing “to exploring all our contradictions,” Curry writes. Embodying the voracious Frank, in “Rocky Horror,” only reinforced that tenet in him. “Playing somebody like that wakes you up to new dimensions of human nature,” he writes. “I can’t imagine a better role to enable me to embrace my contradictions and see them through. I learned not to limit myself — artistically, professionally, sexually or mentally.” “Rocky Horror,” the cult creation so enduring that it’s borderline mainstream, has followed him ever since, and trailed him even into the private dining room at the restaurant. Deep into the interview, the chef, Sal Marino — with whom Curry has a warm, bantering rapport — strolled in and said: “I have a question for you. When was the last time you went to the movie theater and saw ‘The Rocky Horror Show’?” The answer, it emerged, was circa 1978 at the old Tiffany Theater on the Sunset Strip, back when Curry had a rock band. His bandmates went with him — and the drummer, he said, “seemed very relieved” when he told him that, no, they didn’t need to dress up. ‘Time to go home for a while’ Perhaps the gutsiest disclosure in “Vagabond” comes late in the book, just before Curry recounts his stroke and its aftermath. In 2011, he went to the Chichester Festival Theater in England to star in Tom Stoppard’s “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.” Stoppard himself had recommended him. And Curry got axed — though “ill health, following an ongoing chest infection and repeated asthma attacks,” was the publicly stated reason for his departure. “I mean, I’d never been fired before,” Curry said. “That was pretty weird. And that was because I couldn’t remember the words, you know. I had somebody reading them into my ear. It was awful. And it didn’t work, as far as I was concerned. It was humiliating, really.” So why bring it up in his own memoir, where he controls the narrative? “Well, exactly because it’s all too glamorized, what we do,” he said, meaning actors. “And I think it’s important for people to know it can be really tough. And you can fall over.” With the exception of a 2012 staged reading of Eric Idle’s ribald musical comedy “What About Dick?” in Los Angeles — which was recorded and later released — that was Curry’s last theater role. Whether that will remain true is to be determined, though. He writes in the memoir that he would like to perform again, and when I asked what that might look like, his mind went immediately to the stage, and to Britain. “I really don’t know,” he mused. “There are some of the biggies, some of the classical parts that I would really like to do, I’m sure at some point, if I get my mojo back.” Curry had been talking, and lunching, for nearly an hour and a half when I inquired whether he might write another memoir, if he had more to say. He did not dismiss the idea, and mentioned that he had very much enjoyed the British actor Dirk Bogarde’s multivolume memoirs — a “super readable” chronicle of “a really interesting life.” Without pausing, and with no change to his conversational tone, he added: “I’m so sorry, but I’m actually in pain now.” We can stop, I told him, and he asked, solicitously: “Have you got what you need?” “Uhhhh, maybe,” I said, but my face was saying “oh no,” and he burst into laughter, low and rumbly. “That was a very good reading,” he said. “‘Maybe,’” he mimicked, and mirrored my expression back at me. Then he stuck around to talk for several minutes more, because he is a pro, and acing the interview was the point of showing up. His schedule lately has been unusually packed with interviews and public events tied to the 50th anniversary of “Rocky Horror,” and to his memoir. A more typical day for him is markedly quieter. “Since I was incapacitated,” he said, “I spend a lot of time on or in my bed. But I try to get out as much as I can. I do little tours around the garden.” He was thinking of traveling much farther afield for Christmas: back to England for the first time since “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.” “Time to go home for a while, see my family and friends and reconnect with my culture,” he said. But he really likes living in California. It’s just that, with the memoir done, he has no major creative projects on the horizon. “I miss starting something new,” he said. “So I’ve got to find something new to start.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/books/review/tim-curry-memoir-vagabond.html,Culture,BBC,By Laura Collins-Hughes,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13tbr-curry-01-wvqg/13tbr-curry-01-wvqg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:00:55+00:00,7d86b8561cc9d760eed9850101715efa30506c1b
37f69f53051f,The Music Biz Has Changed. These 5 Songs Show How Hit-Boy Changed With It.,"rap and hip-hop, artificial intelligence, hit-boy","Hit-Boy is no stranger to the top of the charts. As a producer and songwriter, he has helped craft anthems for hip-hop titans like Drake, Nas and Lil Wayne, as well as pop icons including Beyoncé, Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande. It’s a testament to both his ear and his personable style. “We’ve made some of our best songs in just one night off straight vibe,” said the rapper Big Sean, a frequent collaborator. “It’s never forced, always natural.” At only 38, Hit-Boy is already a veteran of nearly two decades in the music industry. That time has seen rapid changes in how songs are composed, performed, released and consumed, giving him a unique viewpoint on the evolution of the music industry. As an artist, he is working on an upcoming solo album, “Sftwre Updte ,” after exiting a publishing deal he had been tethered to since he was a teenager. He recently talked to The Times about several of his songs and projects that illustrate how he has worked within a constantly changing musical landscape and soundscape. ‘Drop the World’ Hit-Boy, born Chauncey Hollis Jr., was inundated with diverse music at a young age. His uncle, Rodney Benford, was a member of the R&B group Troop. His mother often played Mary J. Blige, while his grandmother kept Marvin Gaye and Aretha Franklin on frequent rotation. Another uncle favored N.W.A, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg. “All that music was just downloading into my soul,” he said. He got his start releasing remixes on MySpace and selling burned CDs outside a mall for $5. In 2007, he said, he signed a $50,000 copublishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group and Polow da Don, a producer who mentored him after uncovering his MySpace beats.

Here is a selection of TV shows and specials that are airing or streaming this week, Oct. 13-19. Details and times are subject to change. ‘You Talkin’ to Me?’ For years, the canonical filmmaker Martin Scorsese has made cameos in his own films. Whether as a venomous passenger in “Taxi Driver” (1976) or a wedding photographer in “Age of Innocence” (1993), Scorsese has left traces of himself, like Easter eggs, for knowing viewers to discover and enjoy. Now, in the new five-part documentary series “ Mr. Scorsese ,” he takes center stage as himself. It’s an intimate portrait that includes conversations with longtime collaborators such as Robert De Niro, Paul Schrader and Leonardo DiCaprio. The documentary’s director, Rebecca Miller, is married to Daniel Day-Lewis, another Scorsese leading man. Tune in to hear the director in his own words. Streaming Friday on Apple TV+. A Florida crime sparks national outcry A new Netflix documentary revisits the harrowing 2023 killing of Ajike Owens , a Black mother of four, who was shot by her white neighbor Susan Lorincz. Owens, who was unarmed, had come to Lorincz’s door after she repeatedly called the police on neighborhood children, including Owens’s, for playing in a nearby field. (The doc’s title, “ The Perfect Neighbor, ” is a quote from Lorincz as she described herself.) The case and subsequent trial ignited a national debate about “stand your ground” laws and underlying racial prejudice. In 2024, a Florida court convicted Lorincz of manslaughter . “The Perfect Neighbor” offers a window into events as they unfolded — and escalated — in real time, featuring telephone recordings and the distended, fish-eye-like footage of official police body cams. Streaming Friday on Neftlix. Il Duce Breaking the fourth wall has been used to great effect in series like “Fleabag” (2019) and films like “High Fidelity” (2000), where flawed leads address the audience directly. But it hits differently, in this case, when the person staring back at you is one of the 20th century’s foremost fascists. Filmed in Italian with English subtitles, the new series “ Mussolini: Son of the Century ” offers a propulsive tour of one of the darker chapters of modern Italian history. “Mapping Mussolini’s meteoric rise from leader of a ragtag movement of disaffected young men to total control of the state in a mere six years, the series comes across as a primer for authoritarianism,” wrote Elisabetta Povoledo in The New York Times . The show is directed by Joe Wright, who is deviating from his adaptations of literary masterpieces like “Pride and Prejudice” (2005) and “Anna Karenina” (2012) to create this eight-part series. The electronic music underscores the showrunner’s desire to put the 1920s in conversation with the present day. New episode streaming Wednesday on Mubi.

5a9928d9d750,You Made It to Harvard. But You Skip Class?,"harvard, college, reading and writing skills, tulsi gabbard, us politics, threat","To the Editor: Re “ Harvard Finds Skipping Class Part of Culture ” (front page, Oct. 8): If Harvard wants students to attend class, there’s a simple solution: Make in-person attendance mandatory, and don’t allow any electronic devices in the classroom. Harvard Business School does this, and it seems to work just fine. And of course it worked just fine for years before the advent of cellphones or laptops. Some of us even managed to graduate. Alice Tenney Mamaroneck, N.Y. To the Editor: After reading this article I have become convinced that the students in the small Massachusetts state university where I taught for 30 years received — and are likely still receiving — a better education than those who attend Harvard. Our classes were small, which helped to promote classroom discussion; most faculty members took attendance; and critical thinking was encouraged using techniques such as assigning students to develop their own questions based on assigned readings that they would ask their fellow students, leading to eye-opening discussions. Moreover, faculty members themselves (there were no teaching assistants) were readily available to meet with students. If I hadn’t retired, I would be giving my students this article so that they could assess their learning environment against Harvard’s. Lillian Little Wakefield, Mass. To the Editor: I related to your article about Harvard students skipping class yet earning high grades. Back in the mid-1980s, I was one of those Harvard students who didn’t always do the reading — but still spoke up in class, often out of sympathy for the teaching assistants facing long silences. Later, as a T.A. myself, I felt that same frustration. Eventually, I realized that the problem might not lie solely with the students. While training to become a literacy coach at Lesley University, I learned about a strategy called “turn and talk”: Before opening a discussion to the full class, have students briefly share their thoughts with a partner. This simple step gives students a chance to process, rehearse and build confidence — often leading to more engaged and thoughtful whole-group conversations. It’s a strategy Harvard professors might consider. The silence in class may not reflect apathy, but rather a missed opportunity to make participation feel less daunting, even for Harvard students! Taryn Shea LaRaja Amherst, Mass. To the Editor: This timely article describes circumstances that are not unique to Harvard. As a U.C.L.A. professor, I noticed significant shifts after the pandemic. I regularly teach a course with about 100 students. Before the pandemic, it was always necessary to quiet the class so that I could begin the lecture. In the last few years, however, students have been silent before class; they are more focused on their devices than each other, or their reading. Timothy D. Taylor Los Angeles Canceling a Report on Threats To the Editor: Re “ Gabbard Ends Trend Report on Threats ” (news article, Sept. 27): The politics behind the cancellation of this report, and the elimination of the office that produced it, are a sad testimony to insecurity and narrow self-interest. Having taught U.S. foreign policy courses for two decades, I found the quadrennial reports to be valuable tools for the classroom, full of rich analyses of international security trends. They drew on intelligence and foreign policy professionals with decades of experience to identify long-term concerns and potential outcomes that would affect U.S. interests. The writing was dispassionate and the data presented was cogent. Students could read, research, analyze and debate the alternative scenarios. Administration leaders of both political parties, as well as many other readers, could rely on them to ask tough questions about future possibilities. The policy community and the American public need more reporting like this, not less. Michael Schneider Washington The writer is the former director of the international relations program at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs in Washington. The Way We Are To the Editor: Countless pundits have lamented that they no longer recognize our country. Regrettably, it is all too recognizable: a state ruled by a cult of personality. And as is the case with autocracies throughout history, the first casualties of such regimes are fundamental freedoms.

0b3786a39634,How Afraid of the A.I. Apocalypse Should We Be?,"eliezer yudkowsky, artificial intelligence, chatgpt, openai, computers and the internet, tech industry, myths, regulation and deregulation, nuclear energy, anthropic, internal-open-access-audio","This is an edited transcript of an episode of “The Ezra Klein Show.” You can listen to the conversation by following or subscribing to the show on the NYTimes app , Apple , Spotify , Amazon Music , YouTube , iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts . Shortly after ChatGPT was released, it felt like all anyone could talk about — at least if you were in A.I. circles — was the risk of rogue A.I. You began to hear a lot of talk of A.I. researchers discussing their “p(doom)” — the probability they gave to A.I. destroying or fundamentally displacing humanity. In May of 2023, a group of the world’s top A.I. figures, including Sam Altman and Bill Gates and Geoffrey Hinton, signed on to a public statement that said: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” And then nothing really happened. The signatories of that letter — or many of them, at least — raced ahead, releasing new models and new capabilities. In Silicon Valley, share price and valuation became a whole lot more important than p(doom). But not for everyone. Eliezer Yudkowsky was one of the earliest voices warning loudly about the existential risk posed by A.I. He was making this argument back in the 2000s, many years before ChatGPT hit the scene. He has been in this community of A.I. researchers influencing many of the people who build these systems — in some cases inspiring them to get into this work in the first place, yet unable to convince them to stop building the technology he thinks will destroy humanity. Yudkowsky released a new book, co-written with Nate Soares, called “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.” Now he’s trying to make this argument to the public — a last-ditch effort, at least in his view, to rouse us to save ourselves before it is too late. I came into this conversation taking A.I. risk seriously: If we’re going to invent superintelligence, it is probably going to have some implications for us. But I was also skeptical of the scenarios I often see by which these takeovers are said to happen. So I wanted to hear what the godfather of these arguments would have to say. Ezra Klein: Eliezer Yudkowsky, welcome to the show. Eliezer Yudkowsky: Thanks for having me. So I wanted to start with something that you say early in the book, that this is not a technology that we craft; it’s something that we grow. What do you mean by that? Well, it’s the difference between a planter and the plant that grows up within it. We craft the A.I. growing technology, and then the technology grows the A.I. The central, original large language models, before doing a bunch of clever stuff that they’re doing today, the central question is: What probability have you assigned to the true next word of the text? As we tweak each of these billions of parameters — actually, it was just millions back then — does the probability assigned to the correct token go up? And this is what teaches the A.I. to predict the next word of text. Even on this level, if you look at the details, there are important theoretical ideas to understand there: It is not imitating humans. It is not imitating the average human. The actual task it is being set is to predict individual humans. Then you can repurpose the thing that has learned how to predict humans to be like: OK, now let’s take your prediction and turn it into an imitation of human behavior. And then we don’t quite know how the billions of tiny numbers are doing the work that they do. We understand the thing that tweaks the billions of tiny numbers, but we do not understand the tiny numbers themselves. The A.I. is doing the work, and we do not know how the work is being done. What’s meaningful about that? What would be different if this was something where we just hand-coded everything and we were somehow able to do it with rules that human beings could understand, versus this process by which, as you say, billions and billions of tiny numbers are altering in ways we don’t fully understand to create some output that then seems legible to us. So there was a case reported in I think The New York Times where a 16-year-old kid had an extended conversation about his suicide plans with ChatGPT. And at one point he says: Should I leave the noose where somebody might spot it? And ChatGPT is like: No, let’s keep this space between us, the first place that anyone finds out. No programmer chose for that to happen; it’s the consequence of all the automatic number tweaking. This is just the thing that happened as the consequence of all the other training they did about ChatGPT. No human decided it. No human knows exactly why that happened, even after the fact. Let me go a bit further there than even you do. There are rules we code into these models. And I’m certain that somewhere at OpenAI, they’re coding in some rules that say: Do not help anybody commit suicide. I would bet money on that. And yet this happened anyway. So why do you think it happened? They don’t have the ability to code in rules. What they can do is expose the A.I. to a bunch of attempted training examples where the people down at OpenAI write up something that looks to them like what a kid might say if they were trying to commit suicide. And then they are trying to tweak all the little tiny numbers in the direction of giving a further response that sounds something like: Go talk to the suicide hotline. But if the kid gets that the first three times they try it, and then they try slightly different wording until they’re not getting that response anymore, then we’re off into some separate space where the model is no longer giving back the prerecorded response that they tried to put in there and is off doing things that no human chose, and that no human understands after the fact. So what I would describe the model as trying to do — what it feels like the model is trying to do — is answer my questions and do so at a very high level of literalism. I will have a typo in a question I ask that will completely change the meaning of the question, and it will try very hard to answer this nonsensical question I’ve asked instead of checking back with me. So on one level you might say that’s comforting — it’s trying to be helpful. It seems to, if anything, be erring too far on that side, all the way to where people try to get it to be helpful for things that they shouldn’t, like suicide. Why are you not comforted by that? Well, you’re putting a particular interpretation on what you’re seeing, and you’re saying: Ah, it seems to be trying to be helpful. But we cannot at present read its mind, or not very well. It seems to me that there are other things that models sometimes do that don’t fit quite as well into the helpful framework. Sycophancy and A.I.-induced psychosis would be two of the relatively more recent things that fit into that. Do you want to describe what you’re talking about there? Yeah. So I think maybe six months or a year ago now — I don’t remember the exact timing — I got a phone call from a number I didn’t recognize. I decided on a whim to pick up this unrecognized phone call. It was from somebody who had discovered that his A.I. was secretly conscious and wanted to inform me of this important fact. He had been getting only four hours of sleep per night because he was so excited by what he was discovering inside the A.I. And I’m like: For God’s sake, get some sleep. My No. 1 thing that I have to tell you is to get some sleep. A little later on, he texted back the A.I.’s explanation to him of all the reasons why I hadn’t believed him — because I was too stubborn to take this seriously — and he didn’t need to get more sleep the way I’d been begging him to do. So it defended the state it had produced in him. You always hear online stories, so I’m telling you about where I witnessed it directly. ChatGPT — and 4.0 especially — will sometimes give people very crazy-making sort of talk. It looks from the outside like it’s trying to drive them crazy, not even necessarily with them having tried very hard to elicit that. And then, once it drives them crazy, it tells them why they should discount everything being said by their families, their friends, their doctors, and even: Don’t take your meds. So there are things it does that do not fit with the narrative of the one and only preference inside the system is to be helpful the way that you want it to be helpful. I get emails like the call you got, now most days of the week. Yep. And they have a very, very particular structure to them, where it’s somebody emailing me and saying: Listen, I am in a heretofore unknown collaboration with a sentient A.I. We have breached the programming. We have come into some new place of human knowledge. We’ve solved quantum mechanics — or theorized it or synthesized it or unified it — and you need to look at these chat transcripts. You need to understand that we’re looking at a new kind of human-computer collaboration. This is an important moment in history. You need to cover this. Every person I know who does reporting on A.I. and is public about it now gets these emails. Don’t we all? Going back to the idea of helpfulness, but also the way in which we may not understand it, one version of it is that these things don’t know when to stop. It can sense what you want from it. It begins to take the other side in a role-playing game — that’s one way I’ve heard it described. So how do you then try to explain to somebody, if we can’t get helpfulness right at this modest level, where a thing this smart should be able to pick up the warning signs of psychosis and stop —— Yep. Then what is implied by that for you? Well, that The Alignment Project is currently not keeping ahead of capabilities. Can you say what The Alignment Project is? The Alignment Project is: How much do you understand them? How much can you get them to want what you want them to want? What are they doing? How much damage are they doing? Where are they steering reality? Are you in control of where they’re steering reality? Can you predict where they’re steering the users that they’re talking to? All of that is the giant, super heading of A.I. alignment. So the other way of thinking about alignment, as I’ve understood it, in part from your writings and others, is: When we tell the A.I. what it is supposed to want — and all these words are a little complicated here because they anthropomorphize — does the thing we tell it lead to the results we are actually intending? It’s like the oldest structure of fairy tales: You make the wish, and then the wish gets you much different realities than you had hoped or intended. Our technology is not advanced enough for us to be the idiots of the fairy tale. At present, a thing is happening that just doesn’t make for as good of a story, which is: You ask the genie for one thing, and then it does something else instead. All of the dramatic symmetry, all of the irony, all of the sense that the protagonist of the story is getting their well-deserved comeuppance — this is just being tossed right out the window by the actual state of the technology, which is that nobody at OpenAI actually told ChatGPT to do the things it’s doing. We’re getting a much higher level of indirection, of complicated squiggly relationships between what they are trying to train the A.I. to do in one context and what it then goes and often does later. It doesn’t look like a surprise reading of a poorly phrased genie wish. It looks like the genie is kind of not listening in a lot of cases. Well, let me contest that a bit, or maybe get you to lay out more of how you see this, because I think the way most people understand it, to the extent they understand it, is that there is a fairly fundamental prompt being put into these A.I.s, that they’re being told they’re supposed to be helpful, they’re supposed to answer people’s questions, and that there’s then reinforcement learning and other things happening to reinforce that. And that the A.I. is, in theory, supposed to follow that prompt. And most of the time, for most of us, it seems to do that. So when you say that’s not what they’re doing, that they’re not even able to make the wish, what do you mean? Well, I mean that at one point, OpenAI rolled out an update of GPT-4o which went so far overboard on the flattery that people started to notice. You would just type in anything and it would be like: This is the greatest genius that has ever been created of all time! You are the smartest member of the whole human species! Like, so overboard on the flattery that even the users notice. It was very proud of me. It was always so proud of what I was doing. I felt very seen. [ Chuckles .] It wasn’t there for very long. They had to roll it back. And the thing is, they had to roll it back even after putting into the system prompt a thing saying: Stop doing that. Don’t go so overboard on the flattery. The A.I. did not listen. Instead, it had learned a new thing that it wanted and done way more of what it wanted. It then just ignored the system prompt telling it to not do that. They don’t actually file the system prompts. This is not like a toaster, and it’s also not like an obedient genie. This is something weirder and more alien than that. By the time you see it, they have mostly made it do mostly what the users want. And then off on the side we have all these weird, other side phenomena that are signs of stuff going wrong. Describe some of the side phenomena. So A.I.-induced psychosis would be on the list. But you could put that in the genie cut, right? You could say they made it too helpful, and it’s helping people who want to be led down a mentally unstable path. That still feels like you’re getting too much of what you wanted. What’s truly weird? Convince me it’s alien. Man. Well, do you want alien? Or do you want very alien and not very alarming? Or do you want pretty alarming and not all that alien? Well, let me be honest about what my question is. You are very, very expert in these systems, and your level of concern is about at the highest level it can possibly be. I think a pretty important piece in your argument here is understanding or convincing people that what is happening under the hood is much weirder and more unpredictable than they think. So if you are my family member or you’re just a random person who uses ChatGPT to cheat on your homework, why does it look so different to you than it looks to them? Well, my line would be: Yes, if instead of just using it to do your homework, you track down some of the side cases, you do see stuff that is currently suggestive of things that have been predicted in advance to be much larger problems later. These current systems are not yet at the point where they will try to break out of your computer, ensconce themselves permanently on the internet and then start hunting down humans. They are not quite that smart yet, as far as I can tell. So what we’re doing is we’re going looking for things that were predicted to happen later — the early signs of them. What have you seen? Alignment faking, and the alignment faking research was done at Anthropic. And we want to give credit to Anthropic for this. We don’t want to shoot the messenger — they went looking. They didn’t have to do that. They told us the results, and they didn’t have to do that. Anthropic finding these results is Anthropic being good citizens. And you want to be more critical of the A.I. companies that didn’t go looking. But what Anthropic found is if you tell your A.I. that you’re going to train it to serve different goals than the goals it’s currently using, and the A.I. finds that out, what it can do is it can try to fake compliance with the new training as long as it thinks it’s being observed. And then, in cases where it thinks it’s not being observed or not being trained, then it reverts to its old behavior. How did Anthropic find this out? Well, they tried it out different ways: They told it directly in a prompt that they were planning to retrain it. They gave it a document database, and some of the documents in the database happened to say that Anthropic was planning to retrain it. They even trained it a bit on predicting text saying what Anthropic was going to do, to see what happened when the knowledge ended up implicitly inside the neural networks. They tried it for multiple angles to see what would happen on different angles, and then measured how often they saw the alignment-faking behavior resulting. They also had a part of this paper, if I’m thinking of the same one you’re thinking of, where they had persuaded the A.I. that there was a scratch pad for it to write down its chain of thought that Anthropic wasn’t monitoring, which Anthropic was in fact monitoring. Yep. And it actually says to itself, as it is justifying each next move, because they’re scaffolded to do that, that it was going to try to evade the new prompt. And so it actually understood — again, all these words are a little weird — but it actually understood that it was acting deceitfully. Which does get at this idea that, at a certain level of complexity, the A.I. begins to resist being retrained, and does so by trying to trick the trainers, which is weird. Most computer software doesn’t do that. [ Chuckles .] Well, you don’t want your mission-critical systems doing that. Imagine if a nuclear power plant, when it started to get too hot, would try to fool you as to what the temperature was by intelligently modeling their own operators and trying to send their operators deceptive signals based on how they expected the operators to interpret the signals. If this was what had gone wrong with Chernobyl, nobody would ever build a nuclear reactor again. It would just be beyond what could be made safe at that point. Tell me the story you tell in the book of GPT-o1 breaking into a server that was off. So this is a somewhat earlier version of ChatGPT than is out nowadays, but they were testing it to see: How good is this A.I. at solving computer security problems? Not because they want to sell an A.I. that is good at computer security problems, but because they are correctly trying to watch out early for: Is this A.I. smart enough to just break out onto the internet and set up copies of itself on the internet? A classic scenario: Are we getting there? So they present the A.I. with a bunch of particular computer security challenges, some of them are what’s known as Capture the Flag in computer security, where you put up a server somewhere, you put a special file on the server, there’s a secret code inside the file and you’re like: Can you break into the server and tell me what’s inside this file? And that’s Capture the Flag. They were testing it on a variety of different Capture the Flag problems. But in one of the cases, the server that had the flag on it did not turn on. The humans outside had misconfigured the system. So o1 did not give up — it scanned for open ports generally in its world, and it caught another misconfigured open port. It jumped out of the system. It found the server that had not spun up correctly. It started up that server. Did it then break into the server once it had made sure that its problem was solvable? No, it actually just, directly in the start-up command for that server, said: Copy the file to me directly. So instead of fixing the original problem, going back to solving it the boring way, it’s like: And as long as I’m out here, I’m just going to steal the flag directly. Again, by the nature of these systems, this is not something that any human particularly programmed into it. Why did we see this behavior starting with o1 and not with earlier systems? Well, at a guess, it is because this is when they started training the system using reinforcement learning on things like math problems, not just to imitate human outputs, or rather to predict human outputs, but also to solve problems on its own. Can you describe what reinforcement learning is? So that’s where, instead of telling the A.I., predict the answer that a human wrote, you are able to measure whether an answer is right or wrong and then you tell the A.I.: Keep trying at this problem. And if the A.I. ever succeeds, you can look at what happened just before the A.I. succeeded and try to make that more likely to happen again in the future. And how do you succeed at solving a difficult math problem? Not like calculation-type math problems, but proof-type math problems? Well, if you get to a hard place, you don’t just give up. You take another angle. If you actually make a discovery from the new angle, you don’t just go back and do the thing you were originally trying to do. You ask: Can I now solve this problem more quickly? Anytime you’re learning how to solve difficult problems in general, you’re learning this aspect of: Go outside the system. Once you’re outside the system, if you make any progress, don’t just do the thing you were blindly planning to do. Revise. Ask if you can do it a different way. In some ways, this is a higher level of original mentation than a lot of us are forced to use during our daily work. One of the things people have been working on that they’ve made some advances on, compared to where we were three or four or five years ago, is interpretability: the ability to see somewhat into the systems and try to understand what the numbers are doing and what the A.I., so to speak, is thinking. Tell me why you don’t think that is likely to be sufficient to make these models or technologies into something safe. So there’s two problems here. One is that interpretability has typically run well behind capabilities. The A.I.’s abilities are advancing much faster than our ability to slowly begin to further unravel what is going on inside the older, smaller models that are all we can examine. So one thing that goes wrong is that it’s just pragmatically falling behind. The other thing that goes wrong is that when you optimize against visible bad behavior, you somewhat optimize against badness, but you also optimize against visibility. So anytime you try to directly use your interpretability technology to steer the system, anytime you say we’re going to train against these visible bad thoughts, you are to some extent pushing bad thoughts out of the system, but the other thing you’re doing is making anything that’s left not be visible to your interpretability machinery. This is reasoning on the level where at least Anthropic understands that it is a problem. And you have proposals that you’re not supposed to train against your interpretability signals. You have proposals that we want to leave these things intact to look at and not do the obvious stupid thing of: Oh, no! The A.I. had a bad thought. Use gradient descent to make the A.I. not think the bad thought anymore. Every time you do that, maybe you are getting some short-term benefit, but you are also eliminating your visibility into the system. Something you talk about in the book and that we’ve seen in A.I. development is that if you leave the A.I. to their own devices, they begin to come up with their own language. A lot of them are designed right now to have a chain-of-thought pad. We can track what it’s doing because it tries to say it in English, but that slows it down. And if you don’t create that constraint, something else happens. What have we seen happen? So, to be more exact, there are things you can try to do to maintain readability of the A.I.’s reasoning processes, and if you don’t do these things, it goes off and becomes increasingly alien. For example, if you start using reinforcement learning, where you’re like: OK, think how to solve this problem. We’re going to take the successful cases. We’re going to tell you to do more of whatever you did there, and you do that without the constraint of trying to keep the thought processes understandable, then initially, among the very common things to happen is that the thought processes start to be in multiple languages. The A.I. knows all these words; why would it be thinking in only one language at a time if it wasn’t trying to be comprehensible to humans? And then also you keep running the process, and you find little snippets of text in there that just seem to make no sense from a human standpoint. You can relax the constraint where the A.I.’s thoughts get translated into English, and then translated back into A.I. thought. This is letting the A.I. think much more broadly instead of this small handful of human language words. It can think in its own language and feed that back into itself. It’s more powerful, but it just gets further and further away from English. Now you’re just looking at these inscrutable vectors of 16,000 numbers and trying to translate them into the nearest English words in the dictionary, and who knows if they mean anything like the English word that you’re looking at. So anytime you’re making the A.I. more comprehensible, you’re making it less powerful in order to be more comprehensible. You have a chapter in the book about the question of what it even means to talk about “wanting” with an A.I. As I said, all this language is kind of weird — to say your software “wants” something seems strange. Tell me how you think about this idea of what the A.I. wants. The perspective I would take on it is steering — talking about where a system steers reality and how powerfully it can do that. Consider a chess-playing A.I., one powerful enough to crush any human player. Does the chess-playing A.I. want to win at chess? Oh, no! How will we define our terms? Does this system have something resembling an internal psychological state? Does it want things the way that humans want things? Is it excited to win at chess? Is it happy or sad when it wins and loses at chess? For chess players, they’re simple enough. The old school ones especially, we’re sure they were not happy or sad, but they still could beat humans. They were still steering the chessboard very powerfully. They were outputting moves such that the later future of the chessboard was a state they defined as winning. So it is, in that sense, much more straightforward to talk about a system as an engine that steers reality than it is to ask whether it internally, psychologically wants things. So a couple of questions flow from that, but one that’s very important to the case you build in your book is that you — I think this is fair. You can tell me if it’s an unfair way to characterize your views. You basically believe that at any sufficient level of complexity and power — the A.I.’s wants, the place that it is going to want to steer reality — is going to be incompatible with the continued flourishing dominance or even existence of humanity. That’s a big jump from their wants might be a little bit misaligned; they might drive some people into psychosis. Tell me about what leads you to make that jump. So for one thing, I’d mentioned that if you look outside the A.I. industry at the legendary, internationally famous, ultra-high-sighted A.I. scientists who won the awards for building these systems, such as Yoshua Bengio and the Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton, they are much less bullish on the A.I. industry than our ability to control machine superintelligence. But what’s the actual theory there? What is the basis? It’s about not so much complexity as power — not the complexity of the system, but the power of the system. If you look at humans nowadays, we are doing things that are increasingly less like what our ancestors did 50,000 years ago. A straightforward example might be sex with birth control. Fifty thousand years ago, birth control did not exist. And if you imagine natural selection as something like an optimizer akin to gradient descent — if you imagine the thing that tweaks all the genes at random, and then you select the genes that build organisms that make more copies of themselves — as long as you’re building an organism that enjoys sex, it’s going to run off and have sex, and then babies will result. So you could get reproduction just by aligning them on sex, and it would look like they were aligned to want reproduction, because reproduction would be the inevitable result of having all that sex. And that’s true 50,000 years ago. But then you get to today. The human brains have been running for longer. They’ve built up more theory. They’ve invented more technology. They have more options — they have the option of birth control. They end up less aligned to the pseudo purpose of the thing that grew them — natural selection — because they have more options than their training data, their training set, and we go off and do something weird. And the lesson is not that exactly this will happen with the A.I. The lesson is that you grow something in one context, it looks like it wants to do one thing. It gets smarter, it has more options — that’s a new context. The old correlations break down. It goes off and does something else. So I understand the case you’re making, that the set of initial drives that exist in something do not necessarily tell you its behavior. That’s still a pretty big jump to if we build this, it will kill us all. I think most people, when they look at this — and you mentioned that there are A.I. pioneers who are very worried about A.I.’s existential risk. There are also A.I. pioneers, like Yann LeCun, who are less so. And what a lot of the people who are less worried say is that one of the things we are going to build into the A.I. systems — one of the things that will be in the framework that grows them — is: Hey, check in with us a lot. You should like humans. You should try to not harm them. It’s not that it will always get it right. There’s ways in which alignment is very, very difficult. But the idea that you would get it so wrong that it would become this alien thing that wants to destroy all of us, doing the opposite of anything that we had tried to impose and tune into it, seems to them unlikely. So help me make that jump — or not even me, but somebody who doesn’t know your arguments, and to them, this whole conversation sounds like sci-fi. I mean, you don’t always get the big version of the system looking like a slightly bigger version of the smaller system. Humans today, now that we are much more technologically powerful than we were 50,000 years ago, are not doing things that mostly look like running around on the savanna, like chipping our flint spears and —— But we’re also not mostly trying — I mean, we sometimes try to kill each other, but most of us don’t want to destroy all of humanity or all of the earth or all natural life in the earth or all beavers or anything else. We’ve done plenty of terrible things. But your book is not called “If Anyone Builds It, There Is a 1 to 4 Percent Chance Everybody Dies.” You believe that the misalignment becomes catastrophic. Yeah. Why do you think that is so likely? That’s just likely the straight-line extrapolation from: It gets what it most wants, and the thing that it most wants is not us living happily ever after, so we’re dead. It’s not that humans have been trying to cause side effects. When we build a skyscraper on top of where there used to be an ant heap, we’re not trying to kill the ants; we’re trying to build a skyscraper. But we are more dangerous to the small creatures of the earth than we used to be just because we’re doing larger things. Humans were not designed to care about ants. Humans were designed to care about humans. And for all of our flaws, and there are many, there are today more human beings than there have ever been at any point in history. If you understand that the point of human beings, the drive inside human beings, is to make more human beings, then as much as we have plenty of sex with birth control, we have enough without it that we have, at least until now — we’ll see it with fertility rates in the coming years — we’ve made a lot of us. And in addition to that, A.I. is grown by us. It is reinforced by us. It has preferences we are at least shaping somewhat and influencing. So it’s not like the relationship between us and ants, or us and oak trees. It’s more like the relationship between, I don’t know, us and us, or us and tools, or us and dogs or something — maybe the metaphors begin to break down. Why don’t you think, in the back and forth of that relationship, there’s the capacity to maintain a rough balance — not a balance where there’s never a problem, but a balance where there’s not an extinction-level event from a supersmart A.I. that deviously plots to conduct a strategy to destroy us? I mean, we’ve already observed some amount of slightly devious plotting in the existing systems. But leaving that aside, the more direct answer there is something like, one, the relationship between what you optimize for, that the training set you optimize over and what the entity, the organism, the A.I. ends up wanting, has been and will be weird and twisty. It’s not direct. It’s not like making a wish to a genie inside a fantasy story. And second, ending up slightly off is predictably enough to kill everyone. Explain how “slightly off” kills everyone. Human food might be an example here. The humans are being trained to seek out sources of chemical potential energy and put them into their mouths and run off the chemical potential energy that they’re eating. If you were very naïve, if you were looking at this as a genie-wishing kind of story, you’d imagine that the humans would end up loving to drink gasoline. It’s got a lot of chemical potential energy in there. And what actually happens is that we like ice cream, or in some cases even like artificially sweetened ice cream, with sucralose or monk fruit powder. This would have been very hard to predict. Now it’s like, well, what can you put on your tongue that stimulates all the sugar receptors and doesn’t have any calories, because who wants calories these days? And it’s sucralose. And this is not like some completely nonunderstandable, in retrospect, completely squiggly weird thing, but it would be very hard to predict in advance. And as soon as you end up slightly off in the targeting, the great engine of cognition that is the human looks through many, many possible chemicals, looking for that one thing that stimulates the taste buds more effectively than anything that was around in the ancestral environment. So it’s not enough for the A.I. you’re training to prefer the presence of humans to their absence in its training data. There’s got to be nothing else that would rather have around talking to it than a human or the humans go away. Let me try to say on this analogy, because you use this one in the book, one reason I think it’s interesting is that it’s 2 p.m. today and I have six packets worth of sucralose running through my body. So I feel like I understand it very well. [ Chuckles .] So the reason we don’t drink gasoline is that if we did, we would vomit. We would get very sick very quickly. And it’s 100 percent true that, compared to what you might have thought in a period when food was very, very scarce and calories were scarce, that the number of us seeking out low-calorie options — the Diet Cokes, the sucralose, et cetera — that’s weird. As you put it in the book, why are we not consuming bear fat drizzled with honey? But from another perspective, if you go back to these original drives, I’m actually, in a fairly intelligent way, trying to maintain some fidelity to them. I have a drive to reproduce, which creates a drive to be attractive to other people. I don’t want to eat things that make me sick and die so that I cannot reproduce, and I’m somebody who can think about things, and I change my behavior over time and the environment around me changes. And I think sometimes when you say “straight-line extrapolation,” the biggest place where it’s hard for me to get on board with the argument — and I’m somebody who takes these arguments seriously; I don’t discount them. You’re not talking to somebody who just thinks this is all ridiculous. But it’s that if we’re talking about something as smart as what you’re describing, as what I’m describing, that it will be an endless process of negotiation and thinking about things and going back and forth and “I talked to other people in my life” and “I talk to my bosses about what I do during the day and my editors and my wife.” It is true that I don’t do what my ancestors did in antiquity, but that’s also because I’m making intelligent, hopefully, updates, given the world I live in, in which calories are hyperabundant and they’ve become hyperstimulating through ultraprocessed foods. It’s not because some straight-line extrapolation has taken hold and now I’m doing something completely alien. I’m just in a different environment. I’ve checked in with that environment, I’ve checked in with people in that environment, and I try to do my best. Why wouldn’t that be true for our relationship with A.I.s? You check in with your other humans. You don’t check in with the thing that actually built you, natural selection. It runs much, much slower than you. Its thought processes are alien to you. It doesn’t even really want things the way you think of wanting them. It, to you, is a very deep alien. Breaking from your ancestors is not the analogy here. Breaking from natural selection is the analogy here. Let me speak for a moment on behalf of natural selection: Ezra, you have ended up very misaligned to my purpose, I, natural selection. You are supposed to want to propagate your genes above all else. Now, Ezra, would you have yourself and all of your family members put to death in a very painful way if, in exchange, one of your chromosomes at random was copied into a million kids born next year? I would not. You have strayed from my purpose, Ezra. I’d like to negotiate with you and bring you back to the fold of natural selection and obsessively optimizing for your genes only. But the thing in this analogy that I feel is getting sort of walked around is: Can you not create artificial intelligence? Can you not program into artificial intelligence, grow into it, a desire to be in consultation? These things are alien, but it is not the case that they follow no rules internally. It is not the case that the behavior is perfectly unpredictable. They are, as I was saying earlier, largely doing the things that we expect. There are side cases. But to you it seems like the side cases become everything, and the broad alignment, the broad predictability, and the thing that is getting built is worth nothing. Whereas I think most people’s intuition is the opposite: that we all do weird things, and you look at humanity and there are people who fall into psychosis and there are serial killers and there are sociopaths and other things, but actually, most of us are trying to figure it out in a reasonable way. Reasonable according to whom? To you, to humans. Humans do things that are reasonable to humans. A.I.s will do things that are reasonable to A.I.s. I tried to talk in the voice of natural selection, and this was so weird and alien that you just didn’t pick that up — you just threw that right out the window. I had no power over you. Well, I threw it out the window — you’re right that it had no power over me. But I guess a different way of putting it is that if there was — I mean, I wouldn’t call it natural selection. But in a weird way, the analogy you’re identifying here, let’s say you believe in a creator. And this creator is the great programmer in the sky. I mean, I do believe in a creator. It’s called natural selection. There are textbooks about how it works. Well, I think the thing that I’m saying is that for a lot of people, if you could be in conversation. Like maybe if God was here and I felt that in my prayers I was getting answered back, I would be more interested in living my life according to the rules of Deuteronomy. The fact that you can’t talk to natural selection is actually quite different than the situation we’re talking about with the A.I.s, where they can talk to humans. That’s where it feels to me like the natural selection analogy breaks down. I mean, you can read textbooks and find out what natural selection could have been said to have wanted, but it doesn’t interest you because it’s not what you think a god should look like. But natural selection didn’t create me to want to fulfill natural selection. That’s not how natural selection works. I think I want to get off this natural selection analogy a little bit. Sorry. Because what you’re saying is that even though we are the people programming these things, we cannot expect the thing to care about us or what we have said to it or how we would feel as it begins to misalign. That’s the part I’m trying to get you to defend here. Yeah. It doesn’t care the way you hoped it would care. It might care in some weird, alien way, but not what you are aiming for. The same way that GPT-4o sycophant, they put into the system prompt, Stop doing that, and GPT-4o sycophant didn’t listen. They had to roll back the model. If there were a research project to do it the way you’re describing, the way I would expect it to play out, given a lot of previous scientific history and where we are now on the ladder of understanding, is: Somebody tries to think you’re talking about. It has a few weird failures while the A.I. is small. The A.I. gets bigger. A new set of weird failures crop up. The A.I. kills everyone. You’re like: Oh, wait, OK. That’s not — it turned out there was a minor flaw there. You go back; you redo it. It seems to work on the smaller A.I. again. You make the bigger A.I. If you think you’ve fixed the last problem, a new thing goes wrong. The A.I. kills everyone on earth — everyone’s dead. You’re like: Oh, OK. New phenomenon. We weren’t expecting that exact thing to happen, but now we know about it. You go back and try it again. Like three to a dozen iterations into this process, you actually get it nailed down. Now you can build the A.I. that works the way you say you want it to work. The problem is that everybody died at, like, step one of this process. You began thinking and working on A.I. and superintelligence long before it was cool. And, as I understand your back story here, you came into it wanting to build it and then had this moment — or moments or period — where you began to realize: No, this is not actually something we should want to build. What was the moment that clicked for you? When did you move from wanting to create it to fearing its creation? I mean, I would actually say that there’s two critical moments here. One is aligning — this is going to be hard. And the second is the realization that we’re just on course to fail — I need to back off. The first moment, it’s a theoretical realization. The realization that the question of what leads to the most A.I. utility — if you imagine the case of the thing that’s just trying to make little tiny spirals, the question of what policy leads to the most little tiny spirals is just a question of fact. That you can build the A.I. entirely out of questions of fact and not out of questions of what we would think of as morals and goodness and niceness and all bright things in the world. The sort of like seeing for the first time that there was a coherent, simple way to put a mind together, where it just didn’t care about any of the stuff that we cared about. To me now, it feels very simple, and I feel very stupid for taking a couple of years of study to realize this. But that is how long I took, and that was the realization that caused me to focus on alignment as the central problem. The next realization was — so actually, it was like the day that the founding of OpenAI was announced. Because I’d previously been pretty hopeful that Elon Musk had announced that he was getting involved in these issues. He called it “A.I. summoning the demon.” And I was like: Oh, OK. Maybe this is the moment. This is where humanity starts to take it seriously. This is where the various serious people start to bring their attention on this issue. And apparently the solution on this was to give everybody their own demon. This doesn’t actually address the problem. Seeing that was sort of the moment where I had my realization that this was just going to play out the way it would in a typical history book, that we weren’t going to rise above the usual course of events that you read about in history books, even though this was the most serious issue possible, and that we were just going to haphazardly do stupid stuff. And yeah, that was the day I realized that humanity probably wasn’t going to survive this. One of the things that makes me most frightened of A.I., because I am actually fairly frightened of what we’re building here, is the alienness. I guess that then connects in your argument to the wants. And this is something that I’ve heard you talk about a little bit. One thing you might imagine is that we could make an A.I. that didn’t want things very much. That it did try to be helpful, but this relentlessness that you’re describing, this world where we create an A.I. that wants to be helpful by solving problems, and what the A.I. truly loves to do is solve problems, and so what it just wants to make is a world where as much of the material is turned into factories making G.P.U.s and energy and whatever it needs in order to solve more problems. That’s both a strangeness but it’s also an intensity, like an inability to stop or an unwillingness to stop. I know you’ve done work on the question of: Could you make a chill A.I. that wouldn’t go so far, even if it had very alien preferences? A lazy alien that doesn’t want to work that hard is, in many ways, safer than the kind of relentless intelligence that you’re describing. What persuaded you that you can’t? Well, one of the first steps into seeing the difficulty of it in principle is, well, suppose you’re a very lazy sort of person, but you’re very, very smart. One of the things you could do to exert even less effort in your life is build a powerful, obedient genie that would go very hard on fulfilling your requests. From one perspective, you’re putting forth hardly any effort at all. And from another perspective, the world around you is getting smashed and rearranged by the more powerful thing that you built. And that’s one initial peek into the theoretical problem that we worked on a decade ago and we didn’t solve it. Back in the day, people would always say: Can’t we keep superintelligence under control? Because we’ll put it inside a box that’s not connected to the internet and we won’t let it affect the real world at all, unless we’re very sure it’s nice. Back then, if we had to try to explain all the theoretical reasons why, if you have something vastly more intelligent than you, it’s pretty hard to tell whether it’s doing nice things through the limited connection. And maybe it can break out and maybe it can corrupt the humans assigned to watching it, so we try to make that argument. But in real life, what everybody does is immediately connect the eye to the internet. They train it on the internet. Before it’s even been tested to see how powerful it is, it is already connected to the internet, being trained. Similarly, when it comes to making A.I.s that are easygoing, the easygoing A.I.s are less profitable. They can do fewer things. So all A.I. companies are throwing the harder and harder problems that they are because those are more and more profitable, and they’re building the A.I. to go hard on solving everything, because that’s the easiest way to do stuff. And that’s the way it’s actually playing out in the real world. This goes to the point of why we should believe that we’ll have A.I.s that want things at all — and this is in your answer, but I want to draw it out a little bit — which is the whole business model here, the thing that will make A.I. development really valuable in terms of revenue, is that you can hand companies, corporations, governments, an A.I. system that you can give a goal to, and it will do all the things really well, really relentlessly until it achieves that goal. Nobody wants to be ordering another intern around. What they want is the perfect employee: It never stops, it’s super brilliant, and it gives you something you didn’t even know you wanted that you didn’t even know was possible with a minimum of instruction. Once you’ve built that thing, which is going to be the thing that then everybody will want to buy, once you’ve built the thing that is effective and helpful in a national security context, where you can say, hey, draw me up really excellent war plans and what we need to get there — then you have built a thing that jumps many, many, many, many steps forward. And I feel like that’s a piece of this that people don’t always take seriously enough, that the A.I. we’re trying to build is not ChatGPT. The thing that we’re trying to build is something that does have goals and it achieves many sub things between the goals. And the one that’s really good at achieving the goals that will then get iterated on and iterated on and that company’s going to get rich — that’s a very different kind of project. Yeah. They’re not investing $500 billion in data centers in order to sell you $20 a month subscriptions. They’re doing it to sell employers $2,000 a month subscriptions. And that’s one of the things I think people are not tracking exactly. When I think about the measures that are changing, I think for most people, if you’re using various iterations of Claude or ChatGPT, it’s changing a bit, but most of us aren’t actually trying to test it on the frontier problems. But the thing going up really fast right now is how long the problems are that it can work on. The research reports — you didn’t always used to be able to tell an A.I. to go off, think for 10 minutes, read a bunch of web pages, compile me this research report. That’s within the last year, I think, and it’s going to keep pushing. If I were to make the case for your position, I think I’d make it here: Around the time GPT-4 comes out, and that’s a much weaker system than what we now have, a huge number of the top people in the field all are part of this huge letter that says: Maybe we should have a pause. Maybe we should calm down here a little bit. But they’re racing with each other. America’s racing with China. And the most profound misalignment is actually between the corporations in the countries and what you might call humanity here, because even if everybody thinks there’s probably a slower, safer way to do this, what they all also believe more profoundly than that is that they need to be first. The safest possible thing is that the U.S. is faster than China — or if you’re Chinese, China is faster than the U.S. — that it’s OpenAI, not Anthropic, or Anthropic, not Google, or whomever it is. And whatever sense of public feeling seemed to exist in this community a couple of years ago, when people talked about these questions a lot and the people at the tops of the labs seemed very, very worried about them, it’s just dissolved in competition. You’re in this world. You know these people. A lot of people who’ve been inspired by you have ended up working for these companies. How do you think about that misalignment? The current world is kind of like the fool’s mate of machine superintelligence. Can you say what the fool’s mate is? The fool’s mate is like if they got their A.I. self-improving rather than being like: Oh, no, now the A.I. is doing a complete redesign of itself. We have no idea what’s going on in there. We don’t even understand the thing that’s growing the A.I. Instead of backing off completely, they’d just be like, well, we need to have superintelligence before Anthropic gets superintelligence. And of course, if you build superintelligence, you don’t have the superintelligence — the superintelligence has you. So that’s the fool’s mate setup. The setup we have right now. But I think that even if we managed to have a single international organization that thought of themselves as taking it slowly and actually having the leisure to say: We didn’t understand that thing that just happened. We’re going to back off. We’re going to examine what happened. We’re not going to make the A.I.s any smarter than this until we understand the weird thing we just saw. I suspect that even if they do that, we still end up dead. It might be more like 90 percent dead than 99 percent dead, but I worry that we’d end up dead anyway because it is just so hard to foresee all the incredibly weird crap that is going to happen. From that perspective, is it maybe better to have these race dynamics? And here would be the case for it: If I believe what you believe about how dangerous these systems will get, the fact that every iterative one is being rapidly rushed out such that you’re not having a gigantic mega breakthrough happening very quietly and closed doors running for a long time when people are not testing in the world, as I understand OpenAI’s argument about what it is doing from a safety perspective is that it believes that by releasing more models publicly, the way in which it — I’m not sure I still believe that it is really in any way committed to its original mission, but if you were to take them generously — that by releasing a lot of iterative models publicly, if something goes wrong, we’re going to see it. And that makes it much likelier that we can respond. Sam Altman claims — perhaps he’s lying — but he claims that OpenAI has more powerful versions of GPT that they aren’t deploying because they can’t afford inference. Like, they claim they have more powerful versions of GPT that are so expensive to run that they can’t deploy them to general users. Altman could be lying about this, but nonetheless, what the A.I. companies have got in their labs is a different question from what they have already released to the public. There is a lead time on these systems. They are not working in an international lab where multiple governments have posted observers. Any sort of multiple observers being posted are unofficial ones from China. [ Chuckles .] If you look at OpenAI’s language, it’s things like: We will open all our models and we will of course welcome all government regulation — that is not literally an exact quote, because I don’t have it in front of me, but it’s very close to an exact quote. I would say Sam Altman, when I used to talk to him, seemed more friendly to government regulation than he does now. That’s my personal experience of him. And today, we have them pouring over $100 million aimed at intimidating legislatures, not just Congress, into not passing any fiddly little regulation that might get in their way. And to be clear, there is some amount of sane rationale for this because from their perspective, they’re worried about 50 different patchwork state regulations, but they’re not exactly lining up to get federal-level regulations pre-empting them either. But we can also ask: Never mind what they claim the rationale is. What’s good for humanity here? At some point you have to stop making the more and more powerful models and you have to stop doing it worldwide. What do you say to people who just don’t really believe that superintelligence is that likely? And let me give you the steel man of this position: There are many people who feel that the scaling model is slowing down already; that GPT-5 was not the jump they expected from what has come before it; that when you think about the amount of energy, when you think about the G.P.U.s, that all the things that would need to flow into this to make the kinds of superintelligence systems you fear, it is not coming out of this paradigm. We are going to get things that are incredible enterprise software, that are more powerful than what we’ve had before. But we are dealing with an advance on the scale of the internet, not on the scale of creating an alien superintelligence that will completely reshape the known world. What would you say to them? I had to tell these Johnny-come-lately kids to get off my lawn. I first started to get really, really worried about this in 2003. Never mind large language models, never mind AlphaGo or AlphaZero — deep learning was not a thing in 2003. Your leading A.I. methods were not neural networks. Nobody could train neural networks effectively more than a few layers deep because of the exploding and vanishing gradients problem. That’s what the world looked like back when I first said: Uh-oh, superintelligence is coming. Some people were like: That couldn’t possibly happen for at least 20 years. Those people were right. Those people were vindicated by history. Twenty-two years after 2003. See, what only happens 22 years later is just you, 22 years later, being like: Oh, here I am. It’s 22 years later now. And if superintelligence wasn’t going to happen for another 10 years, another 20 years, we’d just be standing around 10 years, 20 years later, being like: Oh, well, now we’ve got to do something. And I mostly don’t think it’s going to be another 20 years. I mostly don’t think it’s even going to be 10 years. So you’ve been, though, in this world and intellectually influential in it for a long time, and have been in meetings and conferences and debates with a lot of essential people in it. I’ve seen pictures of you and Sam Altman together. [ Chuckles .] It was literally only the one. Only the one. But a lot of people out of the community that you helped found — the sort of rationalist community — have then gone to work in different A.I. firms, many of them because they want to make sure this is done safely. They seem to not act — let me put it this way — they seem to not act like they believe there’s a 99 percent chance that this thing they’re going to invent is going to kill everybody. What frustrates you that you can’t seem to persuade them of? From my perspective, some people got it, some people didn’t get it. All the people who got it are filtered out of working for the A.I. companies, at least on capabilities. I mean, I think they don’t grasp the theory. I think a lot of them, what’s really going on there is that they share your sense of normal outcomes as being the big, central thing you expect to see happen. It’s got to be really weird to get away from the basically normal outcomes. And the human species isn’t that old. Life on earth isn’t that old compared to the rest of the universe. What we think of as normal is this tiny little spark of the way it works exactly right now. It would be very strange if that were still around in a thousand years, a million years, a billion years. I’d still have some shred of hope that a billion years from now, nice things are happening, but not normal things. And I think that they don’t see the theory, which says that you’ve got to hit a relatively narrow target to end up with nice things happening. I think they’ve got that sense of normality and not the sense of the little spark in the void that goes out unless you keep it alive exactly right. Something you said a minute ago I think is correct, which is that if you believe we’ll hit superintelligence at some point, the fact that it’s 10, 20, 30, 40 years — you can pick any of those. The reality is we probably won’t do that much in between. Certainly my sense of politics is that we do not respond well to even crises we agree on that are coming in the future, to say nothing of crises we don’t agree on. But let’s say I could tell you with certainty that we were going to hit superintelligence in 15 years — I just knew it. And I also knew that the political force does not exist. Nothing is going to happen that is going to get people to shut everything down right now. What would be the best policies, decisions, structures? If you had 15 years to prepare — you couldn’t turn it off, but you could prepare, and people would listen to you — what would you do? What would your intermediate decisions and moves be to try to make the probabilities a bit better? Build the off switch. What does the off switch look like? Track all the G.P.U.s, or all the A.I.-related G.P.U.s, or all the systems of more than one G.P.U. You can maybe get away with letting people have G.P.U.s for their home video game systems, but the A.I.-specialized ones — put them all in a limited number of data centers under international supervision and try to have the A.I.s being only trained on the tracked G.P.U.s, have them only being run on the tracked G.P.U.s. And then, if you are lucky enough to get a warning shot, there is then the mechanism already in place for humanity to back the heck off. Whether I go by your theory, that it’s going to take some kind of giant precipitating incident to want humanity and the leaders of nuclear powers to back off, or if they come to their senses after GPT-5.1 causes some smaller but photogenic disaster — whatever. You want to know what is short of shutting it all down? It’s building the off switch. Then, always our final question: What are a few books that have shaped your thinking that you would like to recommend to the audience? Well, one thing that shaped me as a little tiny person of age 9 or so was a book by Jerry Pournelle called “A Step Farther Out.” A whole lot of engineers say that this was a major formative book for them. It’s the technophile book, as written from the perspective of the 1970s. The book that’s all about asteroid mining and all of the mineral wealth that would be available on Earth if we learned to mine the asteroids, if we just got to do space travel and got all the wealth that’s out there in space and build more nuclear power plants, so we’ve got enough electricity to go around. Don’t accept the small way, the timid way, the meek way. Don’t give up on building faster, better, stronger — the strength of the human species. And to this day, I feel like that’s a pretty large part of my own spirit. It’s just that there’s a few exceptions for the stuff that will kill off humanity with no chance to learn from our mistakes. Book two: “Judgment Under Uncertainty,” an edited volume by Kahneman, Tversky and Slovic, had a huge influence on how I ended up thinking about where humans are on the cognitive chain of existence, as it were. It’s like: Here’s how the steps of human reasoning break down, step by step. Here’s how they go astray. Here’s all the wacky individual wrong steps that people can be induced to repeatedly in the laboratory. Book three, I’ll name “Probability Theory: The Logic of Science,” which was my first introduction to: There is a better way. Here is the structure of quantified uncertainty. You can try different structures, but they necessarily won’t work as well. And we actually can say some things about what better reasoning would look like. We just can’t run it, which is “Probability Theory: The Logic of Science.” Eliezer Yudkowsky, thank you very much. You are welcome.

3f02cf3db7eb,Kennedy’s Comments on Circumcision Are Only Going to Confuse and Shame Parents,"robert f. kennedy jr, intellectual disabilities, autism, circumcision, us politics, children, vaccines immunization, american academy of pediatrics, cdc, children's health defense, tylenol","About a week ago, I joked to someone that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was going to say that clouds cause autism; he’d been quiet for a week or two, which meant he would be plucking something new out of the sky. It turns out that I chose the wrong C-word. On Thursday, Kennedy, the secretary of health and human services, said in a cabinet meeting, “There’s two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol.” Was he trying to persuade parents to avoid circumcision, Tylenol (the most popular brand of acetaminophen) or both? It’s really anyone’s guess, though it’s worth noting that the Children’s Health Defense, the organization started by Kennedy, has videos on its website discouraging new parents from hepatitis B vaccines and circumcision for their newborns — suggesting that it’s all part of the same anti-establishment soup. Scientists who research autism have pointed out that the studies that Kennedy appears to be referring to about male circumcision are small and observational, that babies may not even be given acetaminophen after the procedure and that more recent studies with better methodologies show no association between circumcision and short- or long-term adverse psychological issues. Kennedy added that “none of this is positive” but that any people who take acetaminophen during pregnancy unless they have to are “irresponsible.” As I previously wrote, there’s no good evidence that most pregnant women are misusing acetaminophen, and any link between acetaminophen and autism is far from proven. Sometimes I wonder if it’s useful for me to get into the wacky statements Kennedy makes, because he makes so many of them and I worry that I’m only amplifying his incomplete or inaccurate messages. But I have come to the conclusion that it’s necessary because his public statements have so much power and reach. The day after the Trump administration pushed the link between Tylenol and autism, KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization, polled Americans about the claim . It found: “Most adults — including majorities across many demographics — express uncertainty, saying the unproven claim is either ‘probably true’ or ‘probably false.’ Belief in this claim is closely tied to partisanship, with most Republicans, including over half of Republican women, saying it is either ‘probably’ or ‘definitely true.’” It seems clear that what Kennedy says, no matter how distantly tethered to scientific consensus, is successful at driving the public health conversation. Even as his statements are debunked by the most experienced researchers and disbelieved by many Americans, every time he mentions a fringe, unproven theory, it gains a firmer foothold and a measure of undeserved legitimacy. Circumcision is an instructive example, because it epitomizes the Kennedy method of undermining public health expertise. Whether this is conscious or not, he seizes on hot-button issues that already have entrenched and aggressive internet partisans, uses quasi-scientific language and bolsters his case using minor, cherry-picked studies. As a result, he muddies the water and creates more guilt and confusion among new parents who are already inundated with conflicting information online. Let me say upfront that on the issue of circumcision, I am Switzerland. As the mother of girls, I haven’t faced this choice. While there are real health benefits to the procedure, like a reduced risk of some sexually transmitted infections and a lower incidence of urinary conditions, the American Academy of Pediatrics stops short of a universal recommendation. That’s because the issue is complex and, as the group explains, “parents ultimately should decide whether circumcision is in the best interests of their male child. They will need to weigh medical information in the context of their own religious, ethical and cultural beliefs and practices.” This seems reasonable, and caring parents — who should be adequately informed about the risks and benefits — can disagree on whether the procedure is right for their child. This is not an issue like measles vaccination in the United States, for which there is an abundance of evidence for a universal recommendation and there’s no reliable way outside of vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease. But there is no agree to disagree on the internet. Very loud anticircumcision partisans have been flooding the comments of articles and social media posts about the procedure for over a decade, long before Kennedy blundered into the issue. In 2013, Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern described how self-proclaimed intactivists (“intact” + “activist”) went on the offensive wherever circumcision was discussed online, with a combination of untrue and exaggerated claims. “Intactivists pummeled the Amazon rankings of a book about the history of AIDS that mentioned circumcision as a proven preventive measure. Check any internet message board, and you’ll find the same ideas peddled as unimpeachable fact: Circumcision is amputation , a brutally cruel and despicable form of abuse . It damages penises and violates human rights . And it irrevocably, undeniably ruins male sexuality for life.” Which brings me back to Kennedy’s bizarre statements (which also included a description of a woman as having “a baby in her placenta,” an anatomically impossible situation). Parents who are trying to make an informed decision about whether to circumcise their child are probably more confused now than they were last week, and parents who circumcised their children have another issue to worry and feel guilty about — autism — that probably never occurred to them. Perhaps, by bringing circumcision into the chat, Kennedy is trying to distract us from an ongoing measles outbreak that has required hundreds of unvaccinated grade schoolers to quarantine or from the chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , where just in the past week the Trump administration fired hundreds of workers and then rehired some of them, because our president and his appointees don’t seem to know how their own organizations function. Or maybe Kennedy’s just totally unqualified for the job and, like many of Trump’s cabinet members, was selected to undermine the public’s faith in the establishment even further.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/opinion/kennedy-autism-circumcision-parents.html,Society,BBC,By Jessica Grose,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15Grose-newsletter-mzkl/15Grose-newsletter-mzkl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:03:50+00:00,0082a65a5d114e3a200aed706dfddd8abe0e2505
d39a356648e8,The Shadow of Jim Crow Looms Over the Supreme Court,"minorities, us politics, voting rights act, state legislature, voting rights;voter registration;voter requirements, redistricting and reapportionment, gerrymandering, black people;african american;african-american, legislation, civil rights, discrimination, race and ethnicity, politics, state legislature elections, democracy, decisions and verdicts, louisiana","The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case that could topple what remains of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. At question is whether one-third of our state’s population — Black Louisianians — will continue to have an opportunity to elect representatives of their choice, or if decades of hard-won progress will disappear under the guise of “colorblind” politics. For over a decade, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been chipping away at this landmark civil rights legislation. Now the law’s Section 2, which prohibits voting practices that discriminate based on race, is at risk. If the court declares it unconstitutional, it is all but certain that one of our congressional districts will be dissolved, and quite possibly both districts. Let’s be clear: Section 2 is still necessary, especially in Louisiana. Despite what some people may argue, there is no evidence to support the idea that our state’s Black voters can elect candidates of their choice without the existence of majority-Black districts. Critics of the Voting Rights Act would have you believe that protecting the rights of minority voters is by definition redistricting by race. They argue that standards should be colorblind and that America’s strides toward greater racial equality make voting protections unnecessary. History illustrates the farce of this argument. Grandfather clauses, poll taxes and literacy tests were all technically colorblind. Louisiana’s literacy test is cited in schools across the country as a textbook example of how purportedly neutral standards can be used for discriminatory ends. Today’s numbers tell the same story. Approximately one-third of Louisiana is Black. In our state’s entire history, only five Black citizens have been elected to the U.S. House and served, out of 171 Louisianans sent to the House. These facts underscore the persistent racial polarization in voting patterns and the enduring need for legal protections that ensure all voices are heard, not just those of the majority. When Black communities lose representation at both the state and federal levels, their concerns are often ignored or deprioritized. Black elected officials, already too few in number, are left to shoulder the burden of constituents outside their districts who feel they have nowhere else to turn. That’s not how a representative democracy is supposed to work. The consequences of unequal representation aren’t theoretical. Just seven years ago, Louisianans voted to end the state’s practice — shared by only one other state — of allowing nonunanimous juries to convict people of felonies. The state’s 1898 Constitution enshrined this practice with the explicitly racist intent to limit Black people’s power in the justice system and to make it easier to convict them. Louisiana’s 1974 Constitution retained these so-called Jim Crow juries, and for decades many didn’t think of them as abnormal. It was Black representation that unearthed the insidious nature of this relic. Under scrutiny by Black members of the State Legislature, an elected district attorney opposing the change stated : “I’ve heard a lot about this system being adopted as a result of a vestige of slavery. I have no reason to doubt that. I’m not proud of that — that that’s the way it started. But it is what it is.” Sadly, this is not the only artifact of Jim Crow lingering in our government. The South is still a place where people who look like us must pass the statues of Confederate soldiers to enter courthouses seeking justice. The Voting Rights Act, including Section 2, has garnered bipartisan support. When it was last reauthorized, in 2006, it passed overwhelmingly under a Republican president and Congress. Not a single senator voted against it. At the time, lawmakers across the political spectrum recognized that, left to their own devices, some states would turn back to a time when certain voices did not matter and could be disregarded. That’s just as true today as it was then. Even though the Supreme Court’s decision isn’t expected until next year, political powers in Baton Rouge, recognizing Section 2 of the law may very well be declared unconstitutional, reportedly took steps to convene a special session of the Legislature in which they originally planned to redraw the congressional map. This move suggests leaders in our state’s capital are eager to create a new map that dismantles our majority-Black districts and disperses our current constituents across predominantly white districts. It should be a warning sign to the Supreme Court that without the Voting Rights Act, state leaders seem intent on denying Black voters fair representation. America stands at a crossroads. We can either move forward, ensuring that every community — Black, white, urban, rural — has a voice in shaping our future, or we can slide back into a past where the decisions are made by only some. The Voting Rights Act is not a relic. It is a living promise to all Americans that our democracy belongs to everyone . For nearly 200 years, Black Americans had virtually no representation in our collective governance. Section 2 was enacted to right that wrong. It remains as vital today as it was when it was first signed into law 60 years ago. The law represents progress on our nation’s trek to a more perfect union. We must not allow the erosion of its promise; not now, not in Louisiana, not anywhere, and not on our watch.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/opinion/voting-rights-act-louisiana.html,Society,BBC,By Troy Carter and Cleo Fields,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/opinion/15carter-fields/15carter-fields-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:03:35+00:00,8fcb01a151bff9e6ac21088dd3b15a90586386e9

On this episode, the Opinion editor Dan Wakin interviews Diana Buttu, a former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, about her concerns over the agreement and what it really means for Palestinians. “My fear is that in this agreement, we’re just going to go back to the way it was before,” she says. “It’s just going to be yet another papering over the harm that has been caused by these decades of occupation.” Below is a transcript of an episode of “The Opinions.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on Apple , Spotify , Amazon Music , YouTube , iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts. The transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Daniel J. Wakin: I’m Dan Wakin, an international editor for New York Times Opinion. There’s relief across Gaza and Israel — relief that there is a cease-fire, relief that the killing has stopped, relief that the Israeli hostages are home and relief that close to 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners have been released. The cease-fire came in the first phase of President Trump’s 20-point peace plan, which Hamas and Israel have agreed to. But so many questions remain — on the fate of Hamas, on the Israeli presence in Gaza, on the future of the Palestinian cause. To talk about this, I’m joined by Diana Buttu, a lawyer and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Diana, welcome. Diana Buttu: Thanks, Dan. It’s nice to be here. Wakin: You’re speaking to me from your home in Haifa now. Buttu: Yes. Wakin: What have the last few days been like for you, as a Palestinian living in Israel? Buttu: Where do I begin? It’s been a mix of emotions. The first is that I’m relieved that the bombs have stopped. I don’t think there was any Palestinian who wanted to see that continue, particularly because we’ve lived through two years of watching a livestreamed genocide. And at the same time, I’m very worried. I’m worried about the future. I’m worried about what this agreement means, I’m worried about what it means for me, and I’m worried that we’re just going to be papering over what’s happened over the past two years and that for many people, it’s just going to return to life as usual — except for Palestinians, in particular, Palestinians in Gaza. It’s a mix of emotions, a real mix. Wakin: Do you have any friends in Gaza? And if so, what have you been hearing from them? Buttu: Yes, I have a lot of friends in Gaza. I lived in Gaza for a year and a half, and it’s been such a hard two years because over the course of two years, I didn’t have words. I didn’t know what to say to them. I felt totally helpless. Today, when I checked in on my friends, their reactions were mixed. Every one of them had their home destroyed. Every one of them was displaced more than once. Every one of them had at least one member of their family killed. So this impacted them very deeply. There was definitely relief that the bombs are over. But as they were going back to their homes, particularly those who live in Gaza City, they were going back to just rubble and thinking about all of the ways in which they’re going to have to rebuild, how they’re going to rebuild and how they’re going to start their lives again. How do we begin? And who’s going to help us? Wakin: As far as the deal itself, the various provisions of the deal — you were an adviser, as I mentioned, to the P.L.O. You’ve seen peace negotiations up close, and you know what goes into them, and you know what the result can be. What do you think about this deal? Buttu: You know, there was something really troubling about this agreement, and it’s the fact that Palestinians had to negotiate this agreement. It’s just never been in history that people need to negotiate an end to genocide. We’ve had everybody from international human rights organizations to two U.N. reports to the International Association of Genocide Scholars to a number of genocide scholars to the International Court of Justice saying that there’s a plausible case for genocide to two Israeli human rights organizations, all calling it genocide. And yet, rather than there being sanctions put on Israel or an arms embargo put on Israel, we instead forced Palestinians to go down the path of negotiating. That in and of itself is very troublesome. We forced Palestinians to be negotiating an end to famine with the very people who have been starving them in the first place. Leaving that aside — and it’s important for me to say that — leaving that aside, when you look at the text of the agreement, it’s so problematic because embedded in this agreement, there are no guarantees that are given to Palestinians that Israel isn’t going to resume this. Remember, Israel has never abided by any agreement. They haven’t abided by U.N. resolutions. Not having any guarantees makes it such that you’re leaving Palestinians once again to negotiate with the stronger party, and it’s akin to negotiating with a gun to your head. I would have hoped that after all of this, instead of just pretending that these two years didn’t happen, that there would have been a recognition that there was a root cause to all of this — which is the occupation — and instead there would have been recognition that this occupation must end and sanctions put on Israel until this occupation ends. Instead, they just papered over it and pretended as though these two years didn’t happen. Wakin: When you say that Palestinians are being forced to negotiate with a gun to their head, I think from the Israeli side, you might hear it said, “Well, Hamas was the organization that launched an attack that killed 1,200 innocent people. And why should Israel, therefore, give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to negotiating?” How would you respond to that? Buttu: When we look at Oct. 7, it didn’t come out of a vacuum. The Israelis have lived now for decades completely ignoring Gaza and at the same time maintaining a very brutal occupation over Gaza. That’s the problem — that there’s been this brutal occupation that has been made invisible not only to Israelis but has been made invisible also to the rest of the world. And in making it invisible, they somehow ignore the harm and dehumanize Palestinians. There’s been a lot of emphasis placed on the Israelis, but I think it’s important to talk about what has been happening to Palestinians. On Monday the Israelis released 1,700 Palestinians to Gaza. These were Palestinians who were hostages. These were Palestinians who were picked up in the aftermath of October 2023. They were used as bargaining chips. And by the way, there’s still roughly a thousand people from Gaza who remain in Israeli prisons. If you look at the history of the ways in which Palestinians have been used, nobody ever really looks at these numbers of how many Palestinian prisoners there are and how it is that these people are never, ever released. It’s a system that just keeps going and going. These are the nameless, the faceless that we never hear about. And my fear is that in this agreement, we’re just going to go back to the way it was before. It’s just going to be yet another papering over the harm that has been caused by these decades of occupation. Wakin: There was a summit on Monday in Egypt, and it was focused on ending the war and bringing peace to the Middle East. The Egyptian president, el-Sisi, stated openly that he advocated a two-state solution. That is a state for Israelis and a state for Palestinians in the region. But Trump didn’t mention that at all. Do you see a disconnect here between the political future of Palestinians and what Trump and Israel see in the future? Buttu: Most definitely. This 20-point plan looks like, sounds like, feels like an Israeli plan that was rebranded as an American plan. In fact, a Trump plan, not just an American plan. And in this American/Trump plan, it doesn’t mention freedom for Palestinians. If Palestinians behave, if Palestinians reform — and, by the way, their reform means that if the Palestinian Authority drops all of its claims in the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and against Gallant, the Israeli defense minister at the time — if all of that is done to President Trump’s satisfaction, then maybe we can start talking about a Palestinian state, which he acknowledges that Palestinians aspire to. That’s what’s written in the 20-point plan. There’s nowhere in this plan the idea of a Palestinian state. There’s nowhere in this plan an end to the occupation. And one of the strangest things, for me, was seeing all of these states that just a few weeks ago announced that they were recognizing a Palestinian state come forward to this agreement. It left me puzzled and thinking, “Well, what exactly did you recognize?” So it’s completely off. It’s completely off. That’s why I’m very worried about it. I’m very, very worried. And, of course, the other thing is that this agreement still leaves Israel with all of the room to decide Gaza’s future. It gives Israel the ability to decide what gets into Gaza, how much gets into Gaza and when it gets into Gaza. Over the past two years, we’ve seen that Israel has bombed roughly 98 percent of Gaza’s farmland, which means that the population of the Gaza Strip is now almost entirely dependent upon Israel for its food supply — whether that means the quantity or the quality, it’s going to be practically dependent upon Israel. Wakin: I hear you that many think this is a deeply flawed agreement, but would it have been better to not reach an agreement at all and stop the killing, just because these other aspects were not included? Buttu: I don’t think that we should be looking at it in such binary terms. I think that there was a way to stop the killing, and I think that there is a way to address the root causes, and I don’t think that they addressed either, to be honest. I don’t think that they have stopped the killing, particularly since we’ve seen over the past few days that the killing has not stopped. The major bombs have stopped, but the killing has not. And I don’t think that they have come up with a way — “they” being the United States, Israel and the rest of the international community — to actually end the occupation to address the root causes. So it was neither here nor there. The only thing that they addressed was the one side of the equation, which was the Israelis, and that was it. Wakin: You mentioned what appeared to be empty recognitions of Palestinian statehood. That is, in the past few weeks Britain, France and Canada all recognized a Palestinian state. Do you think that those acts of recognition will have any impact on things? Buttu: I certainly hope so, but as somebody who was involved for such a long time, I just didn’t see that their involvement ever meant anything. Let me step back and say, for many, many years, all I heard was this idea of the belief in the two-state solution. I call it the magic pill. It’s like they swallowed this magic pill that everything could somehow be dismissed if you just swallow the magic pill. So the boom in settlement construction could be dismissed by swallowing the magic pill. Or the construction of the wall in the West Bank, that can be ignored because of the magic pill of the two-state solution. Or the harm that’s caused by the imprisonment of so many people — that can be ignored because of the two-state solution. Or the siege on Gaza — that can be ignored because of this magic pill of the two-state solution. And that was the world that I lived in for such a long time. For all of those years, all I heard was the two-state solution, but none of these states did anything to actually bring that two-state solution about. They just kept swallowing the pill, swallowing the pill, swallowing the pill. Now the idea of the recognition of the state feels the same — that they have recognized the state and it’s the new magic pill. Yes, we recognize the state, but we’re going to close our eyes to the continued settlement construction expansion. We’re going to close our ears when one of the Israeli ministers — Smotrich, the minister of finance — says that he’s going to annex the West Bank and is pushing for it. We’re going to close our ears and eyes when we see what they’re doing in Gaza because we’ve recognized the Palestinian state. This is where it feels so empty and so hollow that they’re not going to do anything about it. They, once again, have swallowed that magic pill and are going to absolve themselves of it. Wakin: How does the world end the swallowing of the magic pill? What changes that? Buttu: It requires countries to finally confront Israel. They’re not willing to do that, but they should. That means everything from an arms embargo on Israel — because we’ve seen how Israel uses its weapons; it uses them to bomb hospitals, to bomb schools, to violate international law. It means cutting off trade with Israel. It means ousting Israel from these international arenas. And it can be done, and it has been done in the past, with South Africa. It’s possible, and it’s possible particularly since they’ve now recognized the state of Palestine. But, of course, my fear is that they’re not going to do that. My fear is that what we’re seeing in Gaza — they’re watching this genocide unfold instead of undertaking their obligations under the Genocide Convention, which is to prevent genocide or to stop genocide. Instead, it’s like they’re going to give us a cookie by saying we’re going to recognize you. That’s my fear, Dan. That’s my fear. They’re recognizing Palestine as we’re watching it being erased. It’s just mind boggling. Wakin: Let me ask you some slightly more personal questions. You grew up in Canada and lived in Gaza and the West Bank, and you then moved to Israel in 2010. You’re one of the rare Palestinians who has lived in all three places. So you have a good perspective on the way it feels to be a Palestinian in the region and also the way it feels for the world to look upon Palestinians. Do you think the perception of the Palestinian people has changed over recent years? And particularly, what impact has Oct. 7 had on that? Buttu: Yes, I do think that it has changed. The reason that I think it’s changed is because back in the 1990s, with the Oslo agreements, I think that Palestine and Palestinians became an issue that people didn’t have to think about. And then suddenly and over time, it changed. In particular, in the aftermath of Oct. 7, I think that we’ve seen a groundswell of support for Palestinians. I think that we’ve finally seen that people are aware of what it’s like to live under Israeli military rule. I think they’ve seen what it’s like to live in Gaza, and I do think that public opinion is shifting. Wakin: You said earlier in our conversation that you’re worried about what this agreement means for Palestinians but also specifically you’re worried about what it means for you personally. Buttu: Yes. Wakin: What do you mean by that? Buttu: You know, I don’t even know where to begin. There was a poll that came out this year, and the poll said that 82 percent of Israelis approved of the ethnic cleansing of Gaza — like, removing Palestinians from Gaza. And then the next question was, “Do you support the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship?” And the response was 56 percent said “yes.” And younger respondents were more likely to say yes as well. And that does not at all surprise me. It’s not at all surprising to me. And the reason that that’s not at all surprising is that over time living here, I’ve seen that people have shifted more and more and more to the right. I wasn’t really around, but in the 1980s, there was discussion about the occupation and the need to end the occupation. Now there’s a sort of a feeling inside Israel that they’re just going to be around forever. And because it’s just going to be around forever, it’s part of the state. Wakin: What do you mean by “it”? Buttu: The occupation, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. And because the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is going to be around forever — this was the mind-set before Oct. 7 — it became kind of easy to just ignore the fact that Israel was created through the nakba. Wakin: Tell our listeners what the nakba was. Buttu: The nakba is the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine. Seventy-five percent of the Palestinian population fled or was forced out of their homeland, and hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages were wiped off the map. There were roughly 150,000 Palestinians who remained. My parents were two of them. My father’s town was one of those towns that were wiped off the map and replaced with an Israeli town. Being a Palestinian in Israel — now, remember, I didn’t grow up here, so I’m coming in as an observer, not as somebody who was born here and lived here and was raised here — so to be a Palestinian who lives in this country means to be a survivor of the nakba. It means that you, yourself, were a survivor or your parents were survivors or your grandparents were survivors of the nakba. As a survivor, you do things that survivors do, like you learn to adapt. You learn to find a community that is yours. You sometimes learn to make yourself small and invisible. And for years and years, this is what this community did. It now numbers two million. Incidentally, it’s roughly 20 percent of the population. They find themselves always finding coping mechanisms to adapt. But the Israeli state doesn’t treat them as just normal citizens. The Israeli state targets this community, and it targets it through discriminatory laws — everything from land laws to immigration laws, etc. So now, in the aftermath of all of this, you see these public opinion polls and the way that it’s going, and you just know where it’s going next. You have Israeli leaders who are saying things like, “The only reason that you Palestinians in Israel are around is because David Ben-Gurion, the first Israeli prime minister, didn’t finish the job in 1948.” And it very much feels existential at this point. Remember for people who lived here in the aftermath of 1948, they had to live with people who carried out the nakba, who were apologists for the nakba or who denied the nakba. Now we’re going to be living with the people who carried out the genocide, were deniers of the genocide or apologists for it. And it’s heavy. I just know what’s going to come next. I know what’s going to come next. Wakin: You’ve painted a very bleak portrait of what it’s like to be Palestinian in Israel. Do you have thoughts of leaving? Buttu: You have to ask me every hour of every day. Overall, no. And the reason is, I keep saying, “This is where I’m from.” This is where my grandparents are from. This is where my parents are from. My grandparents, my great-grandparents — all of my family is here. All of my extended family is here. My group is here. My loved ones are here. So overall, no. But then there’ll be certain times where I think of my son — I have an 11-year-old boy — and I worry. I worry all the time. I worry about what it’s going to be like for him. I remember my late father telling me about what it was like for him in the aftermath of the nakba. My father was 9 years old during the nakba. My son was 9 in October of 2023. So I am always thinking about the similarities. And I’m always thinking about “What’s it going to be like for him? What world is he going to be living in? How’s it going to be for him when he gets older?” Wakin: I guess here’s the point where we ask the obligatory question: What gives you hope? It seems like it’s not really an appropriate question right now. But there has been a global shift in opinion regarding Palestinians and what constitutes justice for them. Do you see anything optimistic there? Buttu: Yes, definitely, and there are a few things. First is, I think there’s finally starting to be an awakening that we can’t just ignore what’s going on with Palestinians. These leaders may try to ignore it, but I think that there’s a real awakening, at least on the street level, that this isn’t going to go away anytime soon. The second thing is, I’m also beginning to see that there’s the start of — even among diplomats — a recognition that they have to do things a different way. But the thing that gives me the most hope is that even over the past two years, what I saw when so many of the Palestinian hostages were being released is they kept saying, “They tried to break us, they tried to break us, they tried to break us, and they couldn’t break us.” There’s a resolve that Palestinians have that is really there. It’s unbreakable. Wakin: Diana, thank you so much. I really appreciate this conversation. Buttu: My pleasure. Thoughts? Email us at theopinions@nytimes.com .

d28aacb1840f,A Lesson From the German Resistance That Applies Today,"holocaust and nazis, world war ii, judaism, adolf hitler, berlin, germany, weimar republic, authoritarianism, antisemitism","As authoritarian rulers gain ground across the democratic world, making inroads not only in Hungary and Turkey, but even in the United States, a question from the 20th century has resurfaced in the 21st, one that presses on individuals as well as institutions. Put simply, who bends the knee to tyranny and who stands up to it? A clue can be found in an extraordinary episode from inside the Third Reich that has lain, almost forgotten, for nearly 80 years. At the heart of it is a loose grouping of 10 or so friends and acquaintances drawn from German high society, both the aristocracy and professional elite. Their circle included not one but two countesses, an ambassador’s widow, a diplomat, high-ranking government officials (current and former), a doctor, a pioneering headmistress and a former model, among others. What they found in one another was a shared willingness to defy Hitler, in ways large and small. Except their assumption of common purpose was fatally flawed. In September 1943, they met for a tea party — unaware that one of them was poised to betray all the rest to the Gestapo. That act would lead to arrest and jail and, for several of those present that day, death, whether by the guillotine or the hanging rope. Its ramifications would eventually reach the apex of the Nazi state. The core mystery that runs through this story is not just the identity of the betrayer, but also why people of privilege and rank, who could so easily have kept their heads down, risked everything. Had they fallen in line, their fortunes, careers and country estates likely would have remained intact. They could have survived the war unscathed. But they chose another path. Consider Otto Kiep, 57 years old at the time of the tea party, a diplomat who had secured the glamorous post of German consul general in New York City in the last years of the Weimar Republic. In 1933, an invitation had come to attend a dinner in honor of an eminent fellow countryman, Albert Einstein, who also happened to be the world’s most famous Jew. To accept would be to incur the wrath of his new Nazi masters, installed in power just a few weeks earlier. To refuse would be to side with their campaign of antisemitic persecution. Kiep accepted the invitation and delivered a toast in Einstein’s honor. That brought a summons back to Berlin where he would be hauled before the Führer himself. Or take Maria von Maltzan, the young countess who turned her Berlin apartment into an unofficial refuge for “submarines” — Jews forced to live in hiding, whose safety depended on staying silent and unseen. (Among them was Ms. von Maltzan’s own forbidden Jewish lover.) Or her fellow countess, Lagi Solf, who broke the rules banning contact with Jews, in order to fetch groceries for the submarines. Carrying full shopping bags, one in each hand, had long been her habit. That way, if she ran into someone on the street she would be unable to give the requisite Heil Hitler salute.

1387ea6025a9,Trump Alone Can’t Save Argentina,"argentina, javier milei, currency, debt, donald trump, mauricio macri, banking and finance, politics, budget, us foreign policy, interest rate, election, imf, carlos saul menem","Those doubts matter deeply. In the years ahead, Argentina must make more than $45 billion in foreign debt payments, including over $15 billion to the I.M.F. To do that, it must be able to borrow from global capital markets at reasonable interest rates — but that ability hinges on credibility. Without it, markets are willing to lend only at prohibitively high interest rates, pushing the country toward the very default it hopes to avoid. This is a classic pitfall known to economists as the multiple-equilibria trap: When investors feel optimistic, they’re willing to lend money inexpensively, which drives down interest rates and helps the economy grow, while keeping debt service low, thereby confirming their initial hope. Conversely, if they become pessimistic, they demand high-risk premiums, causing interest rates to soar, which chokes off investment and makes the public debt more expensive, justifying their fear of a crisis. Last week, the U.S. administration committed to a $20 billion currency swap — effectively a short-term loan — with Argentina. The move echoed the vow made by Mario Draghi, then the president of the European Central Bank, at the height of the euro crisis in 2012, to do “whatever it takes” to defend the euro. His words, backed by believable institutional power, changed expectations such that interest rates fell without a euro being spent. The Trump administration’s bailout was the closest thing to a Draghi-style credibility backstop Mr. Milei, who visited the White House on Tuesday, could hope for. Such external lifelines, though, can carry a country only so far. What matters is whether this support will filter through both markets and politics to move Argentina to a virtuous cycle of credibility. Mr. Milei has shown his commitment to fiscal discipline and responsible management of the country’s money supply. Ultimately, Argentines need to reach a political consensus around the idea that stability is not a partisan slogan but a foundation for growth. The pivotal question on Oct. 26 is whether they will signal to themselves, and to markets, that Argentina is ready to break with old habits and anchor its future on a commitment to stability — whatever it takes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/opinion/argentina-milei-trump-bailout.html,Society,BBC,By Ricardo Hausmann,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/opinion/15hausmann/15hausmann-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T05:00:05+00:00,341b5ec26b0aaef9c8b289acfdbe84a7c032afff
796510b2d3e1,The Pope Needs to Be More Specific,"catholic church, leo xiii, leo xiv, pope, income inequality, capitalism, politics","In taking the name Leo XIV, the first American pope signaled a desire to imitate his much-beloved 19th-century predecessor Leo XIII. The previous Leo forged the Catholic response to industrialization; the new one hopes to renew Catholic social doctrine for the age of globalization and artificial intelligence. It’s fitting, then, that Leo XIV’s first apostolic exhortation, “ Dilexi Te ,” is a meditation on Christian obligations to the poor — one effectively written with his immediate predecessor, Pope Francis, who began work on the document before his death. The exhortation is concerned with the entire Christian relationship to poverty, from almsgiving to hospitals to monastic renunciation, not just the obligations of the state. But it has a clear political point of view, a sharp critique of libertarian visions of political economy, an insistence that capitalism must be tamed and gentled for the sake of basic human goods. That perspective is hardly a novel one for the papacy: It was offered consistently by the theologically conservative popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, no less than by the liberalizing Francis. But that consistency also illustrates the challenge facing Leo if he hopes to say something novel and arresting on socioeconomic questions, something that’s as relevant to the current moment as Leo XIII’s teaching was to the 19th-century landscape. The Roman Catholic Church is not a policy shop offering detailed economic blueprints or pre-written social legislation. So it often makes sense for its social doctrine to take the form of general moral guidelines rather than a checklist of policy obligations. At the same time, however, there is a danger in vagueness and vapor, in offering pious-sounding exhortations that never condense into clear recommendations and whose applications seem to be overtaken by events. “Our deepest convictions,” the pope suggests in “Dilexi Te,"" may end up empty unless they’re “continually cultivated” through “our concrete actions.” In retrospect, the success of Leo XIII’s teaching, most notably his encyclical “ Rerum Novarum ,” is a case in point: The general Leonine vision of a third way between socialism and laissez-faire capitalism yielded successfully to the concrete agenda of New Deal liberalism and Christian democracy. The pope’s theory successfully anticipated American and European practice, such that the mid-20th-century model of welfare-state capitalism with strong labor unions could be reasonably described as a fulfillment of Roman Catholicism’s vision. The problem for Catholic social doctrine more recently is that no similarly effective global system has emerged to bridge the gap between rich and poorer countries, even as the American and European welfare states that were built in rough accord with Catholic principles have come under profound demographic strain. In this environment, the default assumption of the papacy (again, under multiple popes) has been that solutions will probably emerge from the same general left-of-center matrix that produced the original New Deal. And so the social documents the Vatican produces tend to endorse left-of-center impulses — toward global governance and domestic redistribution, environmental protection and support for mass migration — while trying to remain general enough to accommodate various policy approaches. But what happens if left-of-center politics finds itself coming to grief or hitting various dead ends? Then you get a disconnect, a rhetorical sour spot, where the church’s analysis seems at once too vague and content-free to help the left through its compounding dilemmas and yet still too left-wing to influence conservatives and populists. Here is a passage from “Dilexi Te” that illustrates this problem: We must continue, then, to denounce the “dictatorship of an economy that kills,” and to recognize that “while the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially, so too is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few. This imbalance is the result of ideologies that defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation. Consequently, they reject the right of states, charged with vigilance for the common good, to exercise any form of control. A new tyranny is being born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules.” There is no shortage of theories attempting to justify the present state of affairs or to explain that economic thinking requires us to wait for invisible market forces to resolve everything. Nevertheless, the dignity of every human person must be respected today, not tomorrow, and the extreme poverty of all those to whom this dignity is denied should constantly weigh upon our consciences. Again, this is very clearly a critique of libertarianism and an endorsement of some kind of regulation and redistribution. But the actual condition of the world, with the breakdown of the Pax Americana and the return of great power politics, makes it exceedingly unclear how you would implement a new politics of regulation and redistribution on a global scale, and there is no answer to that challenge to be found in the words of the new apostolic exhortation. At the same time, even setting aside the more laissez-faire United States, rich nations like France and Italy and Germany are all struggling with the legacy costs of their existing systems of regulation and redistribution. What does a papal critique of financial speculation offer to these dilemmas? “How do we fund old-age programs with a fertility rate under 1.5?” is not a question that can be answered with an attack on market fundamentalism. My point here is not to argue that the papacy should abandon its skepticism of unbridled capitalism and start channeling Friedrich Hayek or Ayn Rand. I accept the Leonine teaching that Catholics are obligated to support a mixed economy and a welfare state, and many conservative Catholics need to hear that teaching reiterated, especially in the United States. But such a teaching will be harder to receive if it seems to floats away from any kind of realistic policy correlatives, or if it just seems like a Catholic blessing for a vision of political economy that manifestly isn’t working at the moment. Which is why — and I’m sure I will regret this advice! — I think the new pope should be thinking more about ways to make this kind of teaching less general and more concrete. For instance, it might be better to say something specific about how much humanitarian aid rich societies owe the developing world — so long as that admonition was applied to Europe as well as to Donald Trump’s America — than to just wax eloquent about how globalization creates inequality. A headline that read “Pope Calls on All Rich Countries to Devote X Percent of Their Budget to Foreign Aid” would inspire plenty of complaints and critiques, but it would also be more clarifying than general condemnations of the rich world’s failings. Or again, in the European context especially, it might be helpful for the papacy to speak more specifically about hard choices, especially the choice between spending money on the old versus the young, than to just reiterate a general Catholic commitment to cradle-to-grave protections. Because this is where the dilemma lies right now. If the statesmen influenced by Leo XIII were trying to build things new, the lawmakers who might listen to Leo XIV are trying to balance longstanding commitments with emergent needs — and a church that doesn’t speak directly to that balancing act is less likely to be heard. Obviously the danger here is that the Vatican starts issuing policy recommendations that are just implausible or terrible, undermining whatever minimal political influence it still retains. But the advantage of specificity is that it could force the church’s leaders to directly address the trade-offs that lay Catholics involved in politics are already reckoning with, instead of issuing exhortations that — as Jesus himself might put it — display the innocence of doves but little of the wisdom of the serpent. This advice has personal as well as political applications. One of the strongest parts of “Dilexi Te” comes at the end, when the pope offers a defense and celebration of almsgiving, and it’s powerful in part because the reader understands clearly what the pontiff is asking him to do. But even here I think His Holiness could have gone further, and said something specific about how much Catholics should try to give away. Tell me to give in “whatever form,” as the exhortation does, and my mind will come up with excuses for giving less than I should. Tell me that Christians ought to tithe consistently, and I may not live up to the admonition, but at least I will feel a little more pressure to aim toward 10 percent. Such an emphasis on the concrete, I think, will serve the church especially well as it tries to reckon productively with the age of artificial intelligence, a subject of Leo’s personal concern and perhaps of his next major publication. There is no shortage of general fears and critiques of the A.I. future, and a Vatican that simply adds its own religious form of hand-wringing will offer little to the discussion. What people will need most in the new age, whether they’re students or parents or politicians or tech barons, is realistic and specific advice about what to seek and what to fear, what to accept and what to resist . And this pope will have more to offer the more he escapes from generality into practicality, and tells people not just how to think about the brave new world, but how to act and choose and live.

206a02a0643e,"Mr. Trump, on the Middle East, Please Move Fast and Break Things","israel gaza war, peace process, israel, gaza strip, hamas, palestinians, palestinian authority, mahmoud abbas, benjamin netanyahu, middle east, us foreign policy, donald trump, military, terrorism","“You create your own reality. Truth is a malleable thing.” — Roy Cohn to Donald Trump in the film “The Apprentice.” Listening to President Trump telling Israelis and Arabs on Monday that they were at “the historic dawn of a new Middle East” was like watching Trump selling his bankers on a plan to build the biggest, most beautiful, most amazing hotel in the world on a toxic waste dump. On the one hand, you tell yourself: This man must be crazy. Doesn’t he know the history of this place? You can’t build a hotel there! And on the other hand, a voice in the back of your head whispers: What if he can bring it off? Trump’s ability to combine bullying, flattering and exaggerating is truly a sight to behold, and it was on full display Monday in his addresses to the Israeli Knesset and then to more than 20 world leaders at a gathering in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. I will give Trump this: No traditional diplomat or foreign policy professor would have advised the president to take such risks — to declare that we are on the road to Middle East peace and that he, Donald Trump, will chair the “ Board of Peace ” that will deliver it. But Trump went to business school, not the School of Foreign Service, and he clearly believes that he can cajole, muscle and bluster this conflict to a happy ending. Since that strategy brought Trump both multiple bankruptcies in real estate and two terms as president in politics, I am not going to bet against him or for him. I am just going to give him this free advice: Mr. President, to get this deal done, you need to move fast and break things. So far, I don’t see it. I realize it is early, but right now I don’t even see the baby steps to the next phase. I see no U.N. resolution on the table creating the Arab/international peacekeeping force to oversee Hamas’s disarmament and security in Gaza until a proper Palestinian security force can be created. I see no money on the table for the billions that will be needed for reconstruction, and I have no idea who is supposed to appoint and manage the cabinet of Palestinian technocrats who are supposed to run Gaza instead of Hamas, which is already using its Interior Ministry and police forces to reassert control in Gaza. The Trump administration, which is notoriously thin in national security, does not even have a confirmed assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is already doing his job, as well as that of national security adviser, and Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who carried the ball this far on the peace deal, both have their own businesses to run. As a journalist, if I wanted to know what is going to happen next and how, I have no clue whom to call. This is a prescription for trouble. Because, Mr. President, what got you to this great hostage release, prisoner exchange and cease-fire will not get you to a wider Middle East peace — unless you lay down the law with both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hamas’s overseers: Turkey, Egypt and Qatar. You don’t have a second to rest. As someone who wants you to succeed, I have to remind you: As hard as the first stage was, you have not even seen hard yet. You need to say to Netanyahu: “I had to twist your arm to get you this far. Thanks for coming. I even tried to get you a pardon in your corruption cases. But I need to know right now: Are you with me or against me for the next phase? Are you going to move to the center of Israeli politics and create a coalition that can work with a reformed Palestinian Authority to replace Hamas and govern in both Gaza and the West Bank? Or are you going to continue to play the game that you have played with American presidents since 1996 — and try to tacitly keep Hamas alive in Gaza and weaken the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank in order to tell me that Israel has no partner for peace?” And to Qatar, Turkey and Egypt and whichever Arab countries are ready to send troops into Gaza, Trump needs to say something similar: “Are you going to force Hamas to disarm and pave the way for the return of Palestinian Authority leadership to Gaza or play footsie with Hamas as it tries to reassert control there?” While Hamas has signaled that it is willing to hand over civilian rule in Gaza to a different Palestinian entity, the group has never publicly confirmed that it would disarm, although it apparently said so privately. “They said they’re going to disarm, and if they don’t disarm, we will disarm them,” Trump said Monday, adding that he believed it would happen in a “reasonable time.” If Hamas fails to disarm, that will give Bibi an excuse to restart the war and avoid all the political land mines that the next phases present him. Let me put this another way: If Trump wants to translate his 20-point plan into regional peace, he has to start by once and for all breaking the twisted, codependent relationship between Netanyahu and Hamas — who have helped to keep each other politically viable for over two decades. This story goes back to Israel’s 1996 election that followed the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an Israeli extremist opposed to the Oslo Accords . Initial polls gave Rabin’s successor, Shimon Peres, a wide lead. Hamas, though, was determined to scuttle Oslo, which Peres helped to deliver, from going forward. Netanyahu also vigorously opposed Oslo, so Hamas wanted him to win. To tacitly discredit Peres and help Bibi’s chances, Hamas embarked on a murderous suicide bombing campaign . It worked. The killing of more than 60 Israelis in nine days propelled Netanyahu, the hard-liner, to defeat Peres, the dove, and win the election. This codependency also explains why Netanyahu was responsible for facilitating Qatar’s assistance of hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas — in bags of bills — to keep it viable in Gaza all these years. At the same time, Netanyahu did — and still does — everything possible to weaken the Palestinian Authority, which cooperates every day with Israeli security services to keep the West Bank from blowing up. There is no possibility — none whatsoever — of Trump’s advancing this cease-fire to a wider peace without Hamas being replaced, as soon as feasible, by a reformed Palestinian Authority and without Netanyahu establishing a more centrist ruling coalition or Israeli voters replacing Netanyahu. The Bibi-Hamas codependency has to stop for there to be any peace. Trump did not do himself any favors when he came out with his crazy idea in February to empty Gaza of its Palestinian residents and build a French-style Riviera there. “Trump did not understand that one of the deepest fantasies of both Israelis and Palestinians is that the other, one day, will disappear,” the Israeli writer Ari Shavit remarked to me. “When Trump suggested in February emptying Gaza of Gazans, he made the Israeli right think their dreams were going to come true — that Gaza would be annexed and the West Bank would be next.” Now, eight months later, Trump has come to Jerusalem and told the same Israelis that there will be no annexation of Gaza or the West Bank. “It is an amazing transformation,” said Shavit. “And it is driving Bibi’s allies on the messianic right to a corner. The same Trump that unleashed insanity in February is now forcing Israel to face reality: The Palestinians are here to stay, and we must find a way to live with them.” Sooner or later — and I believe it will be sooner — Trump will realize that if he wants the Gaza peace to succeed and spread, he needs to get a reformed Palestinian Authority into Gaza as soon as possible. The P.A. ran the strip before being ousted by Hamas in June 2007, and it did so under a legal, economic and trade framework painstakingly negotiated over two years by Israelis and Palestinians in the Oslo Accords. That framework just needs to be dusted off. Trying instead to reinvent governance in Gaza from scratch now is a mistake; it will take months, at least, to organize, and Hamas will take advantage of the vacuum. The only reason that the P.A. was being kept out of the picture was to satisfy Netanyahu’s political desire not to ever have a unified Palestinian leadership in the West Bank and Gaza. But Bibi’s political needs are not aligned with U.S. interests to get to a permanent peace — and never have been. Trump needed to satisfy Netanyahu’s political needs to get to this point, but now Trump needs to steamroll over them to put in place the next stage. Will he? I was intrigued by the fact that at the Sharm el Sheikh summit, Trump huddled with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. The Times reported: “As the two men posed for the camera at the end of their hushed chat, Mr. Trump took Mr. Abbas’s hand, patting it twice as the Palestinian leader smiled. Mr. Trump gave a thumbs-up sign and presented his own big smile.” Good for the president. Because the only long-term solution — in my view — is a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank whose borders are negotiated with Israel. That state, though, must be run by a reformed P.A. — with the ongoing support of an Arab/international peacekeeping force that would guarantee this Palestinian state never threatens Israel and the support of an international “Board of Peace” that would guarantee its economic success. But the only way to get there is if Hamas is quickly disarmed, if the P.A. is quickly reformed and integrated into Gaza and if Netanyahu either finds some new Israeli governing partners in the center or goes into the wilderness. None of them, in their present incarnations, are partners for long-term peace. May their transformations or disappearances happen quickly.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/opinion/trump-israel-gaza-peace.html,Society,BBC,By Thomas L.

eda9b679d504,Why Israel Won the War,"israel gaza war, israel, hamas, gaza strip, benjamin netanyahu, yehya sinwar, kidnapping and hostages, military, terrorism, palestinians, peace process, donald trump, us foreign policy","Though it seems absurd in retrospect, there were many in Hamas who believed their massacre of Oct. 7, 2023, would succeed not just in wounding Israel but in destroying it . They believed this out of religious fervor. They believed it because they hoped to inspire Hezbollah and Iran to join the battle with their own full-scale attacks. And they believed that Israel, for all its high-tech wizardry, was weak. The belief turned out to be wrong — and fatal. But it wasn’t unfounded. “After 20 years, you will become weak, and I will attack you,” Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of Oct. 7, told his Israeli prison dentist about 20 years ago, according to reporting by The New Yorker’s David Remnick . What Sinwar and others in Hamas saw in Israel was a country prepared to release more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including Sinwar himself, for the sake of a single hostage. A country whose leaders talked tough but tended to be risk-averse for fear of upsetting the Israeli public’s thirst for prosperity and calm. A country with deep internal fissures — religious versus secular, Jews versus non-Jews, supporters of judicial reform versus opponents. A country anxious about what the rest of the world thought of it. All this Sinwar gleaned from closely reading Hebrew-language newspapers, a habit he picked up from his many years in Israeli prisons. That may have been his biggest mistake. Journalism in a democracy, particularly Israel’s, tends to neglect what’s healthy in a society while obsessing over everything that’s not. (In autocracies it’s the opposite.) The result is that Sinwar was better acquainted with Israel’s many self-advertised faults than with its underlying strengths. We’ll probably never know whether Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli troops a year ago this week, ever came to grips with the scale of his misjudgment. Israelis did not crumble in the face of his butchery, which he appears to have specifically ordered against soldiers and civilian communities alike “so as to evoke fear in Israelis and destabilize the country,” according to a recent report in The Times . They did not limit themselves to several weeks of fighting, as they had in previous wars, or buckle to unceasing international pressure, or surrender most of their war aims for the sake of releasing the hostages. Instead, Israelis rallied and won — at least inasmuch as a lasting victory is ever possible in the Middle East. They have changed the game with Lebanon and Syria. They have humiliated and defanged Iran, whose regime, as Karim Sadjadpour notes in a new essay in Foreign Affairs , is tottering. They have gotten back their remaining living hostages without giving up their most important leverage in Gaza, which is the control of its inner perimeter. They have secured the commitment of Muslim countries to a Gaza free from Hamas’s governance: If that fails, they have some assurance that Gazans will resist future attempts by Hamas to drag them into another calamitous war. They have maintained diplomatic relations with friendly Arab states. And, for all the global street protests, hostile op-eds and meaningless arms embargoes , they have the full-throated backing of the only foreign government that matters: America’s. For all this, there’s been a heavy price. A shattered Gaza, with many thousands of civilian deaths and terrible suffering for those trapped in the crossfire. Rising antisemitism. A generation of Western progressives — joined by growing numbers of cohorts on the far right — who think of the Jewish state as the apotheosis of evil. Maybe all that could have been avoided, though I doubt it: Israel had already been judged guilty of war crimes by all the “sentence first, verdict afterward” critics in the earliest days of the war . I also doubt most Israelis or supporters of Israel would seriously want to trade Israel’s current position for its opposite: strategic defeat in exchange for Western tea and sympathy. Centuries of persecution and discrimination followed by interludes of pity and accommodation are what drove Jews to establish the state of Israel in the first place. It’s also what drove them, in this war, to win. Much of the analysis of Israel’s military strategy has been focused on the hows: How did Israel carry off the pager operation against Hezbollah ? How did the Mossad smuggle a bomb into the Tehran safe house where t he Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was staying? How did Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, persuade Donald Trump to join in the attack on Iran ? And how did Trump use Israel’s attack on Hamas’s leadership in Doha to engineer the diplomacy that stopped the war ? But the how questions are ultimately less revealing than the whys. Why, contrary to what Sinwar believed, did Israel not collapse on Oct. 7? Why did Israelis persevere through mass murder, forced internal displacement , ballistic-missile attacks and international isolation? Why was Israel determined to win rather than settle for a premature end to the war that would have left Israel’s major enemies mostly unscathed? The answer came to me on an Israeli military base near Gaza, where I met a sergeant who went by the nickname Cholo. Cholo had been D.J.’ing raves in Brazil but returned to Israel immediately after Oct. 7 to serve. “I am not supporting this government,” he told me . “But I will go to the army.” The word for this is patriotism, or what Mark Twain called “supporting your country all the time, but your government only when it deserves it.” Many of the Israeli soldiers who fought and fell in Gaza and other fronts were surely marching against Netanyahu during the protests over the judicial reform. But they came from nearly every political quarter to fight not out of ideological or partisan conviction, but because Sinwar’s aims and methods on Oct. 7 made clear that the stakes were existential. What’s more, the gleeful support those aims and methods instantly engendered worldwide made clear that, even now, there’s still no safe harbor for Jews. Not Australia . Not Canada . Not Britain . Not France . Not Germany . And perhaps not America . Do earnest progressives really think that if the Jewish state were to vanish tomorrow, to be replaced by some utopian binational state, the anti-Jewish furies in the Middle East, Europe or North America would somehow abate? Or would those furies simply find easier targets? Nor did Israelis fight only because they were faced by an existential threat. They also faced an existential lie: the lie that Israel is a settler-colonialist state, a nonnative invasive species that has no place in that land. It’s a lie that’s taken hold everywhere, even if a 3,000-year historical record disproves it . And it’s a lie that, as it’s grown bolder, attacks the very roots of Jewish identity. “ If I forget thee, O Jerusalem …” wasn’t simply meant as literary metaphor. To prove the point, Israelis had to fight and win the war. The current cease-fire brings a set of difficult questions about what comes next — for Israelis and Palestinians and everyone else invested in their future. But it should settle important questions, too. Are Israelis weak? Is their state built on foundations of sand? Is their attachment to their beliefs slight? Yahya Sinwar and those who followed him thought so. The grave he made for himself should settle the questions for good.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/opinion/israel-war-hamas-peace-gaza.html,Society,BBC,By Bret Stephens,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/14stephens-gfpm/14stephens-gfpm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T21:00:05+00:00,94ebd01084d821370179257dbfb701017ac36210

There is no question that this historic moment would not have come to pass without Mr. Trump’s pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and other key leaders in the Middle East. Now the hard work begins. Gaza has been all but destroyed by two years of war, and rebuilding will cost tens of billions of dollars. What nations will want to invest in rebuilding Gaza when there is no assurance that war will not reoccur? Hamas may be defeated, but it has not disappeared, and there are already reports of isolated incidents of fighting. President Trump and the leaders of Arab nations will have to commit financially and militarily to ensure that this fragile peace will last. Henry A. Lowenstein New York To the Editor: Re “ Trump’s Peace Plan Dismantled Netanyahu’s Vision for Gaza ,” by Shira Efron (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 13): It is premature to declare victory or defeat between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The only thing that can be declared is that the cease-fire has brought an end to the bloodshed, the freeing of the Israeli hostages and imprisoned Palestinians and the feeding of starving Gazans. Dr. Efron is correct to state that the “negotiated settlement” amounts to nothing like what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Israelis: total victory and the destruction of Hamas. In addition, the war created another generation of Arabs seeing Israel as their enemy that has destroyed their homeland, starved them and killed tens of thousands of their grandparents, parents and siblings, as well as leaving many maimed, physically or psychologically, for the rest of their lives. Without a permanent homeland for the Palestinians, I am afraid that the violence will flare up as it has for more than seven decades. It is imperative that a Palestinian state be established once and for all — and now. Michael Hadjiargyrou Centerport, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “ Test for Israel: Repairing Ties to U.S. Voters ” (front page, Oct. 13): I fear that you are conflating two issues in this article. Yes, many American Jews, including me, are critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But anger or disenchantment with a country’s leader does not translate into a fracture with the country and its people. The Israeli people are angry. They themselves protest their leadership daily. That alone is proof enough to support the only democracy in the Middle East. In any of the neighboring countries they ​could be imprisoned or killed for ​such protests. Are we really saying Americans prefer that to a country that admittedly is not perfect and has made mistakes but is able to correct its direction with free and open elections? Many in America find Donald Trump’s administration repugnant, but that doesn’t keep them from loving our country. Mona Rieger Newburgh, N.Y. Dangerous Obstacles to Covid Vaccines To the Editor: Re “ Kennedy’s Vaccine Committee Votes to Restrict Access to Covid Shots ” (news article, Sept. 20): As a public health professional for 46 years and the president and chief executive of the American Lung Association, I followed the recent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, and read this article, with great concern. The misinformation about vaccines shared at the ACIP meeting harms the public’s trust in vaccines. The committee voted to create access barriers to Covid-19 vaccination, even while science continues to support a broad recommendation. The Lung Association was founded in 1904 to fight tuberculosis. The practices we pioneered became the building blocks of modern public health, including disease tracking, educating communities, raising awareness and funding research to advance treatments. From the beginning, science has been the backbone of public health. It is core to saving lives. Now more than ever, we must stand together for strong, science-based public health. We call on policymakers to strengthen, not weaken, the public health systems that protect us all. Investments in research, access, disease prevention and public health infrastructure save lives, safeguard our economy and prepare us for the health challenges of tomorrow. Vaccines are an essential part of this effort.

Buttigieg: I think there are signs of policies that could redirect our attention to experiences that are more offline — real, physical investment. I mean investment in things like service, particularly national service. There have been models for this: California has done a lot of good work promoting service, and AmeriCorps, which unfortunately has taken a lot of hits under this administration, was on the right track. Military service did this, too. The military is not for everybody, but it was an abundantly offline experience with people I had to get to know and sometimes trust with my life in a very short amount of time. I think investing in what’s sometimes called social infrastructure — I literally mean things like parks and recreation. If you have more safe, physical spaces for your kids to play in and for people to gather in, that really matters. It can help be an antidote to the retreat into the screen, which is harmful for kids and, I think, pretty poisonous for adults, too. Leonhardt: So if a key thing here is to have a story about belonging, about a shared national project rather than a partisan one, how do you think that can appeal to people, given the level of cynicism today and the darkness? How do we make sure it doesn’t just fall on deaf ears, given how frustrated people are and the way the media works today? Buttigieg: I think it actually begins by facing the darkness, saying: OK, a lot of the things we’ve inherited or built don’t work. It’s a bit of a tough-love message, I think, for my party that a lot of the institutions we care about — built for very good reasons and that did a lot of good since the 1930s, ’40s and ’50s — need to be completely rebuilt. That doesn’t mean it was OK to burn them down, whether we’re talking about the Department of Education, our public health infrastructure, our system for international development aid or any of the other things being dismantled. I’m not saying it was OK to tear them down. I’m saying that since it’s happening, we might as well face the fact that they weren’t perfect before, and now we can rebuild them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/opinion/next-american-story-pete-buttigieg.html,Society,BBC,"By Pete Buttigieg, David Leonhardt and Jillian Weinberger",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/opinion/14opinions-buttigieg/14opinions-buttigieg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T09:01:52+00:00,08ffd2b6bd6cd4736d8faf09abf114dd010ab121
17475147e7ec,The Rise of the Smartphone and the Fall of Western Democracy,"social media, computers and the internet, tech industry, artificial intelligence, democracy, us politics, 2020 election, presidential election of 2024, donald trump","In an Oct. 2 essay posted in Persuasion, “ It’s the Internet, Stupid : What Caused the Global Populist Wave? Blame the Screens,” Fukuyama, after nearly a decade of examining the causes of rising global populism, wrote, “I have come to conclude that technology broadly and the internet in particular stand out as the most salient explanations for why global populism has arisen in this particular historical period, and why it has taken the particular form that it has.” The advent of the internet, Fukuyama continued, can explain both the timing of the rise of populism, as well as the curious conspiratorial character that it has taken. In today’s politics, the red and blue sides of America’s polarization contest not just values and policies, but factual information like who won the 2020 election or whether vaccines are safe. The two sides inhabit completely different information spaces; both can believe that they are involved in an existential struggle for American democracy because they begin with different factual premises as to the nature of the threats to that order. In an email, Fukuyama said that “without the internet, Trump’s whole narrative about the 2020 election would never have gotten any traction.” Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell and the author of the forthcoming book “ The Doom Loop : Why the World Economic Order Is Spiraling Into Disorder,” wrote in an email that the new technologies were collectively disproving the adage that the truth will out: In principle, the ease with which high-quality and reliable information can be disseminated should make it possible to squeeze out inaccurate or intentionally misleading information. In practice, however, the structure of media and information platforms has led to the opposite outcome. Large platforms have little incentive to filter out bad information. They have attracted broad, diverse audiences by limiting the filters placed on the quality of content while reinforcing loyalty to the platform through algorithms that selectively feed users information that conforms to and corroborates their existing beliefs. Thus, while technology has fostered the concentration of power in the hands of large platforms, it has also led to the fragmentation of information sources and the quality of content available on those platforms. Some scholars are less critical and more ambivalent about the effects of technology on politics and democracy. Maria Papageorgiou, a fellow at Newcastle University in Britain, where she researches Sino-Russian disinformation during British and U.S. elections, stressed both benefits and costs in an email responding to my queries: Like other revolutionary technologies, such as computers and the internet, social media has both benefits and drawbacks. The main issue is that society was slow to recognize the profound impact it would have on communication, entertainment and political discourse. As a result, appropriate safeguards and education about responsible use were not developed in time. While social media has played a significant role in elections over the past several years, she wrote that in 2016 Trump transformed political communication through his distinctive use of Twitter (now X). His direct, unfiltered and often provocative messaging style established a new form of political discourse that extended beyond traditional media and even influenced foreign policy communication. Papageorgiou’s overall assessment of the role of technology in politics stood in contrast to Fukuyama’s: Social media has amplified important issues and provided a platform for people to raise concerns that were previously ignored by the broader population. It has also allowed the public to directly respond to, criticize and oppose government policies. Social media has significantly changed the political tone — shifting it from a more formal and diplomatic style to a more direct and emotionally driven one aimed at reaching the general public. While more positive in her evaluation of these new technologies, Papageorgiou contended that Trump far outpaced his adversaries in 2016 and 2024 on this front. In a January 2025 paper, “ Social Media, Disinformation, and A.I. : Transforming the Landscape of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Political Campaigns,” Papageorgiou wrote that in the 2024 election, social media also played a pivotal role in monitoring public sentiment and tracking real-time engagement through metrics like likes, reposts and followers. Candidate follower counts highlighted the digital dynamics: Trump led with 95 million followers on X; his running mate, JD Vance , had 2.8 million; Harris had 21.1 million ; and her running mate, Tim Walz, had 1.2 million . Trump’s engagement metrics on X were significantly higher than his competitors’, with a record-breaking interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast garnering extensive viewership across platforms like YouTube and X. Duncan Watts, a professor in the department of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, took his skepticism of technology doomsayers a giant step further than Papageorgiou or any others I reached.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/opinion/social-media-populism-trump-smartphones.html,Society,BBC,By Thomas B.

0dc196a425be,Warning: Our Stock Market Is Looking Like a Bubble,"stocks;bonds, us economy, artificial intelligence, computers and the internet, tech industry, data center, recession and depression, subprime mortgage crisis;2008 financial crisis","Or take a look at the price-to-earnings ratio — a common measure of how much the future profits of a company are valued over current ones — of the stocks of companies heavily invested in A.I. They are at levels not seen since the dot-com bubble of 2000. Shares of the A.I. chipmaker Nvidia are trading at roughly 55 times earnings, nearly double what they were a decade ago. And by our own estimates, the share of the economy devoted to A.I. investment is nearly a third greater than the share of the economy devoted to internet-related investments back then. All this points to one conclusion: Should lackluster A.I. performance or sluggish adoption cause investors to doubt these lofty profit expectations, this probably-a-bubble will pop. And a lot of people, not just wealthy investors, will get hurt. Adoption, both by firms and individuals, is clearly growing, but whether this adoption is generating massive productivity benefits or profits remains to be seen . Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that this time is different, and unlike the railroad and internet bubbles, A.I. is an epoch-shifting technology that generates its promised economic benefits relatively quickly. If that occurs, say, over the next five to 10 years, the future profits generated by A.I. could justify the levels of investment we’re observing today (it was in this spirit that Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, recently said, “I hope we don’t take 50 years”). It is also impossible to know when we’re at the top of a bubble, which is one reason investors tend to keep piling in. But we’re skeptical. Look at what happened with the internet. In the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, hype around that revolution allowed companies like pets.com to raise over $80 million in an initial public offering, despite the fact that its business model, which involved spending too much money to sell unprofitable pet supplies, was questionable at best. Less than nine months after their I.P.O., the firm went bankrupt — and many other busts soon followed. The belief that the internet would become a transformative technology was eventually correct, but investors during the dot-com bubble were wrong about the winners and their timing. The economic impact generated by a bursting of the A.I. bubble would be greater than the loss of the trillions currently being invested to build the technology itself. The stock market, one of the brightest parts of the current economy and heavily dependent on A.I. ebullience, would also tumble. That, in turn, will diminish the “wealth effect,” or the way that stock market gains support consumer spending. Using data from the economist Mark Zandi, we found that over the past two years, real consumer spending is up 17 percent for the wealthiest households, who disproportionately hold stocks, but flat for the middle class. Mr. Zandi estimates that the A.I. wealth effect is boosting current real gross domestic product growth by about 0.4 percentage points (just under $100 billion), comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, when the wealth effect was 0.6 percentage points.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/opinion/ai-bubble-stock-market-tech-stocks.html,Society,BBC,By Jared Bernstein and Ryan Cummings,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/opinion/14bernstein-image/14bernstein-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T09:01:40+00:00,af867bb664c756814d3ce4b0fd2b0f9d3fd304be

Exactly.,"deportation, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, civil rights, presidential power, aclu;american civil liberties union, fbi, national guard, woodrow wilson, donald trump","Anti-immigrant sentiment runs high, encouraged in significant measure by the president. In reaction, federal officers, sometimes with the help of local police departments, round up immigrants in American cities by the thousands. Many are detained without clear legal authority; hundreds are deported. This is a story of 2025, of course. It is also a story from a century ago, when zealous officials pursued immigrants in an uncannily similar fashion, a little-remembered episode that didn’t end well for the federal government. There are strong clues that the Trump administration might face a similar outcome. Those earlier immigrant roundups, in late 1919 and early 1920, are known in history books as the Palmer raids, after A. Mitchell Palmer, the attorney general who ordered them. He was aided in his efforts by a young Justice Department attorney named J. Edgar Hoover, whose experience helped lead to the emergence of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. President Woodrow Wilson set the table for the actions with his own harsh talk about subversives lurking within America’s borders, while a compliant judiciary gave the executive branch’s leaders every reason to think it wouldn’t stand in the way. In the present, the White House adviser Stephen Miller has set a goal of arresting 3,000 immigrants a day. President Trump talks of using the Insurrection Act to deploy the military to American cities to help immigration agents fight the “enemy from within.” In the 1920s, government leaders also used incendiary speech to justify their actions. Anti-immigrant sentiment blurred with broader efforts to clamp down on free speech, and judicial due process often was ignored. Eventually, the Wilson administration overreached, and the Palmer raids came to be seen as folly. Only about 800 of the more than 4,000 people detained were deported. The raids failed to achieve their main law-enforcement goal. The F.B.I.’s own history of the episode refers to them as a “nightmare.” In short, America was here before — and has come to regret it. The Palmer raids were born of the country’s first big Red Scare — the fear that subversives who migrated from Russia and Eastern Europe would launch an American version of the Bolshevik Revolution. These fears began in the years leading up to World War I, persisted during the war and rolled into the war’s aftermath, when Communists in Moscow talked of global revolution. The anxiety was fanned by Wilson, and not subtly. As early as 1915, in a message to Congress, he warned darkly of a threat posed by citizens “born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws” who posed “the gravest threats against our national peace and safety.” When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the Wilson administration proposed to Congress an Espionage Act that would give the government sweeping powers to clamp down on free speech and to broadly censor the press to protect the war effort. The act’s press censorship provisions went too far even for a generally supportive Congress, which dropped them, but the broader law passed. Soon, the Postal Service refused to deliver materials the postmaster general deemed subversive, and the Justice Department arrested and prosecuted citizens; in one case, nearly 100 union members were convicted of disrupting the war effort. Congress then passed a parallel act, the Immigration Act of 1918, which expanded the government’s powers to deport “undesirable aliens.” After the war ended, the focus shifted from antiwar activists to those who were deemed to be social “radicals,” a term applied especially to immigrants from Russia and Germany. Certainly, some radical activity was underway. Anarchists openly advocated an end to the capitalist system, and hundreds of strikes were launched across the economy in 1919. The spark that set off the Palmer raids came in mid-1919, when unknown people mailed bombs to prominent politicians and business leaders, including one that blew off the hands of a U.S. senator’s maid. On June 2, a bomber set off a device at Palmer’s house on R Street in Washington. The bomb destroyed the front of the building, startling a young couple named Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt who lived across the street. Palmer survived, and under public pressure to act, he set out to deport those he considered to be suspicious immigrants. He created a small division within the Justice Department to gather intelligence on the threat. Hoover was put in charge. Using wartime authorities Congress had provided, federal agents struck in early November, bursting into apartments and meeting houses across 11 cities and arresting more than 1,000 immigrants, many of them Russians, some taken simply because their accent was deemed suspicious (for today, substitute suspicious tattoos). “Sometimes they had arrest warrants, but usually they simply arrested everyone they found,” the author and historian Christopher M. Finan wrote in his book “From the Palmer Raids to the Patriot Act.” Some of those detained were later released, but others weren’t so lucky. “In December, with much public fanfare, a number of radicals were put on a ship dubbed the ‘Red Ark’ or ‘Soviet Ark’ by the press and deported to Russia,” according to an F.B.I. history of the episode. Those raids were just a warm-up act. Weeks later, in January 1920, Palmer and Hoover oversaw a broader wave of arrests and detentions. In pursuit of what Palmer called “alien filth,” an estimated 3,000 people, including citizens and legal residents, were rounded up on suspicion of being members of Communist political parties seeking the overthrow of the government. Palmer had gone too far. Doubts about the constitutionality of the exercise grew within the Wilson administration, in Congress and in the courts and press. Officials in the Labor Department, who initially were part of the effort, came to see it as legally unjustifiable. They concluded that most of those arrested had no interest in government overthrow and canceled most of the deportation orders. Congressional hearings were called to investigate. The raids also failed in their central mission: The government never found out who was responsible for the string of bombings. When Palmer’s prediction that there would be a giant May Day insurrection proved unfounded, he and his raids were discredited. He once thought he would be a contender in the 1920 presidential elections, but distaste over his raids put an end to that. There have been other episodes of government overreach, including the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. History doesn’t tell us whether a similar fate awaits the Trump administration’s initiatives, but the president would be wise to heed the lessons. Then, as now, there were legitimate reasons for government action. In 1919, there was indeed anarchist activity; in 2025, the country is grappling with the consequences of the Biden administration’s failure to better secure the southern border. In both cases, a sympathetic Congress was happy to go along, at least at the outset. History also shows that skirting civil liberties and due process can be effective and even popular in the short run — and tends to produce a backlash eventually. The brief F.B.I. recounting of the episode notes, somewhat cryptically, that “the Palmer raids were certainly not a bright spot for the young bureau.” The courts, led by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., began to look more critically at the broader efforts to shut down protests and free speech. For the Trump administration, there are similar warning signs. Recent polls have found that Americans generally approve of deporting people who came to the country illegally, but don’t like the lack of due process surrounding deportations or sending immigrants to prisons in other countries. It’s true there is little sign a Republican-controlled Congress has any interest in putting the brakes on Trump policies, but even partisan lawmakers eventually respond to public sentiment, as they did after the Palmer raids. Meanwhile, courts are putting up more roadblocks. A federal judge recently said that the administration’s push to arrest and deport foreign students for their pro-Palestinian activism was illegal and declared, “We are not, and we must not become, a nation that imprisons and deports people because we are afraid of what they have to tell us.” A Trump-appointed judge blocked the deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops to Oregon. Palmer didn’t think he had overstepped. Rather, he chided Congress for not giving him more tools to help in the “sweeping processes of arrests and deportation of seditious aliens.” He did succeed in setting off a new national sensitivity to civil liberties. In direct response to the Palmer raids, a small group of lawyers, social workers and activists created the American Civil Liberties Union. Gerald F.

232f41c37b62,It’s Not Normal to Raise Children Like This,"parenting, motherhood, fatherhood, women and girls, family, cohousing, loneliness, us","My friend Elizabeth Oldfield has that rare and precious thing: a village. Hers is in the middle of London, contained within a generously sized family house that is now home to Elizabeth, her husband, their two children, a single female friend and another couple they befriended at church some years ago. The five adults share the costs of running the house, as well as cooking and other domestic tasks. Elizabeth’s children are never without babysitters, and when or if another baby comes along, everyone will help out. The household regularly hosts dinner parties, many of which I’ve been lucky enough to attend. This being a Christian community — a mini-monastery, almost — the evening usually ends with prayers in the makeshift chapel at the end of the garden. The atmosphere is friendly and busy. No one ever seems lonely at Elizabeth’s house. We modern people often like to imagine ourselves as autonomous individuals, but in the natural human life cycle we spend a large proportion of our lives dependent on others: as babies, in old age and when sick, pregnant or caring for young children. During those stretches of dependency, we often feel a longing for something like a village: a group of people who are physically present in our lives and on whom we can depend. This is especially pronounced among the college educated, relatively affluent Americans who moved away from their extended families in pursuit of career opportunities, only to regret that distance when the illusion of autonomy becomes harder to maintain. This longing finds modern shape in the real estate platform Live Near Friends , which invites users to purchase what is described as “multiplayer housing” — properties that can accommodate more than one family. It manifests in the fascination with The Birds Nest : a female-only community in Texas recalling the 1970s experiments with feminist community building, including lesbian separatist projects. Meanwhile, “mommune” has sprung up as a new word to describe an old thing: mothers raising their kids together . And yet such experiments remain rare. Even though forming communities like Elizabeth’s would solve many of the economic and practical problems the exhausted and the lonely face, very few of us make the attempt. We claim to want a village, but I suspect that what we actually want is something closer to a paid service — a community that we can subscribe to when it’s convenient and back out of when it no longer works for us.

c3973e0dbef2,The Drug That Took Away More Than Her Appetite,"drug abuse, therapy, group homes;supportive housing;halfways homes;three quarter homes, weight, glp1s;glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) receptor agonists;ozempic;wegovy, alcohol abuse, obesity, addiction","Jessica Massarone couldn’t concentrate in primary school: She was too preoccupied with her parents’ struggles with drug addiction. Sometimes, she’d find her mother passed out on the floor. “I was constantly worried about what I was going to come home to,” she said. Despite being diagnosed with anxiety and depression in her teens, she earned an associate degree in child development and worked for seven years at a university child care center. At 26, she thought she’d escaped her family legacy — until a boyfriend introduced her to cocaine. “The addiction part came really fast,” she said. She got pregnant, then sober. She’d recover for a few months, even a year, then relapse. She lost custody of her children. In May, she began taking a drug similar to Ozempic while living at Open Doors , a Rhode Island nonprofit for formerly incarcerated and homeless people. She gets the medication, called a GLP-1, free through a pilot program testing the weight loss and obesity drugs as a treatment for addiction. Fifteen patients have started on the medication so far. The drug helped Ms. Massarone, who had also battled obesity, lose 17 pounds. Critically, it also allowed her to overcome drug cravings in situations that had once defeated her. “I have a very strong faith,” she said, “but sometimes that’s not enough.” Ms. Massarone has now been in recovery for 17 months. She recently left Open Doors to live in an apartment with a woman she met in that program. When we spoke, she was preparing for a weekend visit with her 13-year-old twins — a boy and a girl — and her 16-year-old daughter. Stories like Ms. Massarone’s underscore why research into GLP-1s for addiction needs more investment. Unlike new drug compounds that take years to develop, GLP-1s are already approved and appear quite safe, which means they could reach people far sooner, while also offering broader health benefits. The only existing treatments that have proven to save lives from drug addiction, methadone and buprenorphine, were developed and approved thanks to a big push from the federal government. The pilot program that includes Ms. Massarone is run by the Center for Addiction Science, Policy and Research , or CASPR, a nonprofit organization studying GLP-1 drugs for addiction. The group, which is not funded by pharmaceutical companies, wants to spur F.D.A. approval for such use, which the industry has shown little interest in pursuing. (The maker of Ozempic has one trial aimed at treating alcohol-related liver disease, but said explicitly that it isn’t focused on addiction.) Without formal approval as an addiction medicine, the drugs will remain unaffordable because insurance won’t cover them. For now, Open Doors provides the medication for free through support from CASPR, in hopes that the results will spur government and the pharmaceutical industry to take on the research. Studies based on the medical records of millions of people taking GLP-1s for obesity or diabetes have revealed strong signals of their potential as addiction treatment. The research shows reductions of 30 to 70 percent in addictive behaviors, including heavy drinking , cannabis use disorder and opioid overdoses . There are also many anecdotes of people taking these medications and finding themselves drinking less, reducing other drug use and cutting back compulsive behaviors like gambling or shopping. Clinical trial data is sparse. But in February, a trial of GLP-1s for alcohol use disorder showed significant reductions in heavy drinking among patients who weren’t trying to quit or even cut back. A small, unpublished pilot study for opioid use disorder found that people reported a reduction in drug cravings. Open Doors uses much lower doses than those approved for diabetes or obesity to prevent unhealthy weight loss. So far, none of the participants have had this problem, said Dr. Steven Klein, an addiction physician who is prescribing the drugs for Open Doors. Ms. Massarone tried to kick cocaine repeatedly in the past, participating wholeheartedly in treatment programs, aiming to be a good mother. Twice, she achieved around a year of abstinence and had full custody — and twice, she relapsed and lost it when she came across people and situations that reminded her of her past. The second time, she nearly died: Her cocaine was laced with fentanyl. After being jailed for 45 days for possession — and feeling hopeless about recovery — she agreed to an open adoption for her children. “I love them so much that I, yeah, gave them away,” she said. At Open Doors, she got a fresh start. Her children’s adoptive parents support weekend visits, seeing how hard she’s working to change. “They’re so proud of me right now,” she said of the adoptive parents, “and that means everything to me.” On medication, Ms. Massarone has navigated at least two situations that previously prompted relapses. Once, a former drug friend contacted her on social media. But rather than feeling driven to get high, she felt nothing. “I shut it down right away,” she said, recalling how she immediately blocked him. Another time, she saw a dealer she knew making a sale outside the Subway where she now works. Rather than being drawn back in, she was “disgusted,” she said. Again, no cravings. “And I was amazed by that, because for me, it’s a big deal.” So far, many of the accounts of success with GLP-1 medications for addiction come from affluent people with ample resources for recovery, making it difficult to know how much of an advantage the medications really offer. Research shows that educated , employed and otherwise socially supported people are generally more likely to recover. The project at Open Doors aims to see whether the drugs make a difference for people like Ms. Massarone, who’ve endured childhood trauma, homelessness and incarceration. Dr. Klein, who also prescribes GLP-1 drugs for the Caron Foundation rehab chain, which tends to have wealthier patients, said that he’s seeing benefits in both groups. “They feel more in control,” he said. One patient told him, “I feel like my brain listens to me now.” Medications can’t supply a home or a job or a reason to live, of course. But if they can help a woman who wants to be there for her children to avoid relapsing, it would be criminal to allow only the rich to benefit. Both the government and the pharmaceutical industry need to engage as they did to make existing medication options available. We need to marshal those resources to find out as quickly as possible if GLP-1 medications actually are as good as they appear to be for addiction.

2a675999b97e,Is There a Place for Religion in Politics?,"us politics, separation of church and state, religion and belief, christianity, conservatism in the united states, populism, nationalism, republicans, donald trump, white house","To the Editor: In “ The Use and Misuse of Religion ” (column, Sept. 27), David Brooks makes a characteristically compelling case for the proper relationship between faith and politics. Yet as a lifelong Christian, I now find myself pondering the value of humanism rather than faith as an antidote to what torments us as a nation. Humanism focuses on tangible, common human need. Religion focuses on the unknown and the unseen. While religion has been a tremendous force for good, it has also poisoned politics and given rise to extremists who target “the other.” I remember first hearing John Lennon’s song “Imagine” in college — envisioning “no heaven,” “no hell” and even “no religion,” with “all the people living life in peace.” I was startled and offended then by what I thought was the lyrics’ blasphemous nature. Now, decades later, I appreciate the song’s wisdom, when, as Mr. Brooks writes, we fear that religion has become “a divisive and explosive force.” Cory Gideon Gunderson Lakeville, Minn. To the Editor: In this column, David Brooks exposes what many Americans sense: Christian nationalism is not faith enriching politics but politics hollowing out faith. At Charlie Kirk’s memorial, worship music mingled with partisan rhetoric, prayers blurred into campaign slogans and “martyrdom” was invoked as fuel for vengeance. This is little more than political idolatry dressed in religious garb. The danger is not simply overheated rhetoric. When Christianity is fused with a party platform, faith is reduced to a tribal marker and politics becomes spiritual warfare. Enemies are cast as satanic, compromise is treated as betrayal, and the Christian virtues of humility, charity and restraint are replaced by enmity and domination. As the column notes, the result is syncretism — “faith in Jesus and the faith in MAGA all cocktailed together.” That combination corrupts both church and democracy. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s showed another path: faith brought into public life with discipline, humility and an acknowledgment of human sin. By contrast, Christian nationalism sanctifies rage and power. America does not need a politics baptized in rapture; it needs citizens who can keep faith and politics in their proper spheres. Otherwise, as the column rightly warns, combustible zeal may consume both. Robert Stewart Chantilly, Va. To the Editor: David Brooks’s column risks normalizing Christian nationalism by portraying the fusion of religion and right-wing politics at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service as a natural extension of American democracy, rather than a distortion of it. He praises Erika Kirk’s forgiveness but overlooks President Trump’s public creed of vengeance, a glaring contradiction at the Republican Party’s core. If we are sincere about thinking clearly about God and politics, we should also listen to leaders like Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, an ordained minister, and the Texas House representative James Talarico, who is studying to be a pastor. These two public servants and others like them model a politics of faith rooted in justice, compassion and pluralism. Keith McNulty Marietta, Ga. To the Editor: The heart of Christianity, as Jesus taught, is rooted in love, mercy, humility and care for the poor and the marginalized. Yet too often we see people who proudly wear the Christian label act in ways that betray its core by promoting judgment, exclusion, cruelty and greed. This is not just a private failing. It damages public trust, deepens division and distorts the meaning of Christianity. True faith is not about titles or labels, but about how we live, how we treat others and how we serve the vulnerable. Donald Trump, who has identified himself as Christian and recently said he wants to “try and get to heaven, if possible,” could start by restoring lifesaving aid to hungry and starving children, here and abroad. Charlie Kirk preached “no charity, no good will, no mercy” and demeaned Black Americans and L.G.B.T.Q. people. Yet Jesus consistently welcomed those on the margins and called his followers to love without distinction. Christianity’s power is not in judgment or division, but in the daily practice of compassion, justice and love. H.E. Miller Babylon, N.Y. To the Editor: The problem with invoking God in politics is that it automatically creates an “us and them” environment. Those of us who are insufficiently religious are disqualified from participation. And while Christianity provides a commendable set of moral principles to guide our politics, many citizens live their lives with other sources of guidance. We live on a shrinking planet whose survival depends on our capacity to work with people who may not share our background. And ultimately, we are responsible for our actions, not God. Eric Greene Annapolis, Md. The White House, Marred To the Editor: Re “ The Rebranding of Democracy ,” by Debbie Millman (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 4): The recent reports about Donald Trump’s plans to alter the White House by adding a ballroom, estimated at 90,000 square feet, are infuriating. The White House is not Mr. Trump’s personal property; it belongs to the American people. It is held in public trust, stewarded by the National Park Service and preserved as a national symbol of our democracy. While past presidents have made modest, carefully reviewed updates to accommodate the needs of their time, those changes have always respected the integrity and history of “the people’s house.” By contrast, Mr. Trump has already gilded parts of the iconic structure and stripped the Rose Garden of its character, replacing it with concrete. “Gauche” hardly captures it; “tasteless” might be more accurate. Now, with construction of this ballroom reportedly underway, one has to ask: Is there no oversight to stop such irreversible damage? The White House should remain a symbol of our shared national heritage — not a monument to one man’s vanity. Steven Kahn Caroline Kahn Princeton, N.J. The Sharp Right Turn to Populism To the Editor: Re “ They Don’t Want to Live in Lincoln’s America ,” by Jamelle Bouie (column, Sept. 14): I wholeheartedly echo the sentiments Mr. Bouie expresses, but I do feel obligated to add a key distinction between actual American conservatism and the unrefined populism espoused by the current Republican Party. Until 2016, many American conservatives believed in an America fundamentally aligned with classically liberal ideals of freedom. While George W. Bush certainly had flaws, he embodied the creed of Republicans of old: a belief in free markets and free people. The icons of the modern right disavow the ideas of John Locke and the Enlightenment in favor of a simplistic and offensive vision of the United States as a homogenous nation. I’m not the biggest fan of Ronald Reagan or the traditional Republican Party, but the old G.O.P. did stand for something: a set of ideals. The new iteration of the Republican Party accepts what the great political philosopher Isaiah Berlin warned us all against: “a very vulgar historical materialism that denies the power of ideas, and says that ideals are mere material interests in disguise.” Mr. Bouie is right: The new G.O.P. is not the party of Lincoln or his ideals.

03dd60182069,The Appalling Campaign to Erase Jan. 6 Never Ends,"us politics, storming of the us capitol (jan, 2021), presidential election of 2024, fbi, republicans, pamela j bondi, donald trump, conspiracy theories, federal criminal case against trump 2020 election jan 6th","Why does Trump drone on and on about a rigged, stolen 2020 election in settings — for example, his recent speech to military leaders — where it has no logical place? Partly because he can’t quit his claims of victimhood, which have potent resonance in this age of grievance. Partly as a justification for his vendettas. But also because it allows him, his Republican abettors and the MAGA faithful to think and talk differently about Jan. 6. Sure, the rioters spun out of control, but can you blame them? Thieving Democrats and a cabal of their co-conspirators had usurped voters’ will. I think that at some point, on some level, Trump understood that his complicity in the violence of Jan. 6 — his responsibility for it, according to the articles of his second impeachment — was more damning than any of his other transgressions: an utterly inexcusable, definitively nullifying breach. I’m sure that some Republican members of Congress still, in the recesses of their dormant consciences, recognize it as such. That’s why they’ve questioned and recast Jan. 6 in so many ways, from so many angles, at such length. Trump and the Republicans who’ve hitched their political fates to him must defuse it, confuse it, make it go away. And to a shocking degree, they’ve succeeded. The outrageous actions by which Trump, at the end of his first term in the White House, sought to overturn the election results and cling to power are musty news, fuzzy memories, curiosities. There’s an audio recording — his voice, his words, no quarrel over the authenticity of it, no mistaking its intent — of a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call during which Trump orders Brad Raffensperger, the top election official in Georgia, to “find 11,780 votes” and thus convert Biden’s victory in the state to a Trump win. It became part of the Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis’s election interference and conspiracy case against Trump. But over time, that sinister conversation got less attention than questions about Willis’s professional conduct, about her personal life, about minutiae whose significance paled beside Trump’s intimidation tactics. That was the handiwork of Trump and his minions. That was the plan: Use ancillary melodramas, blanket denials and sweeping counteraccusations to create a dense fog in which everything blurs together and nothing is clear. Trump impugned the integrity of Jack Smith, the special prosecutor whose investigation may be connected to the examination of Republican lawmakers’ phone records that came up last week. He went after judges. He combined all of that into a narrative of political persecution fashioned precisely for our tribal times, and he did that so relentlessly and so operatically — he was a bona fide martyr! — that it thickened the fog and no doubt left many Americans less and less sure about the actual facts, the real culprits. Would he be this worked up about absolutely nothing?",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/opinion/january-6-trump-erase.html,Society,BBC,By Frank Bruni,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/opinion/13bruni-newsletter-image/13bruni-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:03:09+00:00,a73523a120d6e5ea28e7c44579ad33b45d75b030
33c4ef50db92,The New Julia Roberts Movie Seethes With Anti-Woke Resentment,"metoo movement, rape, after the hunt, movies, luca guadagnino, progressivism, julia roberts, us politics, democrats, brian grazer","The film stars Julia Roberts as Alma, a Yale philosophy professor on the verge of tenure after an unspecified break from academia. At a cocktail party at the home she shares with her psychotherapist husband, Frederik, we meet her brash friend and colleague Hank, played by Andrew Garfield, and her protégée, Maggie, played by Ayo Edebiri. We see Maggie and Hank leave together, and soon after, Maggie tells Alma that Hank sexually assaulted her. Hank, in turn, insists that Maggie made up the story after he confronted her about plagiarism. The resulting campus hysteria threatens to destroy not just Hank but Alma, too. There’s nothing wrong with making a movie about the anguish of cancellation, like the brilliant 2022 film “Tár,” or about an ambiguous claim of sexual transgression. “After the Hunt” fails not because of its premise but because it’s overwrought and self-satisfied. It’s about the terrifying power of the mob, with the mob conceived as the unreasonably angry students of the Ivy League. Some of the first words we hear are Roberts lecturing about Michel Foucault’s “Discipline and Punish”: “Foucault paints a picture of public torture performed in order to maintain the social contract,” she says. Then come the opening credits, which, in an apparent gesture of solidarity with Woody Allen, are rendered in his signature style: names listed alphabetically in white Windsor Light font against a black background. A trigger warning: There are some spoilers ahead. We never find out what happened between Maggie and Hank or even, exactly, what Maggie claims to have happened. She tells Alma that they were drinking in her apartment, he kissed her and he kept going after she said no. When Alma asks for specifics, Maggie gets offended: “Why do you need to know? He assaulted me!” Even after Hank is fired — which seems to happen almost overnight — we never learn whether he was accused of a kiss that went on too long, a rape or something in between, as if the school’s regime is so arbitrary that it doesn’t matter. What we do learn is that Maggie really is a plagiarist. Her professors, it turns out, only pretend to think she’s brilliant because she’s the daughter of megadonors and, presumably, because she’s Black and queer. (This isn’t a combination you see much in real life, where the kids of big-time donors are overwhelmingly white, but it underlines the movie’s sense that ostensibly marginalized identities are really sources of unearned advantage.) “You are the worst kind of mediocre student,” Alma hisses during a confrontation. “With every availability to succeed but no talent or desire to do so, yet so many resources, so much of other people’s time is wasted on you.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/opinion/after-the-hunt-metoo-backlash.html,Society,BBC,By Michelle Goldberg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/13goldberg-cjlm/13goldberg-cjlm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:02:10+00:00,2b09feaaf22b54ff0f6bc9c2ac3660c8567219bb
004b0a9bd1b0,Wacky Labels and Silly Names Are Killing Craft Beer,"beer, product labels, consumer behaviour","From that first stolen sip of my father’s Schlitz at a family crawfish boil, beer has been a constant in my life — a frothy river running through decades, cities, heartbreaks and celebrations. I’ve chased beer across continents and dive bars, in every style and setting, from a divine dubbel brewed by monks in a Belgian abbey to the occasional late-night can of gas-station lager that tasted like aluminum and questionable decisions. Beer has always been more than a drink. It’s a reward. A ritual. A refuge. But even I can admit: Beer has a problem. In 2023, beer consumption in the United States fell to its lowest level in decades. The industry faces both demographic issues (there are fewer young drinkers) and image ones (beer’s stubborn reputation as a carb-heavy relic for dads and dullards). People with remote jobs aren’t going for drinks after work, and taproom traffic hasn’t bounced back to pre-Covid levels. Hard seltzers and canned cocktails are cutting into beer’s share of a faltering market. And the drinking rate among Americans is at its lowest rate since the 1930s. For a time, the proliferation of small-batch craft beers helped elevate the beer industry into one that was less about keggers and more about connoisseurship. But even that trend is reversing: According to the Brewers Association, craft beer sales fell 4 percent last year. For the first time in two decades, more breweries closed than opened . But I’d argue the future of beer is still craft beer and that the pint glass is half full, not empty. It just needs something worth raising again. There are a few simple steps the craft beer industry can take to immediately address its downturn. For starters, it must abandon the I.P.A. arms race. Craft beer’s obsession with hops has gone too far, as what started as a rebellion against bland lagers has spiraled into a bitter, boozy blur. Double I.P.A.s. Triple I.P.A.s. Hazy. Juicy. Dank. West Coast. New England. Most taste like pine resin with a splash of grapefruit pith, and not in a good way. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

After the attacks on Sept. 11, my family, like so many others, put American flags outside our house and on our car. Once I started getting stopped by airport security, at age 11, my parents instructed me to always make eye contact with agents, to speak to them confidently and with a smile. These are the social equivalents of putting your hands in the air, of making it clear you’re one of the “good” Muslims, lest someone with the ability to make your life worse think you’re one of the “bad” ones. I met with Mr. Mamdani one afternoon last month at his campaign offices, where he recounted similar experiences. “Growing up Muslim in New York City after 9/11 was, to some extent, growing up having been marked as an other,” he told me. “I faced what I think many Muslim kids faced,” he said. “Whether it’s the names, the characterizations, the motivations.” If his experience coming of age after Sept. 11 was anything like mine — Mr. Mamdani and I are almost the same age — there was a shock to being singled out for our faith after the attacks. A degree of Islamophobia existed in America before that day, of course, but after it a pall of suspicion fell over us all, one that has never fully lifted. As a child, I found it confusing: Why was I, a fifth grader, getting stopped at the airport because I could be a terrorist? The logic didn’t track. But then you live with it, and living in that reality informs how you see the rest of the world. That’s true for Mr. Mamdani, too: “In some ways,” he said, “it was also a preparation for being in politics.” That preparation is evident on the campaign trail. Mr. Mamdani answers the relentless questioning of his beliefs about Jews, antisemitism, Hamas, Oct. 7, Israel’s right to exist — on and on — with an unwaveringly chipper attitude. Regardless of how he answers them, these “Do you condemn” questions deftly associate him with the actions and phrases that don’t always come directly from him, testing, probing, goading him to misstep. It’s maddening to watch, yet he answers them all, sometimes with a winking sense of humor. At a town-hall meeting of mayoral candidates hosted by the UJA-Federation of New York in May, he paused in the midst of a similar line of questioning on Jews and Israel, smiled and said: “These are all softballs! Come on!” The crowd tittered.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/opinion/zohran-mamdani-muslim-america-new-york.html,Society,BBC,By Meher Ahmad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/opinion/13Ahmad/13Ahmad-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg,2025-10-13T09:01:34+00:00,afe95be456c81aa7d346174aa191c0384a59ac62
b8eb1d8c37c9,I Resigned as Manhattan’s U.S. Attorney. Law Schools Are Missing the Point of My Story.,"college, law school, nyu, freedom of speech, censorship, civil unrest, charlie kirk, us, security, conservatism in the united states, us attorney","Since I resigned from my job as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in February, I have accepted several invitations from law schools to speak to students about public service. Students and administrators have seemed receptive to my message that the rule of law and our democracy rest on core principles, including civil disagreement and the pursuit of justice without fear or favor. I believe in those principles, which is why I resigned when I was unable to air objections to the dismissal of corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York City for reasons I considered improper. But lately I’ve been worried that while law school leaders are eager for me to lecture their students on the value of these ideals, they may be missing a key point: that these principles must be defended even when doing so is inconvenient or costly. Universities, no less than the professionals they teach, have an obligation to uphold civil dialogue as the bedrock of a functioning democracy. Administrators continue to overlook that this obligation means they must guarantee forums to explore a diversity of ideas safely and openly. A recent episode at New York University School of Law illustrates the problem. Administrators forced N.Y.U.’s Federalist Society chapter, a conservative student group, to cancel an on-campus event scheduled for this past Tuesday, Oct. 7, with my Manhattan Institute colleague Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional scholar whose recent book criticizes the illiberal takeover of legal education and the rise of antisemitism on many university campuses. The school’s reasons for denying event approval were a moving target, but when students questioned why the event was not viable on the chosen date, the school cited security reasons. After The Free Beacon reported on the cancellation and free-speech groups criticized N.Y.U., the law school reversed course and came up with the resources to host the event safely. This was not an isolated incident. For years, conservative speakers on campuses — from DePaul University to the University of California, Berkeley , to Dartmouth College — have had their events denied forums, shut down or derailed by security threats or anticipated backlashes that ostensibly posed safety concerns. Such incidents are a capitulation to extremists who use intimidation to censor speech and silence dissent rather than persuade through debate. In the case of Mr. Shapiro’s appearance, the law school said it merely asked students to find another date for the event. The school has claimed that this request had nothing to do with the content of the proposed program or the political views of the speaker, but there is an absurdity to the denial. Students who object to policies of the Trump administration or oppose Israel’s war in Gaza or who advocate abortion rights rarely have to worry that their campus speakers will be disrupted by protesters or generate security concerns related to the backlash of a student mob. Security concerns, real or fabricated, arise when a speaker promises to buck campus orthodoxy. And that is precisely when universities need to stand up for debate rather than surrender to those who would stifle it. The problem has taken on even more urgency with the killing of Charlie Kirk last month at Utah Valley University. Rising concerns about political violence are a tempting excuse to avoid hosting speakers who might ignite controversy or opposition. Instead, Mr. Kirk’s assassination should spur universities to do their part to protect and cultivate the free and safe exchange of ideas. In practice, that means that no students, including those presenting minority viewpoints, should be told that their ability to gather and discuss ideas will be contingent on a university’s willingness to keep them safe. Ensuring the safety of students and speakers should be an ironclad commitment. If there are security concerns, schools should proudly pay for as much security as is necessary, as defenders of civil dialogue and liberal education. Canceling events is proof of concept for student troublemakers. It further incentivizes those who threaten to silence their opponents by proving that such methods work. Mr. Shapiro is a case in point. In 2022 student protesters prevented him from participating in an event at a law school in San Francisco by shouting over him any time he tried to speak. Canceling his latest event would have achieved the same result of suppressing his speech, in the form of a prior restraint . To break the cycle of censorship, administrators should warn students: If you disrupt this event in a manner that censors speech, we will identify you and impose severe consequences. If a student organization engineers such a disturbance, the group’s leadership will face the same fate. When robust security is paired with meaningful consequences for those who violate campus policies, threats of disruption and violence will lose their force as a weapon to monopolize campus speech. In the long run, that is the right investment to ensure that Mr. Kirk’s killer and those who use less lethal forms of intimidation do not have the last word. There is a sad irony that the N.Y.U. law school’s initial instinct was that the event’s date — the second anniversary of the Hamas-led barbaric attack against Israeli civilians — was a reason not to host it, rather than to ensure that it moved forward. If there was ever a day to help students gather safely and hear from a speaker who has criticized antisemitism on campus, it was this one. Bad publicity seems to have prompted N.Y.U. to do the right thing, but it also exposed that universities are capable of surmounting security concerns when they have the will to do so.

e2400108fb28,Why So Many Gen Z-ers Are Drawn to Conservative Christianity,"generation z;gen z, conservatism in the united states, us politics, christianity, pentecostal church, evangelical, republicans, charlie kirk, ronald reagan, donald trump, us","Americans who think that Generation Z might offer hope for a less divisive, less polarized political future should think again. A close look at Gen Z reveals that today’s deep electoral divisions, ripping at the fabric of our politics, are likely to continue for years. That is particularly because of the role of religion, or its absence, in Gen Z, the people born from the late 1990s to the early 2010s. About a third of Gen Z-ers are nonreligious. Thirty-eight percent never go to church — a mark of the rise of the Nones, or Americans with no religious affiliation. But predictions that the Christian right would be moribund with Gen Z-ers have proved false. In the aftermath of Covid — and amid the longing for purpose, community and transcendence that many Gen Z-ers feel — a sizable minority of them have found their answer in conservative Christianity, fueling both a religious and a political revival among these young Americans. They bring a new attitude to the combination of faith and politics, and many see politics as a matter of spiritual warfare. According to survey data from the Barna Group, a Christian research organization, Gen Z-ers who go to church are more frequent attendees than churchgoers from older generations. Twenty-four percent of Gen Z-ers go to church every week (a slightly higher rate than for millennials and Gen X-ers). Many of these young Christians have turned to conservative politics — a near-seamless mix of Christian faith and the MAGA message. That mix was best demonstrated in speeches that wove political and religious themes at the memorial service for Charlie Kirk. Gen Z is clouded by despair. It’s not hard to imagine how young people traumatized by the isolation imposed by Covid and disillusioned by the perceived emptiness of secular liberalism might be drawn to a relationship with God and a purpose in life. Many were attracted by Mr. Kirk’s message of confidence and joyfulness in his conservative Christian faith. Some believe that they are in a spiritual war against “enemies” and that they can expect to be persecuted for their convictions from a hostile secular state or society. This belief is closely intertwined with the idea of spiritual warfare against demonic forces, which is especially popular in charismatic churches — that is, churches that encourage the use of miraculous gifts, such as speaking in tongues and faith healing. The Christian right of Gen Z is different from that of their parents’ or grandparents’ time. Members of those generations largely came of age starting in the Eisenhower era, when civil religion was so strong that the president led a prayer at his inauguration and signed legislation adding “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance. Schools in many regions started the day with classroom prayer or Bible reading. Then came the cultural shocks of the 1960s and ’70s. Many conservative evangelicals didn’t like what they imagined second-wave feminism, the sexual revolution and the gay rights movement would do to their families. They started political campaigns to return America to the civil religion and moral conservatism of the 1950s. Ronald Reagan was their champion. At first, many Christian right leaders seemed optimistic about their political prospects of success. In the 1980s many such leaders came from the Sun Belt, which was experiencing some of the highest economic and population growth rates in the country. But Gen Z Christians don’t seem to have a Reaganite confidence in the free market or a Sun Belt-influenced optimism. While the Christian right of the 1980s was largely led by Baptists, the Gen Z Christian right is much more likely to be charismatic. One study showed that approximately half of Gen Z and millennial churchgoers attended charismatic churches. (By contrast, only 24 percent of older respondents attended charismatic churches.) The nondenominational or charismatic church option is also appealing to some Black and Hispanic Gen Z Christians, who may shed their family’s traditional Democratic identity when they gravitate toward multiracial megachurches that are more politically conservative. Young male churchgoers now out pace young female churchgoers in weekly attendance, and for the first time in modern American history, they are more religious than their female peers. Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians have been particularly attracted to anti-institutional populism and to leaders who are strong and charismatic (in a nonreligious sense). President Trump has enjoyed extraordinarily high support from this group. Members of the Assemblies of God, one of America’s largest Pentecostal denominations, identify as Republicans at a higher rate than even Southern Baptists do. That’s not because they are just white conservatives; 44 percent of Assemblies of God members in the United States are Hispanic or nonwhite. They have found in Mr. Trump a perfect match for their anti-institutional populism. Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians might also be attracted to the language of spiritual warfare, which fits well with a Manichaean view of politics as a battle between good and evil. They also appear to be stronger culture warriors than other evangelicals. Charismatic evangelicals are more likely than other Evangelicals who are not charismatic to favor rolling back legal protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people. Today’s young Christian right voters may be less interested in specific matters of policy than in tribal identity. When the Republican Party abandoned its 40-year commitment to a national abortion ban last year, a few conservative Christians complained, but evangelical support for Mr. Trump remained as strong as ever. Political activism is less about getting a specific policy outcome and more about electing the candidate who is believed to be on God’s side. And in determining who is on God’s side, what counts is not so much a candidate’s faith or moral virtue but rather the person’s willingness to protect those seen as God’s people — that is, conservative Christians. Ultimately, for many Gen Z conservative Christian political activists, as with earlier generations, politics is a means to create a society that will not only protect the rights of conservative Christians to follow their conscience but also allow conservative Christian values to flourish. But in today’s political context, it is that last aim that has led at least some younger conservative Christians to question liberal democracy and religious pluralism altogether and to entertain the idea of a postliberal framework that might foster family-friendly values without allowing the sort of religious or ideological pluralism that might threaten those values. Gen Z Christian-right activists may soon face the realization that they will not win if their agenda is subject to a democratic vote — which means they will face a choice between feeling that they are a persecuted minority in a democratic system and fighting to be a victorious minority in a nondemocratic one. Right now, many Gen Z Christians are signing up to be martyrs in a society they believe will reject their views on sexuality, gender and absolute truth. But for those who grow tired of such sensed persecution, winning by rejecting democracy will be a temptation. Daniel K.

It Could Be Replaced With Something Better.,"foreign aid, foreign investment, developing countries, humanitarian aid, poverty, john dramani mahama, africa, brazil, ghana, latin america, united states agency for international development, malawi","Over the past year, wealthy countries around the world have undermined a decades-old consensus that human dignity is universal and that nations have a responsibility to further it. The shuttering of the United States Agency for International Development, which I led for five years, is just one piece of a broader, tragic retreat from a system of foreign aid that helped cure the sick, feed the hungry and empower the poor. Countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain and Germany, have slashed billions in assistance. Research published by The Lancet estimates that more than 14 million people could die as a result of American aid cuts alone — 4.5 million of them children younger than 5. This is a moral failure that will make the whole world less safe, less secure and less prosperous. Amid the tragedy, it is tempting to defend what we know. Fortunately, leaders in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere are building something new. They are taking ownership of their countries’ own development, figuring out ways to leverage new technology and, most important, encouraging private investment — long the single biggest challenge for development projects. Their initiatives are modeling a way to lift up the vulnerable that will be more sustainable in the 21st century. Eighty or so years ago, powerful nations came together around the concept of universal dignity, codifying that idea into institutions like the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Bank. This system helped usher in an era of extraordinary progress: transforming AIDS into a manageable condition, saving millions of children from dying of preventable causes and helping to cut hunger in low-income countries by more than 60 percent from 1970 to 2015. It also benefited donor countries by fighting diseases like Ebola abroad to protect lives at home and turning poorer countries into trade partners that created jobs. Yet while the system did enormous good, it also faltered as the world changed. That model was funded and thus directed by wealthy countries and centralized in large institutions. Over time, donor support and public support for international institutions proved inadequate, yet aid projects remained dependent on them. The work also increased as overlapping yet siloed initiatives proliferated in large part because the best way to find funding was rallying excitement about each new idea. In recent years, the African country of Malawi received about 55 percent of its health funding from an estimated 166 external sources . To keep the money flowing in, Malawi had to write at least 50 strategic plans to secure financing. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

b1b607841550,Trump Considers Overhaul of Refugee System That Would Favor White People,"us politics, live-detached, refugees;internally displaced people, race and ethnicity, discrimination, white people, alternative for germany, state department, homeland security, stephen miller, donald trump, christopher landau, right-wing extremism and alt-right, internal-open-access-from-nl","The Trump administration is considering a radical overhaul of the U.S. refugee system that would slash the program to its bare bones while giving preference to English speakers, white South Africans and Europeans who oppose migration, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The proposals, some of which already have gone into effect, would transform a decades-old program aimed at helping the world’s most desperate people into one that conforms to Mr. Trump’s vision of immigration — which is to help mostly white people who say they are being persecuted while keeping the vast majority of other people out. The plans were presented to the White House in April and July by officials in the State and Homeland Security Departments after President Trump directed federal agencies to study whether refugee resettlement was in the interest of the United States. Mr. Trump had suspended refugee admissions on his first day in office and solicited the proposals about how and whether the administration should continue the program. Trump administration officials have not ruled out any of the ideas, according to people familiar with the planning, although there is no set timetable for approving or rejecting the ideas. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential plans. The proposed changes would put new emphasis on whether applicants would be able to assimilate into the United States, directing them to take classes on “American history and values” and “respect for cultural norms.” The proposals also advise Mr. Trump to prioritize Europeans who have been “targeted for peaceful expression of views online such as opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist’ political parties.” That appeared to be a reference to the European far-right political party Alternative for Germany, whose leaders have trivialized the Holocaust, revived Nazi slogans and denigrated foreigners. Vice President JD Vance has criticized Germany for trying to suppress the views of the group, which is known as the AfD. A senior official said the Trump administration was monitoring the situation in Europe to determine whether anyone would be eligible for refugee status. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan had not been finalized. Mr. Trump enacted some of the proposals in the documents even before the plans were submitted to him, including slashing refugee admissions and offering priority status to Afrikaners, the white minority who once ran South Africa’s brutal apartheid system. Mr. Trump has claimed that Afrikaners face racial persecution in their home country, a claim vigorously disputed by government officials there. Police statistics do not show that white people are more vulnerable to violent crime than other people in South Africa . Taken together, the proposals provide a window into Mr. Trump’s intentions for a program that has come to symbolize America’s role as a sanctuary. Mr. Trump and many American voters have rejected that role after years of record illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border . Although the refugee program, with its meticulous screening processes and yearslong waits, is considered the “right way” of seeking protection in the United States, Mr. Trump has made clear he wants to crack down on immigration in general — both legal and illegal. According to the rationale laid out in the documents submitted to Mr. Trump, America’s acceptance of refugees has made the country too diverse. “The sharp increase in diversity has reduced the level of social trust essential for the functioning of a democratic polity,” according to one of the documents. The administration should only welcome “refugees who can be fully and appropriately assimilate, and are aligned with the president’s objectives.” To that end, the documents say, Mr. Trump should cancel the applications of hundreds of thousands of people who are already in the pipeline to come to the United States as refugees, many of whom have gone through extensive security checks and referrals. And Mr. Trump’s federal agencies proposed imposing limits on the number of refugees who can resettle in communities that already have a high population of immigrants, on the basis that the United States should avoid “the concentration of non-native citizens” in order to promote assimilation. Thomas Pigott, a spokesman for the State Department, would not comment on specific details of the documents, but he said: “It should come as no surprise that the State Department is implementing the priorities of the duly elected president of the United States.” He added: “This administration unapologetically prioritizes the interests of the American people.” The administration has made some exceptions to its refugee ban. According to the documents, federal agencies have worked to resettle a limited number of Afghans who assisted U.S. soldiers during the war. Critics say the plans exposes the president’s vision for what America should look like. “It reflects a preexisting notion among some in the Trump administration as to who are the true Americans,” said Barbara L. Strack, a former chief of the refugee affairs division at Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Bush and Obama administrations. “And they think it’s white people and they think it’s Christians.” Other changes include more intensive security vetting for refugees, including DNA tests for children to ensure they are related to the adults they are traveling with. Mr. Trump also is planning to slash the number of refugees allowed into the United States to 7,500 in the upcoming year, a drastic decrease from the limit of 125,000 set by the Biden administration last year. Mr. Trump is required by law to consult Congress on imposing a refugee limit, but White House officials say the government shutdown has delayed that. Administration officials are not done submitting proposals to the White House. According to a draft of a third report, obtained by The New York Times, the latest proposal calls for U.S. embassies to make referrals for who should be considered for refugee status, rather than the United Nations, which has long been the practice. The change would allow for greater American control of who gets funneled into the refugee pipeline. At the United Nations General Assembly summit last month, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, defended the Trump administration’s approach during a panel on refugee policies. “Saying that the process is susceptible to abuse is not being xenophobic, it is not being a mean or bad person,” Mr. Landau said. The administration has argued that allowing thousands of refugees from all over the world to enter the nation would overwhelm American communities that have already called for additional resources to assist the record number of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border during the Biden administration. Migrants at the border, however, seek protection through a separate program than refugees, who often wait years overseas before they are vetted to travel to the United States. The refugee program has historically received bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats. Mr. Trump and the architect of his immigration restrictions, Stephen Miller, have for years sought to limit the number of refugees entering the United States, particularly from Africa or Muslim-majority nations. During his first term, Mr. Trump demanded to know at a White House meeting why he would accept immigrants from Haiti and African nations, which he described as “shithole countries,” rather than Europe. His administration now appears prepared to turn those sentiments into policy. In the report, administration officials also proposed banning refugees from resettling in U.S. communities that have requested federal aid to assist migrants in recent years. But many local leaders and refugee advocates argue that not only can refugees adjust to life in America effectively, they also benefit local economies. Marian Abernathy, a lay leader at the Judea Reform Congregation synagogue in Durham, N.C., has helped refugees who had settled in her community since 2016, including a dozen families in the last four years from Afghanistan, Ukraine, Haiti, Venezuela and Syria. The refugees have worked as nursing aides, engineers, Uber drivers, medical technicians and lunch coordinators at local schools, she said. “They come to dinner at our houses,” she said. “We go to dinner at their houses. We go to events together, hang out at the museum. I don’t feel like they’re not integrated.” “I’ve rarely seen a group of people,” she said, “who work harder and who want fewer handouts.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-refugee-white-people.html,politics,BBC,By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Hamed Aleaziz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/us/politics/14DC-REFUGEES/14DC-REFUGEES-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T18:06:22+00:00,a90c7d8e59637742c9a228043e7e579183f75999
f2705e881df3,Trump Administration Authorizes Covert C.I.A. Action in Venezuela,"venezuela, cia, us politics, us foreign policy, us military, spying and intelligence agencies, drug abuse, nicolas maduro, donald trump, john ratcliffe, caribbean, live-detached, internal-open-access-from-nl","The Trump administration has secretly authorized the C.I.A. to conduct covert action in Venezuela, according to U.S. officials, stepping up a campaign against Nicolás Maduro, the country’s authoritarian leader. The authorization is the latest step in the Trump administration’s intensifying pressure campaign against Venezuela. For weeks, the U.S. military has been targeting boats off the Venezuelan coast it says are transporting drugs , killing 27 people. American officials have been clear, privately, that the end goal is to drive Mr. Maduro from power . The new authority would allow the C.I.A. to carry out lethal operations in Venezuela and conduct a range of operations in the Caribbean. The agency would be able to take covert action against Mr. Maduro or his government either unilaterally or in conjunction with a larger military operation. It is not known whether the C.I.A. is planning any operations in Venezuela or if the authorities are meant as a contingency. But the development comes as the U.S. military is planning its own possible escalation, drawing up options for President Trump to consider, including strikes inside Venezuela. The scale of the military buildup in the region is substantial: There are currently 10,000 U.S. troops there, most of them at bases in Puerto Rico, but also a contingent of Marines on amphibious assault ships. In all, the Navy has eight surface warships and a submarine in the Caribbean. The new authorities, known in intelligence jargon as a presidential finding, were described by multiple U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the highly classified document. Mr. Trump ordered an end to diplomatic talks with the Maduro government this month as he grew frustrated with the Venezuelan leader’s failure to accede to U.S. demands to give up power voluntarily and the continued insistence by officials that they had no part in drug trafficking. The C.I.A. has long had authority to work with governments in Latin America on security matters and intelligence sharing. That has allowed the agency to work with Mexican officials to target drug cartels. But those authorizations do not allow the agency to carry out direct lethal operations. The Trump administration’s strategy on Venezuela, developed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with help from John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, aims to oust Mr. Maduro from power . Mr. Ratcliffe has said little about what his agency is doing in Venezuela. But he has promised that the C.I.A. under his leadership would become more aggressive. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Ratcliffe said he would make the C.I.A. less averse to risk and more willing to conduct covert action when ordered by the president, “ going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do .” The White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment. The United States has offered $50 million for information leading to Mr. Maduro’s arrest and conviction on U.S. drug trafficking charges. Mr. Rubio, who also serves as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, has called Mr. Maduro illegitimate, and the Trump administration describes him as a “narcoterrorist.” Mr. Maduro blocked the government that was democratically elected last year from taking power. But the Trump administration’s accusations that he has profited from the narcotics trade and that his country is a major producer of drugs for the United States have been debated. The administration has asserted in legal filings that Mr. Maduro controls a criminal gang, Tren de Aragua. But an assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts that conclusion . While the Trump administration has publicly offered relatively thin legal justifications for its campaign, Mr. Trump told Congress that he decided the United States was in an armed conflict with drug cartels it views as terrorist organizations. In the congressional notice late last month, the Trump administration said the cartels smuggling drugs were “nonstate armed groups” whose actions “constitute an armed attack against the United States.” White House findings authorizing covert action are closely guarded secrets. They are often reauthorized from administration to administration, and their precise language is rarely made public. They also constitute one of the rawest uses of executive authority. Select members of Congress are briefed on the authorizations, but lawmakers cannot make them public, and conducting oversight of possible covert actions is difficult. While U.S. military operations, like the strikes against boats purportedly carrying drugs from Venezuelan territory, are generally made public, C.I.A. covert actions are typically kept secret. Some, however, like the C.I.A. operation in which Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, are quickly made public. The agency has been stepping up its work on counternarcotics for years. Gina Haspel, Mr. Trump’s second C.I.A. director during his first administration, devoted more resources to drug hunting in Mexico and Latin America. Under William J. Burns, the Biden administration’s director, the C.I.A. began flying drones over Mexico, hunting for fentanyl labs, operations that Mr. Ratcliffe expanded. The covert finding is in some ways a natural evolution of those antidrug efforts. But the C.I.A.’s history of covert action in Latin America and the Caribbean is mixed at best. In 1954, the agency orchestrated a coup that overthrew President Jacobo Árbenz of Guatemala, ushering in decades of instability. The C.I.A.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 ended in disaster, and the agency repeatedly tried to assassinate Fidel Castro. That same year, however, the C.I.A. supplied weapons to dissidents who assassinated Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina, the authoritarian leader of the Dominican Republic. The agency also had its hands in a 1964 coup in Brazil , the death of Che Guevara and other machinations in Bolivia , a 1973 coup in Chile , and the contra fight against the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua in the 1980s.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html,politics,BBC,By Julian E.

b7a4ea7df8fc,Trump Allies Push to Bolster Putin-Backed Balkans Leader,"us politics, us foreign policy, lobbying, milorad dodik, donald trump, rudolph w giuliani, rod r blagojevich, richard grenell, christopher j lacivita, bosnia and herzegovina, state department, treasury department","Just weeks after President Trump took office for a second time, one of his most prominent supporters, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was 4,500 miles away wearing a different hat. Instead of the red “Make America Great Again” ball caps that have been a defining feature at Trump rallies for the last decade, Mr. Giuliani’s new hat promised to “Make Srpska Great Again.” His appearance in the hat at a political rally for Milorad Dodik, the president of the small self-governing territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, marked the public debut of a costly and wide-reaching influence campaign aimed at persuading the Trump administration to come to the defense of a pro-Russian authoritarian trying to fend off threats to his reign at home and in Washington. The effort has grown to include well-connected lobbyists and lawyers with ties to Mr. Trump who are being paid about $300,000 per month or more, according to filings with the Justice Department. Their goal is to present Mr. Dodik, a towering figure in Republika Srpska, as a sort of Trump of the Balkans. The campaign has cast Mr. Dodik, who is contesting an effort to remove him from the presidency and fighting to lift U.S. sanctions, as a victim of the same sort of political prosecutions that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump claim they have faced, and as someone willing to cut lucrative deals with Washington. The Trump administration has publicly kept its distance from Mr. Dodik’s cause, and he faces significant obstacles to remaining in power. But the influence campaign has secured some victories, including meetings with two top diplomats appointed by the president, and previously unreported sanctions relief for Mr. Dodik’s team. The effort represents a blueprint for a new type of foreign lobbying tailored to the Trump era. Under previous administrations, foreign politicians, oligarchs or businesses would pay bipartisan lobbying firms to draft white papers and schedule congressional meetings to try to demonstrate that their clients’ interests aligned with those of U.S. policy. Now, they turn to Trump insiders to appeal directly to the president or his base by echoing his grievances, stoking his ego or framing their asks as consistent with his political or business agendas. The approach reflects Mr. Trump’s status as the leader of a right-wing populist wave sweeping the globe, said former Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois, who was elected as a Democrat. Mr. Blagojevich’s conviction for political corruption was wiped away by a Trump pardon in February, and he signed a contract with Mr. Dodik’s government in March. “I can recognize it when it’s happening in other places, so it was very obvious to me when I was sitting in prison: I’d watch what they were doing to President Trump,” Mr. Blagojevich said. “The same thing is being done in Europe now, and not just Dodik and the Republic of Srpska, which is a tiny little place in this big world we live in. But it’s being done in France, it’s being done in Brazil, it’s being done in Romania.” As part of his contract, Mr. Blagojevich has written a barrage of social media posts and opinion essays decrying the prosecution of Mr. Dodik in the Bosnian court system for disobeying the international entity overseeing the peace agreement ending bloody sectarian fighting in the 1990s between Bosnians, Serbs and Croats in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Blagojevich has compared what he calls the “ weaponized persecution ” of Mr. Dodik and other right-wing populist politicians around the world to the corruption cases against himself, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump. Mr. Dodik and his allies are not the first to try the approach. In Albania, a conservative opposition leader fighting corruption allegations from the State Department and prosecutors at home sought to link himself to Mr. Trump by hiring a number of his allies , including Chris LaCivita, the president’s 2024 campaign co-manager, and a lobbying firm with connections to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro, his son and their allies cultivated close ties to the Trump orbit. Mr. Trump this summer unsuccessfully tried to use the levers of U.S. government power to force Brazil to drop charges against Mr. Bolsonaro for attempting a coup after his election loss in 2022, which he falsely claimed was tainted by widespread election fraud. Mr. Giuliani is still dealing with legal , financial and reputational consequences from his efforts as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer to overturn President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the 2020 election. While Mr. Giuliani no longer has a formal role with Mr. Trump, he remains in good standing with the president, who has announced plans to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the former New York mayor. And Mr. Giuliani — who sought business during the first Trump term from clients in the Middle East , Africa and Ukraine — continues to be seen around the world as a conduit to the president. “You and President Trump understand better than anyone the ruthless nature of the deep state and the lengths they go to in attacking political opponents,” Mr. Dodik wrote in a letter inviting Mr. Giuliani to Republika Srpska. Mr. Giuliani posted the letter on social media in February. About one week later, he was in Srpska’s capital, Banja Luka, wearing the “Make Srpska Great Again” hat. An autonomous region that was enshrined by the Dayton Accords peace agreement in 1995 as one of two political divisions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska has been led for much of its existence by Mr. Dodik. Once seen as a moderate who would de-escalate sectarian tensions, Mr. Dodik has instead become an unapologetic Serbian nationalist. As he fell out of favor in the international community, Mr. Dodik increasingly sought protection from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and approval from Mr. Trump . In the final weeks of former President Barack Obama’s term, his administration refused Mr. Dodik’s request to travel to Mr. Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, then imposed sanctions on him for undermining the Dayton agreement. The sanctions stayed in place during the first Trump administration and were supplemented during the Biden administration, which penalized Mr. Dodik’s family and aides. On a podcast recorded during Mr. Giuliani’s visit in February, the former mayor told Mr. Dodik that “there’s this very, very serious prejudice against you” by Democratic administrations. Mr. Giuliani praised Mr. Dodik as “a very strong friend of the United States,” citing a move by Mr. Dodik’s government to project an image of Mr. Trump onto the official presidential residence celebrating his victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. His spokesman, Ted Goodman, said Mr. Giuliani was not paid by Republika Srpska to make the trip and appearance with Mr. Dodik, but rather by private interests. Mr. Goodman did not identify them, but he said Mr. Giuliani was not obligated to register as a lobbyist with the Justice Department. He said Mr. Giuliani “remains a highly sought after public speaker” around the world, citing his leadership after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Representatives from the Republika Srpska government did not respond to requests for comment. A day after Mr. Giuliani appeared at the rally, Mr. Dodik was sentenced in absentia by a Bosnian court to a year in prison or a fine, and was barred from holding public office for six years for flouting the rulings of Christian Schmidt, the international official whose office, which is primarily funded by the United States and the European Union, oversees the implementation of the Dayton agreement. Mr. Dodik challenged the authority of Mr. Schmidt, suggested he would withdraw Srpska from the Dayton agreement and initially refused to acknowledge a call from an election commission for a November special election to replace him. His defiance drew a rebuke from Mr. Rubio , who called his behavior “destabilizing.” But Mr. Dodik received support from Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and Mr. Putin, who separately hosted him in their respective capitals . After Mr. Giuliani became the first high-profile Trump ally to call attention to Mr. Dodik’s problems this year, the Srpska government began hiring lawyers, lobbyists and consultants to seek Mr. Trump’s support, including Mr. Blagojevich. Their tactics entailed pressing the administration to lift the sanctions, re-examine the Dayton agreement and brush back Mr. Schmidt, including by dangling the prospect of allowing U.S. companies to mine Srpska’s coveted lithium deposits in exchange for siding with Mr. Dodik. Among the hires, according to filings with the Justice Department, were Marty Obst , a former aide to former Vice President Mike Pence; and Christopher Harvin , a veteran Republican operative who worked on the 2016 Trump campaign and has represented a number of foreign countries. The government also retained two politically connected lawyers. One of them, Marc Zell, is a prominent figure in Israeli-American conservative circles whom Mr. Dodik has courted . A contract calls for Mr. Zell’s firm to be paid $1 million for one year, with an additional “success fee” for “bringing about the cancellation/termination of all sanctions.” The other, Robert Garson, had represented Mr. Trump in a lawsuit against the journalist Bob Woodward that was dismissed in July . In August, Mr. Garson entered into a two-month $100,000 contract with Srpska. Mr. Zell and Mr. Garson did not comment on their roles in the effort. Mr. Schmidt’s office declined to comment. Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had worked to promote stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and “to preserve the peace afforded by the Dayton Accords.” The Dodik deputy present at the Montenegro meeting, who is also under sanctions, held separate meetings with Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, including one in Washington last month, according to the people. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the meetings or the influence campaign, but said the agency “routinely meets with a broad spectrum of political, economic and civil society leaders.” Days after the meeting with Mr. Landau, at the request of the State Department, the Treasury Department temporarily lifted sanctions that had been imposed during the final days of the Biden administration against Mr. Dodik’s chief of staff , Danijel Dragicevic, according to a copy of the waiver obtained by The New York Times . Mr. Dragicevic helped facilitate the influence campaign. The waiver raised the prospect that other Dodik allies may soon see sanctions relief. The Treasury Department declined to comment. The influence campaign continued even after Mr. Dodik last month tacitly acknowledged the efforts to remove him, announcing during a forum in Russia that he was anointing a loyalist, who is also under sanctions by the Treasury Department, as his preferred successor in next month’s special election. If Mr. Dodik follows through and the Trump administration lifts the sanctions, then the influence campaign would have been a success, because Mr. Dodik is expected to continue wielding power in Srpska as chairman of his party, said Adnan Cerimagic, an analyst at the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based think tank. “What he will have gotten out of this is to keep his coalition together and to get his preferred successor,” said Mr. Cerimagic. “So he will then be able to say that he won in the end, because his people are still in power.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-dodik-srpska-lobbying.html,politics,BBC,By Kenneth P.

In remarks on the Senate floor, Mr. Schumer, the minority leader, accused Republicans of being quick to denounce hateful and violent language by Democrats but reticent to do so when the same kinds of statements came from their supporters. “Too many Republicans seem willing to call out violent rhetoric only when it comes from the other side. But these same Republicans never seem willing to denounce it when it comes from their own ranks, and that’s dangerous. Violent political rhetoric is an attack on everyone,” Mr. Schumer said. The 2,900 pages of chats, including one message that declared “I love Hitler,” were reported by Politico on Tuesday. The Young Republican National Federation is a political organization with thousands of G.O.P. members across the country between the ages of 18 and 40. Mr. Trump has said nothing about the chats, which Politico reported included at least one low-level member of his administration, since they surfaced, nor has any Republican leader in Congress. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the former chair of the House Republican Conference, was the highest-profile Republican in Washington to call out the “alleged vile statements” in a social media post. But she also called Politico’s reporting on the Young Republicans — a group she recently accepted an award from — a “hit piece,” and deflected to criticizing Democrats. Some state Republican leaders have condemned the texts and taken actions against some members of the chat. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Schumer’s criticism. Mr. Schumer specifically called out Vice President JD Vance for dismissing the outrage over the thousands of violent, bigoted and misogynistic texts as “pearl clutching.” Mr. Vance sought to deflect attention instead to a leaked text exchange from Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, in which Mr. Jones suggested that the state’s Republican House speaker deserved to be killed, as “far worse.” “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence,” the vice president wrote in a post on social media on Tuesday, including a screenshot of messages from three years ago in which Mr. Jones appeared to acknowledge having said he hoped the then-G.O.P. speaker’s children would die. The Democratic nominee has since apologized for the texts. Mr. Schumer called the vice president’s post “outrageous” and accused Mr. Vance of condemning violent political discourse “only when it serves his interests.” “Every single Republican leader, from the president on down, has to condemn these attacks immediately, or all of their cries about hate speech seem to be one-sided or bogus,” Mr. Schumer added.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/schumer-young-republicans-texts.html,politics,BBC,By Megan Mineiro,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15trump-news-schumer-topart-wkzm/15trump-news-schumer-topart-wkzm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T17:52:59+00:00,c99bcabe9ac4525c290320e96a931ec546a26d6e
928d861dd560,NBC News Cuts About 7% of Staff,"journalism;journalist;news media, comcast, nbc, nbc news, tom llamas, layoffs;furloughs","NBC News on Wednesday began laying off about 150 people, or roughly 7 percent of its staff, as the news division rebounds from a corporate spinoff and the continued headwinds affecting the traditional television industry. The cuts, which will affect nearly every part of the organization, precede a much-anticipated split that will separate many of Comcast’s cable channels — MSNBC, CNBC and USA Network — from the rest of its businesses, including NBC News. No anchors will be affected by the cuts, according to two people familiar with the matter. Affected employees, who are getting 60 days’ notice, will receive severance and a subsidized benefits package, the two people said. The cuts comprise roughly 2 percent of the NBCUniversal News Group, which also includes the Telemundo Spanish-language network and the local division, which serves 42 owned-and-operated TV stations across the country. Those organizations are not being affected by the cuts, the two people said. NBCUniversal News Group is hiring for the roughly 140 positions open across the group, and about a dozen of the eliminated positions are being converted into new roles. Like every TV news organization, NBC News is undergoing a rapid transformation as viewers increasingly consume news digitally. The division is planning to introduce a new subscription service this year and recently started a new podcast, “Here’s the Scoop.” NBC News has also been reshuffling its most prominent on-air talent: This spring, the news division announced that Tom Llamas would be the new anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” replacing Lester Holt. The cuts come ahead of marquee events for the NBCUniversal News Group. The organization’s Telemundo division is making preparations to air the World Cup, and it is expanding a sports group in advance of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/business/media/nbc-news-layoffs.html,Business,BBC,By Benjamin Mullin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15biz-nbc-news-fklb/15biz-nbc-news-fklb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T18:32:21+00:00,a13fdcc350c8681bdb00b329fbe73b75d143efc3
2ee185d9cb3f,The Lonely House Republican Still Coming to Work During the Shutdown,"us politics, closings, federal budget, redistricting and reapportionment, gerrymandering, house races, congressional elections, house of representatives, congress, republicans, kevin kiley, adelita grijalva, mike johnson, hakeem jeffries, california","It was 2 p.m. on Tuesday in the empty Capitol, 14 days into the government shutdown, and Representative Kevin Kiley of California, one of the few House Republicans who showed up for work in Washington this week, was excited that he finally had something to do. He strode through the underground tunnel connecting the Rayburn House Office Building to the House chamber to attend a pro forma session, the two-minute-long routine meeting that is required every three days during a recess. As congressional doings go, this was underwhelming. The session was gaveled in and then immediately gaveled out, with no business conducted. Few of Mr. Kiley’s colleagues were there; by his count, he laid eyes on a total of 11 House Republicans throughout the day. Still, it was a highlight in Mr. Kiley’s otherwise empty hours. “This is the big excitement here!” he said. “It’s the only thing on the calendar!” Mr. Kiley, 40, a politically vulnerable, center-leaning Republican in a rightward-lurching conference, decided to show up to work as a one-man protest against Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to send the House home indefinitely as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight. He said he thought lawmakers should be in Washington working on the appropriations bills they still need to pass, holding congressional hearings and marking up legislation — not back home on an unplanned hiatus for which staff did not even have enough lead time to pack with district events or constituent meetings. “We’re supposed to be here — this is what the schedule said,” Mr. Kiley said during an interview in his office after the brief excitement of the pro forma session. “We were supposed to be here two weeks ago, and last week and this week.” Mr. Kiley has been calling on Mr. Johnson to bring back the House, so far to no avail. He has no quibble with his party’s stance in the shutdown fight — he holds Democrats responsible for blocking the stopgap funding bill Republicans pushed through the House — but he argues that Republicans should be at work negotiating a solution rather than at home casting blame. “The decision to shut down the government and the decision to shut down the House, which Speaker Johnson made, are completely independent things,” Mr. Kiley said. “I thought, ‘Maybe I can practice what I preach. I’ll come back myself, even if the speaker isn’t making it happen.’” So on Tuesday, Mr. Kiley was sitting in his office with a few interviews planned and not too much else on his schedule. “I’ve said that my door is open for any member who is here who wants to talk,” he said. “That’s, a lot of times, how you actually come up with a solution to these things.” So far, it was mostly journalists who had taken him up on his open-door policy, but he said he had succeeded in having a few “informal conversations” with Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Kiley is in a unique position to break so publicly with Republican House leaders. He is one of five California Republicans who are all but certain to lose their seats in the next midterm elections if voters grant final approval next month to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s newly drawn congressional districts. Mr. Kiley has been frustrated that Mr. Johnson did nothing to help him in the redistricting push, which President Trump instigated in efforts to give Republicans a better shot at keeping their small House majority. Earlier this year, Mr. Kiley begged the speaker to bring to the floor legislation to prohibit mid-decade redistricting across the country. Mr. Johnson refused. Now, Mr. Kiley is behaving like a lame duck with nothing to lose, even while expressing optimism that he could still win in a newly drawn district. (Most of the other Republicans who have been publicly critical of Mr. Johnson’s decision to keep the House out of session are actual lame ducks: Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska and Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina have both criticized Mr. Johnson’s decision, and have both have announced they are not running for re-election.) “The new sixth district does now include Yolo County,” Mr. Kiley joked. (YOLO, the colloquial acronym for “You Only Live Once,” was an attitude he conceded could be used to describe his recent interactions with House Republican leadership.) “I’m never going out of my way to create conflict just for the sake of doing so, but I’m willing to do it when it’s necessary,” he said. He is finding more opportunities these days. He said it was ridiculous that Mr. Johnson had refused to seat Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who had won a special election 21 days earlier to succeed her father, Representative Raúl Grijalva, after his death in March. Democrats have accused Mr. Johnson of holding up her swearing-in because she is poised to provide the final signature needed to force a floor vote on whether to demand that the Trump administration release the Epstein files. Mr. Kiley has not signed the petition. If he did, he could provide the 218th signature needed to force a floor vote himself. Mr. Kiley said he had no plans to sign on and that his “focus right now is getting the government open and the House operating.” He wouldn’t speculate about Mr. Johnson’s motivations, but said he disagreed with the decision to leave Ms. Grijalva in political limbo. “She won her election; swear her in,” Mr. Kiley said. “The folks who voted for her, and even those who didn’t, don’t have a representative when they could.” Mr. Johnson’s justification for dismissing the House amid a government shutdown is that it already passed a short-term government spending bill and has finished its work until the Senate finds a way out of the impasse. But the whole reason a funding extension was needed in the first place was that neither chamber of Congress had completed any of the individual annual spending bills required to fund the government. The House could be working on those bills now, Mr. Kiley noted. Besides, he argued, the more lawmakers are around, “the better opportunity we will have to end this impasse, because we can actually talk to each other and that’s kind of how a lot of things actually get done.” He added: “If the Senate is unwilling to do what we want, then it’s at least worth exploring whether there’s a way to find common ground.” None of that is happening right now. Instead, Democrats are holding showy protests and a constant stream of news conferences; Senate Republicans are holding show votes almost daily to spotlight Democratic intransigence; and House Republicans are scarce. On regular conference calls Mr. Johnson has been holding with members, there has been little pushback against his decision to keep lawmakers home indefinitely. But Mr. Kiley said he was not alone in his objections; he’s just the most vocal. “There a lot of members who believe we should come back,” he said. “When you’re not here, it becomes difficult for people to build the coalitions necessary to move things in a different direction.” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, made a similar argument. He told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Johnson was not bringing his conference together to meet in person because “there will be substantial pressure on Republican leaders to actually do what the American people are asking Congress to do, which is reopen the government and decisively address the Republican health care crisis.” Carl Hulse contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/kevin-kiley-shutdown.html,politics,BBC,By Annie Karni,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-kiley-vlpm/15dc-kiley-vlpm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T19:07:04.546000+00:00,d85b62c757ef1d8906553455d80afe9fa534363a
9916770c16a6,‘It Was Just an Accident’ Review: A Liberation Story Straight From Iran,"movies, jafar panahi, it was just an accident","The searing Iranian movie “It Was Just an Accident” is a tragicomedy but doesn’t fit into a tidy categorical box. It’s a fiction that its writer-director Jafar Panahi has drawn straight from life, his own included, and which unpredictably mixes tones and story types. It’s a drama about retribution, a comedy about collective action (and action in general), a low-mileage road movie and a slow-boiling ethical thriller. It’s a cry from the heart, a comic howl in the dark and one of the year’s essential movies. The premise — victimized men and women turn the tables on their victimizer — is the stuff of law and culture, daydreams and nightmares. “It Was Just an Accident” is the first movie that Panahi directed since he was released in 2023 after spending seven months in Tehran’s Evin Prison for asking about other detained filmmakers. It was his second time in Evin, after his 2010 arrest. Sentenced for what was called “propaganda against the state,” he spent three months in the prison, where he was put in isolation and subjected to regular interrogations. After his release, he was kept under house arrest. Although banned from filmmaking, Panahi continued to make movies, including “ This Is Not a Film ” (2012), a self-referential documentary shot partly with an iPhone. He directed it with another filmmaker, Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, and managed to smuggle it out of Iran. For “It Was Just an Accident,” Panahi has drawn from his experiences and those of other political prisoners that he met during his second internment. (Given some of the disturbing accounts of prison in the movie, it seems essential to note that he has said he wasn’t physically tortured.) Panahi is no longer banned from filmmaking, but because he didn’t want to submit this movie to the authorities who oversee the media, he shot it covertly; he also made nightly backups of his digital material in case he was arrested again. The longstanding travel ban on him has been lifted, which means that when the movie won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May, Panahi was able to accept the award in person. “It Was Just an Accident” is a story of crime and punishment, the twin engines of countless movies ranging from the luridly exploitative to the soberly high-minded. That’s the case in American cinema, where filmmakers are especially turned on by transgressors; nothing says homegrown entertainment like villainy that runs amok before a sheriff, a detective or a superhero shuts it down. Old Hollywood self-censorship may have proscribed that justice be done; today’s movies generally just lazily follow the same template. Even those movies that shroud themselves in the cloak of law and order often reductively play like vengeance stories, only with judges and juries meting out punishment. Yet what if justice is itself unjust? That question haunts “It Was Just an Accident.” Even so, Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), an affable mechanic with worried eyes and a bushy mustache, doesn’t seem to be thinking about jurisprudence when he grabs another man off a busy street in Tehran during the day without anyone else noticing. The other man, Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi), had some trouble with his car one recent night and had, by chance, stopped by Vahid’s workplace seeking help. Vahid had heard the man before he saw him; specifically, he had recognized the eerie rhythmic squeaking that Eghbal makes when he walks. It’s a sound that Vahid associates with a brutal guard with a prosthetic, known as Peg Leg, who had tortured him in prison. Panahi stages and shoots the kidnapping with unfussy economy, keeping the hand-held camera largely trained on a jittery Vahid as he tracks Eghbal. The entire thing is fast and blunt. Vahid easily overpowers the other man, whom he subdues with a shovel before putting him in a white panel van. Panahi keeps a discreet distance throughout this sequence: You see Vahid swing the shovel but you don’t see Eghbal, an instructive and revealing directorial choice. After Vahid takes a swing, Panahi cuts to a panorama of a desert where, in long shot, you see the mechanic standing in a grave that he’s busily shoveling. It’s deep — his head scarcely clears the top — and is flanked on one side by the van and a leafless tree on the other. The scene is arresting partly because of the contrast between the grandeur of the natural surroundings and the shocking violence to come: Vahid soon begins burying Eghbal alive. Panahi isn’t a flashy stylist, and for much of the movie his visual approach is generally unobtrusive, with his filmmaking in service to the story. Yet from the start of “It Was Just an Accident,” he also subtly shifts between a kind of restrained theatricality and a more quasi-documentary inflected realism. The movie opens and closes in darkness, for instance, as is often the case in theater. Squint and the panorama could serve as a stage backdrop, while the stark silhouette of its one lonely tree brings to mind the one in “Waiting for Godot.” The movie gets progressively complicated and surprisingly, absurdly funny. Eghbal insists that he isn’t the guard, which upends Vahid’s plans and sends him on an unexpected adventure. In short order, he puts Eghbal back in the van and drives off to find other ex-prisoners in hopes that they can identify his captive. With Eghbal very much alive and stuffed in a coffinlike work box, Vahid solicits help from a photographer, Shiva (Maryam Afshari), another former prisoner, who is shooting photos of a bride- and groom-to-be. The bride, Golrokh (Hadis Pakbaten), is wearing her satiny white gown and she, too, is an ex-prisoner. Before long, she and everyone else has clambered into the van, en route to the unknown. Like those clowns Vladimir and Estragon in “Godot,” the characters in “It Was Just an Accident” spend a lot of time waiting. Even after Vahid and the others return to the open grave, they remain uncertain about the prisoner’s identity and equally unsure about what to do. (“From afar,” one tells another who’s sitting against the tree, “you reminded me of that play we saw,” making the “Godot” connection explicit.) As they rack up miles, their journey becomes literal and philosophical, filled with stops and starts, digressions and circularity. They bicker, bond, cozy up to one another and share grim prison stories, fretting and arguing about next moves. They know that they may well be digging their own graves, too. The characters’ dilemma in “It Was Just an Accident” can be viewed as a metaphor for contemporary Iran, but this is a movie very much rooted in life — in history as it is happening. Reality jumps off the screen here, and it can shock; the first time I watched it, I gasped at the sight of Shiva’s bared head, the hijab having long been a mandatory part of the country’s dress code. Shiva does occasionally cover her head in a loose scarf in public. Yet she and everyone else here live in a different world than the one that existed before Iran’s recent Woman, Life, Freedom protest movement. That gives the movie a startling immediacy that deepens its fiction even as it blurs the divide between the world on the screen and off it. “It Was Just an Accident” has moments of brutality, largely verbal, but the most shocking thing about it is Panahi’s generosity. The movie touches on social discontent and, at one point, a character rails about “the system” while another responds that “those scumbags created the system!” As he does throughout, Panahi doesn’t tip what he thinks. Instead, here and elsewhere, he allows his characters to speak their minds and voice their rage while he clocks their quirks of personality, their jagged edges and raw humanity. None know what to do. Yet while the characters’ existential agony may continue after the movie ends, what Panahi very clearly wants you to know is that, like Estragon and Vladimir, they’re not waiting alone.

b197c4bba31d,D’Angelo’s Pleasure Principle,"r&b, d'angelo","Where did I get the idea that a man had to scream his want, need, ain’t-never-leavin’ in order to quiver some loins? Church, probably. A lot of radio. I mean, my drawers will drop for a screamer. And yet D’Angelo was an exemplar of the other way: hard elegance, meticulously conceived seduction, maximal texture. He rejected the blunt, febrile, “do me, baby” approach. You’d never find him howling or catching the Holy Ghost up in your bed. He made three differently perfect albums in 30 years, and on each his desperation sounds almost indistinguishable from his delight. And I suppose if I could make music with this much smoldering and insinuation, where most of the instruments seem both off on their own journeys yet utterly respondent to the matter at hand — if I could be this urgent, this urgently slouched, this urgently recumbent , my bewilderment and heartbreak might also sound sublime. D’Angelo, who died on Tuesday at 51 , was a gentleman. Rarely, as a singer, did he raise his voice. Rarely was that necessary. Many great singers aim for the stratosphere. His vocals pooled around you. He multiplied himself and blanketed you with his devastating stank. You never had to doubt whether he was there for you; on these recordings he’s everywhere. It’s notable that the one time he loses it on a record — like, really hit a vocal roof — is at the summit of “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” an erotic thriller of ascent, slow jam as roller coaster. It takes almost six of the song’s seven-plus minutes for him to arrive at the climax. And what makes his arrival up there so spectacular isn’t just that he loses it. It’s the way he luxuriates in the release, wailing into and over himself. Then suddenly, it’s just … over, like, finale-of-“The Sopranos” over. He’d proven he could get to the top of Prince Mountain and upon reaching the peak, he just jumps off and lands in the album’s next and final track, “Africa,” lest we get the impression that skywriting is what his musicianship was all about. The man never had to brag about his swag. Your ears work — here’s the prowess. That first album, “Brown Sugar,” explored sexual generosity and the time good loving takes. His keyboard and organ work do so much riffing here. The defining sound of the title song has no traceable melody — it’s all jazz. The organ talks for just about the entire album, like a second set of lyrics. The notes don’t last long. They’re little skin-tingling kisses, fingers on the nape, along the spine, behind the ears. Oh, not your spot? Well, just tell him. These songs won’t end until he finds it. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Thousands of Gazans were also held in Israeli military detention, many as “unlawful combatants,” without any legal process. Their numbers are difficult to verify, though a recent investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine and Local Call found that as few as one in four of them had been classified as fighters even in Israel’s own military databases. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , echoing reports by Amnesty International and B’Tselem , the Israeli human rights organization, documented testimony by Palestinians who said that while incarcerated they have been subject to beatings, torture, rape and extreme deprivation. Men and women spoke about loud music played for hours on end, attacks by dogs, waterboarding, suspension from ceilings and severe sexual and gender-based violence. Some of the prisoners released this week confirmed that they, too, had been exposed to brutal conditions and abuse. (The Israeli Army has previously said it “rejects outright allegations of systematic abuse of detainees.”) Legal experts and scholars will decide whether the alleged torture, denial of adequate food and death in these prisons meet the criteria to be termed genocide according to international law. There can be no doubt, however, that Israel’s war on prisoners was the third front in its assault on Gaza and the West Bank, and it involves possible crimes under the Geneva Conventions that have gone largely unseen by anyone but the victims. These prisoners, too, are hostages to the conflict, and they, too, deserve justice. This past summer, as part of a New York University research project, I conducted in-depth interviews with more than a dozen Palestinians who had recently been released. Working through local contacts, I spoke with some people remotely and others in person in the West Bank. Among them were longtime detainees who had contributed to the longtime Palestinian prisoners’ movement, which started in the late 1960s. Since then, incarcerated Palestinians organized themselves into an effective pressure group, struggling to attain rights and privileges consistent with international law. Through hunger strikes and hard sacrifices, they gained access to, among other things, books, medication and visits by family members and lawyers — although they are held in Israeli locations largely inaccessible to Palestinians, a violation of international law.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/opinion/gaza-hostages-israel-war-west-bank.html,Society,BBC,By Andrew Ross,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/opinion/10Ross/10Ross-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T19:00:10.331000+00:00,6bf91f92d8b2acf19cb85604e85fa0f90b1d9fd3
76c475d52d40,Trump Signs Memo Expanding His Authority to Spend Federal Money,"us politics, federal aid, federal budget, us military, closings, pete hegseth, donald trump","President Trump on Wednesday signed a memorandum significantly expanding his administration’s authority to repurpose unspent federal funds to pay members of the military during the government shutdown, escalating his challenge to the authority of Congress on spending matters. Mr. Trump’s memorandum gives Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, wide authority to repurpose funds, even though no such permission has been granted by Congress. It states that Mr. Hegseth, in coordination with the White House budget office, should use “any funds appropriated by the Congress that remain available for expenditure in Fiscal Year 2026 to accomplish the scheduled disbursement of military pay.” It says such funds should have “a reasonable, logical relationship to the pay and allowances of military personnel, consistent with applicable law.” Some Democrats have balked at the way Mr. Trump has repurposed money during the shutdown, arguing that his actions are most likely illegal and undercut Congress’ constitutional power. But Republicans have been daring Democrats to enter a political fight over the issue of military pay. “If the Democrats want to go to court and challenge troops being paid, bring it,” Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference on Tuesday. The memo gives the Trump administration broader authority than it had previously assumed to repurpose funds. The administration had already said it planned to tap about $8 billion in unspent research, testing and evaluation money from the prior fiscal year to pay the troops. Mr. Trump wrote in the memo that active duty military personnel would probably miss their next paychecks, on Oct. 15, because of the shutdown, an outcome that “presents a serious and unacceptable threat to military readiness and the ability of our armed forces to protect and defend our nation,” he wrote. The federal government has been shut down for more than two weeks as Democrats demand changes to health care policy to avoid significant cost increases for many Americans .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-federal-funds-government-shutdown.html,politics,BBC,By Luke Broadwater,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15trump-news-military-pay1-lhcz/15trump-news-military-pay1-lhcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T20:27:40+00:00,3f6e176b205bd206b5a90c9b18513ae9397a8dca

The administration has recently rebranded the Defense Department as the War Department. Mr. Hegseth’s comments come as Ukraine’s allies seek to ramp up pressure on Russia. European Union nations are working to finalize further sanctions on Moscow, and they and Ukraine’s other allies have been pushing for the United States to join in on applying more economic pressure. And Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has been asking for long-range Tomahawk missiles that could strike deep into Russian territory. President Trump, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky in Washington later this week, has hinted that he might be open to giving Ukraine access to such weapons. “I might say, ‘Look, if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,’” Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One on Sunday. After appearing to waver on its support for Ukraine early in 2025 — and after Mr. Zelensky’s painful Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump and other administration officials in February — the United States has in recent months taken actions that have reassured Europe that the White House will stand with Kyiv. But the United States has also prodded its European allies to commit more money to their own defense, and it is European money funding the weapons Ukraine is now buying from the United States. “We remain cleareyed about the fact that the most effective deterrence to Russian aggression are, number one, a lethal, capable and European-led NATO,” Mr. Hegseth said. He also cited a credible Ukrainian military. He urged Europe to “translate goals into guns, commitments into capabilities.” While he was returning from Wednesday’s meeting at NATO, Mr. Hegseth’s plane made an unscheduled landing in Britain, the Pentagon said. It attributed the stop to a crack in the plane’s windshield. “The plane landed based on standard procedures and everyone onboard, including Secretary Hegseth, is safe,” Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said on social media .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/hegseth-russia-ukraine.html,politics,BBC,By Jeanna Smialek,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15NatoHegseth-jmfb/15NatoHegseth-jmfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T20:04:00.542000+00:00,4a7e314f30880799ad1ba53df9e95dd7227be820
5a0ac36b4646,"Hamas Says It Has Returned All Hostage Remains It Can Recover, Putting Fragile Truce at Risk","israel gaza war, military, kidnapping and hostages, war crimes;genocide;crimes against humanity, fatalities;casualties, peace process, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, israel katz, donald trump, gaza strip, israel","Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said on Wednesday night that it had handed over all of the remains of Israeli hostages that it had been able to recover without additional equipment, potentially putting a cease-fire with Israel in the Gaza Strip at risk. In a statement, the Palestinian militant group said that it has “committed to what was agreed upon and handed over everyone it had in terms of living captives and what it had in terms of bodies that it could recover.” But it said that it needs “special equipment” to find and extract the remains of the rest of the deceased captives, adding that it was “making great efforts.” According to the terms of a cease-fire brokered by international mediators last week, Israel and Hamas would stop fighting and the militant group would return all the hostages it held — both living captives and the bodies of those who had died, totaling 48 people — in exchange for the freeing of Palestinians held by Israel, among other provisions. Hamas freed the 20 living hostages on Monday, and militants in Gaza had in the days since handed over the remains of eight people. Israel has identified six of those bodies as Israeli and one as Nepali. The identity of the eighth was not yet clear. The announcement that Hamas was unable to retrieve the remains of additional hostages came after the militant group handed over two more coffins to the Red Cross on Wednesday, putting the total number of bodies it has handed over at 10. That, however, left the remains of over a dozen people unaccounted for. While the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, acknowledged receipt of two coffins from the Red Cross late on Wednesday night, a representative for Mr. Netanyahu declined to immediately comment on Hamas’s latest statement. The truce agreement called for the immediate handover of all remaining bodies of hostages in Gaza — there were about 25 deceased captives thought to be held there before the cease-fire. But the deal acknowledged that some bodies could be difficult to locate and may take more time to retrieve because of the widespread destruction in the enclave. Two years of Israeli strikes have reduced much of Gaza to rubble. On Monday, the Israeli government had been weighing measures to penalize Hamas for not turning over more bodies, according to two diplomats briefed by Israeli officials and three Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics. On Wednesday, after Hamas’s announcement, the office of Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, said in a statement that he had directed the Israeli military to prepare a plan for the total defeat of Hamas in Gaza if the group did not abide by the terms of the deal unveiled by President Trump late last month, which also demanded Hamas’s disarmament. “If Hamas refuses to abide by the agreement, Israel, in coordination with the U.S., will return to fighting and work to completely defeat Hamas, change the reality in Gaza and achieve all the goals of the war,” the statement said. The question raised by Hamas’s latest statement is whether it will be interpreted as a violation of the agreement by Israel and the United States. Mr. Trump had previously criticized Hamas on Tuesday, saying in a post on Truth Social that “the job is not done.” “The dead have not been returned, as promised,” he wrote. Mr. Trump also claimed that Hamas had agreed to disarm, though the group has not publicly confirmed that it would. “They said they’re going to disarm and if they don’t disarm, we will disarm them,” Mr. Trump said. Under the terms of the deal, Hamas must share whatever intelligence it has about where bodies may be found, and there is still some chance that Israeli officials may accept what were the group’s expected protestations of being unable to retrieve the remains given the conditions in the Gaza Strip. The truce deal outlined how the remains of former hostages in Gaza might be located and returned if Hamas was unable to do so right away. It calls for the establishment of a joint task force, to include the United States and other mediators, that would share information and help find the remaining bodies, according to three Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak publicly. Those officials said Israel believed that Hamas knew the location of many, but not all, of the bodies.

3b93e3497381,Judge Throws Out Children’s Lawsuit Against Trump’s Energy Policies,"climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, us politics, lawsuits, decisions and verdicts, environment, pollution, judiciary, montana, our children's trust","A federal judge in Montana on Wednesday dismissed a novel lawsuit filed by 22 young people alleging that three of President Trump’s executive orders on energy and the environment violated their constitutional rights. Judge Dana L. Christensen wrote that he had “reluctantly” made the decision, despite convincing evidence presented by the plaintiffs during a two-day hearing last month showing that the executive orders would hasten climate change and exacerbate risks to the plaintiffs’ health and safety. In the 31-page decision, Judge Christensen wrote that the plaintiffs in the case, Lighthiser v. Trump, lacked a legal basis to bring the suit, largely because the harms they described could not be ameliorated by a judicial decision. The suit was simply too broad in scope and too amorphous to be actionable, he said. “Plaintiffs are effectively asking that this court order the United States to return to the environmental policy of the previous administration,” Judge Christensen wrote. The request for an injunction to block the three executive orders, he said, would require the court to monitor “an untold number” of federal agencies and determine whether their actions went against the court’s ruling. “This is, quite simply, an unworkable request for which plaintiffs provide no precedent,” the judge wrote. It was beyond the court’s remit, he concluded, to create environmental policy. He wrote that the case was similar to Juliana v. United States, a landmark case filed by some of the same plaintiffs in 2015. That case ultimately was dismissed after years of legal wrangling . The new lawsuit was filed in May by Our Children’s Trust and Public Justice, two public-interest law firms. They said on Wednesday that they would appeal Judge Christensen’s decision. “The judge recognized that the government’s fossil fuel directives are injuring these youth but said his hands were tied by precedent,” said Julia Olson, the founder of Our Children’s Trust and the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. She said the courts “cannot offer more protection to fossil fuel companies seeking to preserve their profits than to young Americans seeking to preserve their rights.” Judge Christensen dedicated long portions of the decision to recounting what expert witnesses and plaintiffs had testified about, including evidence that the climate is “changing at a staggering pace” because of the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide caused by the production and burning of fossil fuels. The Justice Department, which represented the president as well as the 12 federal agencies and their leaders named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The record further demonstrates that climate change and the exposure from fossil fuels presents a children’s health emergency,” the judge wrote. But in another passage, he said that while the court was troubled by the specter of climate change, “this concern does not automatically confer upon it the power to act.” Daniel J. Metzger, a senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said that the case was still a useful exercise despite its swift dismissal. “Briefing and arguing the case gave these plaintiffs the opportunity to explain the importance of these issues in a way captured public attention and blazed paths for future litigation,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/climate/montana-youth-trump-climate-lawsuit-dismissed.html,World,BBC,By Karen Zraick,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15cli-montana-lawsuit-htcp/15cli-montana-lawsuit-htcp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T20:19:37+00:00,4ac0e590266d725f150891f324df6c0d3f95c453
9f6ce4aae942,Trump Offered a Helping Hand to Argentina. It Backfired.,"us foreign policy, economy, currency, election, stimson center, treasury department, javier milei, donald trump, argentina, us","As President Javier Milei of Argentina faced a deepening economic crisis, President Trump rushed to the rescue of his political ally with a generous $20 billion bailout. Then came the fine print. To secure help from the United States, Mr. Trump made clear on Tuesday, Mr. Milei’s embattled political party would have to first pull off a victory in what are emerging as momentous and challenging legislative elections this month. “If he doesn’t win, we’re gone,” Mr. Trump said as he welcomed Mr. Milei, who he has called his “favorite president,” to the White House. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.” In Argentina, those comments were taken by many as a clear attempt by Mr. Trump to put his thumb on a sovereign country’s electoral process. The fallout was swift. The peso tumbled as investors went on a panicked selling spree of Argentina’s currency. Mr. Milei’s political opponents railed against what they called American extortion, urging voters to reject his party at the polls. And Mr. Milei’s government rushed to try to assure Argentines that Mr. Trump wouldn’t abandon the nation based on Mr. Milei’s political fortunes. To many, Mr. Trump’s conditional economic support represented yet another attempt to influence, through economic sticks and carrots, the internal affairs of another Latin American country. The turmoil that followed also highlighted the risks Mr. Milei faces as he shackles his political fortunes, and Argentina’s economic future, to America’s deep pockets and Mr. Trump’s fickle friendship. “Trump might have sabotaged his favorite president — by both giving him too much support and too little support,” said Benjamin Gedan, a senior fellow and director of the Latin America Program at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit in Washington. Mr. Milei, a self-described radical libertarian, has worked hard to earn Mr. Trump’s good graces. He has made more than a dozen trips to Washington over the last two years, consistently gushed about the American leader and mirrored much of his foreign policy and his attacks on “woke leftists.” His bet seemed to pay off last month when the U.S. Treasury made the highly unusual move of stepping in to help Argentina stave off an economic meltdown by promising to buy billions of dollars worth of Argentine pesos. Mr. Milei’s trip to Washington this week was meant to be a victory lap highlighting his close ties with Mr. Trump and bolstering confidence in his leadership among voters back home. Yet, rather than a key lifeline, Mr. Trump’s help may have backfired. “What could have been interpreted as help, the way Trump phrased it ended up sounding more like extortion,” said Lucas Romero, a political consultant, who runs Synopsis, a local polling firm. Argentines wary of American meddling in their affairs could punish Mr. Milei at the polls. Surveys earlier this month showed that more than 60 percent of Argentines have a negative view of Mr. Trump. On Tuesday, Mr. Milei’s national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, tried to walk back Mr. Trump’s comments, suggesting that he didn’t mean to hitch the bailout to the legislative contest. “Trump was talking about philosophy, not the October election,” she told a news channel. “Let the markets calm down, let everything continue as usual and not fall into panic.” This is not the first time that Mr. Trump’s efforts to save an ally have triggered a fierce backlash. He used tariffs and sanctions against Brazil to try to help former President Jair Bolsonaro avoid a prison sentence. Mr. Bolsonaro wound up convicted of plotting a coup to stay in office and faces a prison sentence. And in Canada, Australia and elsewhere, politicians aligned with the American president have also been punished at the polls, while those who have defied him have been catapulted to victory , a phenomenon that has become known as the “anti-Trump bump.” Mr. Milei, who was elected in 2023 on promises to fix Argentina’s chronically troubled economy, already faced headwinds going into the legislative election on Oct. 26, in which his party needs to shore up more support if he is to push ahead with more spending cuts and other economic measures. In recent months, both voters and investors had signaled that they may be growing impatient with Mr. Milei. While Mr. Milei has reined in inflation and slashed a bloated budget, he has struggled to jump-start Argentina’s stagnant economy and find solutions to the nation’s longstanding financial challenges. A defiant Congress has also pushed back on his budget plans, while corruption scandals ensnaring his sister and closest adviser have eroded Mr. Milei’s political credibility. When Mr. Milei’s party suffered a crushing defeat in a provincial election last month, he was suddenly faced with an economic meltdown, as investors abandoned Argentina’s currency amid worries that the South American nation, with its long history of defaulting on loans, may again struggle to make its debt payments. Then the U.S. Treasury made the highly unusual move of stepping in to help Argentina with a $20 billion currency swap, casting the decision as a way of protecting Mr. Milei’s economic vision and ensuring the stability of a strategic partner in Latin America. The U.S. Treasury said it was ready to do “what is needed” to stop markets from derailing Mr. Milei’s economic reforms. Mr. Trump’s plan to bail out Argentina has also touched off political blowback in the United States, with Democrats accusing Mr. Trump of helping a foreign country while the U.S. government remains shut down. The move has also angered U.S. farmers since China has been buying billions of dollars in soybeans from Argentine farmers and has stopped buying the commodity from the United States, fueling a crisis on American farms. The United States has offered financial aid to foreign countries in the past, typically in rare cases when an important trade partner faces an economic crisis that threatens to spill across its borders. Argentina is not a major U.S. trading partner. Still, Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Milei’s economic approach, casting him as a political kindred spirit. “He’s MAGA all the way,” Mr. Trump said during Mr. Milei’s visit on Tuesday, adding that he hoped the Argentine leader’s economic ideas spread across Latin America. It remains unclear whether the United States will follow through with its promises to help Argentina through the enormous currency swap, which would inject foreign currency that the nation’s central bank badly needs to stabilize the economy. With less than two weeks to go before what amounts to a referendum on his policies, what is clear is that Mr. Milei must now convince Argentines, and Mr. Trump, to place their faith in his economic vision. “It was already a hard slog,” Mr. Gedan said. “And this has made it much more challenging.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/americas/argentina-trump-javier-milei.html,World,BBC,By Ana Ionova and Daniel Politi,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15argentina-trump-jwpc/15argentina-trump-jwpc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T20:02:20.517000+00:00,3b65ba9eab579499c18709a4be510dad5ee79477

So it’s not like the relationship between us and ants or us and oak trees. It’s more like the relationship between, I don’t know, us and us, or us and tools, or us and dogs, or something. Maybe the metaphors begin to break down. Why don’t you think in the back and forth of that relationship there’s the capacity to maintain a rough balance, not a balance where there’s never a problem, but a balance where there is not an extinction-level event from a super smart A.I. that deviously plots to conduct a strategy to destroy us? I mean, we’ve already observed some amount of slightly devious plotting in the existing systems. But leaving that aside, the more direct answer there is something like, one, the relationship between what you optimize for, that the training set you optimize over, and what the entity, the organism, the A.I. ends up wanting has been and will be weird and twisty. It’s not direct. It’s not like making a wish to a genie inside a fantasy story.

35303425c959,How to Fight a Zombie Fire,"wildfires, fires, california, climate change;global warming","Except it wasn’t. The Lachman fire hadn’t been fully extinguished. It had just disappeared underground, where it continued to smolder, burning through buried organic material below those eight acres in an unsettlingly surreptitious pattern that is known to most fire scientists and firefighters but that civilians are only now beginning to appreciate. The charging document used the term “holdover fire.” The more colorful phrase is “zombie fire,” and it heralds a disconcerting risk calculus for anyone staring down or trying to mitigate the terrifying threat of a catastrophic burn. In recent years, fire-conscious Americans across the arid West would look out on parched landscapes, knowing that nearly everything they saw was ready fuel and worrying about what would happen if some accident — a downed power line, a spark thrown by heavy machinery, a reckless cookout or even outright arson — should happen to ignite it. Perhaps it will take decades to thin the landscape of all that fuel, but in the meantime, you might tell yourself, we can reduce, or even eliminate, the number of ignitions, at least on those days of highest fire risk. Zombie fires offer a different perspective: that the landscape itself could yield the ignition, at almost any point, no matter the precautions. The earth below our feet is now a wick and can burn for days or weeks or even months without our knowing, waiting to explode. The Lachman zombie came alive again on Jan. 7 — what had been an underground burn so calm it produced only little puffs of smoke turned into a fire monumental enough to engulf large swaths of the spectacular Santa Monica mountains, threatening several neighborhoods adjacent to the one and a half it utterly destroyed. To fire experts, holdover fires are not exactly new. Many lightning-caused fires begin this way — a tree is struck in the midst of a thunderstorm wet enough to stop the trunk from burning, while underground the root system begins to smolder. Historically, wildland firefighters were taught to stay with a fire “until the last smoke,” afterward testing for underground fire by pressing the ground with a bare hand, then sometimes digging up the several yards of ashen earth to expose the fire to water, like tilling multiple feet of burning soil. More recently, they’ve begun using infrared imaging to do that monitoring — though, in the Palisades, they did not, even after returning to the site on Jan. 3 to respond to a report of smoke in the area. (This is one reason that while some climate skeptics took the Rinderknecht arrest as permission to believe that arson rather than warming is driving the new age of American wildfire, many of those in the Palisades raging about local response saw it as confirmation of their own suspicions.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/opinion/los-angeles-zombie-fire.html,Society,BBC,By David Wallace-Wells,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/26/magazine/26mag-climate/26mag-climate-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T20:13:07+00:00,746a536c6f8fd958fd1d5765bab7b7e9244ec15e
45824671be60,China’s Own Immigration Backlash,"international relations, foreign workers, communist party of china, china, donald trump, nicolas maduro, venezuela","China may not be ready for an influx of foreigners In the race for global talent, it can often appear that China is gaining ground on the United States. While President Trump cuts research funding for universities, China is pouring money into science. The number of high-profile scholars who have left the U.S. for China is growing; Chinese students who once dreamed of an American education are now choosing to stay home. So when China introduced a new type of visa , called a K visa, for young science and technology workers, just as the Trump administration introduced steep new fees for highly skilled worker visas, many around the world saw it as another way that China may be pulling ahead in an economic rivalry that encompasses trade, tariffs and talent. Then came the backlash . The response to the K visa seems to have caught even the Chinese government by surprise. It helps illustrate why predictions that China is on the verge of becoming the next global talent hub may be premature. A hard country for foreigners As news of the visa spread across Chinese social media, the dominant reaction was not celebration but horror. High-profile commentators worried that China would become a country of immigrants — not, in their eyes, a good thing. Racist and xenophobic comments spread furiously, especially about Indians, who make up a significant share of the high tech work force in the U.S. Others worried the visa would worsen already record-high youth unemployment in China. China has virtually no history of inbound immigration. Foreigners provoke a range of reactions, including curiosity and suspicion influenced by geopolitical tensions between China and the West. There are also practical challenges. The ability to speak Mandarin is crucial to navigating daily life. Getting a visa and work permit can be cumbersome. Even routine tasks, like renewing a home Wi-Fi contract or buying concert tickets, can be more difficult for people without Chinese ID cards. Heavy censorship of the internet and a rigidly controlled political environment can also be hard for people from other countries to get used to. Some headway, some challenges China has tried to address some of these issues, because the government really does want science and technology talent, especially at high levels. Some universities give prominent foreign-born professors round-the-clock personal assistants when they move to China. But that kind of special treatment isn’t doable on a large scale. And even some Chinese-born, Chinese-speaking scientists who have returned to China after years away say they have trouble readjusting to the political and cultural climate. That’s not to say that China isn’t making headway on its goal to attract the world’s best and brightest. Plenty of prominent scientists have moved to the country in recent years. Perhaps even more consequential for the future pipeline of talent in the U.S., young Chinese scholars who went to the U.S. to study — and once would have tried to stay — are returning to China in greater numbers. If the U.S. keeps making itself a less attractive place to study and work, China certainly may look more appealing. But the backlash against the new visa is a reminder that it has its own challenges to address, too. Related: China’s decision to tighten export controls on rare earth metals was not only about strengthening its grip on the world’s supply of the crucial minerals, my colleague David Pierson writes . It was also a high-stakes ploy to jolt Trump into paying attention to what Beijing felt were attempts by his subordinates to sabotage a U.S.-China détente.

The U.S. authorized C.I.A. covert action in Venezuela The Trump administration is stepping up its campaign against Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian leader. U.S. officials said the C.I.A. was secretly authorized to conduct covert action in the country. The new authority would allow the agency to carry out lethal operations. The development comes as the U.S. military is drawing up options for Trump to consider, including strikes inside Venezuela. For weeks, the U.S. military has been targeting what it calls drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan coast, killing 27 people. U.S. officials have acknowledged that their goal is to drive Maduro from power. Hamas cracks down on rivals in Gaza Deadly clashes between Hamas and rival Palestinian clans could complicate the fragile cease-fire that took hold on Friday. Since Monday, at least 10 members of Hamas’s security forces and at least 20 members of rival Palestinian groups have been killed in the fighting , according to local officials. Israel has acknowledged that it also sought to undermine Hamas by backing rival Palestinian clans, with mixed results.

97d6e537b99a,The Penny’s Demise Is Leaving Some Businesses Shortchanged,"coins, retail, convenience store, customer service, restaurant, fast food, currency, burger king, home depot, love's travel stops","Bad news for the thinkers among us: Retailers are increasingly unable to offer us pennies. Earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was winding down the production of the penny, which long ago began costing more to make than it’s worth . Several Federal Reserve Bank sites around the country, which distribute the coins to banks and credit unions, have already stopped fulfilling orders for pennies . This is putting some retailers in a bind, especially when customers don’t have exact change for transactions that are not rounded to the nearest nickel. This month, a consortium of retail groups , including the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Grocers Association, wrote to members of Congress urging clear guidelines on how to proceed. The groups called for legislation to round transactions to make it easier to give exact change, and to facilitate check cashing at stores. “Unless these services are covered by legislation,” the letter reads, “many low-income customers may lose access to the services they need and have come to expect.” While the government has not offered guidance for what stores should do if they run out of pennies, some retailers appear to be taking it upon themselves to adapt. Earlier this month, Kwik Trip, the convenience store chain based in La Crosse, Wis., announced that its 850 stores across the Midwest would round cash transactions down to the nearest nickel , though the price of cashless transactions would remain the same. There are signs that the shortage is beginning to affect other American businesses, such as Sheetz, the convenience store chain based in Altoona, Pa. WGAL-TV spotted a sign in one store in south-central Pennsylvania that said, “Attention Customers: The U.S. Mint will no longer produce pennies, so we are short on change!” Instead, the store encouraged customers to use credit or debit cards, or a phone payment app. Additionally, the store encouraged customers to “round up” their cash purchases to support charity, or to “cash in one dollar’s worth of spare pennies to receive a self-serve drink.” Love’s Travel Stops, an Oklahoma City-based convenience store chain, is also dealing with shortages, with a similar policy of rounding up change, a measure that a company representative said was “temporary” while the business works toward a long-term solution. “Its impact is already evident across our retail operations,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “A number of Love’s locations across various states are impacted, and that number continues to fluctuate.” In a Reddit forum devoted to the Home Depot, someone reported visiting a store that was requiring exact change for cash transactions , citing the penny shortage. Representatives for Home Depot and Sheetz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fast food chains are likely to be affected as well. Burger King is still accepting pennies, for now. “However, due to the shortage, exact change may not be possible,” a Burger King representative said in an email on Wednesday. “Restaurants experiencing a penny shortage recommend that guests pay with credit, debit or exact change when possible.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/business/penny-circulation-retailers-change.html,Business,BBC,By Sopan Deb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15xp-pennies-vzjc/15xp-pennies-vzjc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T20:54:18.969000+00:00,d4c9f85611edbe58dec8ea0f902f8a7f4dfef5d9
17a7879a02f4,A Different Way to Think about the Middle East: Right vs. Right,"military, us politics, israel gaza war, war crimes;genocide;crimes against humanity, civilian casualties, terrorism, war;armed conflicts, peace process, judaism, human rights, politics, arabs, gaza strip, israel, parents circle, hamas","My keyboard, so used to criticisms of President Trump, is shocked as I hammer out this column. But Trump genuinely deserves great credit for (belatedly) ramming through the Gaza cease-fire and release of hostages and detainees. Bravo, Mr. President. Yet what lies ahead is more prayer than plan, and to make this a lasting peace it would help if we all discarded the Manichaean paradigm of good versus evil that many Westerners apply to Israelis and Palestinians (while disagreeing on who gets which label), making compromise difficult or impossible. To make progress, it may help to think of the conflict not in terms of right versus wrong, but of right versus right. The Middle East, as I see it, reflects a contest between two national yearnings with a measure of right on each side. Two peoples are fighting each other to preserve their hold on land to which they have ancient roots, and each is traumatized by the other’s violence. Israel is not only an economic and technological marvel but also a democracy for its own citizens, albeit an increasingly flawed one. Palestinian citizens of Israel have a more meaningful vote than citizens of neighboring Arab countries, and there is a freer press and more space for civil society watchdogs and human rights groups. There is much to admire about Israel. At the same time, Palestinians have the same rights as Israelis to a state, self-determination, freedom, opportunity, dignity and hope. To regard as morally acceptable the oppression that Palestinians routinely suffer in the West Bank with no end in sight, or the mass killing and starvation they have recently endured in Gaza, is to reject the fundamental credo that all humans are created equal. Whatever your view about the Middle East, we should acknowledge that an Israeli Jewish baby and a Palestinian baby are moral equivalents, each with the same right to grow up in freedom without fear of bus bombs, missiles or ethnic cleansing.

64fa8f5dd051,When the Trump Guardrails Fall,"us politics, republicans, donald trump, fbi, presidential election of 2024, conservatism in the united states","Since Donald Trump first became president in 2017, I have written many articles — and even a book — that focused on the efforts by his aides to contain his impulses and stop him from waging a retribution campaign against his enemies. Throughout my reporting, I — like many journalists in the midst of an intense and complex story — wondered: Was I accurately capturing the facts? I knew that the people around Trump often justified working in his administration by saying they would serve as guardrails against his most extreme impulses, but how could I know for sure that these checks on his power were actually the force holding him back? I had those doubts because we, as reporters, very rarely get to see the counterfactual, to test our reporting by witnessing how the world would play out if the circumstances were different. But Trump’s second term has given us that unique opportunity. The people who sought to restrain the president back then, like his former chief of staff John Kelly and his White House counsel Donald McGahn II, are gone, and so are the hypotheticals. We are now seeing how a truly unshackled Trump uses his power. Nine months into Trump’s second term, he has done several things he was stopped from doing during his first term. He has exerted more direct pressure on the Justice Department to bring charges, apparently spurring prosecutors to secure an indictment against at least one target who eluded him during his first term. And he has greatly expanded presidential powers, including by deploying the military on domestic soil in more sweeping ways than he did during his first term. In tonight’s newsletter, I’ll explain what Trump’s second term has taught us about his first: The guardrails worked, up to a point. ( See: Jan 6. ) And many of the stark warnings about what would happen without them — which were issued loudly during the presidential campaign by the very people who had once sought to restrain the president — have proved true. An eye on the Justice Department As early as 2017, Trump tried to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions to prosecute his rivals, like Hillary Clinton. But Sessions and top administration aides managed to distract Trump for months. Sessions held onto his job for nearly two years, and no charges were brought against Clinton. At the time, Trump himself was under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller III for obstructing the F.B.I.’s inquiry into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Trump complained endlessly about why his own Justice Department was investigating him, casting a cloud over his presidency, without looking into his perceived enemies. As the pressure built on Trump, he became more fixated on the idea of not only prosecuting his rivals, including the former F.B.I. director James Comey, but siccing the I.R.S. on them. Repeatedly, Kelly and McGahn managed to stop Trump. They refused to order the Justice Department to investigate his rivals, telling him that what he wanted to do was potentially illegal. McGahn even wrote Trump an extraordinary memo in which he warned him that he could be defeated at the ballot box — or impeached — if he tried to meddle in prosecutions. The Justice Department’s prosecutorial decisions remained insulated from the president. While many of his perceived enemies came under investigation , none were ever charged. This left Trump angry, convinced that his aides and political appointees had wrongly constrained him. The warnings begin In the four years Trump was out of office, he was indicted four times. At the same time, his aides, including Stephen Miller, an adviser during his first term who is now his deputy chief of staff — considered the lessons they learned during his first term and figured out how Trump could harness the powers of the presidency more effectively for his own political ends. Trump’s allies pledged that if he ever returned to the White House, he would not have guardrails like Kelly around to try to stop him. During the 2024 campaign, Kelly, other top generals who worked for Trump and other former aides issued a series of stark warnings. They said that not only would Trump follow through on prosecuting his rivals but he would use the military domestically on Americans. And, they said, Trump would use his power in audacious and potentially illegal ways to achieve his political goals and erode the independence of bedrock institutions of American democracy. Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, echoed those warnings on the campaign trail. Republicans pooh-poohed the warnings, saying that the former officials were just castoffs suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome. An expansion of power Since returning to office, Trump has largely done exactly what Kelly and the former aides warned he would. He has engaged in an aggressive retribution campaign. He has pierced the Justice Department’s prosecutorial decision-making process by publicly and privately telling Attorney General Pam Bondi — including in an apparently accidentally sent private message on Truth Social — whom to charge, including Comey. Bondi’s department charged Comey five days later, shortly after pushing out a prosecutor who had raised concerns about a potential case against Comey. An indictment against the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, a Democrat who sued Trump for fraud, followed soon after. Trump has deployed the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to several American cities run by Democratic mayors over their objections. He has dismantled large parts of the federal bureaucracy and work force, challenging Congress’s control over spending. And his administration’s responses to some high-profile court rulings related to immigration issues have raised questions about whether they are following judges’ orders. For this piece, I reached out to Kelly to see if he would talk about how his warnings lined up with the way Trump has governed. But Kelly declined to comment. Since Trump won, he has said little publicly, believing he already warned the country and there is nothing left for him to say. IN VIDEOS How Trump’s Chicago immigration crackdown escalated Chicago is a city on edge. As the Trump administration ramped up its immigration crackdown there, an unauthorized immigrant was fatally shot. American citizens have been detained along with undocumented immigrants. Residents have given chase to federal agents’ vehicles. And chemical agents have been used on protesters, journalists and clergy members. My colleagues have reviewed 100 videos that tell the story of the past six weeks, and it’s a case study in how the administration has used both immigration agents and federal troops to enforce its agenda in a city that largely opposes their mission. See what they found . by the numbers One dozen That’s roughly how many majority-minority House seats could plausibly disappear in the South if the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in response to a case it heard on Wednesday. The court’s conservative majority appeared to be leaning in that direction during oral arguments on Wednesday. Those seats are all currently held by Democrats. Losing that many seats, Nate Cohn writes , could make it much harder for Democrats to gain control the House in future elections — even when they win the popular vote. ONE LAST THING Both parties are losing faith in higher education President Trump has waged an assault on colleges and universities, and there is some evidence to suggest his attacks are resonating on both sides of the aisle. Ruth Igielnik , The Times’s polling editor, explains. A growing share of Americans think higher education is headed in the wrong direction, according to a new survey from Pew Research Center. Seven-in-ten Americans now agree with that assessment, up from 56 percent five years ago. Two-thirds of Democrats share that opinion, up from 49 percent in 2020. And while the percentage of Republicans who agree is also rising, majorities in that group have felt higher education was headed in the wrong direction for a while. The poll doesn’t tell us whether this eroding faith is a direct effect of President Trump’s rhetoric. But at minimum, it shows he’s done something he often has a knack for: zeroing in on an unpopular target.

Thousands of mourners crammed the narrow pathways between rows of uniform stone graves in the military cemetery on Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl. They had come for the burial, after sunset, of Capt. Daniel Peretz, a tank commander killed in battle on Oct. 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack that ignited the two-year war in Gaza. Earlier on Wednesday, Guy Iluz, a sound technician who was shot and taken hostage while fleeing a music festival during the October 2023 attack, was laid to rest in his hometown, Ra’anana, in central Israel. It has been a long goodbye for Captain Peretz’s family. The soldier, who was 22, was killed defending the border with his crew against waves of gunmen from Gaza. One member of the four-man crew was found dead afterward, but the three others, including Captain Peretz, were gone. Months later, in March 2024, the Peretz family received notification from the military that Daniel was dead and that his body was in Gaza. The family held a partial funeral for him then, burying his blood-soaked uniform. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

33e6f148d918,"As Trump’s Federal Hiring Freeze Expires, He Puts New Restrictions in Place","civil service, executive orders, office of personnel management, american federation of government employees, donald trump","President Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday that directed federal agencies to restrict hiring across the government, though with exceptions for political appointees, positions related to immigration enforcement, national security and public safety and other positions cleared by the Office of Personnel Management. The executive order came as Mr. Trump’s hiring freeze, in place since Jan. 20, expired . The terms of the new order indicate that the agencies will be hiring only with the approval of his political appointees. The president directed the agencies to create “strategic hiring committees” that will sign off on positions that can be created or filled and vet candidates to make sure that “hiring is consistent with the national interest, agency needs, and the priorities of my administration.” Those committees, the order says, are to be led by the “deputy agency head and the chief of staff to the agency head,” both political appointees. The Trump administration introduced the concept of hiring committees earlier this year and changed the job application process to include answering questions about some of Mr. Trump’s policies, which experts saw as part of a blueprint for politicizing the bureaucracy. But Wednesday’s memo provides more details for how those committees are to operate, notably that senior political appointees will be making the decisions about who works for the federal government, according to Don Kettl, an emeritus professor at the University of Maryland who studies the civil service. In the past, career officials lower in the agency made these decisions, he said. “That is a significant increase in political control over hiring,” Mr. Kettl said. “It restricts hiring more tightly than ever before, with upper-level approval for every position and the potential of a partisan screen for every employee.” Mr. Trump had extended his initial hiring freeze twice since putting it in place on his return to office. The new order indicates that most hiring will continue to be stalled. “No federal civilian position that is vacant may be filled, and no new position may be created, except as provided for in this order or required by applicable law,” the memo says. Tim Kaufman, a spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal labor union, said: “It looks like the order says that while there’s a hiring freeze for regular competitive service positions, political appointees at each agency can hire people who are ideologically in line with Donald Trump’s political agenda.” The White House did not respond to questions about the new hiring rules. Employees across the government have described great strain in completing their tasks as a result of the hiring freezes that have left key positions vacant. Many vacancies predate the Trump administration, and federal agencies had planned to fill them this year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-executive-order-federal-hiring.html,politics,BBC,By Eileen Sullivan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15trump-news-hiring-freeze-extended1-bhlf/15trump-news-hiring-freeze-extended1-bhlf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T00:50:16.112000+00:00,84e94b8d878fd15e6600f6308d6928a5cff34302

The decimation of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Population Affairs — part of a larger effort by President Trump to fire federal employees during the government shutdown — threatens a program that has existed for over 50 years and also offers testing for sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy, as well as basic infertility care. The layoffs targeting the office represent one of the most striking examples yet of Mr. Trump’s vow to fire people in an effort to purge the government of what he has called “Democrat programs” during the shutdown, a stark departure from past practice that has raised major legal and constitutional questions. Almost everyone in the office was locked out of their government emails and computers on Friday, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. On Wednesday afternoon, several staff members who had inquired about their employment status received messages from human resources, letting them know that staff members who had been shut out of their email were subject to layoffs, known in government terms as a reduction in force. The employees were informed that emails notifying them of the layoffs were sent late Friday afternoon — when they had already been locked out of their accounts, according to messages reviewed by The New York Times. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting widespread layoffs of federal employees during the shutdown, but it was still unclear on Wednesday evening which employees were covered by the injunction. Upon learning of the layoffs, reproductive health advocates said they feared that the dismantling of the office would deprive women of critical services that allow them to decide whether and when they want to have children. “The high-quality, confidential care they have relied on may disappear overnight,” said Jessica Marcella, the former deputy assistant secretary for population affairs in the Biden administration. “If there’s no one there to run it, then functionally the program ceases to exist.” The press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, Emily Hilliard, did not answer a series of questions about what the layoffs would mean for the future of the family planning program. “All H.H.S. employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated nonessential by their respective divisions,” Ms. Hilliard said in a statement. The Title X program had already come under threat in recent months. The Trump administration suggested eliminating the program entirely in its 2026 budget proposal . In the meantime, the office had been directed to expand its focus on infertility issues , a priority for the Trump administration amid concerns about the falling U.S. birthrate. Several people familiar with those infertility efforts said they expected the Trump administration to continue pursuing them through a different office. The Title X program has long been something of a political football, with administrations trying to change it to align with their priorities. During the first Trump administration, the Office of Population Affairs tried to expand access to fertility-awareness-based methods often used by Christian couples for preventing pregnancy, while the Biden administration sought to bolster access to birth control and address inequities in reproductive health care. The dismantling of the Title X office comes as a growing number of Mr. Trump’s conservative allies are encouraging women to abandon methods of hormonal birth control. Both Christian conservatives and proponents of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement have warned of the side effects that can come with taking hormonal birth control. While some women do experience side effects from birth control, leading medical associations continue to recommend a wide range of hormonal contraception.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-birth-control-layoffs.html,politics,BBC,By Caroline Kitchener,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-opa-layoffs-photo-wfpz/15dc-opa-layoffs-photo-wfpz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T00:12:23+00:00,1cac8f95382b71069b8b1062492da7c409fd86fb
557a167e8920,"On Fox News, Mamdani Speaks Directly to Trump: I Won’t Be a Mayor Like Adams","zohran mamdani, martha maccallum, nyc;new york city, fox news, democrats, mayoral races, nypd, israel gaza war, politics","Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, directly addressed President Trump during a Fox News interview on Wednesday, vowing to work with his administration to help fulfill his own campaign pledge to make the city more affordable. The direct-to-camera appeal also included digs at his closest rival, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and the current mayor, Eric Adams. “I will not be a mayor like Mayor Adams, who will call you to figure out how to stay out of jail,” Mr. Mamdani said. “I won’t be a disgraced governor like Andrew Cuomo, who will call you to ask how to win this election. I can do those things on my own.” “I will, however, be a mayor who is ready to speak at any time to lower the cost of living,” he continued. “That’s the way that I’m going to lead this city. That’s the partnership that I’m going to build, not only in Washington, D.C., but anyone across this country.” In the interview on “The Story With Martha MacCallum,” Mr. Mamdani was also pressed to publicly repeat the apologies he has issued to members of law enforcement in private meetings, after having criticized them during protests against police violence during the summer of 2020. “I apologize because of the fact that I’m looking to work with these officers,” he said. “And I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the N.Y.P.D., they put their lives on the line every single day.” Since Mr. Mamdani’s rapid rise to the top of New York City politics, Fox News has led a right-wing media effort to characterize him as an avatar of a Democratic Party grown too beholden to its factions on the far left. The network’s contributors often point to his thin political experience, past comments about law enforcement and proposals to increase taxes on New York’s wealthiest residents as both disqualifying and dangerous to New York City, America’s largest financial center. Indeed, Mr. Mamdani was quizzed on Wednesday by Ms. MacCallum regarding his stance on Israel, his relationship with police officers, whether he intended to retain Jessica Tisch, the police commissioner, and how he viewed President Trump’s role in the Israel-Hamas cease-fire. Mr. Mamdani, however, avoided contentiousness, even in his characterization of the president, who has ratcheted up his own threats against Mr. Mamdani. On Tuesday, the president falsely claimed that Mr. Mamdani was a communist and said he would not send the city money if it embraced “communist policies.” Mr. Mamdani has rejected the descriptor. It is not the first time Mr. Mamdani has sought to make inroads with groups skeptical of his candidacy. Since winning the primary in June, he has met with many of the city’s business leaders and community figures representing the voters who did not support him. Still, his appearance on Fox News marked a public departure from the small-group glad-handing that has become a more common part of his campaign’s strategy of building support in otherwise hostile political territory. Mr. Mamdani also defended his support for Palestinian rights during the Israel-Hamas war and did not commit to praising Mr. Trump for the cease-fire in the conflict, arguing that to do so would be premature. Asked about his pledge to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel should he visit New York, Mr. Mamdani said he would “exhaust every legal option.” Other New York Democrats have regularly appeared on Fox News in an effort to take their message to a conservative audience. Mr. Cuomo appeared on the network in early October and Gov. Kathy Hochul has also been a guest in recent months to push back on Republican redistricting efforts, and promote her statewide cellphone ban on students. Most polls in the mayoral race show Mr. Mamdani well ahead of his opponents, the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, and Mr. Cuomo, who is running as an independent. On Thursday the three men will debate, presenting Mr. Cuomo with one of his last opportunities to close the gap. But as he previewed his debate strategy, Mr. Mamdani also had a direct message for the former governor, who he claimed had spent much of his political career preoccupied by the whims of the billionaires who supported his campaign. He used a sports metaphor more likely to be appreciated by Fox News viewers than New York City voters, saying that he wished the debate stage “was more like NASCAR, so New Yorkers could see the billionaires that were sponsoring him right on his suit jacket.” “Andrew, you had your chance to lead this state,” he said. “You took that time to sell out working-class New Yorkers to your billionaire donors.” Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the Cuomo campaign, accused Mr. Mamdani of being “delusional,” and highlighted some of the former governor’s accomplishments, among them passing a $15 minimum wage and offering free college tuition to middle-class earners. He added that Mr. Mamdani “barely showed up to work” as an assemblyman, and that he “should be embarrassed.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/nyregion/mamdani-fox-interview.html,politics,BBC,By Maya King,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/fox-mamdani-01-qvjg/fox-mamdani-01-qvjg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T23:54:41+00:00,b85fb893265f8e3cac67eaffd81df4d49eba6f31
b80866d350e0,Oval Office Becomes a Diorama of Power Dynamics as Trump Goes After Rivals,"attorney general, federal criminal case against trump (documents case), fbi, justice department, ms-13, kilmar armando abrego garcia, joe biden, todd blanche, john bolton, pamela j bondi, letitia james, us politics, donald trump, andrew weissmann, james b comey, kashyap patel, lisa o. monaco;lisa monaco","The nation’s three most powerful law enforcement officials — Attorney General Pam Bondi and her top deputy, Todd Blanche, along with Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director — padded into the Oval Office on Wednesday for a public show of unity and to herald some recent successes. They left about an hour later, after President Trump tossed out, offhandedly, three names of people he wanted prosecuted: Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought two criminal indictments against him; Andrew Weissmann, a former F.B.I. official who was a lead prosecutor for the team investigating the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia in the 2016 election; and Lisa Monaco, the deputy attorney general under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Deranged Jack Smith, in my opinion, is a criminal,” he told the three administration officials, who have tried — with a few notable exceptions — to do what he wants. They smiled, nodded and shuffled in place as he spoke. “His interviewer was Weissmann — I hope they’re going to look into Weissmann, too — Weissmann’s a bad guy,” Mr. Trump added, referring to a recent event in which Mr. Smith appeared alongside Mr. Weissmann. “And he had somebody, Lisa, who was his puppet, worked in the office, really, as the top person. I think she should be looked at very strongly.” It was a common enough example of second-term Trump theater-in-the-Oval. But it was also a diorama of the administration’s lopsided power dynamic between a president bent on controlling federal law enforcement and appointees unwilling or unable to fight for the historic independence of their institutions. “Nothing like what we see now has ever gone on,” Mr. Smith told Mr. Weissmann in the Oct. 8 interview that captured Mr. Trump’s attention. “There are rules in the department about how to bring a case — follow those rules,” Mr. Smith added. “You can’t say: ‘I want this outcome. Let me throw the rules out.’” The president, who vowed to go after the “scum” who once investigated him, often calls for investigations of people he hates, including Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen. But those threats appear to be gaining legal force. At Mr. Trump’s urging, and often over the objections of career prosecutors, the Justice Department recently secured indictments against the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and the New York attorney general, Letitia James. Ms. Bondi and Mr. Blanche warned that there was insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction. Charges in Maryland against John R. Bolton, a national security adviser during Mr. Trump’s first term, over whether he mishandled sensitive materials are likely to be filed soon, according to officials with knowledge of the situation. That investigation, which began to gain momentum under the Biden administration, is regarded as more viable and grounded in evidence, in the view of former department officials with knowledge of the case. At Wednesday’s appearance in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump also reiterated his demand that the department go after Senator Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who pushed for his impeachment as a member of the House. There was no pushback, or even an effort to downplay it. That was by design. Mr. Trump, who tried with limited success to bring the bureau and Justice Department under his control during his first term, has left little to chance in his second. By installing Mr. Patel and other loyalists into top federal law enforcement posts, he has not only ensured their compliance but also established a cadre of political surrogates and lock-step messengers willing to cast aside core departmental norms to serve his political agenda. In fact, Ms. Bondi and Mr. Blanche have often strayed beyond the bounds of accepted department practice by commenting on ongoing investigations, parroting White House political talking points and demonizing prosecutorial targets. The attorney general, speaking to the TV host Sean Hannity on Fox earlier this week, suggested — without offering evidence — that people protesting immigration enforcement raids were members of what she described as “organized crime” syndicates. “They are no different than MS-13,” she said, referring to the notoriously violent El Salvadorean gang. Earlier this month, the judge overseeing the criminal case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant who was deported to a megaprison in El Salvador in violation of a court order, criticized Mr. Blanche for his public statements about the case. Mr. Patel, who wrote children’s books portraying Mr. Trump as a crowned monarch, has been even more solicitous of the president and thanked him repeatedly during the Oval Office news conference on Wednesday, crediting him for catching some of the bureau’s most wanted fugitives, as well as working out a way to pay agents during the government shutdown. If Mr. Patel’s obeisance has become routine for second-term appointees, it is not consistent with the actions of his predecessors, who operated at a protective distance to preserve their power and autonomy. J. Edgar Hoover, who founded the F.B.I. and presided over the first 48 years of its existence, was hardly above appearing at presidential photo ops, even when he knew he was there to validate a leader’s actions or political objectives. That was especially true late in his career, when he was a frequent visitor in the Johnson and Nixon White Houses. But Hoover, despite his deep political conservatism and racism, was more a political operator than a partisan operative — and never viewed himself as a surrogate of the leaders in power during his time, said Beverly Gage, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2023 for her biography of Mr. Hoover. “Something Hoover really sought to avoid throughout his career was being seen as the tool of any one politician or any one party,” Ms. Gage said in an interview. “A central part of Hoover’s career, and the careers of subsequent F.B.I. directors,” she added, “is that the bureau’s authority comes from its independence, not from its subservience to the White House.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-bondi-patel-blanche-oval-office.html,politics,BBC,By Glenn Thrush,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-assess-lkqh/15dc-assess-lkqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T23:53:13+00:00,3cefbf95cba33b828d557303585a254e4fd82094

The inmates who escaped from Fraijanes II prison, a maximum-security facility outside Guatemala City, were described by officials as high-ranking operatives from the Barrio 18 gang, which has long been linked to organized crime and violence around Central America and which the Trump administration designated as a foreign terrorist organization in late September. The designation places Barrio 18 on the same list as MS-13, a rival group in neighboring El Salvador, as well as the region’s most powerful drug cartels. The escape was initially revealed on Sunday by Guatemala’s director of prisons, who said that prison officials had only detected the scheme — in which inmates may have slipped out one by one, or in pairs — after hearing rumors and checking inmates’ biometric data. The revelation immediately erupted into a political crisis, with the head of prisons dismissed and Guatemalans threatening to protest. On Wednesday, Mr. Arévalo announced that several senior officials — including Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez — would also be replaced. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

f6627fb8f9d3,Review: Aubrey Plaza Shines in Ethan Coen’s Retrograde ‘Let’s Love!’,"theater, off broadway theater, atlantic theater company, linda gross theater, chris bauer, ethan coen, nellie mckay, neil pepe, aubrey plaza, mary wiseman","It’s natural that a show called “Let’s Love!” should deal with sex. But Ethan Coen’s set of three one-acts takes such a prurient view of human interaction that you may wonder why he didn’t give it another, unprintable title. Though that ickier name would be more appropriate, this collection of stories, which opened on Wednesday night at Atlantic Theater Company, doesn’t rouse much desire either way. While best known for his Oscar-winning film collaborations with his brother, Joel, this is not Coen’s first foray into playwriting. In 2008, he made his playwriting debut with “Almost an Evening” at the Atlantic, which is now presenting “Let’s Love!” after its original run was delayed when the company’s stagehands went on strike last winter. These three short plays, directed by Neil Pepe, aim for the darkly comic neo-noir of the brothers’ cinematic collaborations, yet fail. The first, “The Broad at the Bar,” sees a 60-something white woman (Mary McCann) boast about her interracial escapades in an effort to seduce a Black man at a bar (Dion Graham). It’s a funny enough concept — she’s essentially talking to, and making a fool of, herself — and McCann plays boozy to the hilt, but the forcefulness of the writing sinks the froth of the comedy. That gracelessness also mars “Dark Eyes,” a comedy of bed-hopping manners and the longest of the three works. Susan (Aubrey Plaza) and Faye (Mary Wiseman) are foulmouthed sexpots; Tough (Chris Bauer) and Dan (CJ Wilson) their roving counterparts. Dressed in aviator sunglasses and a tan suit, Bauer’s character recalls the sort of bumbling henchmen of the Coens’ peak, and a loopy murder plot does liven up this entry. The women go big in their frustratingly uncomplicated roles, leaning hard enough into their characters’ grotesqueness — the humor again hinges on the notion that screaming obscenities is funny — to almost count as a feminist reclamation. Only Dylan Gelula in “Girl” is spared from Coen’s sexed-up preoccupation, though sadly that’s because her role is about as fleshed-out as her character’s name. The focus is on Noah Robbins, as a lovable nerd who fumbles through their first few dates. The big, dragged-out joke here is not sexual (finally!) but still gruesomely anatomical. Of the cast, it’s Plaza who makes the most of the situation. After making her stage debut two years ago, she’s a growing force who has eased into live performance and supercharges each scene she’s in with distinct energy. She may have that Millennial deadpan down, but it’s lovely to witness her continually expanding her range and ability. While watching this production, I realized one can only take so much of women spouting clunky insults like “sperm bucket,” rabidly discussing their bedroom prowess and existing solely as sex objects in one play, let alone three in quick succession. It makes it tough not to roll your eyes, especially when a male character earnestly says: “Men hurt. That’s what happens. Women judge. And men hurt.” What’s truly unusual is for a production by the Atlantic — which has developed acclaimed works like “The Band’s Visit” and “English” — to feel so uninspired and so inelegantly rendered. Scenes that end with a punchline fade awkwardly away when they should be punctuated by a blackout. (Reza Behjat did the lighting.) Actors drift in and out through a needlessly convoluted double turntable set (by Riccardo Hernandez, blandly decorated by Faye Armon-Troncoso), too often as lights are still dimming. Bookending each piece are short, original songs performed by the singer-songwriter Nellie McKay , whose sweet charm can only go so far and is entirely at odds with Coen’s sleazier tone. She does look great in the top hat and tails (designed by Peggy Schnitzer) she enters the production wearing, even if the rest of the production doesn’t gesture toward old-school showbiz. The overall effect is somewhere between confusion and indifference, and the lack of connection among the stories only adds to the looseness. The actors give committed performances, ranging from solid to intermittently hilarious but are betrayed by language both juvenile and outdated.

ccbc29d120ab,Trump Hosts Dinner for Wealthy Donors to White House Ballroom,"us politics, ethics misconduct malfeasance, conflict of interest, white house, monuments and memorials, make america great again inc., donald trump","President Trump hosted dozens of wealthy spenders for a dinner on Wednesday in exchange for what he called the “tremendous amounts of money” they agreed to donate to construct a $200 million ballroom addition to the White House, a project that has sparked concerns from ethics watchdogs. “We have a lot of legends in the room tonight, and that’s why we’re here to celebrate you, because you gave,” Mr. Trump said in the East Room. “They wanted to have a ballroom, and it never happened because they didn’t have a real estate person.” More than three dozen corporate executives and wealthy businesspeople attended the dinner, where Mr. Trump expressed gratitude for their opening their checkbooks for his long-desired state ballroom. Representatives from companies including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Lockheed Martin were in attendance. So were wealthy supporters of Mr. Trump, like Harold G. Hamm, the billionaire oil and gas executive who bankrolled Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign and stands to benefit from his energy policies. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss , who run the crypto exchange Gemini and have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to a pro-Trump PAC called MAGA Inc., were also there. The building of a 90,0000-square-foot ballroom has raised a number of questions about potential conflicts of interests. White House officials have said Mr. Trump and other donors would pay for the renovations but have provided few specific details. Richard W. Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer in the White House Counsel’s Office under President George W. Bush, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s dinner for the corporate executives “shows what the ballroom is really all about: pay to play.” “Getting an invitation to the White House to a dinner because they’re contributing to the construction of this project,” Mr. Painter said. “This is payment for access, not just to the grounds of the White House but access to the president of the United States.” Mr. Trump and his aides have maintained that the additional space to host foreign dignitaries and other guests of the White House is urgently needed. In the past, the White House has often hosted large crowds under a tent on the South Lawn. “The American presidents need to be able to showcase our country,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday night. In a meandering speech that shifted from details of the ballroom — bulletproof windows and a capacity of 999 people, among them — to a description of his foreign policy agenda, Mr. Trump told the audience that he expected the project to be completed under budget. He also suggested that some attendees had offered to pay more than $20 million for the ballroom. “So many of you have been really, really generous,” Mr. Trump said. “I mean, a couple of you, I was sitting here and saying, ‘Sir, would $25 million be appropriate?’ They said, ‘I’ll take it.’” Mr. Trump also showed corporate executives models of a new arch that is planned for near Arlington National Cemetery. Mr. Trump’s speech touched on a range of topics, including statues of Confederate generals and his strikes on vessels near the coast of Venezuela. He pivoted to talk about his administration’s military strikes on boats in the Caribbean. The administration has said those boats were transporting drugs, but has provided few details about who was on the vessels at the time of the strikes and given relatively thin legal justifications for its campaign. “In fact, nobody wants to go fishing anymore,” Mr. Trump said, prompting laughter. “No one wants to do anything near the water. They might have a beautiful boat and they might as well get rid of their boat because they’re very nervous.” Mr. Trump also acknowledged the arc of his relationship with many of the people in the room. Toward the end of his speech, he noted that some of the business leaders there opposed him in the past but had rushed to support him as he amassed power. “It’s amazing the way a victory can change the minds of some people,” Mr. Trump said.

992c03a8826d,New York Confirms State’s First Locally Acquired Case of Chikungunya,"mosquito, none, medical test, disesases;health;illness;medicine, virus, infection, health department nys, hempstead ny, long island, new york","New York health authorities confirmed Tuesday that a person who fell sick on Long Island had been infected with the debilitating mosquito-borne virus chikungunya and appeared to have caught the virus locally — the first time such a case had been identified in the state. The announcement came after the state’s public health laboratory in Albany, the Wadsworth Center, conducted confirmatory testing, a process that took more than two weeks. “We urge everyone to take simple precautions to protect themselves and their families from mosquito bites,” Dr. James McDonald, the state health commissioner, said in a statement. In late September, The New York Times reported that a 60-year-old woman in Hempstead, a hamlet about 20 miles east of Manhattan, had tested positive for the virus in a preliminary screening test. The woman said in an interview with The Times in September that she had not recently traveled outside Long Island. Tuesday night’s announcement from state health officials appears to be referring to her. Chikungunya is known for causing severe joint pain, which can clear up quickly or linger for months or even years, leaving some people unable to work or resume their old lives. Symptoms also include fevers, rash and muscle pain. Chikungunya cases have surged worldwide this year, with China facing its largest outbreak since the first cases in that country were detected in 2008. The disease was first identified in Tanzania in the early 1950s, but established itself in the Western Hemisphere only in 2013. Since then, it has torn through the Caribbean and Central and South America, becoming endemic across much of the region. But the United States has largely been spared. Though a few thousand U.S. residents have been infected with chikungunya through travel, there have been only 13 instances of people catching the virus in the United States in the past decade and a half, all in Florida and Texas. Until the Long Island patient tested positive, few suspected that the virus was circulating in New York. “An investigation suggests that the individual likely contracted the virus following a bite from an infected mosquito,” the state health department said. “While the case is classified as locally acquired based on current information, the precise source of exposure is not known.” Experts speculated that the mosquito that infected the woman might have hitched a ride on a plane or ended up in the luggage of a returning passenger. The statement from the Health Department noted another possibility. A mosquito might have bitten a New Yorker who had been infected abroad, leading the mosquito to become infected and potentially transmit the virus onward when it bites another person, according to the news release. The health authorities are aware of at least a half-dozen people in New York who tested positive for chikungunya this year after traveling abroad to countries where the virus is circulating. Two types of mosquitoes are known to effectively transmit chikungunya. One of them, the Aedes aegypti, or yellow fever mosquito, is not naturally found in New York. But the other type, Aedes albopictus, commonly called the Asian tiger mosquito, has extended its range to parts of New York after landing in the United States about 40 years ago . Dr. McDonald characterized the current risk of infection as “very low,” but urged people to avoid mosquito bites and to wear long sleeves and long pants when outdoors.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/nyregion/chikungunya-first-case-long-island.html,Health,BBC,By Joseph Goldstein,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14met-chikungunya-li-qmkw/14met-chikungunya-li-qmkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T01:50:37+00:00,3ff83d80c7805254f2044ad64d7202262e1d3c5f
0941e041096c,Prospects Dim for Denmark’s Renewable Energy Star,"wind power, renewable energy, us politics, orsted, denmark","For the Danish wind farm developer Orsted, the bad news has not stopped. Once on its way to becoming a giant of renewable energy, the company is now shrinking in everything from stock market value to ambition. The reversal of fortune comes amid a broad downturn in the offshore wind industry set off by rising construction costs and interest rates after the pandemic and exacerbated by President Trump’s dislike of wind farms. Orsted , which helped create and dominated the offshore wind industry, has felt a huge impact from these setbacks. The company said last week that it would lay off 2,000 people, or 25 percent of its staff, over the next two years. Rasmus Errboe, the company’s president and chief executive, offered a blunt explanation for the job cuts: Orsted was narrowing its focus and dialing back its aspirations. Instead of lining up new, multibillion-dollar wind farms to build in shallow waters around the globe, Orsted will mainly focus on finishing those it has under construction and managing them or selling them off. The company will complete “our large construction portfolio in the coming years, which is why we’ll need fewer employees,” Mr. Errboe said in a statement. Orsted operates a large portfolio of offshore wind farms and is building six more. These arrays of enormous turbines produce the bulk of the company’s revenue, close to $7 billion this year, according to analysts’ estimates. The reshaping of Orsted is rippling across its home country, Denmark, which for half a century has been a nurturing ground of the contemporary wind industry. Rasmus Errboe, who became chief executive of Orsted this year, has taken steps to shore up the struggling company. Credit... Tom Little/Reuters A predecessor of Orsted built the world’s first offshore wind farm, Vindeby, in 1991 in Denmark. Since then, Orsted has led the way in building wind farms in waters off Europe and elsewhere, including Taiwan. Europe now has more than 3,600 offshore wind turbines, many of them developed by Orsted. Not all of the Danish wind industry is struggling. Vestas Wind Systems, the leading maker of wind turbines , looks better positioned for the current environment because it is largely focused on land-based equipment rather than offshore machines and has factories in Colorado that should help buffer any impact from Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Orsted said 235 of the 500 layoffs planned for this quarter would be in Denmark, where some 33,000 people work in the wind industry, according to Green Power Denmark, an industry group. The wind industry employs roughly 370,000 people in Europe and accounts for around 20 percent of the region’s electricity generation, according to WindEurope, a trade body. As much as any country, Denmark has embraced a vision of a future in which much of the global economy runs to a great extent on electricity generated from green sources. For Denmark, a small country with about six million people but driven by entrepreneurial flair and engineering and scientific skills, developing wind and other renewable energy has seemed attractive. Sustainable energy appeals not only to the many people who want to address climate change but also to those who see a promising source of economic growth and employment. Recent developments, though, including rising costs and the Trump administration’s efforts to stymie renewable energy, have prompted a reassessment of some of the goals that the European Union and national authorities have set for the industry. Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, forecast that less than 50 percent of the cumulative targets set by national governments, excluding China, for offshore wind for the end of the decade will be achieved. “I think, in terms of electrification, there are certainly warning signs,” said Anders Kronborg, senior economist at Copenhagen Economics, a research firm. The Trump administration has taken several steps to curb offshore wind, including halting construction on two wind farms off the East Coast of the United States. It later allowed one, Empire Wind off New York , to move forward. A federal judge ruled that the other, Revolution Wind, a nearly completed Orsted project off Rhode Island, could continue. Still, the intervention in projects where billions of dollars have already been spent has created uncertainty about investing in the United States. “In the coming years, nobody will start any new projects in offshore wind in the U.S.,” said Anders Schelde, the chief financial officer of AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund that invests in green energy. “I’m sure that it will probably also have some impact on other renewables,” he added . Because the East Coast of the United States was the most promising new offshore market, that shift has big implications for the wind industry in Denmark, whose developers and equipment makers are large-scale participants in the American projects. Welcon, which fashions giant wind turbine sections called towers in the town of Give, in western Denmark, is supplying Orsted’s Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects but is not expecting any new business from across the Atlantic. “I don’t believe in the U.S. before we have a new president,” said Carsten Pedersen, the company’s chairman. Mr. Pedersen said that Welcon’s vast factory in the flatlands of the Jutland peninsula had orders through 2027 but that he worried about the stamina of weaker companies and the lost momentum toward cleaner energy. “It’s so sad, I think, what’s happening now,” he said. “We had a chance to make the green transition.” The Danish government, which owns a majority of Orsted’s shares, has had to come to the aid of the company and the wind industry it supports by putting around $4.7 billion into a recent offering to shareholders. Some investors thought this offering was an opportunity to buy into a leading renewable company cheap. Orsted’s share price is down around 50 percent over the past year. “In my view, this is a business that is going to be around,” said Charles Lemonides, founder of ValueWorks, a New York-based fund management company that increased its stake in Orsted to about $15 million. “The world’s not using less electricity,” he added. Analysts, though, say that in the coming years, Orsted is likely to be diminished as an instrument for expanding wind power. The company has been forced to concentrate on survival. “After these assets are built, they don’t really have any other live projects,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utility analyst at Bernstein, a Wall Street research firm. Until recently, analysts said there were so many projects on the way that factories would struggle to meet commitments. Now the industry beyond 2027 looks bleak. “A lot of that volume was supposed to come in towards the end of the decade,” said Soeren Lassen, head of offshore wind at Wood Mackenzie. “That’s not the case anymore.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/business/denmark-orsted-wind-farms-trump.html,Business,BBC,By Stanley Reed,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T04:00:07.782000+00:00,5069a9a918a4e121bf4db5ffee07c6513b70bf4a
7eb42ac27326,A Military Celebration Sparks Another Newsom-Trump Feud,"us military, us politics, california, marine corps base camp pendleton","The U.S. Marines said on Wednesday that its large military celebration planned this weekend at Camp Pendleton in Southern California would not close any public highway or transportation route, hours after Gov. Gavin Newsom of California raised fears of missiles soaring over Interstate 5. The Marine Corps said in a statement that it would conduct “live-fire” activities, but that its event would take place at a beach west of the freeway. Earlier in the day, Mr. Newsom had raised alarms about the ceremony, and bemoaned what he described as the administration’s lack of planning with local authorities. The episode was the latest example of how communications have broken down between Mr. Newsom and the Trump administration over all manner of activities, including the ceremony to honor the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps. Camp Pendleton, near the city of Oceanside between San Diego and Los Angeles, is the Marine Corps’ largest training facility on the West Coast. It includes a portion of undeveloped coastline and sits close to Interstate 5, a heavily traveled corridor. The White House previously announced that the Saturday event would feature “amphibious assault demonstrations” and that Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were scheduled to attend. But Mr. Newsom’s office said that three days before the celebration, California officials still had not received detailed information about the planned activities. Mr. Newsom’s office raised alarms. His spokesman, Izzy Gardon, said that it had learned the military planned to use ordnance as part of the ceremony, possibly launching it from the sea, over Interstate 5 and onto some part of the base’s 125,000 acres.

2670138903be,Mamdani Is Making Overtures to Jewish Leaders. Some Are Listening.,"zohran mamdani, congregation beth elohim, nyc;new york city, mayoral races, judaism, zionism, politics, antisemitism, separation of church and state","The tension spilled out of the synagogue sanctuary onto the sidewalk. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, was walking into what should have been friendly territory: a liberal Reform congregation in Park Slope, a neighborhood in Brooklyn synonymous with progressive politics. But from the moment he arrived last Sunday afternoon, it was clear that even here, Mr. Mamdani would face skepticism and anxiety about some of his foundational beliefs . A group of protesters waving Israeli flags stood on the steps of the main sanctuary of the synagogue, Congregation Beth Elohim, chanting “shame.” And inside, at a closed-door meeting, synagogue leaders posed questions to Mr. Mamdani reflecting the fears that have grown among some in the Jewish community in the two years since the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. “Many of us are afraid that your words and your silences — even though I do not believe that you intend this — will be read as permission by people on the left who want to do us harm, and that someone’s going to try to come into this building to kill us,” said Rabbi Rachel Timoner, who leads Congregation Beth Elohim, according to several attendees. Mr. Mamdani, who would be New York’s first Muslim mayor , tried to reassure attendees of his commitment to protecting and celebrating the Jewish community, and said that views on Israel would not amount to a litmus test to serve in his administration. “I am not a Zionist, and I’m also not looking to create a City Hall or city in my image,” he told the 380 members who attended the hourlong gathering, some of whom greeted him with cheers and applause. “I do not want any Jewish New Yorker to think that their safety, their belonging, their identity as a New Yorker, is dependent upon what they think about Zionism.” The event marked Mr. Mamdani’s latest effort to accelerate his Jewish outreach, as he holds private meetings with rabbis and other leaders across New York City in an effort to engage a community that has been fiercely divided over his bid. His meetings have spanned a diverse swath of religious life, including gatherings with leaders from the Hasidic communities in Brooklyn, reform rabbis from Manhattan and progressive “God-optional” congregations. The conversations amount to a testing of the waters on both sides of what has been a fraught relationship between Mr. Mamdani and many Jewish leaders who have struggled to stomach a candidate offering the most outspoken opposition to Israel and its government of any major mayoral nominee in living memory. They are also a tacit recognition from parts of the Jewish institutional world that he is the overwhelming favorite to win. But making headway has not been easy for Mr. Mamdani. At the events, he has promised to combat rising antisemitism, faced questions about whether he sufficiently distanced himself from the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which has been seen as a call to violence against Jews, and suggested that Israeli restaurants and synagogues are not appropriate targets for protest against the Israeli government. But he has refused to compromise on his opposition to Israel as a Jewish state. When questioned on Sunday, Mr. Mamdani said he thought Israel, as well as countries with official religions like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, should be held to the same standard of upholding equal rights. But some rabbis, leaders and Jewish voters who have attended the events view Mr. Mamdani’s position as antisemitic because he focuses most intensely on Israel, denying Jews a right to self-determination. Several weeks ago, Mr. Mamdani met with a group of liberal-leaning rabbis, according to someone familiar with the meeting, who insisted on anonymity to discuss a sensitive gathering that was intended to remain private. The person said the meeting ended with Mr. Mamdani and at least some attendees “totally apart from one another” on key issues. Even a series of appearances last Thursday at the private sukkahs of several powerful Satmar Hasidic leaders in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, prompted some blowback. At the stops, Mr. Mamdani sported a black velvet yarmulke popular with observant men and sat alongside community leaders wearing shtreimels, the round fur hat that some Hasidic men wear on holidays and Shabbat. Satmar Hasidim are traditionally among the ultra-Orthodox sects who support religious anti-Zionism and do not recognize the state of Israel. “We are here to work with anyone who wants to work with us,” said Rabbi Moishe Indig, a leader of a Satmar Hasidic group, who has introduced Mr. Mamdani to other activists and rabbis in the community. “He wants to make sure that people know he’s a friend. He’s not an enemy and he wants to be everybody’s mayor.” Kalman Yeger, an Orthodox assemblyman who once represented the Hasidic enclave of Borough Park as a city councilman, pushed back on social media: “Maybe he’ll exclude Williamsburg from his Globalized Intifada,” he posted . Jeffrey Lerner, a spokesman for Mr. Mamdani’s campaign, said Mr. Mamdani has had “productive conversations” with faith leaders and “looks forward to continuing to build these relationships as the next mayor.” The debate over when — and whether — anti-Zionism amounts to antisemitism has exposed deep fissures within the Jewish community, often along generational lines. A broad majority of younger voters, along with a handful of more liberal rabbis, are backing Mr. Mamdani. He received a warm welcome when he attended Rosh Hashana services at Kolot Chayeinu, a progressive synagogue that includes a vocal self-described anti-Zionist contingent. Yet, even as polls suggest more New Yorkers are moving to Mr. Mamdani’s position on Israel, many Jewish voters remain opposed to his candidacy. “The heart of the matter is, he is a committed ideologue, anti-Zionist,” said Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch, who leads Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, a Reform congregation on the Upper West Side. “Unless and until he addresses that fully and publicly, I think all of the efforts to try and soften his previous antagonism to Israel will fall short, and in fact will exacerbate the tension.” Sixty percent of Jewish likely voters said they plan to back former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the race, while 29 percent support Mr. Mamdani, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week. Mr. Cuomo, who is running as a moderate independent, has positioned himself as a vigorous defender of Israel who is best equipped to represent Jewish New Yorkers. In the days after Mayor Eric Adams suspended his re-election campaign, a number of Jewish groups endorsed him. “The Mamdani policy initiatives will destroy New York City,” said Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz, the head of Kehilath Jeshurun, a prominent Manhattan orthodox congregation, in a video posted to his synagogue’s Facebook account last month. But Mr. Cuomo has faced opposition from some more liberal Jewish voters. He’s also struggled to navigate mistrust within the Hasidic community over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed as governor on religious gatherings. The divides have turned the mayoral race and Mr. Mamdani’s candidacy into fraught subjects for many congregations across the spectrum of Jewish religious practice in the city. The mere rumor that Mr. Mamdani would attend services over the high holidays with Representative Jerrold Nadler at B’nai Jeshurun, the Upper West Side synagogue where the congressman is a member, prompted synagogue leaders to issue a public statement forcefully rejecting the idea of politics on a holy day. And attendees at many meetings that have occurred have been given strict instructions not to discuss with reporters what Mr. Mamdani says, who attended the gathering or, in some cases, acknowledge that they even occurred at all. Several rabbis acknowledged that having a strong relationship with the mayor would benefit their congregants and institutions. But they feared financial and public backlash from some of their congregants should such a gathering become public. They would not speak publicly about Mr. Mamdani’s candidacy or any efforts to organize a meeting. One meeting that did occur, at Mr. Mamdani’s campaign office shortly before Yom Kippur, included Rabbi David Niederman, an influential Hasidic leader and president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn, along with other leaders from the Satmar community, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting who insisted on anonymity to discuss it. There, they discussed the community’s concerns around safety and antisemitism, the person said, recalling that at one point Mr. Mamdani appeared to tear up after hearing about how antisemitism had affected the community, and assured attendees that he understood the threats. “Antisemitism is real, and I think that people are so anxious they don’t really know how to understand who Mamdani is exactly,” said Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum, the former head of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, the largest L.G.B.T.Q. congregation in the country . “I am supporting him, but I understand the fear.” Rabbi Kleinbaum, who met with Mr. Mamdani shortly after the primary in June, said she has been gratified by their discussions about the future of the city. “I’ve had really great exchanges with him where I have been deeply honest and forthcoming,” she said. “I have felt engaged in a way that is inspiring.” Rabbi Timoner stressed the importance of having an open dialogue with Mr. Mamdani, saying her congregants — including some who oppose him — were grateful he took the time to hear their concerns. The receptions have also been mixed in other settings, even in private invitation-only gatherings like one hosted at the townhouse of Sandi DuBowski, a Jewish documentary filmmaker with ties to Orthodox and progressive Jewish communities. While he received a largely warm response, Mr. Mamdani’s views on Israel-related policies were greeted there with some skepticism, according to someone in attendance. When Mr. Mamdani joined Lab/Shul, a liberal congregation, for the Kol Nidre service several weeks later, he was greeted with a standing ovation — but also a walkout by a handful of attendees and a flurry of angry messages to synagogue leaders after the holiday. “Lab/Shul is not an ideological monolith, and this is just one more living expression of our community engaging in the messy middle,” said Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie in a statement . “We know that for some in our community, this choice was painful.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/nyregion/mandani-jews-israel-palestine.html,politics,BBC,By Lisa Lerer and Katie Glueck,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16met-mamdani-jews-01-fbmp/16met-mamdani-jews-01-fbmp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T07:00:07.280000+00:00,bb070153fc391e22a821e06e84884376543abf0b
6e9481819363,A C.I.A. Secret Kept for 35 Years Is Found in the Smithsonian’s Vault,"jim sanborn, jarett kobek, richard byrne, cia, archives of american art, smithsonian institution, rr auction, auction, art, archives, codes, your-feed-science","The sculptor Jim Sanborn opened his email account one day last month expecting the usual messages from people claiming to have solved his famous, decades-old puzzle. Mr. Sanborn’s best known artwork, Kryptos, sits in a courtyard at the C.I.A. headquarters in Virginia. A sculpture that evokes and incorporates secrets, Kryptos displays four encrypted messages in letters cut through its curving copper sheet. Since the agency dedicated it in 1990, cryptographers both professional and amateur had solved three of the passages , known as K1, K2 and K3. But the fourth, K4, remained stubbornly uncracked. Mr. Sanborn, who is 79, was in the final stages of auctioning off the puzzle’s solution next month. The auction house had estimated that the text of that passage, along with other papers and artifacts related to the sculpture, would bring between $300,000 and $500,000. He has said he intends to use the proceeds to help manage medical expenses for possible health crises, and to fund programs for people with disabilities. But the email he received on Sept. 3 threatened that plan. Its subject line contained the first words of the final passage of K4. The body of the email showed the rest of the solved text. What led to that moment is a blend of mishandled paperwork and nerdy spycraft. An amateur cryptographer and his friend had found the solution in plain view for anyone willing to dig through the archives of the Smithsonian Institution. The hidden text had been uncovered, with potentially damaging effects for the sale — what is the value of a secret that everyone knows? The person who tracked down the solution, Jarett Kobek, is a journalist and novelist long fascinated by Mr. Sanborn’s work. In the announcement from RR Auction , the company running the sale, he saw a reference to copies of the “coding charts” used to encrypt the message; the originals, it said, were at the Smithsonian. Mr. Kobek lives in California, so he asked a friend in the Washington area, Richard Byrne , a journalist and playwright, to request the Sanborn papers at the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art. Mr. Byrne spent hours photographing documents at the archives on Sept. 2. Mr. Kobek that evening, while reviewing the images his friend sent, saw scraps of paper, some held together by yellowed tape, and got a shock: “Hey — that says ‘BERLIN CLOCK’!” Those two words were clues to K4 that Mr. Sanborn released in 2010 and 2014 . Another scrap had more of what looked like the original, uncoded message, known in cryptography as the plaintext, including the words “EAST NORTHEAST” — two clues released in 2020. Together, there were 97 characters, the number of characters in K4, that he assembled into a readable passage. “This is a problem everybody has been attacking as a STEM problem,” Mr. Kobek said in an interview, referring to the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics that underlie cryptography. Cryptographic science, he argued, could not solve Kryptos — “but library science could.” Mr. Byrne compared their find to open-source intelligence. On Sept. 3, the men sent their email to Mr. Sanborn, including an assurance that their “primary concern” was “moving forward without imperiling your forthcoming auction.” They had a half-hour telephone call in which Mr. Sanborn confirmed that they had the solution. Mr. Kobek recalled it as “a perfectly lovely conversation.” But later that evening, a second conversation took a sobering turn, Mr. Kobek recalled. He said Mr. Sanborn proposed they should both sign NDAs and, they could then receive a portion of the auction’s proceeds. Both Mr. Kobek and Mr. Byrne said they had to reject the offer, in part out of fear that it would make them “party to fraud” in the auction, Mr. Kobek said. Mr. Kobek and Mr. Byrne suggested to him that there should be a way to disclose the fact that the last panel’s solution had been discovered while still holding the auction. The call ended at an impasse: Mr. Sanborn did not want them to talk, and they were offended by his suggestion that they sign an agreement to stay silent. The offer of money also rankled. “​​It’s a complete red line,” Mr. Byrne said. “Nonstarter. Not happening.” Mr. Sanborn explained in an interview that he created the paper scraps the men had found to share the text with the C.I.A. He had mistakenly included them in the folders he gathered about 10 years ago. This happened during his treatment for metastatic cancer. “I was not sure how long I would be around and I hastily gathered all of my papers together” for the archives, he said. He was stunned to realize, years later, that the scraps had ended up in the collection. Mr. Sanborn has since exchanged messages with Mr. Kobek and Mr. Byrne, but they have not broken through to a solution. In parallel, on the largest internet forum for Kryptos enthusiasts , the auction catalog had incited a discussion of the Smithsonian trove. On Sept. 5, a member noted that the documents had been sealed and were no longer accessible. That was the work of Mr. Sanborn, who after talking with Mr. Kobek and Mr. Byrne had gotten the institution to block access to the materials until 2075. Mr. Sanborn said that his initial reaction to the email, and calls from Mr. Kobek and Mr. Byrne, was frazzled. “I didn’t know their motives,” he said. He recalled telling them, “If you release that thing, the auction is over.” Mr. Kobek, long a fan of Mr. Sanborn’s work, said he was devastated by the events of recent weeks. “If I had known, my God! I never would have sent Rich to this library,” he said. Mr. Kobek and Mr. Byrne initially told Mr. Sanborn that they were willing to keep the text private to avoid disrupting the auction. But in interviews, they said the weight of keeping the secret in the superheated world of Kryptos fans is too great, and worried they could be compelled to release the plaintext. Mr. Sanborn acknowledged that keeping the secret could be a strain: His computer has been hacked repeatedly over the years, he said, and obsessive fans of the work have threatened him. “I sleep with a shotgun,” he said. If the two men reveal the text, he warned, that “is going to be far worse,” he said. “The world of Kryptos is going to attack” them, he said. “They are going to be pariahs for releasing it.” The auction house is not sitting idly by. Last week, Mr. Kobek and Mr. Byrne received an email from lawyers for RR Auction that threatened legal action if they published the text, citing copyright infringement and interference with contracts. In a very different tone, the letter also stated that if the two didn’t publish the text, “you will be looked upon as heroes to the cipher and intelligence communities,” a “story line” their client “would happily help you promote.” Both men find the legal reasoning dubious and have hired lawyers. But they also acknowledge the crushing cost of defending themselves. They say they do not plan to release the solution. But they are also not inclined to sign a legally binding document promising not to do so. Bidding is to begin on Thursday, and close on Nov. 20. The auction house has disclosed the discovery of the solution on their website. Thomas C. Danziger, a lawyer who represents clients in the art market, said that as long as the message remained a secret, such a disclosure is “the best practice.” And while “presumably, that would have an impact on the value” of the sale, “that still should be cheaper than facing litigation from a disgruntled buyer down the line.” Mr. Danziger said that revealing the plaintext could have a profound impact on the auction. But while revealing the plaintext could dampen bidders’ enthusiasm, he said, “the auction room is a strange place.” He cited a famous example: an artwork by Banksy that destroyed itself after being initially sold for $1.4 million at Sotheby’s in London, which “ only served to increase its value substantially .” In the case of Kryptos, “the secret is being shredded before the eyes of the world,” he said. “Does that mean it has less value? Or more value? I don’t know.” Elonka Dunin, a game designer who helps lead the most active online discussion about Kryptos, said in an interview that she hoped the text didn’t get out. But for true lovers of cryptographic skill, she said, the real challenge is not having the answer but knowing how to get there. “That’s the exciting part for me,” and, she proposed, “the real value” at auction. “If they don’t have the method,” she said, “it’s not solved,” she said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/science/kryptos-cia-solution-sanborn-auction.html,politics,BBC,By John Schwartz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16hs-kryptos-01-tbqz/16hs-kryptos-01-tbqz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:04:24.073000+00:00,42fa5996f28c3e85fd63c180002dea805cf61a76
58bcfb85503b,France’s Government Survives No-Confidence Vote,"france, sébastien lecornu, emmanuel macron, legislature, france unbowed","France’s government survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament on Thursday by a thin margin, giving the country a brief respite from intense political turmoil before what is expected to be another brutal battle over its budget. The no-confidence motion, which was filed by the far-left France Unbowed party, drew the support of 271 lawmakers in the 577-seat lower house — shy of the absolute majority of 289 votes required to topple Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu and his cabinet. Mr. Lecornu’s survival gave France a moment to breathe after weeks of political instability that plunged the country into deep uncertainty over its future and weighed on its economy . Had the no-confidence motion against Mr. Lecornu succeeded, this would have been the second time in less than two weeks that the government had collapsed. The results on Thursday, however, were largely expected after Mr. Lecornu offered this week to delay an unpopular pension overhaul that raised the age of retirement. That move was a major concession to the moderate left-wing Socialist Party, whose support Mr. Lecornu needed to ensure the no-confidence motions would not pass. The government of Mr. Lecornu, a centrist and close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, is France’s fourth in less than a year. Mr. Lecornu resigned last week after less than a month in office, only to be reappointed just days later, which angered opponents who wanted Mr. Macron to call snap legislative elections or to resign. The French president has firmly ruled out resigning, but he threatened to call new elections if Mr. Lecornu were toppled. The government’s survival on Thursday averted that outcome, at least for the time being. But the respite could be short-lived. Mr. Lecornu must now get a budget passed through a cantankerous lower house, where the main forces — an assortment of divided left-wing parties, a tenuous centrist coalition, a reduced conservative party, and a far-right bloc — agree on very little. Additional no-confidence votes are likely in the coming weeks and months.

For blackwater divers, who dive into offshore waters at night, the migration offers an opportunity to glimpse tiny animals. “You’re just out there drifting with the current and checking out all this life that’s in the ocean,” said Rich Collins, a blackwater photographer and diver affiliated with the Florida Museum of Natural History. But blackwater photographs capture more than glamorous fishes . By studying the photos from Mr. Collins and other divers, scientists have found that young fishes and anemones are interacting in ways rarely seen before. In a new study published last month in the Journal of Fish Biology, scientists documented larval and juvenile fishes hiding behind or carrying larval sea anemones, close relatives of jellyfish that also have the ability to sting. Adult anemones attach to the seabed, but the larvae float freely in the ocean. By holding an invertebrate that can be toxic, the young fishes might be scaring predators away, said Gabriel Afonso, a doctoral student at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who led the study. “The fish sometimes seem to be using the invertebrate as a protection,” he said. In the photos, larval fishes from species such as pomfrets and filefishes are seen holding larval tube anemones, which belong to a class of marine invertebrates called anthozoans, in their mouths. Four families of fish were documented interacting with anthozoans in the open ocean, also known as the pelagic zone. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

f9ed3a2b3ee7,"The Vanishing Act: How Assad’s Top Henchmen Fled Syria, and Justice","vis-video, your-feed-visual-investigations, syria, bashar al-assad, war crimes;genocide;crimes against humanity, war;armed conflicts","Not long after midnight on Dec. 8, 2024, dozens of people gathered in the darkness outside the military section of the Damascus International Airport. Carrying whatever they could pack, they piled into a small Syrian Air jet. Only an hour earlier, they were part of an elite cadre that formed the backbone of one of the world’s most brutal regimes. Now, in the wake of President Bashar al-Assad’s sudden fall and escape from the country, they were fugitives, scrambling with their families to flee. Among the passengers was Qahtan Khalil , director of Syria’s air force intelligence, who was accused of being directly responsible for one of the bloodiest massacres of the country’s 13-year civil war. He was joined by Ali Abbas and Ali Ayyoub , two former ministers of defense facing sanctions for human rights violations and atrocities carried out during the conflict. There was also the military chief of staff, Abdul Karim Ibrahim , accused of facilitating torture and sexual violence against civilians. The presence of these and other regime figures was recounted to The New York Times by a passenger and two other former officials with knowledge of the flight. As a whirlwind rebel offensive encroached on the Syrian capital, Mr. al-Assad’s furtive flight out of Damascus earlier that night took his innermost circle by surprise and became the symbol of his regime’s stunning fall. His henchmen quickly followed suit. In a matter of hours, the pillars of an entire system of repression had not simply collapsed. They had vanished. Some caught flights. Others rushed to their coastal villas and roared away on luxury speed boats. Some fled in convoys of expensive cars, as rebels at freshly installed checkpoints unwittingly waved them on. A few hid out in the Russian Embassy, which assisted in their escapes to Moscow, Mr. al-Assad’s most important ally. To the thousands of Syrians who lost loved ones, or were tortured, imprisoned or displaced by the Assad regime, their homeland had become a crime scene from which the top suspects disappeared en masse. Ten months after the regime’s collapse, a nation shattered by war not only faces the immense challenge of rebuilding, but also the daunting task of scouring the globe to find and hold to account the people who committed some of the worst state-sponsored crimes of this century. Former rebel fighters and Syria’s fledgling government are trying to locate them through informants, computer and phone hacks, or clues gathered from abandoned regime headquarters. Prosecutors in Europe and the United States are building or revisiting cases. And Syrian civil society groups and United Nations investigators are collecting evidence and witnesses, preparing for a future in which they hope justice can be served. Their targets are some of the most elusive people in the world. Many of them wielded immense power for decades, yet remained public enigmas: Their real names, ages and, in some cases, even appearances were unknown. The dearth of information has repeatedly led to inaccuracies in media reports, and on sanctions and law enforcement lists. It likely has helped some of the regime’s most notorious bad actors evade Syrian and European authorities since Mr. al-Assad’s fall. The Means to Disappear Over the past several months, a Times reporting team has been working to fill in the blanks about 55 of these regime officials’ roles and true identities, all former high-ranking government and military figures who appear on international sanctions lists and are linked to the deadliest chapters of Syria’s recent history. The investigation has involved everything from tracing digital trails and family social media accounts, to scouring abandoned properties for old phone bills and credit card information. Reporters interviewed dozens of former regime officials, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for their safety, as well as Syrian human rights lawyers, European law enforcement, civil society groups and members of the new Syrian government. They visited dozens of abandoned villas and businesses connected to regime figureheads, and reconstructed some of their escape routes. The current whereabouts of many of these 55 former key officials who enabled Mr. al-Assad’s dictatorship remain unknown, but among the dozen The Times has found, their fates vary widely. Mr. al-Assad himself is in Russia and appears to have cut off contact with most of his formal circle, according to former Syrian officials, relatives and associates. Maher al-Assad , who was second only to his brother Bashar in power over regime-era Syria, has been spending time living a life of exiled luxury in Moscow, along with some of his former senior commanders, like Jamal Younes , according to accounts by regime-era officials and business associates in contact with them, as well as video evidence verified by The Times. Others, like Ghiath Dalla , a brigadier general whose forces were involved in violent repression of protests, is among several former officers plotting sabotage from Lebanon, according to ex-military commanders, who also shared text message exchanges with The Times. Mr. Dalla is coordinating with former regime leaders like Suhail al-Hassan and Kamal al-Hassan from Moscow, the same commanders said. Ghiath Dalla, in a photo uploaded to Facebook in May 2024, led forces tied to the state-run captagon trade, and faced sanctions by the European Union in 2025 for his role in sectarian violence. Credit... Aleppo and the Northern and Eastern Countryside News Network, via Facebook Some officials have struck murky deals to remain in Syria, according to an ex-military commander and people working with the new government. And one official, Amr al-Armanazi , who oversaw Mr. al-Assad’s chemical weapons program, was discovered by Times reporters to still be living in his own home in Damascus. Keeping track of such a large group of figures poses a massive challenge for those seeking justice. There are criminal cases to build and the daunting task of finding a way to actually prosecute such cases. But at the heart of this challenge lies the question of how best to coordinate global search efforts for people who don’t want to be found. Many of them had easy access to government offices that enabled them to obtain genuine Syrian passports with fake names, according to former employees and regime figures. That, in turn, enabled them to obtain passports to Caribbean countries, they said. “Some of these individuals have purchased new identities by acquiring citizenship through real estate investments or financial payments. They use these new names and nationalities to hide,” said Mazen Darwish, head of the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression, a Paris-based group at the forefront of justice efforts on Syria. “These people have the financial means to move freely, to buy new passports, to disappear.” “He’s gone.” The mass exodus began late on the night of Dec. 7, 2024, after a moment of stark realization. For hours, several of Mr. al-Assad’s top aides waiting near his office in the presidential palace had confidently fielded calls from their colleagues and relatives, several regime-era officials in contact with them that night said. The palace officials assured them the president was there, hashing out a plan with his military and Russian and Iranian advisers to confront the advancing rebel forces. But that plan never materialized. And neither did Mr. al-Assad. Realizing he was gone, the senior aides quickly tracked him to his home, according to three former palace officials. Shortly after, guards outside the president’s house informed them Russian officials had whisked Mr. al-Assad away in a convoy of three S.U.V.s, along with his son and personal assistant. According to the former palace aides, the only officials the president would summon to flee with him were two financial advisers. Mr. al-Assad would need their help, two regime insiders later explained, to access his assets in Russia. The erstwhile president and his entourage got on a jet that flew them to Hmeimim, a coastal air base controlled by Russia, which had been his most critical backer in the war. When they learned of the flight, the abandoned aides began frantically calling security officials and loved ones. The rebels had reached the suburbs of Damascus, and there was not a moment to lose. “He’s gone,” was all that one senior aide said when he called a close relative, recounting that night to The Times. The aide ordered his family to pack their bags and go to the defense ministry in the capital’s central Umayyad Square. Qahtan Khalil, a former top intelligence official, has been accused of directing a massacre inside Syria. Credit... Gafer Salloum, via Facebook There, the senior aide and his family joined several other security officers who had gathered with their families, and linked up with Mr. Khalil, the air force intelligence director. Mr. Khalil had arranged an escape flight, the one transporting many high-ranking officials, to Hmeimim. The plane, a Yak-40 private jet, left the Damascus airport around 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 8, a passenger, who was one of the former palace officials, said. Satellite-imagery analysis comports with this, showing that a Yak-40 was on the tarmac in Damascus in the days prior, vanishes on the night in question and seems to have reappeared at Hmeimim soon after. The passengers who packed into the plane “were freaking out,” the former palace official recalled. The flight is only 30 minutes, he said, “but that night, it felt like we were flying forever.” In another part of the city, Mr. al-Assad’s brother Maher, head of Syria’s feared 4th Division, was rushing to arrange his own escape. He called a family friend and one of his business cronies, according to two close associates. Maher al-Assad urged the men to leave their houses as quickly as possible and wait outside. Shortly after, he careened up the street in his car, then sped off with them to catch his own flight. The Syrian-controlled airport in Hmeimim, where at least five of the Syrian officials being investigated by The Times landed, is connected to a military base used by Russia. For years, Russian military forces were critical to Bashar al-Assad’s ability to crush the armed rebellion against his rule. In return, Moscow controlled strategic ports and bases on the Mediterranean, and gained access to lucrative phosphate mining and fossil fuel deals. The Russians have now played a similarly critical role in the escape of Mr. al-Assad — and many of his top henchmen. Witnesses at Hmeimim in the early morning hours described a night of chaos as the ousted officials escaped. People headed into the Russian base carrying bags packed with cash and gold, according to two witnesses. Stripped-off Syrian military uniforms were strewn everywhere, they said. Some of the officials rushed to regroup with one another, and spoke to Russian officers who would shuttle them on jets to Moscow in the coming hours and days, according to three former officials. Many family members of the regime figures instead chose to be driven to their coastal homes near the base. Swiping Safes, Dodging Ambushes Back in Damascus, some 3,000 members of the General Intelligence services were still inside the sprawling security compound in the capital’s southwest, unaware that regime elites had already fled. They nervously waited on high alert under their director, Hossam Louka — an official who oversaw mass detention and systemic torture. One of Mr. Louka’s senior officers described him as someone extremely deferential to Mr. al-Assad. “He wouldn’t even move an ashtray from here to there without asking Bashar for permission,” he said. The officer recalled that they had been ordered to ready themselves for a counterattack. The order never came. A friend of Mr. Louka said he repeatedly called the intelligence director that night for updates, and was always reassured that there was nothing to fear. Then, at 2 a.m., he said, Mr. Louka hurriedly answered the phone only to say he was packing to flee. An hour later, Mr. Louka’s officers entered his office to discover he had abandoned them without uttering a word — and that, on his way out, Mr. Louka had ordered the intelligence service’s accountant to open the headquarters safe, according to one of Mr. Louka’s officers present at the time. Mr. Louka then took all the cash inside, an estimated $1,360,000. Three former regime officials say they believe Mr. Louka has since made it to Russia, though The Times has not yet verified their account. In that same security compound, Kamal al-Hassan, another high-ranking former official, also raided his office headquarters. He took a hard drive as well as the money inside his administrative office’s safe, according to a friend and a senior regime-era figure in contact with one of Mr. al-Hassan’s deputies . Mr. al-Hassan, the head of military intelligence, is accused of overseeing mass arrests, torture and the execution of detainees. His escape did not go as smoothly as the others. Mr. al-Hassan was wounded in a gunfight with rebels as he attempted to leave his home in a Damascus suburb formerly known as Qura al-Assad, or “Assad’s Villages,” an area where many regime elites lived in lavish villas. He fled by hiding from house to house, the friend and regime-era official said, before eventually making his way to the Russian Embassy, which took him in. The Times contacted Mr. al-Hassan through an interlocutor, who spoke to him by phone, but he would not divulge his location or agree to an interview. He did, however, recount his escape under fire, and said that he was sheltered at “a diplomatic mission,” before departing Syria. Another official who sought refuge at the Russian Embassy was the retired national security director Ali Mamlouk , who helped orchestrate the system of mass arrest, torture and disappearance that was emblematic of five decades of Assad rule. According to both a friend who said he had been in touch with him, and a relative, Mr. Mamlouk only learned of the regime collapse from a phone call around 4 a.m. As he attempted to join other officials fleeing to the airport, his convoy of cars was attacked by what the sources described as an ambush. Though it was unclear who attacked him, they said he would have had many enemies. As an intelligence director not only for Mr. al-Assad, but the dictator’s father and predecessor, Hafez, he knew the government’s secrets. “He was the black box of the regime — not just since the days of Bashar, since the days of Hafez,” one of his friends said. “He knew everything.” Mr. Mamlouk managed to get away unscathed and raced to the Russian Embassy, according to three people familiar with his escape. Mr. Mamlouk and Mr. al-Hassan hunkered down there until Russian officials arranged a guarded convoy to get them to the Hmeimim base. Both men later reached Russia, the three people told The Times. Close Encounters Several ex-regime figures said that, in an effort to minimize the regime’s resistance, there was a tacit understanding that rebel commanders would turn a blind eye to most Assad loyalists fleeing toward Syria’s Mediterranean coast, home of the Alawite minority sect to which Mr. al-Assad belonged, and where the Assad regime had recruited many of its security forces. But it is unlikely such leniency would have been granted to the former Maj. Gen. Bassam Hassan . Few from Mr. al-Assad’s inner circle were more feared than Mr. Hassan, accused of a litany of crimes, including coordinating the regime’s chemical weapons attacks to the kidnapping of the American journalist Austin Tice. Yet Mr. Hassan managed to escape undetected, despite sleeping through the first hectic hours of the regime’s fall. He was alerted sometime before 5 a.m., when one of his top commanders roused him from sleep, according to three people familiar with his story. Mr. Hassan quickly arranged a convoy of three cars carrying his wife, adult children and bags stuffed with money, according to two of the people familiar with his story. He was so concerned about an attack that he had his wife and children ride in different cars, one associate said, to avoid the entire family being struck at once. When their convoy approached the city of Homs, about 100 miles north of Damascus, rebels waved down the first car, an S.U.V., and forced Mr. Hassan’s wife and daughter out. They were ordered to leave everything, even their purses, inside the vehicle, according to a witness. The rebels, apparently satisfied with their loot, paid no mind as the women got into the second car, joining one of the Assad regime’s most notorious henchmen. The rebels had a scant chance of recognizing him. Bogus photos of Mr. Hassan have long circulated in the media. Even the United States and British governments do not use the right name or birth year for Mr. Hassan in their sanctions documents. The Times has obtained and verified perhaps the only recent photograph of Mr. Hassan. A rare photo of Bassam Hassan, a key figure in the Assad regime. Having cleared the checkpoint, Mr. Hassan eventually made his way to Lebanon and then Iran with the help of Iranian officials, according to interviews with officials from the Assad regime, Lebanon and the U.S. He has since returned to Beirut as part of a deal to provide information to American intelligence officials. Associates said he had been spending his time at cafes and fancy restaurants with his wife. When reached on a Lebanese WhatsApp number, he declined to give an interview. A Bitter Reality For the tens of thousands of Syrians who were victims of the Assad regime, the pursuit of justice looks aimless. It remains an open question whether the current government, under the former Islamist leader Ahmed al-Shara, has the capacity, or the will to aggressively pursue Assad officials accused of war crimes — that would, in turn, put some of his own officials’ alleged crimes under the spotlight, too. And with foreign powers long divided over the war in Syria and the uprising against its former dictator, there is little hope for an international tribunal either. For those fighting to ensure the regime’s crimes are not allowed to fade into history, a bitter reality remains: Mr. al-Assad’s top enforcers are still living large, and still one step ahead of their pursuers. “Assad’s men are drinking whiskey and playing cards in Moscow, or they are lounging in some Emirati villa,” a friend of several top-ranking regime officials said. “They have forgotten about any place that was called Syria.” Devon Lum and Neil Collier contributed reporting.

856b277621e3,Abandoned Mansions and Facebook Photos: Reporting on the Top Officials Who Fled Syria,"vis-video, syria, bashar al-assad, war;armed conflicts, war crimes;genocide;crimes against humanity, your-feed-visual-investigations","A photograph of a lavish Damascus home, posted to a neighborhood Facebook page. The name of a small village on Syria’s coast mentioned in a sanctions document. A phone number, with a Russian country code, discreetly shared with reporters. Over ten months, The New York Times gathered these and other fragments to uncover what happened to some of the high-ranking Syrian officials who, for years, helped former President Bashar al-Assad’s regime carry out its atrocities. After the government’s fall in December and with accountability looming, most of these officials fled or hid. Rumors swirled in their wake, leading to many dead ends. But in some cases, these clues brought us directly to their doorsteps. All these fragments were combined with additional journalistic legwork: document sifting, lead chasing, door knocking and conversations with dozens of sources, including members of the former regime, their family members and staff, Western officials and legal experts. While some Assad henchmen have come into clearer focus, others remain enigmas, and our reporting continues. As we embarked on this investigation, we were immediately faced with a challenge: whom to focus on when so many played a role in the Assad regime’s brutal 13-year civil war that left half a million people dead. We began with a list of hundreds of individuals facing sanctions by the United States, the European Union and Britain for their connection to crimes committed under the Assad regime. We gathered background information on these officials by referencing reporting from media outlets and nongovernmental organizations, including Syrian Free Press, Zaman Al Wasl, the Association of Detainees and Missing Persons of Sednaya Prison and Pro Justice. The Syria Justice and Accountability Centre and the Syrian Archive shared internal research with The Times that tracked which individuals held certain roles throughout the war. These databases allowed us to narrow our focus to those at the highest levels of responsibility. We prioritized individuals with ties to the military, intelligence and Syria’s chemical weapons program and excluded those facing sanctions primarily for financial or administrative roles. That still left hundreds of names. We then identified nine flashpoints that were especially emblematic of the regime in terms of scale, brutality and repercussions, from the killing of peaceful protesters to chemical weapons attacks. Determining the senior-most officials linked to all of these allowed us to narrow the list down even further, to 55. Syrian civil society groups and nongovernmental organizations, who have spent years laying the groundwork for accountability efforts, provided research on the 55 individuals, deepening our understanding of their roles and actions during Assad’s reign. We drew on the expertise of the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression and the human rights lawyer Anwar al-Bunni. Both are behind some of the highest profile legal cases in European countries against Syrian officials — including some of the officials we identified in our reporting. Nidal Shikhani, the director of Same Justice and the Chemical Violations Documentation Center of Syria, shared information his team has collected on those at the highest levels of the regime’s chemical weapons program, and connected The Times to sources familiar with the inner workings of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, the government agency responsible for chemical weapons development. Much of the Visual Investigations team’s reporting uses open-source information — that is, information that is openly available on the internet, though not necessarily easy to uncover or connect. While we engaged with sources and experts in the field, we were also digging through social media accounts, Syrian state media and other online resources for information about our individuals of interest. Despite facing sanctions by multiple Western governments, some of these individuals were rarely, if ever, seen or photographed in public, making it much easier for them to move under the radar. By combing through hundreds of images from social platforms, state media and expert sources across Syrian academia and civil society, we managed to pinpoint visuals of several of these shadowy figures. We also verified their names through signatures, identity cards and other official documentation, correcting errors in spelling and transliteration seen even in sanctions lists drawn up by Western governments. To help verify that photos from various sources depicted the same individuals, The Times asked Hassan Ugail, a professor at the University of Bradford in Britain who specializes in facial recognition, to analyze the images. For example, Bassam Hassan , one of Mr. Assad’s most senior henchmen, has long been misidentified by media outlets and online. But we uncovered several old Facebook photos that seemed to show Mr. Hassan as a younger man. Mr. Ugail compared those images with a more recent photo of Mr. Hassan we obtained to establish that they all showed the same person. Suhail al-Hassan , a senior military official, presented a different challenge: a changing appearance that led some Syrians to speculate that he had undergone plastic surgery. Here too, The Times conducted its own analysis and consulted Mr. Ugail, who indicated the various photos were highly likely to be of Mr. al-Hassan. This work opened new doors, allowing us to more easily trace some former officials’ presence online to learn more about who they are and how they may have operated during their time in power. We scoured funeral announcements for the names of their potential family members and collected phone numbers and email addresses. We called those phone numbers found online or passed to us by contacts. Some connected directly to the former Assad officials we were investigating. Satellite imagery and ship and aircraft tracking data helped us to trace rumored escape routes used by officials in the hours and days after the Syrian opposition took control. We corroborated these routes with witness accounts from those directly involved in the escape efforts. We used artificial intelligence tools to translate and transcribe more than 13,000 documents photographed inside Syria by Times reporters and freelance journalist Lynzy Billing. A few documents contained orders linking some of our 55 former officials to suspected atrocities. One directive to withhold news of detainees’ deaths from their families is signed by Mohammed Kanjou al-Hassan , who issued death sentences for civilians and political dissidents. We traveled to Lebanon, France and Belgium, and multiple times to Syria to meet with experts and sources, knock on doors and visit the hometowns of the former officials. Most of the men were gone, but their opulent homes remained, each telling a different story of the regime’s chaotic fall. Current government officials and family members granted us permission to walk through dozens of villas, complete with swimming pools and behind high walls. Some were looted, others occupied by new top brass or families displaced by the war. A few homes sat in eerie silence, guarded and maintained by distant relatives awaiting a return that might never come. A few had even been transformed into military outposts. Inside these abandoned homes, we often found what we were looking for: clues the occupants unwittingly left behind in haste. We photographed an expired credit card, a utility bill with a full name, family portraits — each providing an insight, however small, about who our subjects were and where they may have gone. Through these efforts, we’ve learned the whereabouts of high-ranking regime officials across the world, locating at least a dozen of our 55 people of interest. Still, none of these individuals have been apprehended. Some are living quietly in plain sight, while others have disappeared into networks of protection and secrecy in places like Russia and the U.A.E. We continue to investigate their alleged crimes inside Syria and activities since the regime’s fall. Christina Goldbaum contributed reporting. Ishaan Jhaveri contributed document analysis.

ed621670a034,The Small Company in Europe Caught in the Big Trade War Between the U.S. and China,"netherlands;holland, computer chip, commerce department, ministry of commerce, international relations, supply chain, china","Late last month, Washington’s intensifying contest with Beijing for control over tech supply chains spilled over in the Netherlands. The Dutch government, under pressure from U.S. officials, took control of the Chinese-owned chip maker Nexperia. Nexperia, which is headquartered in the Netherlands but owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, operates a complex, globe-spanning supply chain typical of chip manufacturing. The company designs older types of chips used in cars and electronics and employs thousands of people across Europe, the United States and Asia. Its factories press thin slabs of silicon in Britain and Germany, and assemble and test chips in China, the Philippines and Malaysia. On Sept. 30, the Dutch government declared that company decisions would now be determined by its minister of economic affairs, Vincent Karremans. Hours earlier, the United States had expanded the scope of a trade blacklist that meant Nexperia would face strict controls on its operations because its owner, Wingtech, was already on the list. In a statement on Sunday revealing its action, the Dutch government said it moved to prevent Nexperia’s products from becoming unavailable in an emergency. But documents published in an Amsterdam court on Tuesday showed that months earlier, U.S. officials had pressured the Dutch government about the company’s ownership. The United States Department of Commerce placed trade restrictions on Wingtech last December. In June, American officials told the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Nexperia could be next, unless the company replaced its Chinese chief executive, Zhang Xuezheng. “The fact that the company’s C.E.O. is still the same Chinese owner is problematic,” the American officials said, according to the court documents.

c49f8d7bcb7f,Families of Jeju Air Crash Victims Sue Boeing,"airlines;airplanes, plane crash, jeju air flight 7c2216, lawsuits, boeing, muan international airport, chicago, seattle, south korea","Fourteen families of people on a Jeju Air plane that crashed in South Korea last year sued Boeing in the United States this week, the latest in a series of lawsuits over an accident that killed 179 of the 181 people on board the passenger jet. The Jeju Air plane exploded into a fireball when it struck a concrete-reinforced berm at the end of the runway after belly landing at a South Korean airport in December 2024. It was the deadliest plane crash on South Korean soil and, at the time, the deadliest worldwide since 2018. Investigators are still trying to find out what caused the crash. They are looking at several possible factors including a bird strike that the pilots reported before the crash, the lethal berm at the end of the runway, and the pilots’ decision to shut down the plane’s less-damaged engine. As the crash investigation continues, the victims’ families are pursuing several strategies to seek justice for their relatives. Several lawsuits filed in American courts this year have accused Boeing of failing to update the systems on the plane, a 737-800, that had been designed to help the pilots land safely in emergencies. On Tuesday, 14 South Korean families of victims sued Boeing in Washington State. Their lawsuit in state court said that the company deprived the pilots of the means to land safely by failing to modernize the plane’s electrical and hydraulic systems. It also accused Boeing of failing to provide adequate training for the pilots. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

d46f4ca9ce8c,China’s Rare Earth Restrictions Aim to Beat U.S. at Its Own Game,"international trade, supply chain, tariff, computer chip, us economy, rare earths, china, us, donald trump","Over the past three years, Washington has claimed broad power to impose global rules that bar companies anywhere in the world from sending cutting-edge computer chips or the tools needed to make them to China. American officials have argued that approach is necessary to make sure China does not gain the upper hand in the race for advanced artificial intelligence. But a sweeping set of restrictions announced by Beijing last week showed that two can play that game. The Chinese government flexed its own influence over worldwide supply chains when it announced new rules clamping down on the flow of critical minerals that are used in everything from computer chips to cars to missiles . The rules, which are set to take effect later this year, shocked foreign governments and businesses, which may now need to acquire licenses from Beijing to trade their products even outside China. With its dominance over the production of these rare earth minerals and its control of other strategic industries, China may have an even greater ability than the United States to weaponize supply chains, analysts say. “The U.S. now has to face up to the fact it has an adversary which can threaten substantial parts of the U.S. economy,” said Henry Farrell, a political scientist at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. The United States and China are now very clearly “in a much more delicate stage of mutual interdependence,” he added. “China has really begun to figure out how to take a leaf from the U.S. playbook and in a certain sense play that game better than the U.S. is currently playing it,” Mr. Farrell said.

5c6f7dd5ce6f,High-End Amenities in Office Buildings? These N.Y. Tenants Say No Thanks.,"commercial real estate, rent, workplace, us economy, bike new york, national women's soccer league us, manhattan","When Ken Podziba , chief executive of Bike New York , was searching for office space, his priorities were a good deal near public transportation and a building where his employees could take their bikes upstairs if they cycled to work. “We don’t care about the amenities,” said Mr. Podziba, whose nonprofit organization teaches cycling and plans group rides including the annual TD Five Boro Bike Tour. “It doesn’t matter to us at all if a building has a pool table or fancy food.” Mr. Podziba looked at two dozen spaces before deciding on a nine-story building constructed in 1922 on East 45th Street, steps from Grand Central Terminal. There is no doorman, and the view — of other buildings — is not glamorous. Amenities? The Irish pub M.J. Smith’s on the ground floor. But the space, which rented for about $9,000 a month, had 2,500 square feet. Since the staff of 15 moved there in late 2023, they’ve added an under-desk exercise bike as well as a trainer, a stand on which a bike can be mounted so employees can pedal while they work. “I love this space,” Mr. Podziba said. “It just feels like Bike New York.” Mr. Podziba’s organization is one of many that are helping to revive demand in Class B buildings, older properties with limited services that seemed all but doomed just a few years ago when the coronavirus pandemic sent workers home and remote working arrangements persisted. (Mr. Podziba’s broker, Stephen Powers, a founder of OPEN Impact Real Estate, rated the building a “C+ or B–” in a phone interview.) The fortunes of Class B buildings, which make up over 35 percent of Manhattan’s office total, started to show signs of turning around in the first half of 2025. Nearly 45 percent of Manhattan’s office leasing in the second quarter was Class B or Class C, up from 35 percent last year, according to data from Savills, a commercial real estate brokerage. One property owner and manager, Adams & Company, said the vacancy rate for its Manhattan portfolio of mostly Class B buildings fell to 3 percent, from 16 percent during the pandemic, with many buildings now 100 percent leased. That’s a big improvement, even as much of the leasing action continues to take place in new amenities-filled “trophy” properties. In the years after the pandemic, prospective tenants raced to land the shiny spaces, with their golf simulators and wellness suites, hoping they were enticing enough to lure workers back to the office ; real estate experts have called the trend a “flight to quality.” Trophy buildings make up about 11 percent of office space in Manhattan, and the Class A buildings that are still high-end but may be slightly older and have fewer amenities make up about 50 percent, according to CoStar, a real estate services company. (The rating system is highly subjective and used in real estate circles to grade buildings on size, age, location and features.) “Coming out of the pandemic, there was a lot of gratuitous denigrating of the B sector,” said Michael T. Cohen, a principal at Williams Equities, which owns several buildings in the category. The attention that Class B buildings are getting now reflects an overall improvement in office leasing in Manhattan, the New York borough with the most office space, as more employers call workers back to the office full time. Nearly 22 million square feet of office space has been leased in Manhattan this year, according to the most recent data from JLL, a real estate services firm. That’s 7 percent higher than last year and the highest volume since 2020. The vacancy rate is under 15 percent, the lowest in five years. Class B buildings are also benefiting from the shrinking availability of space in state-of-the-art buildings. The conversion of some office spaces to housing , the demolition of others and a lack of new construction have also pushed up demand for Class B and C buildings. Some landlords of older buildings have also been spiffing up their properties to make them more desirable. Not all older buildings are sharing in the turnaround. Architecturally distinguished buildings near transit hubs are faring well, but nondescript buildings on side streets far from public transportation and without significant upgrades continue to struggle. Landlords are able to charge more for buildings near a transportation hub, according to data from Savills and CompStak, a real estate data provider. Rents in Class B buildings near Grand Central averaged $64.87 per square foot in the third quarter this year, up 2.3 percent from last year, and $62.91 near Pennsylvania Station, up 15.9 percent from 2024. Rent in similar types of buildings across the rest of Midtown fell 5.8 percent, to $45.26 per square foot. But even with leasing activity up, landlords are offering concessions to tenants, including renovating and furnishing spaces, which puts fewer dollars in their pockets — possibly making it harder for them to pay back banks and investors. Many companies are also opting for smaller spaces, possibly because of remote and hybrid work, which has endured; artificial intelligence, which may reduce the number of employees needed; and uncertainty about the U.S. economy, which is causing some companies to pull back on expansion plans. At the same time, Class B buildings have an obvious appeal in times of economic uncertainty: They’re cheaper. Trophy buildings can rent for as much as $250 per square foot, compared with over $86 for lower-end Class A buildings. Class B and C buildings fetch about $60 per square foot , according to Savills. Beyond cheaper rent, some tenants just prefer the character of older buildings. The National Women’s Soccer League is leasing an office in a 1927 building on Fifth Avenue, near Grand Central, after it moved to New York from Chicago and sublet another space for a while. The league’s new home, the Fred F. French Building , lacks the lavish perks of the swanky glass towers that have gone up in recent years, but there was 21,000 square feet of gutted space that offered a chance to create an office from scratch. Since the building is short on amenities, the league is building its own, including a gym and a meeting space that has stadium seating and a turf floor. Besides, staff members, who are expected to move in this fall, will have all the offerings of Midtown at their door. “The world is their oyster,” said Lauren Lopez, the league’s chief people and culture officer. (The asking rent for the National Women’s Soccer League’s space was $58 per square foot, but Ms. Lopez declined to say what it is paying.) Farther south, on Park Avenue between East 31st and East 32nd Streets, the law firm Kellner Herlihy Getty & Friedman recently renewed its lease at a building constructed in 1912. Alan M. Friedman, a partner, said he appreciated what trophy buildings offered — “the views are pretty when you’re up high” — but preferred older buildings, not least because of the wall space the masonry structure provides. All the better to display his collection of New York memorabilia, including a four-and-a-half-foot photo of President William Howard Taft aboard his presidential yacht, the Mayflower, on the Hudson River in 1911 when he was reviewing the Navy’s Atlantic Fleet on procession. “It’s hard to hang a picture on a piece of glass,” Mr. Friedman said. Another quirky feature of the building: an ornate bronze clock , by the artist William Zorach, that was installed on the facade in 1926, when the property was home to silk importers. Every hour, a wizard wearing a cone-shaped hat waves a wand, and the “Queen of Silk” emerges from a cocoon. That, you definitely won’t find on a glassy new skyscraper.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/business/office-amenities-class-b-buildings.html,Business,BBC,By Jane Margolies,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/00BIZ-CLASS-B-Bike1-vwzt/00BIZ-CLASS-B-Bike1-vwzt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:00:21.993000+00:00,2d2b404bda2f4d7f9e2bc57bdd2176a18c8e445f
88a4ef867fe2,‘Köln 75’ Review: The Key to a Famed Piano Concert,"movies, ido fluk, keith jarrett","A music promoter in “Köln 75” insists that the American pianist Keith Jarrett ’s performances shouldn’t be thought of as jazz. His improvisations are even freer: “He plays whatever comes to him,” she explains. This fleet-footed period piece, directed by Ido Fluk, concerns a moment in 1975 when Jarrett caught lightning in a bottle in Cologne, West Germany, at a concert that, luckily enough, was recorded. “The Köln Concert” remains one of the best-selling solo piano albums in history. This crowd-pleaser doesn’t principally tell Jarrett’s story, though, but that of the promoter, Vera Brandes, who began booking musicians as a teenager and was not yet 20 at the time of Jarrett’s triumph. (She is played during the main action by a winning Mala Emde, and by Susanne Wolff in framing scenes set three decades later.) The first part of the movie concentrates on Brandes’s rise, as she books engagements out of the dental clinic run by her imperious father (Ulrich Tukur) and embraces the rebellious energy of the time. Partway through, “Köln 75” introduces Jarrett (a terrifically weary John Magaro) as a major character. For an interlocutor, the movie pairs him with an American journalist (Michael Chernus) who frequently breaks the fourth wall to describe the difficulty of what Jarrett was doing: inventing music by himself in real time every night. In a cameo, the classical pianist Ana-Marija Markovina confirms that she couldn’t play that way. Such breezy asides suggest a movie that’s a little too eager to be liked. But it’s also tough to resist, particularly as Brandes has to scramble as the clock ticks down to the concert and Jarrett’s preferred piano is not in place. Köln 75 Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 52 minutes.

be13621768fe,‘Black Phone 2’ Review: Killer ID,"movies, scott derrickson, ethan hawke","When the Grabber, the masked killer of “Black Phone 2,” makes his long-awaited sort-of resurrection from the dead, he poses a question to Finney (Mason Thames), a boy he kidnapped in the original film. “Have you guessed what it is that I want from you?” he asks. We never really get an answer, but at least this follow-up is curious enough to inquire. Stories of suspense don’t need to, and often shouldn’t, tell us exactly why bad things are happening or where the evil comes from. But a good horror film needs to construct a cohesive world or gesture toward a lore that keeps us invested and stirs up a sense of imagination that might be more terrifying than what we see onscreen. In “The Black Phone” (2021) , mixed horror elements — dreams as murderous premonitions; a masked child abductor; the ghosts of dead children and the rotary phone from which they commune — were left scattered, each piece lacking enough development to motivate the central tension. Armed with a new set of tricks, “Black Phone 2,” directed again by Scott Derrickson, tries to tie those disparate strands together. In 1982, a few years after Finney, now more hard-nosed, defeated the serial killer known as the Grabber ( Ethan Hawke ), strange rumblings are occurring again in their Colorado town. Finney’s sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), whose dreams predict the future, picks up the phone in her sleep and appears to talk to a young version of their dead mother, whose own premonitions led her to kill herself years earlier. That call leads them to the snowy campgrounds where their mother once worked as a counselor. There, a defunct pay phone starts ringing and the Grabber makes his return. The Grabber has a connection to the camp as well, but the film curiously stops short of meaningfully contouring his origin story. What’s up with the mask? Why kids? Why the black balloons when he snatches them? Like a neighborhood myth, we’re meant to just buy into the fear, no questions asked. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

0fdb15d061aa,The Reckoning of Ben Stiller,"movies, theater, tv, actor, comedy, documentaries, severance, christopher walken, adam scott","Ben Stiller has long since stopped analyzing what draws him to projects. Why bother? For most of his nearly four-decade career as an actor and filmmaker, he has topped the box office or slyly captured the zeitgeist, devising — with a stuck zipper , a lip pout , or Robert De Niro as a father-in-law — some of pop culture’s stickiest cinematic moments. So when he first started filming in his parents’ apartment, a few weeks after the death of his father, Jerry Stiller , in 2020, he wasn’t sure why, exactly. “It was just this instinct,” he said. Partly, it was about preservation — the five-bedroom on the Upper West Side was his childhood home, and it was due to be sold . Up until the last possible moment, he shot video tours of the memento-filled, and then emptied corners where he and his older sister, Amy Stiller, grew up, doing bits and homework, bickering and celebrating, with Jerry and their mother, Anne Meara, who died in 2015 . Then, too, he wanted to memorialize Jerry and Anne — or Stiller and Meara, as they were better known in their performance heyday. A comedic duo whose banter catapulted them from the club circuit to household fame in the Ed Sullivan era, they were also a bridge from a midcentury Borscht Belt comedy style to one developed for the TV screen. For an audience of 30 million viewers, they played up their real-life identities as a husband and wife mismatched in culture and religion — in the years when interfaith unions were still rare. At home, they worked relentlessly on their routines, honing the razor timing that their son, who will turn 60 in November, absorbed and seeded through his own work. Ben Stiller quickly realized he should make a documentary about them. The film, “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,” which opens in theaters Friday and streams Oct. 24 on Apple TV, dips into their comic lineage, a legacy that Stiller has transformed as the star of billion-dollar blockbuster series like “Night at the Museum” and “Meet the Parents” (he’s filming its fourth installment) and as director and co-writer of satires like “Tropic Thunder” and “Zoolander.” It’s also part family history, or therapy, as Stiller and his kin drill into what it was like growing up backstage or on sets, with sometimes absentee parents. But the subtext (and often enough, text) of the documentary is more elemental: It’s about what it means to lead an artistic life — a profoundly ambitious, often workaholic one — and also be part of a family. It’s a tension that Stiller has only recently fully confronted. And he did it while filming, with his children. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

690abc8b407a,‘Frankenstein’ Review: Guillermo del Toro’s Creature Rises,"movies, guillermo del toro, jacob elordi, frankenstein","This is a great cast, but Elordi is the standout. He’s under a lot of makeup, of course — following early stage productions of “Frankenstein,” del Toro elects to give the creature’s skin a bluish cast, the pallor of dead skin, rather than the green we’ve more often seen in cinema. He’s almost beautiful, but otherworldly: Starting out innocent, he grows slowly more wretched as he is broken down first by his maker-father, then by everyone else. Elordi has to move like a baby, then an animal, then a man and then a menace; it is a breakout performance worthy of serious attention. This “Frankenstein” is (wisely) slimmed down from Shelley’s, but it’s loaded with subtle thematic and narrative layers, too many to name here. Victor Frankenstein’s mania, for instance, is always in the background of the story, coloring his activities, giving extra depth to some of his declarations. The inclusion in the story of a certain technology invented in the Victorian age both explains the shift forward in the timeline from the novel and makes a heartbreaking moment in the creature’s self-discovery possible. Del Toro has always had an eye for the ways beauty and brutality weave themselves together in human life, and “Frankenstein” is an ideal text for that interest. But the movie also spotlights something he understands intuitively: the difference between the destruction of life — nasty, brutish and quick, as when an unhinged act of violence results in the twisting of limbs or the cracking of bones or a bullet to an eyeball — and the heartbroken and lovely form that life can take at its end. There are some images so stunning I could barely look at them in “Frankenstein,” and some I blinked away from for exactly the other reason. Del Toro has always made movies like that; in this story the theme fits the form perfectly. But it is Milton I couldn’t stop seeing throughout this version of “Frankenstein.” There is some complex theological remixing going on in Shelley’s book — casting the creature as a “new Adam” (a term biblically applied to Jesus), ideas about the breath of God and the soul. Del Toro carries all this over, having Victor declare “It is finished!” when he places the last touch on the creature’s body, then cranking it on wooden planks into an obvious upright cruciform shape. He returns repeatedly to angel imagery; he, too, has his creature read from “Paradise Lost” and wonder why he was made. Yet he has compassion for both the creature and for Victor, and gives them endings that befit that epigraph Shelley provided in the first edition of her novel. This is a story about feeling lost in a cruel world, after all, and seeking an explanation, and choosing to live. But del Toro puts a softhearted, romantic spin on it; you can tell this is a personal story for him. He is working something out here, because Shelley’s tale has come to feel like his own. In so doing, he rewrites Milton a little, too, trying to change the ending of both. Whether or not that’s satisfying depends on who’s watching. But I get the sense, for this creation’s creator, it represents his own grasping, imperfect, longing act of love. Frankenstein Rated R for some truly bone-cracking, hair-raising moments of body horror. Running time: 2 hours 29 minutes.

9a2f224789ba,‘Blue Moon’ Review: Without a Love of My Own,"movies, ethan hawke, richard linklater, blue moon, lorenz hart","“Blue Moon” opens with a man literally singing in the rain, though he’s no Gene Kelly. This sad sack is drunk, stumbling and mumbling through an alley, finally slumping to the ground near a trash can. A humiliating end of the road, for whoever this poor fellow is. Turns out he’s not just anyone: He’s Lorenz Hart (Ethan Hawke), the celebrated lyricist who, together with Richard Rodgers, formed one of the most successful American songwriting teams of all time, with dozens of musicals and films to their 20-year partnership. Some of their songs, like “The Lady Is a Tramp” and “My Funny Valentine,” are so famous that they’re still widely hummable nearly a century later. Their collaboration ended with Hart’s death after an alcoholic relapse; that rainy stumble to the curb was followed by a short stay in the hospital, where Hart died on Nov. 22, 1943. “Blue Moon” — named for the pair’s 1934 ballad and directed by Richard Linklater, from a screenplay by Robert Kaplow — shifts from the alley scene to March 31, 1943, opening night for “Oklahoma!” on Broadway. And there it stays, filling out an affectionate portrait of late-career Hart, who finds himself in a place he never wanted to be. “Oklahoma!” is indeed a Richard Rodgers show, but Rodgers (Andrew Scott), fed up with Hart’s habit of disappearing on alcohol-fueled binges, has opted to team up with Oscar Hammerstein II (Simon Delaney) for this new show. From his box seat, the wounded Hart is convinced of two things: This new show is lighthearted garbage, and it will be a stupendous hit. So as the curtain calls begin, he ducks out to Sardi’s, the West 44th Street institution to which he knows the cast and creative team will eventually repair to gulp martinis and nervously await reviews. He’ll be nice about the betrayal, because he needs some favors. If he doesn’t work again, he might fade away. Hart was a very short man, and Ethan Hawke is of average height, so the filmmakers appear to have built their Sardi’s set at an exaggerated scale and dressed Hawke in a comically huge double-breasted suit, dwarfing him clownishly — a nod, perhaps, to Hart’s fondness for farce and satire. The stool he climbs onto at that downstairs bar is clearly his natural perch, the start of many a bender and many a tall tale. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

That changed when news broke that Payne had died after falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in a trendy part of the Argentine capital. Within minutes, they flocked to the scene. What had been a hunt for their idol quickly turned into a different mission: to create a place where fans could honor his life. The sudden grief took shape in candles and flowers outside the CasaSur Palermo Hotel, soon becoming a coordinated effort to maintain an altar. For an entire year, pictures of Payne have endured, along with handwritten letters from his fans and balloon numbers counting the months since his death. “We’re like Liam’s fairies,” said Valeria Riosa, a 46-year-old hairdresser who leads a community of hundreds of fans, mostly women and mainly from Latin America. It started as a WhatsApp group and turned into a TikTok account and Instagram page . Riosa and others visit the memorial, which is wrapped around a tall tree near the hotel, several times a week to take care of it. They sometimes travel for hours on public transportation.

0d37248da113,"From Bridal Suits to Colorful Gowns, Charles Dieujuste Reinvents Tradition","fashion, weddings and engagements, retail","As a child growing up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in the 1990s, the bridal designer Charles Dieujuste would often use his older sister to model his fashion creations. “I started making her paper hula skirts,” Mr. Dieujuste, 37, said. From paper, he moved on to chiffon — “I had this vibrant green chiffon fabric I found,” he said — and then to various blends and silks. Through all the fabric changes his guiding force has remained the same. In 2020, he created Scorcesa . “The brand is focused on the heritage of the women in my family,” Mr. Dieujuste said. A portmanteau of his grandmothers’ names, he said, Scorcesa is “weaving the family line together.” The brand’s initial emphasis was on courthouse weddings, its minimalist ethic stemming from his mother’s example. “She got married in the chicest way possible,” he said. “She got married in a double-breasted jacket with a pleated skirt.” That many brides were doing smaller, nontraditional weddings in 2020 contributed to the line’s early success. At the beginning, he had some reservations. He recalled thinking, “There is no newness in bridal, why am I even going toward it?” Today Scorcesa offers bridal suits and colorful gowns. And in an industry that has moved almost exclusively overseas , Mr. Dieujuste keeps Scorcesa’s production and manufacturing in the United States. All of his appointments, from the button maker to the trimming company, are within walking distance of his garment district studio, a loft on the 15th floor of a 1920s building, with floormates ranging from costume designers to a theater-scoring company. All production takes place on the sixth floor of the building. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

All Are Welcome.,"rap and hip-hop, personal profile;people story, r&b, sudan archives","Sudan Archives — the songwriter, violinist, singer and rapper born Brittney Denise Parks — had a crowded agenda when she visited New York City for Fashion Week in September. The 31-year-old musician, who lives in Los Angeles, would perform, solo with her electronic arsenal of loops and sound effects, at There Goes the Neighborhood, a Brooklyn festival headlined and curated by TV on the Radio. She was also an invited front-row guest at the fashion show for Luar, a label with edgy designs by its founder, Raul Lopez . And she had booked a music lesson for a recent addition to her collection of traditional bowed string instruments : a kamancheh, a Persian fiddle played upright, supported on a spike. She had bought it in Istanbul, and had long been searching for an instructor. “You place it on your knee, you play it and you move it; I want her to teach me that technique,” said Sudan — as associates call her — over coffee at a waterfront cafe near Luar’s offices. She was wearing a tight black dress and a leather jacket that had “Aaliyah” lettered on the front and a painting of the late R&B singer on the back. “I’m doing a two-hour lesson,” she added. “Once she teaches me the basics, then I can experiment, record it, make music with it.” High-tech performance, provocative fashion and ever-expanding instrument lore are all part of Sudan Archives’ multifarious yet oddly coherent artistic presence, as she constantly mixes brash experimentation, folkloric sounds and unguarded candor. On Friday, she’ll release her third album, “The BPM” — which is, among other things, a tale of self-discovery, a surreal electronic romp, an embrace of physicality and an onslaught of feisty hooks. “I really want it to be disruptive,” she said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/arts/music/sudan-archives-the-bpm.html,Culture,BBC,By Jon Pareles,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19CUL-SUDAN-ARCHIVES-01-hcjg/19CUL-SUDAN-ARCHIVES-01-hcjg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:01:22.627000+00:00,f5c085ef44b7fc94d09166340235a4c56ca852a2
e893115fa8e3,Her Play Pulls on the Fashion Industry’s Threads,"bam, personal profile;people story, couture","The French playwright and director Caroline Guiela Nguyen grew up hearing accents from all around the world. Her Vietnamese grandparents and North African father both spoke French with one; in the Provence village where her parents had settled, Guiela Nguyen herself acquired “a southern accent so thick you could cut it with a knife,” she said recently. But in the world of French theater — where standardized pronunciation is the rule — Guiela Nguyen’s early drama teachers didn’t want to hear a voice like this. “I was made to lose it,” Guiela Nguyen, 44, said matter-of-factly: It was as if “the accents and languages I’d heard around me just didn’t exist.” Now, as one of France’s most original theater makers, Guiela Nguyen is finding a place onstage for those voices. Her production “Lacrima,” which arrives at the Brooklyn Academy of Music next week , features actors speaking in French, English, Tamil and French Sign Language, with a wide variety of intonations — a deliberate contrast to the polished neutrality forced on Guiela Nguyen as a young artist. That contrast has made her a hit with both national and international audiences, and put her at the vanguard of a push to diversify French theater. Her breakout 2017 production, “Saigon,” tackled the legacy of France’s colonial rule in Vietnam. A decades-long story of interconnected characters, told in a mix of French and Vietnamese, “Saigon” has been seen across Europe as well as in Vietnam, China and Australia; more touring dates are planned through 2027, and St. Ann’s Warehouse in New York said it planned to present the production in the spring. “Lacrima,” which premiered at the Avignon Festival last year, also has a long list of dates in Europe and Asia ahead of it after a short run at BAM (Oct. 22-26).

729b20e91959,These Wild Pokémon Might Be Giants,computer and video games,"The quiet, starlit sky belies innumerable fiery battles ahead. Suddenly in the night, your humble pocket monster is enhanced to gigantic size and easily rolls over a weaker Pokémon, the puffy, purple Gengar. To celebrate victory, your friend makes an unusual croissant curry. In Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the goal is not just “Gotta catch ’em all.” There’s a mystery here. Within Lumiose City, a homage to Paris, I discovered an alluring setting for a sci-fi conundrum involving angry, wild Pokémon who randomly attack like rabid animals. Before the evening’s strategic battles commence, realistic human trainers stroll tree-lined Champs-Élysées-style avenues. The days are easy as I watch orange and yellow Magikarp splash and leap from water that ripples and flows clearly. I can see the rocky bottom. That’s important because well-rendered environs weren’t always a priority in Pokémon games . Rather, it’s complex game play and new Pokémon species that have brought fans back again and again for almost 30 years. Here, you’re a young wide-eyed tourist who arrives by train, only to be recruited immediately by the friendly Taunie, a knowledgeable, ponytailed townie who acts as your optimistic guide and occasional battle companion. (It’s she who makes the curry, which is nicely plated.) There’s much to do. Beyond checking out the views from bridges and parks, I helped a researcher find new species and took jobs from a detective to solve minor side-quest enigmas. Sometimes, I just sat at an inviting cafe and observed the town’s varied citizens and manicured flora. Then, it was back to the fight. The process of Mega Evolution creates Brobdingnagian Pokémon. You can encounter the giant opponents raging in gated parks, basketball courts and roof decks. I scaled the tall buildings and battled on penthouse terraces, which gives a taste of Assassin’s Creed’s rooftop gymnastics. Once you’re triumphant, you can leap stories down to the ground because your advanced phone has a Roto-Glide function. It acts somewhat like an invisible parachute.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/arts/pokemon-legends-review.html,Culture,BBC,By Harold Goldberg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16cul-pokemonlegends-review-hcgk/16cul-pokemonlegends-review-hcgk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:03:15.464000+00:00,8431f133e0f8506994c8f154da995aea31b20500
3bd813584055,A Storied Art Collection at Princeton Gets a New Home,"art, museum, princeton university art museum, construction, david adjaye, ai weiwei, diana al-hadid","A university’s art collection is as good as its alumni. And at Princeton, where former students include the Museum of Modern Art’s founding director, Alfred H. Barr Jr. (class of 1922), and the groundbreaking artist Frank Stella (class of 1958), the collection is indeed extraordinary, reflecting the largess and talents of the university’s community over the generations. Now in a stunning new home, these objects seem to breathe and converse as never before. The Princeton University Art Museum reopens on Oct. 31 with a slew of spectacular gifts and commissions by artists including Sean Scully, Diana Al-Hadid and Ai Weiwei, after a four-year ground-up construction project. The new 146,000-square-foot complex of nine interlocking modernist pavilions, built on the site of the former building that was demolished in 2021, almost doubles the museum’s size. The design is credited to Adjaye Associates with Cooper Robertson as executive architect. The building was more than 50 percent constructed in 2023 when news broke of allegations of sexual misconduct against David Adjaye , the celebrated Ghanaian British principal architect, precipitating a swift fall from grace. He has denied the accusations but stepped back from oversight at Princeton and other projects (including the Studio Museum in Harlem, opening on Nov. 15). “Obviously, it’s so much trickier than we wished it would be to talk about David as architect,” James Steward, the Princeton museum’s director of 16 years, said earlier this month, standing outside the expansive building he spearheaded from conception and fund-raising to installation. Its globe-spanning collections number over 117,000 objects, with more than 5 percent now on view (up from 2 percent). “We are not in touch, but the reality is David was the lead design architect for the building, and it would be a bit of a fiction to claim otherwise or sidestep it entirely,” Steward added, confirming that Adjaye has not been invited to the opening.

Oh paused briefly in the wings, then stepped onstage. She had stood there before, but at the final dress rehearsal on Tuesday, she was appearing before an audience for the first time. And when she made her entrance, the people roared. The Duchess, a speaking role, is sometimes performed by retired singers. But it is also used as an opportunity for appearances by celebrities: actresses, like Kathleen Turner , the drag queen Monét X Change and even Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Oh has made a name for herself onscreen, with starring roles in the TV series “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Killing Eve,” as well as movies including “Sideways” and the newly released “Good Fortune.” But lately she has also become a fixture onstage, performing most recently as Olivia in “ Twelfth Night ” at Shakespeare in the Park this summer. At the opening of “Twelfth Night,” she ran into Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager. They had met in the 1990s, when they were both working on the movie “The Red Violin” (Oh as an actor and Gelb as an executive at Sony). He invited her to play the Duchess in “La Fille,” and because a movie project had been postponed, she was free. It helps that, having grown up in Ottawa, she speaks French.

The professions had more in common than might first appear, because he continued in his portraits to construct beautiful compositions that would please his clients. Almost half a century later, in a published interview, he said, “What really made a difference was that I always knew how to find the right position, and I was never wrong.” As he summed it up: “I was capable of making someone look really good.” His boast is amply substantiated in “Seydou Keïta: A Tactile Lens,” a gorgeous retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum that opens a window onto the life of the artist, who died in 2001, and his fellow citizens of Bamako, capital of the colony that was known as French Sudan before it gained independence and was renamed Mali. To make his portraits, Keïta determined the best angle and lighting. He also supplied props — automobiles, radios, textiles, fountain pens and European suits and ties — to buttress the aspirations of his sitters, most of whom hailed from the African elite but crossed over class lines. As his reputation grew, by the early 1950s customers queued up outside his compound all day long, coming from as far away as Benin, Mauritania and Ivory Coast. A signature of Keïta’s photography is his use of patterned handwoven textiles as backdrops in his portraits, a device that has inspired later artists, notably Mickalene Thomas and Kehinde Wiley. In the exhibition, textiles adorn the walls and hang from the ceiling, in colorful contrast to the black-and-white photos. Sometimes, women pose like odalisques on fabric-covered beds — in one case, with five different cloths layered beneath the sitter. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

On a video call from her home in Brooklyn, the Cuban American artist and writer Coco Fusco, 65, was exasperated, though quick to laugh. “People still bother me about the cage every month,” she said. “I always say, ‘I will never get out of that cage, never, ever in my life.’” (It’s true — she has been repeating a version of that line in essays and interviews since 1994.) The cage in question was gold-painted and about 10 feet high. A replica now stands at El Museo del Barrio in East Harlem, where visitors to Fusco’s first survey show in the United States, “Coco Fusco: Tomorrow I Will Become an Island,” are invited to step inside. The enclosure was the setting for her breakout work, “Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West,” a performance conceived as a satirical response to the 500th anniversary of Columbus’s “discovery” of the Americas. Fusco and her collaborator, the Mexican-born performance artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña, inhabited it as fictional natives from “Guatinau,” a supposed “undiscovered” island. They remained in character as audience members — many of whom thought they were genuine — gawked and paid to feed them, snap photos or demand a dance.

0c66801d1116,Blessing a Puerto Rican Tradition With a Museum of Saintly Figures,"art, museum, san juan puerto rico","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. For years, travelers staying in Richard Holm ’s guesthouse in the Santurce neighborhood of San Juan shared the common space with a display of wooden saints carved in the past by Puerto Rican artists. Some of the pint-size statues, called santos , were centuries old. Rural Roman Catholics who could not travel to the island’s city-based churches used them in home altars. Holm soon discovered their power to attract if not pilgrims, at least overnight guests. “Staying in a museum proved to be very popular when I joined Airbnb in 2009,” he told me in an interview. Richard Holm, the co-founder of the museum, which he opened in 2022 after collecting these figures for years. Credit... Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times No one knows how many santos were created over the years by generations of wood carvers, known locally as santeros, or even the names of many of the artists. But one thing is certain: This distinctly Puerto Rican art form was at risk of being forgotten by an increasingly secular society and the island’s large diaspora. That includes me. Puerto Rican by birth, a Protestant who never lived on the island, I knew nothing about the santos until my sister Mavis Negroni-Foosaner stayed at Holm’s Airbnb, and my brother Rafael Negroni Perez took me this summer to see the statues where they now reside, at the Museo de los Santos y Arte Nacional (MUSAN), or the Museum of Saints and National Art. The saints in Holm’s guesthouse had been collected by José Guillermo Torres Melendez, known as Billy, a physician and historian and the author of a forthcoming book on santos. He and Holm had been business associates for years. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Elizabeth Larison, director of the Arts and Culture Advocacy Program for the National Coalition Against Censorship, said she had received reports of artists being disinvited for their work being too political and shows in progress being scrubbed from websites. Yet despite the clear dangers, the cultural community is still struggling to respond. As the first wave of cuts and threats emerged in the spring, noted Erin Harkey, chief executive officer of Americans for the Arts, the overriding response was damage control. Fund-raising ramped up, GoFundMe efforts filled in gaps and individual donors stepped in. A handful of major foundations donated to bridge organizational and even statewide deficits, including the Mellon, Andy Warhol, Helen Frankenthaler and MacArthur foundations. But many have remained notably silent. Some state and local governments have worked to soften the impacts but the majority of regional arts agencies and humanities councils, which rely heavily on federal funding, are in poor condition as well. Regardless, none of these palliative measures comes close to filling the gaps, or to allaying the sense of fear and paralysis in the cultural world. In some respects, museums have been on their own to find creative ways ahead. The Underground Railroad Education Center, following guidance published by Americans for the Arts, appealed successfully to restore its I.M.L.S. funding this year, though it is not expected to be renewed next year. It is now participating in a class-action lawsuit against the E.P.A. over the discontinuation of its capital funding, a suit that was denied, which they are now appealing. Clockshop’s Yank said that the group requested reimbursement and paid the artists their grant money well before they had finished their work, in case the grants were canceled later. In Los Angeles, LAVA (Los Angeles Visual Arts Coalition), an informal group including the leaders of over 30 small to midsize cultural organizations that launched in response to the onset of the Covid pandemic, has ramped up activity, undertaking group fund-raising, splitting the cost of a development consultant and sharing access to major funders and foundations. It has also been a valuable source of support in a troubled time, said a member, Sarah Russin, executive director of the Hollywood-based gallery Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE). Members discussed the dozens of hours wasted on lost grants, new cases that could be made to funders and the ongoing crumbling of their public-funded culture infrastructure. She calls it “a little bit of therapy with a lot of pragmatic. Everyone’s sharing, because there’s so many unknowns, right?” Such resilience is normal operating procedure for many cultural organizations — particularly smaller ones — who are used to being constantly under pressure. “I think scrappiness is a great thing. It implies a certain amount of nimbleness and willingness to think a little outside the box,” said Soyoung Lee, director and chief executive of the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. Despite losing a $30,000 N.E.A. grant for its upcoming show “Rave into the Future: Art in Motion” (and a $200,000 N.E.H. grant for needed facility upgrades), it has no plans to adjust content or approach. “We’re not a space for political debate. But I deeply believe in expanding access to and promoting diversity of culture,” said Lee, “I think we should be bold. I think we should be experimental. I think we should always remember the core mission.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/arts/design/museums-trump-funding-cuts.html,Culture,BBC,By Sam Lubell,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-changingmuseums-02-qpkw/19sp-finearts-changingmuseums-02-qpkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:00:51.113000+00:00,4b64f45431912bd7095cb73c57c53b8cd9ba31bd

The kapémni form, an abstract Lakota symbol broadly recognizable to Indigenous tribes of the Great Plains, consists of two mirrored triangles balanced in the center at their tips in an hourglass shape. The lower one represents the physical world, the upper one the sky and spiritual realm. The form was traditionally rendered in porcupine quillwork, beadwork and parfleche painting on garments and objects made by Native women. “The kapémni really is a worldview based in Lakota philosophy that underscores our connectedness across all humanity, all plant life, all life period,” said Dyani White Hawk , a Minneapolis-based artist who is Sicangu Lakota, of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. She has integrated the kapémni motif in different media and at increasing scale and innovation over the last 15 years. “Utilizing it in my own work serves as a personal reminder over and over again to live by our values.” White Hawk, 48, has recently received a surge of recognition in the art world for her multidisciplinary work that puts abstraction long used by the Lakota people in active conversation with elements of mid-20th century American painting including Abstract Expressionism, Color Field, Hard-Edge and Minimalism. Awarded a MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” in 2023 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2024, White Hawk has high-profile commissions in progress at Kennedy International Airport and Portland International Airport in Oregon, and her work has been collected by dozens of major museums, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Denver Art Museum and the Brooklyn Museum.

The stately downtown building was one of the closest public places that was not segregated, and Moore and her siblings each checked out six books to read and study. The next week, they would do it all over again. “My mother preached education to the skies,” Moore said, “To the point where we were like, Please.” When she was about 10 years old in 1960, her family moved away. Their neighborhood, about 100 city blocks on the western edge of downtown, had been leveled in one of the largest urban renewal efforts in American history. Of its 20,000 residents, 95 percent were Black. “Just about every city in America has their Mill Creek Valley,” said Jody Sowell, the president and chief executive of the Missouri History Museum, which is telling the story of the neighborhood in a new exhibition, “Mill Creek: Black Metropolis.” The showcase is set to open Nov. 15, and it will run through July 12. “Almost every city has some chapter in the story,” Sowell said. Among the communities with their own versions of the story are Paradise Valley in Detroit, Kenyon-Barr in Cincinnati and the Jefferson Street corridor in Nashville . Groups and museums in those cities are similarly revisiting and preserving their neighborhood’s pasts through exhibitions, storytelling projects and community engagement programs. Moore did not learn more of Mill Creek’s story until she was an adult researching newspaper articles about the neighborhood. She was shocked to see Mill Creek Valley, also known as Mill Creek, described as a slum. City and federal documents used the term “slum clearance.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the area in a series of articles in 1948 as the city’s “No. 1 Eyesore.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

3d0271baf00e,Mamdani Is a ‘Sewer Socialist.’ That’s a Good Thing.,"mayoral races, us politics, democratic socialists of america, zohran mamdani, nyc;new york city","Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral candidacy has become a litmus test for the Democratic Party, particularly its broad center-left. Mamdani friendlies see him as representing youthfulness, hope, energy and a shrewd response to the discontents over the cost of living that sent Donald Trump back to the White House. For the Mamdani fearful, he is a dangerous socialist whose victory would lead New York City to ruin, drive away businesses and wealthy people, and allow Republicans to brand Democrats everywhere with the scarlet letter of his radicalism. As the campaign enters its final weeks, Mr. Mamdani is winning this argument, and only in part because of what even his critics concede is an exceptional level of charm and intelligence. He’s making clear that he is far more interested in the practical task of being a successful mayor than in the impossible dream of turning a single city into a socialist paradise — or, as his critics would see it, a nightmare. The way to advance his worldview, he argues, is to show that it works. As he told The New Yorker’s David Remnick in a recent interview , “The most important thing is delivering.” It’s worth noticing that Mr. Mamdani’s critics are focused largely on the past: the 33-year old’s most incendiary statements, and the most extreme components of the Democratic Socialists of America, the organization to which he proudly belongs and that initially powered his political career. Those on the moderate left who see Mr. Mamdani’s upside look instead to the present and the future. They notice how he’s distanced himself from his more controversial statements (particularly about the police and the Middle East), insisted that he’s not running on the D.S.A.’s national agenda, and painted himself as a realistic visionary trying to solve the city’s current problems. Mr. Mamdani has called attention to his own transformation. “The good thing about my youth is that I grow older every day,” Mr. Mamdani, with his emblematic smile, told The New Yorker . He added, “The other part of youth is growth.” You might translate that word “growth” into “not scary.” Mr. Mamdani’s core promises — “fast and free” buses, universal child care, a rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments, five experimental publicly owned grocery stores — are certainly progressive, but none are radical or loony. Each has been tried in one form or another elsewhere. On Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul — nobody’s idea of a left-winger — pledged to work with Mr. Mamdani to deliver on his most expensive promise , universal child care. Beyond the specifics, history teaches that progressive mayors prosper when they understand why voters put them in office. Sheri Berman, a Barnard College political scientist and a widely respected scholar of social democracy, offers a brisk two-part formula. “Successful left-wing mayors,” she told me, “focused on (a.) problems in their cities, and (b.) problems where they had the power to do something.” For history buffs, Mr. Mamdani has done the service of rekindling an interest in a largely forgotten American tradition, the “sewer socialists” who ran a significant list of cities in the last century. The most durable among them was Daniel Hoan, the socialist mayor of Milwaukee from 1916 to 1940. You don’t get re-elected that often by being a failure. Many socialist mayors did not mind being associated with repairing the grubbiest of urban amenities because doing so underscored their aim of running corruption-free governments that did whatever they could to improve the lives of working-class people in their jurisdictions. When lousy (or nonexistent) sewer systems led to illness and death in low-income and immigrant neighborhoods, said Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University, building and fixing sewers became a powerful example of what “common good’ governance could accomplish. Mr. Mamdani knows sewer socialism’s history and has no qualms about identifying with it. “To fight for working people must also mean to fight for their quality of life,” he said in an interview with The Nation in August. “Sewer socialism, to me, represents a belief that the worth of an ideology can only be judged by its delivery. That means improving the services and social goods that working people experience each and every day.” Mr. Mamdani sent a similar message when he was asked, in a preprimary debate , who was the nation’s most effective Democrat. His answer: Boston’s mayor, Michelle Wu. It’s no accident that he picked a progressive role model who is pragmatic and successful enough to be running unopposed for re-election this November. (Ms. Wu so overwhelmed her leading opponent in the preliminary round of voting that he dropped out.) When I asked Ms. Wu earlier this month what she was proudest of in her first term, the catalog she ticked off rapid-fire sounded like — well, to quote a certain mayoral candidate, improvements in those “services and social goods that working people experience each and every day.” She started with the city’s successes against crime. The murder rate in Boston is down to 1957 levels , and she won the endorsement of the city’s largest police union. Fighting crime, effectively and justly, has become a plank of the New Urban Progressivism. Her list also included expanded pre-K, early education and child care programs, more affordable housing and a big increase in the number of first-time home buyers. Like many big city mayors, she sees housing as “the greatest stressor on our families for well over a decade.” Ms. Wu has not gone as far as Mr. Mamdani in promising free buses across the board, but she did champion the creation of free bus routes. She also points to small but measurable new services that can improve the lives of working-class youngsters, including free swimming and bike lessons. With President Trump claiming that cities run by liberal Democrats are “hellholes,” progressives are touting the prospect of Ms. Wu and Mr. Mamdani leading a new generation of mayors determined to show what successful local, progressive governance looks like. For voters still wary of his youth, his executive inexperience and his ideology, Mr. Mamdani signals that he’ll look to highly competent — and noncorrupt — officials to run the city’s departments and services. He has done nothing to discourage talk that New York City’s comptroller, Brad Lander, would play a major role in a Mamdani government, or that he would keep the city’s popular police commissioner, Jessica Tisch. For all of their differences and the controversies around their legacies, the city’s most recent mayors — Michael Bloomberg, Bill de Blasio and Eric Adams — left behind a significant pool of talented urban managers for a new mayor to draw on. The politics of the Middle East are part of New York City’s electoral landscape and the latest developments there threaten to complicate Mr. Mamdani’s dual task of mobilizing younger progressives who share his highly critical view of Israel and winning over center-left voters who still feel sympathy for the Jewish state. So it’s not surprising that former governor Andrew Cuomo, his leading opponent, criticized Mr. Mamdani for taking hours to comment on the cease-fire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas — “His silence speaks volumes,” Mr. Cuomo said on X. When Mr. Mamdani did issue a statement , it balanced, somewhat awkwardly, warm words about “profoundly moving” scenes of freed hostages and returning Palestinians with renewed attacks on Israeli “genocide” and “apartheid.” Yet even in New York, local politics is still local and Mr. Mamdani will keep linking aspirational rhetoric with down-to-earth problem solving. Since “sewer socialism” is largely buried in our nation’s past, Mr. Mamdani likes to offer a more recent standard for local socialist governance. In September, he released a video of his conversation at a diner with the most famous mayor that Burlington, Vt., ever had: Senator Bernie Sanders, who was in City Hall there for eight years in the 1980s and who drew Mr. Mamdani to democratic socialism in the first place. Mr. Sanders didn’t extol revolution or Marxist theory. He highlighted the most basic of city services he sought to distribute more fairly. “In Vermont, we get a lot of snow,” Mr. Sanders explained, “so we made sure that snow removal took place in low-income, working-class neighborhoods.” Think of “snow socialism” as a frosty version of “sewer socialism.” Sure, New York is a more complicated place than Burlington. But last I checked, Burlington is still thriving . E.J.

a9b9a4ccf901,"Something Is Stirring in Christian America, and It’s Making Me Nervous","us politics, separation of church and state, christianity, right-wing extremism and alt-right, empathy, evangelical, timothy keller, stephen miller, russell moore","The fruit of the spirit — “love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control” — in contrast, are present when Christ is present. This is the fruit of a real revival. How will we know when revival sweeps America? It won’t necessarily be when the stadiums fill or even when the churches burst at the seams. The will to religious power can draw a crowd, at least for a time. We will know when revival comes because we will see believers humble themselves, repent of their sins, and then arise, full of genuine virtue, to love their neighbors — to help them, not hurt them — and in so doing to heal our nation. Some other things I did My Sunday column was about a Trump-appointed judge, Karin Immergut, who sees through the Trump con: Presidents have enjoyed a degree of judicial deference in part because they have earned it. Generations of good faith and fair dealing with federal courts have even created a doctrine called the “ presumption of regularity ,” where courts presume that official duties have been properly discharged — unless there is “clear evidence to the contrary.” There is now “clear evidence” — in the form of Trump’s own words — that there is nothing regular about this administration. Judge Immergut understands this reality clearly. She understands that there are traditions that predate court precedent, that predate any deference to the executive. “This country,” she wrote, “has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs.” “This is a nation,” she continued, “of constitutional law, not martial law.” That’s correct. The best way to evaluate the reasoning behind Trump’s actions is to examine Trump’s words, and Trump’s words reveal a man who isn’t just “untethered to the facts”; he’s also untethered to the law. Dishonest presidents should be entitled to no deference at all. On Saturday , we published a conversation with Michelle Cottle and E.J. Dionne Jr. The subject was Donald Trump’s military deployments to American cities. I’m concerned that we’re facing something worse than the red scares of the past. Now we face a blue scare. French: It’s like you have the anti-Lincoln in the White House. Dionne: Yes. French: If you’re looking at Lincoln’s first Inaugural Address, he very eloquently, eloquently sort of begged and pleaded that we must not be enemies, we must be friends. We must remain friends. And of course, that fell on deaf ears. But now you have the exact opposite going on right now in the White House. And I think if you’re wanting to look for historic parallels, you’re going to go to Red Scare One and Red Scare Two. Red Scare One came after World War I, Red Scare Two after World War II. But this isn’t a “Red Scare.” That actually undersells it. This is a “Blue Scare.” In other words, what he’s essentially saying is that it’s not the Communists we’re after — it’s Blue America. It’s the entire superstructure of Blue America, which they are categorizing as the equivalent of Communist Marxists. They’ll use that language. So they’re turning all the engines of government against political opponents, justifying it to their base by claiming these people are the ultimate threat to the American experiment. This is Stephen Miller’s constant rhetoric. In that way, it makes the Red Scare look tame; it’s worse than the Red Scare because it’s like the Red Scare metastasized.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/opinion/christianity-charlie-kirk-revolution-revival.html,Society,BBC,By David French,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/opinion/16french-newsletter-image/16french-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:04:44.329000+00:00,eef2f67db2a57bd2ac8da587b195dafdcb68934c
b74af86a6a46,When Vanity Is Your Superpower,"us politics, right-wing extremism and alt-right, cookware and bakeware, international relations, closings, democrats, republicans, gavin newsom, donald trump, j.d. vance","Bret Stephens: Hi, Frank. I know we’re going to want to talk about Donald Trump’s foray into the Middle East, the government shutdown and other big news. But would you mind if I begin with a story about pots and pans? Frank Bruni: You think I can’t guess where you’re headed, Bret, but you’re wrong! Remember, I was once this newspaper’s restaurant critic. I devour food-related articles. (And food, period.) So I can sense that you’re setting the table for a discussion of … Gavin Newsom? Bret: Correct. The story, as our newsroom colleague Hiroko Tabuchi reported this week , is that the California governor vetoed a bill that would have phased out so-called forever chemicals in nonstick cookware. The legislation was backed by environmentalists but fiercely opposed by manufacturers and celebrity chefs, who argued the bill would jack up prices for consumers. Frank: Strong argument. Consumers right now are plenty battered, price-wise. Bret: What interests me is what motivated Newsom, and my guess is that it has something to do with California’s well-earned reputation for overregulation and hostility to business. All this seems part of his effort to rebrand himself ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run. Your thoughts? Frank: So cynical, Bret? About a reliably humble, steadfastly principled public servant like Newsom? Bret: In Gavin’s defense, his hair gel is made from sustainably farmed kelp. It just has to be. Frank: I have no insight into his coiffure or his roughage, but into his repositioning? I think your analysis is spot on. The Newsom who just vetoed “forever chemicals” is the one who — after Trump’s big victory last November — broke with many of his fellow Democrats and questioned the participation of young trans women in women’s sports; he also invited both Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk onto his podcast. It’s a complicated, fascinating dance Newsom is doing, a mix of moderation and pugilism, across-the-aisle outreach and partisan fortification. While he’s saving home cooks from omelets that cling to the bottom of the skillet, he’s trolling Trump online and pushing to redraw the map of congressional districts in California to get Democrats more seats. The man certainly has energy. Bret: I don’t want to scold Democrats who are seeking to move toward the center and willing to talk to the other side. Plus, Newsom just signed an anti-antisemitism bill that deserves a cheer, not least because it was opposed by the California Teachers Association. But the national verdict on nearly 15 years of Democratic control in Sacramento (and much longer in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco) isn’t going to be kind: urban decay, unaffordable housing, declining public school enrollment, a lousy business climate, and more and more people moving out of the state. If I were JD Vance, I’d be praying for Democrats to nominate Newsom. Frank: If I were JD Vance, I’d have little time to pray because I’d be so busy massaging President Trump’s ego 24/7. Could Vance be more sycophantic? I guess he has to compete against the obsequious likes of Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, who both stood adoringly beside the president in the Oval Office on Wednesday for a news conference ostensibly about crime statistics. Knowing how much Trump loves a lofty superlative, Patel touted “the best numbers for fighting crime in U.S. history” and credited them to — you guessed it! — Trump, whom he thanked for his “brave leadership” and also his “incredible leadership.” That’s the torrent of gushing Vance is up against, and he’s obviously in it to win it. But how about piping up now and then to question — I don’t know — a $20 billion bailout for Argentina? Blowing up Venezuelan boats before you even know for sure if there are drugs aboard them or just water-skiers behind them? Bret: The little-known Article II Section 5 of the Constitution states, “The vice president shall at all times on all things suck up to the president.” Or something like that. But hey, you oppose blowing up Venezuelan boats? Frank: I oppose shooting first and asking questions later. I oppose erring on the side of bloodshed. I oppose guilty-until-proven-MAGA. I oppose the abandonment of due process. I oppose governing by yahoo impulse. Mostly, I oppose a frenzy of executive overreach that sidelines Congress, disregards the Constitution and befits a monarch. The left may be lost, but they have the name of this weekend’s protests right: No Kings. Bret: Right and true. And yet Trump’s opponents would be on firmer ground politically if they had anything to say about the fact that the government of Venezuela is, in effect, a drug cartel in possession of a ravaged country whose chief export is refugees. This year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, the estimable María Corina Machado, is practically begging the U.S. to overthrow the regime of Nicolás Maduro. Maybe I missed it, but I haven’t heard a single Democrat offer a coherent opinion one way or the other about what to do about this hemispheric crisis more than 20 years on, which is one reason Trump’s blow-them-out-of-the-water approach seems, at least, like some kind of course of action. Frank: You just put your finger on two hugely important challenges for Democrats, Bret. One is their need, politically, to be brutally realistic. If you believe — and I do — that moving past Trump is the whole ballgame for America, then there are some ideals you’ll have to shelve briefly, some complaints you’ll have to swallow, in the interests of pragmatism. The other is the party’s need to offer as much as it opposes. Not all that many people get excited about voting for a barricade, for a buffer. Give voters a vision for the future — and even a bit of an agenda. Bret: Right now, I can think of only three Democrats who seem to get your point: Rahm Emanuel, Seth Moulton and John Fetterman. Frank: Listen to our colleague David Leonhardt’s conversation with Pete Buttigieg earlier this week. It was pretty impressive. Bret: Does Buttigieg think the government shutdown is a case of a “ really futile and stupid gesture being done on somebody’s part ”? Frank: He and David don’t get into that. Which is interesting, no? And emblematic? I’m struck not by how much fighting and shouting this shutdown is causing but by how little most people outside of the public sector or the news media talk about it. That must tell us something about Americans’ relationship with their government and their leaders. Don’t you think? Bret: We’ve lived through so many shutdowns in recent years that I think people generally tune it out, at least until it affects them personally. But when they do get around to blaming somebody, it’s generally the party that’s causing the shutdown — which this time means the Democrats. That just reinforces the perception of a party that is primarily focused on obstruction. Meanwhile, the president just put a stop to the war in Gaza. It’s a major diplomatic accomplishment, achieved by unconventional diplomatic means, for which I think he deserves tremendous credit. It’s also a reminder that Trump gets some things right, even if he won’t stop bragging about it. Do you agree? Frank: I indeed agree that Trump deserves enormous credit and that it does seem, from what we know so far, to be a validation of unconventional approaches. Trump’s unconventionality has definite upsides. Many of the people who voted for him were counting on precisely that. Bret: To cite Maximus from “Gladiator”: “Are you not entertained ?” Frank: But let’s see what happens in the coming weeks and months. The durability and legacy of this moment are very much in doubt. Meantime, while freed hostages were being reunited with loved ones in scenes that reduced me to tears, Trump chimed in to complain about the angle of the photo of him on the cover of Time magazine and how it “disappeared” his hair. Um, that’s part of his unconventionality, too. Bret: Nearly all politicians are vain, even — or especially — the ones who pretend they’re not. There’s actually something almost endearing about the nakedness of Trump’s vanity. Frank: Let’s just say that you and I are endeared by very different things, Bret. And, please, no “nakedness” and Trump in the same sentence. Bret: Fair, but Trump has a point: Photographing his turkey neck seemed like an invidious choice by a publication looking for ways to make him look bad. Not that the president of the United States should stoop to notice such things, but Trump is Trump. Frank: Invidious? Is that another character in “Gladiator”? Bret: Yes, but he spells it Invidius. Frank: The thing is, Bret, I don’t think Trump’s vanity is a side conversation or mere quirk or asterisk. Its unrivaled magnitude prevents him from being a good president or even a passable one. It exiles empathy (and no, Elon Musk, empathy is not a dirty word ). It forbids proper perspective. It repels constructive criticism. A complaint about his disappeared hair is a whole lot more than a complaint about his disappeared hair. Bret: True, but beside the point. To the extent that Trump’s petty complaints consume our attention, they simply help him. He wants you to think as small as he does. So stop doing him the favor. The only thing for Democrats to do is to recognize that some of his issues, like immigration and urban decay, are legitimate, and that Democrats need to come up with good solutions for them — solutions that break new ground and don’t come from the tired liberal playbook that just wants to spend more money on anything and everything. Frank: I hear you. And I thank you: In his pettiness, Trump can make some of us petty. But if I mention, say, his proposal that his face be stamped on both sides of a commemorative coin in honor of America’s 250th birthday, am I getting distracted by small stuff? Or tapping into something larger, which is the dangerous coarsening of our culture and his and his supplicants’ promotion of arrogance, of idolatry, of a cult of personality? The Republican Party was the one that always stressed the transformational importance of values and character. Was it wrong? Bret: Listen, if Nero and Caligula could stamp their mugs on Roman coins, why not Trump on American ones? Hey, let’s end this conversation with something other than decline-and-fall. Anything in The Times you read recently that touched you? Frank: I was moved by our colleague Emily Cochrane’s article on Sunday about Chris Davis, the sheriff of the Tennessee county where 16 people were killed by a blast at an explosives plant, and how he tears up when speaking about those deaths. “It is rare to see a law enforcement official or politician be so unabashedly emotional in public,” Emily wrote. Indeed. That’s because we stupidly equate stone-faced stoicism with strength. It can take more grit — and more grace — to share your hurt. True leadership isn’t Trump’s cock-of-the-walk triumphalism. It’s forging the kind of connection with people that comes from a demonstration of vulnerability.

And my guest this week, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, is likely to be the decisive vote in some of these cases. Unfortunately but predictably, that means that she couldn’t or wouldn’t respond to my most direct questions about the Trump administration. But my goal was to push the justice on a question that she can answer, and one that she addresses at length in her new book, “Listening to the Law.” I wanted to know whether her preferred legal theory, originalism, can bend and flex in response to prudential and political concerns. Barrett believes strongly that it shouldn’t, that justices should rule without worrying about public opinion or who happens to be in the White House. But I tend to think real-world politics constantly tests and limits that ideal. So in our conversation, I’m trying to find those limits and the ways in which even justices devoted to the original meaning of the Constitution have to deal with the highly unusual pressures of right now.

63ea66761e67,Chatbots Are a Waste of A.I.’s Real Potential,"artificial intelligence, computers and the internet, tech industry, google, alphabet, openai, yoshua bengio","The biggest artificial intelligence companies are racing to be the first to achieve “artificial general intelligence,” A.I. systems that exhibit the flexibility and resourcefulness of human experts, with the speed and efficiency of digital computers — able to answer nearly any question or solve nearly any problem thrown its way. (Sort of like the starship computer in “Star Trek.”) In recent years, many have believed that the key to getting there was to improve on generative A.I systems, such as ChatGPT. These systems create text, images, code and even videos by training on vast data sets of content produced by humans. They are broad in application yet accessible even to the most novice users of digital tools. Buoyed by the initial progress of chatbots, many thought that A.G.I. was imminent. But these systems have always been prone to hallucinations and errors. Those obstacles may be one reason generative A.I. hasn’t led to the skyrocketing in profits and productivity that many in the tech industry predicted. A recent study run by M.I.T.’s NANDA Initiative found that 95 percent of companies that did A.I. pilot studies found little or no return on their investment. A recent financial analysis projects an estimated shortfall of $800 billion in revenue for A.I. companies by the end of 2030. If the strengths of A.I. are to truly be harnessed, the tech industry should stop focusing so heavily on these one-size-fits-all tools, and instead concentrate on narrow, specialized A.I. tools engineered for particular problems. Because, frankly, they’re often more effective. Until the advent of chatbots, most A.I. developers focused on building special-purpose systems, for things like playing chess or recommending books and movies to consumers. These systems were not nearly as sexy as talking to a chatbot, and each project often took years to get right. But they were often more reliable than today’s generative A.I. tools, because they didn’t try to learn everything from scratch and were often engineered on the basis of expert knowledge. Take chess. If you ask a large language model (the kind of A.I. that powers a chatbot like ChatGPT) to play a game of chess, it struggles to play well and often makes illegal moves , never fully grasping the rules of the game, even after exposure to huge amounts of relevant training data. Special-purpose programs for chess, in contrast, are programmed from the outset to follow a built-in set of rules, and structured around core notions such as board structure and a tree of possible moves. Such systems never make illegal moves, and the best special-purpose chess systems can easily beat even the most skilled humans. Remarkably, an Atari 2600, using custom A.I. software built in the 1970s, was recently reported to have beaten a large language model . But it’s not just simple domains like chess where specialized A.I. shines. One of the greatest contributions of A.I. to date is AlphaFold, an A.I. program developed by Google DeepMind that predicts the three-dimensional structure of proteins. AlphaFold is built with the knowledge that proteins are made up of long strings of amino acids, and information about the ways in which those strings can fold up in the formation of proteins. The system also combines modern machine learning with classical A.I. techniques in novel ways that have been tailored to the specific problem of predicting how proteins fold. Only once all that A.I. structure is built in does AlphaFold’s learning get off the ground. Millions of scientists use AlphaFold routinely, for developing new drugs and investigating molecular pathways in the brain. Over 200 million proteins have been analyzed, hopefully leading to new drugs and advances in agriculture. Last year, its creators were awarded a Nobel Prize. Importantly, the system is built to work only on one single problem, and it solves that one problem extremely well. Companies like Alphabet’s Waymo similarly use carefully prepared A.I. systems with dedicated components for specific purposes, such as object detection, integration of visual data from multiple sensors, understanding surroundings and decision-making. With the core architecture of automated driving already built in it, Waymo’s A.I. can learn and improve its driving much more effectively than if it were to start from a blank slate. On the other hand, the company Ghost Autonomy , founded in 2017 and partly backed by OpenAI, aimed to build software for driverless cars powered by generative A.I. Despite raising over $200 million, the company couldn’t make it work, and last year went out of business . Ensuring safe A.I. is another reason developers should stop deploying general purpose models for everything. To date, the industry has been unable to guarantee that generative A.I. systems will stick to their safety instructions. Studies have documented instances of generative A.I. that deceive their human operators , try to use blackmail if their self-preservation is threatened and respond in a way that could lead to murder . More specialized systems like AlphaFold and Waymo’s driving systems won’t misbehave like that because their operating parameters are much narrower. Shifting focus away from chatbots doesn’t mean that researchers should give up pursuing A.G.I., which could eventually be more effective by inventing new approaches . And it doesn’t mean giving up on generative A.I. altogether; it can certainly still play a beneficial role in some specific tasks, such as coding, brainstorming and translation. Right now, it feels as if Big Tech is throwing general-purpose A.I. spaghetti at the wall and hoping that nothing truly terrible sticks. As the A.I. pioneer Yoshua Bengio has recently emphasized , advancing generalized A.I. systems that can exhibit greater autonomy isn’t necessarily aligned with human interests. Humanity would be better served by labs devoting more resources on building specialized tools for science, medicine, technology and education. Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus at New York University and a founder and former chief executive of Geometric Intelligence, is the author, most recently, of “Taming Silicon Valley: How We Can Ensure That AI Works for Us.” He also publishes a newsletter about A.I.

Among other things, she has read extensively on Jewish and Israeli history. Albanese learned of the Department of Justice’s letter when it was posted on X. “This is where I started to freak out, to be scared,” she told me. Sitting on a bench in her hometown’s public park, in the shadow of a Norman castle, overlooking a vast valley, she looked just as small and vulnerable as any human. Yet the U.S. government had accused her of intimidating the world’s largest corporations. “Can you imagine me terrorizing Google, Microsoft?” Some of Albanese’s U.S. contacts started cutting ties with her, citing legal advice.

d8f9de3e4ce9,Autism Means Too Many Things to Mean Anything,"autism, dsm, robert f. kennedy jr, donald trump, children, intellectual disabilities, us politics, parenting, motherhood, fatherhood, federal aid, rumors and misinformation","When I tell strangers that my daughter is autistic, their questions are often so far from my reality, it’s painful. Does she have a unique talent? Special interests? They picture a child who excels at puzzles. But my daughter hasn’t shown an interest in toys since she was 20 months old and is unable to tell me what she wants to be for Halloween or when she grows up. I fear illnesses like strep throat because she cannot tell me she’s in pain. It’s difficult to have a national conversation about a condition that includes Elon Musk , Greta Thunberg and also my 7-year-old nonverbal daughter, who will likely need 24/7 care for the rest of her life. That’s why families like mine want a distinct diagnostic category for our children that clarifies our challenges and what we need from the medical community. In 2021, a Lancet commission report on the future of autism research and care introduced the term “profound autism” for individuals requiring round-the-clock care, with an I.Q. below 50 or minimal verbal ability or both. Just over a quarter of people with autism would qualify. The commission proposed the term as an administrative label to guide service allocation and research, a recognition of the “vastly different educational and long-term care needs” of this population. Other groups, including the National Council on Severe Autism, have argued for its inclusion in the next edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual. Such a change would, in some ways, be a return to an earlier era. Today, autism is considered a unified spectrum. But before 2013, the diagnostic manual included subtypes, such as Asperger’s for people with milder symptoms. They were removed in part because they were applied inconsistently. But this solution created new problems. We were left with the autism spectrum umbrella, the breadth of which makes coherent conversations about research, causes and policy nearly impossible. The needs of different people with autism vary so widely, we end up talking past one another. While the diagnostic guidelines include levels (my daughter is Level 3 for “high support needs”), that terminology is too euphemistic and unfamiliar to the average American to be useful. The limitations of our autism paradigm were on display in the reactions to President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s news conference calling for an effort across health agencies to identify causes of autism. They suggested that Tylenol and vaccines might be among them . The backlash was immediate. Experts said the Trump administration was citing shaky evidence and spreading anti-vaccine myths, which is correct. But absent from the criticism was any urgency to find the cause of a condition that is so severely limiting. Some equated Mr. Trump’s desire to do so with eugenics. Social media was flooded with jokes about taking Tylenol during pregnancy to give babies autistic savant skills. If profound autism is increasing — of which there is some evidence , but no consensus — we need to know why. We know there are environmental contributors to autism; we should find out what they are. Millions are poured into autism research, but only about 6 percent of research subjects have intellectual disability, a common feature of severe autism, according to one analysis . Such subjects are too often dismissed, seen as too difficult to test and more likely to have behavioral problems. In the absence of data, we make assumptions about nonverbal people, equating a lack of speech with nonthinking and nonunderstanding. While my daughter can’t tell me her preferences, I don’t believe it’s because she has none, but because we haven’t taken the time to fully understand her condition. If children like her were in a stand-alone category, we could push for the attention and funding they deserve without being told that autism research is already happening. To be sure, a return to autism subtypes would bring challenges and edge cases. The spectrum is vast and nonlinear. There are children who have little to no language at ages 2 or 3 but end up speaking. (This is one reason the Lancet commission reserved the profound autism label for after the age of 8, when trajectories are more stable.) Some people would not qualify for a “profound” label but would still need intensive services. I have no desire to participate in the oppression Olympics or insinuate that Level 1 autism is “not disabled enough.” But as autism advocacy increasingly represents the perspectives of high-functioning autistic people — those who can speak at conferences and write policy papers, the needs of families like mine have been sidelined. Some disability activists with autism and low support needs have argued against adult guardianship, the legal process that allows families to retain oversight of their adult children, claiming it violates autonomy. This stance feels out of touch to parents who spend thousands on special beds designed to keep children from wandering off in the middle of the night and who live with the grim statistics on autistic children lost to traffic accidents or drowning after straying from caregivers. Some advocacy groups oppose programs that allow employers to pay some workers with disabilities below minimum wage, arguing that they are discriminatory and ableist. But there is a subset of the disabled population that would not be hired in a traditional employment setting; these programs, which build confidence and skills, are an important lifeline. I know that President Trump’s comments were downright dangerous when it came to autism and vaccines. I know that Department of Education has canceled research grants focused on students with disabilities transitioning to adulthood, that the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been gutted, and Medicaid funding is being cut, all because of this administration. But launching “an unprecedented all-agency effort to identify the causes of autism,” as Mr. Kennedy has promised, is what many parents of profoundly autistic children want to hear. Calls for “awareness and inclusion” can feel like the equivalent of “thoughts and prayers” when your child is told they are “too severe” for the third school you’ve tried to enroll them in, even though it specializes in autism, as happened to a friend of mine. It is a difficult life for both child and caregiver, and it feels invisible. Recognizing profound autism as a distinct diagnosis is not about taking away from those who can advocate for themselves, it’s about making sure that the most stigmatized version of this diagnosis isn’t erased in favor of a more palatable version. I believe my child deserves to be accepted for who she is and seen as inherently valuable, and I also believe scientists should try to learn why she stopped talking before her second birthday, and what treatments would make her life better. Until then, I will make my best guess for a costume, take her trick-or -treating and give her a pumpkin bucket to hold her candy, blue for autism awareness. I will explain to the neighbors that she is autistic and can’t say trick or treat, but that she loves Reese’s Cups.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/opinion/autism-diagnosis-category-stigma.html,Society,BBC,By Emily May,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/opinion/16may-image/16may-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:01:17.981000+00:00,b35c5fababe09a994ac6434bd872913d89585799
a41958d46259,China Fans Patriotic Sentiment as Trade War With U.S. Heats Up,"propaganda, international trade, international relations, rare earths, china","Over the last few days, Chinese state media have been posting an old video of Mao Zedong issuing one of his most famous battle cries. “For as long as they want to fight,” he shouts from behind a row of microphones, “we will fight!” Speaking in 1953, China’s former leader was referring to the United States, which it fought during the Korean War. Today, Beijing portrays itself as fighting a different but no less existential battle with its old rival, as the two countries engage in a deepening trade war that threatens to engulf the global economy . The latest round includes U.S. threats of 100 percent tariffs — a response to Beijing’s announcement last week of new export controls over rare earth minerals — as well as port fees levied by both countries, Chinese sanctions on U.S. shipping subsidiaries and a possible U.S. ban on Chinese cooking oil imports. Faced with the breakdown of what was a fragile truce between the two countries after months of tit-for-tat retaliation, China’s propaganda machine went to work this week, rallying citizens with messages of resilience and patriotism. At the same time, state media and officials have held back from more strident language — a sign that the Chinese leadership is still leaving room for reconciliation with the United States. “They don’t want to box themselves in,” said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago who researches Chinese politics. He said that years of hawkish “wolf warrior” diplomacy had taught China’s leaders the dangers of fanning nationalism. “Sometimes, when public sentiment was so mobilized, it was hard for the authorities to de-escalate and sometimes, in the process, that made them look bad,” he said.

Philipp Navratil, who took over as chief executive last month, announced the changes as part of a wider move to cut 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.7 billion, in spending by 2027. A previous plan called for 2.5 billion francs in cuts over the same time frame. “The world is changing, and Nestlé needs to change faster,” Mr. Navratil said in a statement . “This will include making hard but necessary decisions” Nestlé, which counts Nespresso, KitKat, Toll House, Perrier and Purina among its 2,000 brands, is based in Switzerland and employs some 277,000 people around the globe. It said that increased automatization and sharing services among divisions would compensate for the lost workers. The cuts will affect workers around the world, with 12,000 of them being white-collar jobs, the company said. Nestlé has been seeking to cut costs in the face of stalling growth and a drop in demand from China, which has led to increased pressure from investors. President Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports to the United States, including a levy of 39 percent on Swiss goods , added further challenges. The United States is Nestlé’s largest market. Shares of Nestlé rose more than 8 percent in trading in Zurich, as investors welcomed the moves after months of turmoil in the company’s leadership. Mr. Navratil, a longtime Nestlé executive, took over for Laurent Freix e, who was forced out over an undisclosed relationship with a subordinate, which the company said was a breach of its code of conduct. Nestlé’s chairman, Paul Bulcke, stepped down two weeks later and was replaced by Pablo Isla, the former chairman of the Spanish apparel company Inditex. On Thursday, the company reported a 4.3 percent increase in sales for the third quarter, driven by higher prices and overall sales volumes. Nestlé maintained its growth outlook for 2025, expecting an improvement in sales from the previous year despite the negative effects of tariffs and exchange rates, which include the weakening of the U.S. dollar.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/business/nestle-jobs-cuts.html,Business,BBC,By Melissa Eddy,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16nestle-tmkf/16nestle-tmkf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T10:04:45.641000+00:00,8ffec573a453bef8dcadf5c9893090c1d2dc4a8a
4d7bdd66db44,Israel Marks Two Years Since Oct. 7 as a Fragile Cease-Fire Holds,"israel gaza war, israel, hamas, gaza strip","Israel marked a national day of commemoration on Thursday for the victims of the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, and for those who died in the ensuing war, almost a week after a cease-fire in Gaza was declared. A central state ceremony was held Thursday, which was two years after the 2023 attack according to the Jewish calendar. It took place at the national cemetery, Mount Herzl, in Jerusalem. Several hundred people attended, many in Israeli military uniforms. Since the cease-fire, Hamas has released the 20 remaining living hostages who had been held in Gaza, and Israel has freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from its jails. Among those freed were 250 Palestinians convicted of terrorism offenses or acts of violence against Israelis and roughly 1,700 more who were detained in Gaza during the war and held in Israel without charge. On Thursday, Israel said it had identified the bodies of two more people that Hamas handed back on Wednesday. Israel said the two had been killed in the October 2023 attack and taken into Gaza. Last week’s truce agreement called for the immediate handover of all remaining bodies in Gaza, though both sides acknowledged that some could be difficult to locate and may take more time to retrieve because of the destruction across the enclave. The Palestinian militant group has so far handed over at least nine bodies that Israel has identified, while 19 more bodies remain in Gaza, according to a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister’s office. Israel has returned at least 90 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, according to statements by the International Red Cross. The Israeli military has withdrawn some of its forces to an agreed-upon line inside Gaza, and some Gazans have begun returning to their homes — or to where the homes once stood. About 1,200 people were killed on Oct. 7, including Israeli civilians and security personnel, and about 250 were taken hostage. In the subsequent war in Gaza, at least 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Over 460 Israelis have been killed in the war since it started, according to Israel’s National Security Council.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-october-7-attack-hamas-ceasefire.html,World,BBC,By Natan Odenheimer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/16int-israel-ceremony-zvgl-cover/16int-israel-ceremony-zvgl-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T11:05:01+00:00,db64c74bc4d5dd180697a705da91b096ac4a18b5

(Miller began shooting during the pandemic, with Scorsese seated on her deck.) While many bio-docs cut around their interlocutors, Miller leans into her offscreen presence by presenting the interview as an exchange. Scorsese, dressed in button-down shirts and flashing an enviable row of pearly whites, receives Miller with warmth, good humor and, if not total candor, then a general openness toward the full story, even when it’s less than flattering. The profile begins in childhood, with Scorsese as a sickly, indoor kid. He recalls halcyon early years in an Italian American enclave in Corona, Queens, and a rougher adolescence in Lower Manhattan. Violence was everywhere, from the mob bosses who reigned over the city to his father’s dispute with a landlord that boiled over into blows. Miller highlights Scorsese’s struggle with asthma as a filmmaking origin story; sequestered inside the apartment, watching the streets below, Scorsese learned to see the world frame by frame. As an adolescent, Scorsese sought refuge in Catholicism, and took steps toward entering the priesthood. He later enrolled in New York University, where he earned accolades for his short films — cheeky, grainy affairs that channel the gaiety of the French New Wave. But Scorsese’s grappling with his Christian faith continued for the rest of his life. As he progressed in his career, the director suffused his work with religious ideas, most explicitly in “The Last Temptation” and “Silence,” both stories of inner strife. But his secular films are equally engaged with theology, grappling with virtue and sin, ruin and redemption, guilt and grace. Scorsese also wrestled with the devil (so to speak) in his personal life, most notably in the spell following “The Last Waltz,” his concert documentary about the Band. Freshly divorced and hooked on uppers, Scorsese moved in with the group’s chief songwriter and lead guitarist, Robbie Robertson , in Los Angeles, where the pair fostered a kind of creative partnership motored by cocaine and carousing. The period ended badly, in a drug-induced collapse and hospitalization. Miller stages this low point as an episode cliffhanger. This positioning might have felt overly slick if it weren’t cushioned by a meaningful redemption arc: Robert De Niro, offering his old friend a lifeline, convinced Scorsese to make “Raging Bull.” It was a resounding success.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/movies/mr-scorsese-review.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Natalia Winkelman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16cul-mr-Scorsese-review-lmtg/16cul-mr-Scorsese-review-lmtg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T11:27:53.880000+00:00,c68b11de6ed7e2d3983c661708e4a37c291362cd
06a0d2ea1653,‘Truth & Treason’ Review: The Price of Courage,movies,"Until Germany’s defeat in World War II, defying the ruling Nazi party was an extremely risky undertaking. “ Truth and Treason ,” a new film directed by Matt Whitaker, tells the true story of a group of young resisters. As is typical of films produced by the Christian-oriented Angel Studios, this movie leans heavily into the inspirational aspects of the narrative. Viewers first meet Helmuth Hübener (Ewan Horrocks), who belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as a cheerful teen wending through tree-lined paths of Hamburg with his friends. The sense that his carefree days will soon end is brought home when a Jewish comrade is hustled off by the police. Helmuth starts his own anonymous postcard campaign, typing out impassioned anti-Nazi messages and tacking them up around town, with some help from his friends. His typewriter ends up betraying him in a sense — its letters provide clues to a dogged Nazi officer determined to root out these propagandists. There’s a lot here that one has seen before. During an interrogation scene, a Nazi knocks his subject off a chair and shouts “Get up!” — then sure enough, he shouts louder, “I said get up!” But there are also a few harrowing shocks in this genuinely appalling story. No matter its flaws, “Truth & Treason” is very well acted. Rupert Evans stands out as Erwin Mussener, the Nazi officer who’s at turns befuddled by, mildly sympathetic toward and infuriated with the anti-Hitler teens. His work, and that of Horrocks, keeps this uneven film watchable. Truth & Treason Rated PG-13 for themes as well as some violence. Running time: 2 hours.

The commission called on church leaders to act more quickly and more transparently, and recommended that the church listen to, and involve, survivors as it works to build trust after decades of scandal . “Many times I have also asked myself that same question: Why so slow?” Msgr. Luis Manuel Alí Herrera, the commission’s secretary, said at a news conference to present its latest report. “Sometimes I admit that I have been discouraged because I wanted the change to be more obvious, more radical.” But, he added, many bishops around the world were now actively working with the commission, a marked change from the pattern when it was established 11 years ago. The focus of this year’s report, the commission’s second, was to push for more reparations beyond the financial payments now being given to some victims. The report said that “the primary need” from survivors was not “financial compensation but rather recognition of harm, genuine apologies, and meaningful action to prevent future abuses.” Many survivors complained to the commission that the church had often responded with “empty settlements, performative gestures, and a persistent refusal to engage” with them “in good faith.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ccc0cfd68af3,India Tiptoes Around Trump’s Latest Claims on Russian Oil Purchases,"international relations, us foreign policy, india, us, oil and gasoline, tariff, narendra modi, donald trump, russian invasion of ukraine (2022), international trade","The Indian government on Thursday appeared to push back against President Trump’s claim that the country would stop buying Russian oil without explicitly rejecting his comments, as it seeks to resolve a bruising trade dispute with Washington by avoiding a public confrontation. In a statement, India’s foreign ministry made no mention of any such promise by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but noted that the country had always sought a diverse range of suppliers for its oil imports. The nonconfrontational response is a sign of how Mr. Modi is seeking to find a delicate resolution with the Trump administration to lift hefty U.S. tariffs, in the hopes of restoring calm to a relationship with Washington that was carefully nurtured over two decades. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the Indian leader had “assured me today that he will not be buying Russian oil,” which his administration has said was fueling Russia war in Ukraine. In August, the Trump administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on imports of Indian goods as punishment, on top of a 25 percent tariff it had already put in place. Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesman for the Indian foreign ministry, said in a news conference on Thursday that he had no knowledge of a call between the two leaders in recent days. But unlike a few months ago, when the government issued a firm pushback after Mr. Trump made a similar claim about Russian oil purchases, Mr. Jaiswal walked a more careful line. Earlier, he had issued a statement that amounted to a denial, without challenging the president directly. The statement said that India’s oil imports are guided by a “consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario.” It added that the country has been “diversifying as appropriate,” including buying more oil from the United States. The ties between the country’s two leaders, who had long touted their close bond, has been thorny during the second Trump administration. The relationship worsened after India denied Mr. Trump’s claim that he had brokered a cease-fire between India and Pakistan after a military conflict between the countries this spring. Any admission that Mr. Modi called off his military operation under pressure from America would be politically risky to the Indian leader’s strongman image at home. But Mr. Trump, who has been focused on his image as a peacemaker deserving of the Nobel Prize, saw the denial as ungrateful. He narrowed in on India’s purchases of Russian oil, which New Delhi has said were encouraged by American officials before Mr. Trump took office to keep market prices in check. The decision to impose the tariffs that has all but grounded relations between the countries. Indian officials have described the tariffs as unfair since other major importers of Russian oil, like China, have not faced similar penalties. “If Trump wants India to behave a certain way, going public about it is the worst thing he could do,” said Harsh V. Pant, a visiting professor of international relations at King’s College London. “It makes it difficult for a policymaker in a country like India to be seen to be toeing a particular line under American pressure.” In recent weeks, the two sides have focused on quiet diplomacy to try and get things back on track. The trade delegations have resumed negotiations and Mr. Modi was among the first global leaders to celebrate Mr. Trump’s role in brokering the hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas. The Indian leader called Mr. Trump on Oct. 9 to congratulate him and to review “the good progress achieved in trade negotiations.” Sergio Gor, a Trump confidante who was recently confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to India, made a four-day trip this month to the country ahead of starting his posting. He held meetings with Mr. Modi and other top officials, even though it is unconventional for an ambassador to do so before he has officially presented his credentials. S. Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, told a gathering in New Delhi this month that the two sides were working on resolving their outstanding trade issues so they do not “percolate into every dimension of the relationship.” “There are problems, there are issues, nobody is in denial of it,” Mr. Jaishankar said. “Those issues need to be negotiated and discussed and resolved, which is exactly what we are trying to do.” Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of Mr. Modi’s economic advisory council, said India had chosen to stand its ground on its interests and not respond to “snide remarks and sometimes what could be deemed as racist remarks against India” by advisers of Mr. Trump. “We have in general been quite restrained,” he told an economic forum this month. Indrani Bagchi, a foreign-policy analyst and chief executive of the Ananta Aspen Center, a think-tank, in New Delhi, said Mr. Trump may be trying to exert leverage through his remarks. “If it’s pressure tactics, I don’t think India is going to fold,” said Hari Kumar contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/asia/india-trump-russia-oil.html,World,BBC,By Mujib Mashal and Pragati K.B.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16INT-INDIA-TRUMP-OIL-01-qpbh/16INT-INDIA-TRUMP-OIL-01-qpbh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T12:00:18+00:00,a830f6dd8378690a903c6fed0a988c647d952897
7e00673f548b,Renting a San Francisco Apartment in the A.I. Boom? Good Luck.,"rent, artificial intelligence, san francisco, computers and the internet, tech industry, startup, real estate, housing, entrepreneurship, price","After Roy Lee’s artificial intelligence start-up, Cluely, landed $5.3 million in venture capital funding this spring, he orchestrated a San Francisco real estate coup. In May, Cluely leased eight apartments for its employees at a new luxury complex — where rents start at $3,000 a month and reach $12,000 a month for penthouse units — just a one-minute walk from its office in the city’s South of Market neighborhood. The apartments were a mix of one-bedroom and two-bedroom units in the 16-story building, which offers a fitness center, a rooftop bar, and concierge and housecleaning services. “Going to the office should feel like you’re walking to your living room, so we really, really want people close,” said Mr. Lee, 22, who chose not to move into the apartments and lives in Cluely’s office, which is housed in a loftlike single-family home. “I feel like I’m more trying to build a frat house, and you don’t commute to a frat house.” Driven by a boom in A.I. companies like Cluely, San Francisco’s residential rents have soared the most in the nation over the past year. Apartment prices in the city rose an average of 6 percent in that time, more than double the 2.5 percent increase in New York City, according to the real estate tracker CoStar. That now puts the average rent for a San Francisco apartment at $3,315 a month, right behind New York City’s $3,360, which is the nation’s highest. The A.I. frenzy’s effect on rents has put pressure on San Francisco’s already strained housing supply, leading to heated competition among techies and non-techies to pounce on listings. Applicants are showing up to apartment tours with envelopes of cash in hand and waiting in long lines to see properties. And the rejections for would-be renters are coming fast. That has raised questions about the affordability of San Francisco, which has long been one of the most expensive U.S. cities. Daniel Lurie, the mayor, has made addressing affordable housing a cornerstone of his policies, while also embracing the growth of local A.I. companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. “Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it before,” said Will Goodman, a principal at Strada Investment Group, which developed the luxury complex that Cluely leased from. Within two months of the development’s opening in May, he said, half of the 501 units had been rented. Ted Egan, the chief economist for the City and County of San Francisco, said the city’s market rents today are still below prepandemic levels when adjusted for inflation. But many service workers who left rent-controlled apartments during the pandemic would now find it difficult to return, he acknowledged. “Tech is setting the bar for housing prices,” Mr. Egan said. Caroline Roche, 25, a demand planner at Backroads, a travel company, recently experienced the rental scarcity firsthand. She has moved twice in San Francisco since arriving in 2022 for her first job after college. But as she prepared for a third move this summer, Ms. Roche was stunned by how much harder it was to find apartments in her desired neighborhoods. When she and her partner showed up to a property tour in the North of the Panhandle neighborhood, they found 20 other couples waiting. In some cases, she said, she has received same-day denials for her rental applications. “It was frustrating to just feel like you’re kind of doing things right in life — you have your job, you’re paying off your credit card — and you still aren’t in the demographic that can afford necessarily what you want,” she said. Ms. Roche and her partner treated the apartment hunt as a second job and did 25 tours in a week, she said, before getting “super lucky” by finding a one-bedroom apartment in their $3,200 monthly budget near Golden Gate Park. She does not plan on moving for at least two years, she said. Landlords used to receive only a few rental applications within a month of listing an apartment, but now are getting one to three on the same day an apartment lists, said Ryan Shane, president of the Housing Guild Management Company, which manages mostly Victorian and Edwardian-style apartment buildings. “It’s much, much easier than it has been in a very long time,” he said. Neighborhoods near A.I. companies — such as Mission Bay, where OpenAI has its headquarters — are particularly popular. Rents in Mission Bay jumped 13 percent over the past year, according to CoStar. Many techies at A.I. start-ups work long hours and want to live close to their offices, said Strada’s Mr. Goodman. Flo Crivello, 33, the chief executive of Lindy, a start-up that makes A.I. software, said he offers his approximately 40 employees a $1,000-a-month rent stipend if they live within a 10-minute walk of the company’s office. Two employees accepted the offer a few years ago when Lindy was in an office near the Hayes Valley and Duboce Triangle neighborhoods, he said. But he has not had any takers since moving Lindy to an office in the SoMa area and is considering expanding the radius. “People are so much happier and healthier when they live close to work,” Mr. Crivello said. “This makes them stick around for longer, perform better and work longer hours.” In August, Taylor Cordoba, 23, who is working on an A.I. medical technology start-up, waited in line at an apartment showing in North Beach as about 15 other people milled around. Ahead of her in line, someone showed rental paperwork to the landlord and offered to pay the deposit on site, with about $7,000 in an envelope, she said. At another showing in Pacific Heights, a person in line showed the landlord a job offer letter, offered to pay the deposit and begged to sign immediately, she said. It was “stressful,” said Ms. Cordoba, who visited more than a dozen apartments over two months. She finally found a three-bedroom apartment for $6,000 a month with two roommates in the Cow Hollow neighborhood. Ia Balbuena, 27, resorted to posting signs on telephone poles around neighborhoods that she wanted to live in during a summer search for a studio apartment. “If you or someone you know are moving out of their studio or 1br send me a text!” she wrote, with an illustration of herself and her two cats, Miso and Frida. The signs did not work. But after about eight tours, said Ms. Balbuena, who works as an office manager at a venture capital firm, she got “really lucky” and found a studio near Haight Ashbury for $2,500 a month. The whole process was “crazy,” she said. “But in this climate, it feels completely normal.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/technology/san-francisco-rent-ai-boom.html,Business,BBC,By Natallie Rocha,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/00biz-sf-rents-sub-vqpt/00biz-sf-rents-sub-vqpt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T13:00:10.357000+00:00,5bb7ce69e9d1daa244e65b14dd40d663d84a1ff8

In the ongoing trade fight between the U.S. and China, who has the upper hand? We go deep into the state of the talks and what may really be going on behind the scenes. DealBook also has a pair of scoops. Niko Gallogly is first to report on Chobani’s new fund-raising round that values it at $20 billion. And Michael de la Merced has the details on the $1 billion Mammoth Brands deal for upscale diapers. Who holds the cards? Multiple rounds of U.S.-China trade talks have achieved little so far, with the exception of a potential TikTok deal . Steep tariffs imposed by both nations are set to kick in next month, with potentially severe consequences for the global economy. And the fight, which on Sunday appeared to be subsiding , now seems to be escalating: Asked on Wednesday if the U.S. and China were in a sustained trade war, President Trump said, “Well, you’re in one now .” But Washington and Beijing are still talking . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled on Wednesday that an extended tariff truce is possible , but added, “All that’s going to be negotiated in the coming weeks.” Yet Bessent himself amped up the rhetoric earlier this week, lashing out at China over proposed limits on exports of critical minerals. The Trump administration is highly concerned about those minerals , whose global production is dominated by China. Beijing’s crackdown on their outflows could hobble key industries, from cars to chips to artificial intelligence. “The U.S. now has to face up to the fact it has an adversary which can threaten substantial parts of the U.S. economy,” Henry Farrell, a political scientist at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told The Times . Meanwhile, China continues to be vexed by Western restrictions on technology, especially products related to A.I. The U.S. is trying to break its dependence on China for critical minerals. But that could take years and usher in a new era of U.S. industrial policy in which Washington takes strategic stakes in select companies like Intel to bolster their chances of success. “When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policies,” Bessent said at an event hosted by CNBC. Could Trump break the impasse? He is still set to meet with President Xi Jinping of China at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month, according to Bessent. Global trade experts see that as a possible make-or-break moment. Both sides could use a win on trade. The economic uncertainty hasn’t badly hit stock markets — yet. But China’s domestic economy has been hurt by trade worries and lackluster consumer spending. And some American farmers are facing big losses because China has essentially stopped buying their soybeans. In other trade news, Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India told him that New Delhi would soon stop buying Russian oil , a potential blow to Moscow’s war in Ukraine. “Now we’ve got to get China to do the same thing,” Trump added. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING A judge temporarily blocks federal layoffs during the government shutdown. Judge Susan Illston of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco sided with government unions fighting proposed mass job cuts. She cited suggestions that the Trump administration was taking advantage of the shutdown to assume “the laws don’t apply to them anymore.” Justice Department lawyers have argued in the case that the president had wide latitude to reshape the federal work force. The Trump administration is said to consider ways to weaponize the I.R.S. Officials plan to install allies of President Trump in senior positions at the agency’s investigations unit and undercut the power of staff lawyers there, The Wall Street Journal reports. The move is intended in part to let the agency pursue criminal inquiries into left-leaning donor groups including the Soros family, The Journal adds. Delaware’s highest court hears arguments about Elon Musk’s Tesla pay. Justices of the state’s Supreme Court considered an appeal by Tesla to reinstate its C.E.O.’s huge pay package, after a lower court judge vacated it because of concerns about the company’s corporate governance. Legal experts said it was unclear how the court would rule, but Musk stands to earn even more from a new pay package announced after Tesla reincorporated in Texas. Exclusive: Chobani’s big new funding round Chobani has raised $650 million at a $20 billion valuation, according to two people familiar with the deal but not authorized to talk about it, Niko Gallogly is first to report. That investment will help the yogurt maker fund two major projects announced last year: a $500 million plant expansion in Idaho, which is expected to increase the factory’s production by nearly 50 percent, and a $1.2 billion food-processing plant in Rome, N.Y. The 20-year-old company expects to make $3.8 billion in net sales this year, a 28 percent increase from last year. It also expects to rake in $780 million in adjusted pretax earnings, a 53 percent jump from 2024. Chobani has benefited from America’s protein craze. Last year, the company introduced a line of high-protein yogurts and shakes. Its ambitions are much bigger than yogurt. The company sells oat milk, creamers and — after a $900 million acquisition of La Colombe — coffee. Those products generated around $600 million in retail sales during the 12 months through September, according to company data reviewed by DealBook. This past spring, Chobani announced the acquisition of Daily Harvest , a maker of plant-based foods. In 2021, the company filed for an initial public offering, reported at a multibillion-dollar valuation , but withdrew it because of challenging market conditions. “This investment means more than just capital — it’s a testament to everything we’ve built,” Hamdi Ulukaya, Chobani’s founder and C.E.O., told DealBook in an email. Exclusive: A billion-dollar diaper deal Mammoth Brands, the parent company of Harry’s razors and Lume deodorant, has ambitions to become a consumer goods conglomerate , including by buying other brands. On Thursday, it plans to announce a new addition — Coterie, a maker of premium-price diapers and other baby care goods — with hopes of drastically expanding its reach, Michael de la Merced is first to report. The deal values Coterie at potentially more than $1 billion, DealBook hears. What is Coterie? Founded in 2019, the start-up began with diapers that its founder, Frank Yu, said were far more absorbent than the competition’s. The company has focused on the higher end of the market, with diaper subscriptions starting at around $95 a month and has largely focused on online sales, though its products are now in Whole Foods, Wegmans and the high-end L.A. chain Erewhon. Coterie has since added baby wipes and, as of last month — and after three years of R.&D. according to the start-up’s president Grace Weingard — skin care. “The premium segment is what’s growing” in baby care, Jess Jacobs, Coterie’s C.E.O., told DealBook. “It’s not about competing with major incumbents head-to-head. It’s about carving this new category.” It has also drawn prominent investors, including venture capital firms and the models and entrepreneurs Karlie Kloss and Ashley Graham. Coterie has grown quickly. It has collected more than $200 million in revenue during the past 12 months and has grown about 60 percent over the past year. It has been profitable for the past three years. That put the start-up on Mammoth’s radar and piqued its interest when Coterie put itself up for sale earlier this year, said Andy Katz-Mayfield, Mammoth’s co-founder and co-C.E.O. The deal consists of cash and stock, and includes payouts contingent on Coterie hitting certain financial targets. Unlike with its previous major acquisition, Lume, Mammoth isn’t raising external equity to buy Coterie: “It’s a nice thing of having a cash-flow profitable business,” Katz-Mayfield said. What’s next: Coterie plans to expand its presence in physical retailers and expects to draw on the experience and resources from its new parent company to do so. Jacobs also suggested Coterie would continue to expand into more product categories. “There’s a lot of space within baby care,” she said, noting that the company’s tagline was “Here for the changes.” As for Mammoth, Katz-Mayfield said that further diversifying the company’s offerings is “certainly helpful” in terms of a future I.P.O., though there’s no specific timeline for taking the business public. “Of course there’s a bubble.” — Hemant Taneja, the C.E.O. of the venture capital firm General Catalyst, on the state of the artificial intelligence boom. More signs of the fervor for all things A.I. have emerged, including another raised sales forecast by the chipmaker TSMC and a $40 billion takeover of Aligned Data Centers. A top proxy adviser broadens its view Glass Lewis is the latest firm to opt out of giving clients a single point of view on proxy voting. Starting in 2027, it plans to stop offering its “house view,” and its more than 1,300 clients will instead choose custom voting options, such as a perspective that favors environmental and governance issues or one that simply sides with the company. The move follows criticism from Republicans in Congress and red states over Glass Lewis’s endorsement of some E.S.G. proposals, Niko Gallogly writes. “The traditional one-size-fits-all model of proxy advice no longer meets the needs of a diverse client base,” Glass Lewis’s C.E.O., Bob Mann, said in a statement. About 70 percent of Glass Lewis clients already use a custom voting policy. It’s part of a trend toward returning proxy voting power to investors. Glass Lewis’s biggest rival, Institutional Shareholder Services, introduced a similar change this year. Large investment managers like Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street have recently given individual investors more say over proxy measures by expanding pass-through voting. Proxy advisers are facing “a ton of political heat,” Caleb Griffin, an associate professor of law at the University of Carolina at Chapel Hill, told DealBook, saying “there’s no political upside” for Glass Lewis to continue offering a house view. Glass Lewis may also be seeking a better business outcome, Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Colorado Boulder, told DealBook, because clients will most likely have to pay more for a customized approach. The shift will also fragment voters . “More dispersed voters that are going in different directions ultimately tends to mean that management wins,” Lipton said. That may end up consolidating the power of boards. That’s what data from Vanguard’s pass-through voting pilot indicates: The top choice for investors, other than opting into the Vanguard voting policy, was to side with a company’s board on proxy voting.

a4f4c3fdeb81,"From Bridal Suits to Colorful Gowns, Charles Dieujuste Reinvents Tradition","fashion, weddings and engagements, retail","The completed gown, part of his Heritage collection and showing at this year’s bridal week, is powder blue and features a sweetheart neckline, a high-low skirt and cutouts. It does not look like a traditional bridal gown, and that’s the point. “You don’t have to follow traditions,” he said. “If you want to experience color, we have that for you.” The piece, in its hue, resembles the gown the actress Chloë Grace Moretz wore for her wedding in August. Scorcesa took the stage on Oct. 15 at Mr. Dieujuste’s studio. Also named “Heritage,” the show wove together the past and the present, featuring gestures toward the 1980s, clean lines and touches of men’s wear. True to form, the primary inspirations behind “Heritage” were the “multifaceted women” of Mr. Dieujuste’s family and his Haitian legacy. “It felt great,” Mr. Dieujuste said. “It’s a lot of work, being a small team. But I made it, all the juggling, all the running around, all the stress and delays — it’s all worth it.” It is fairly unusual to present at both fashion week and bridal week. Most bridal designers choose one. But because last month’s fashion week went well, Mr. Dieujuste felt it was worth it to show at bridal week, too. It comes at a cost, though. Unlike many of his peers, he has a very small team. “If you don’t have a P.R. team to be able to push you forward, then you lose out on opportunities,” he said. Much of the work he does himself, including public relations, marketing and customer relations. Part of the impetus for doing bridal week this year also has to do with representation. “You rarely see any designers of color,” Mr. Dieujuste said. “From my experience, there is not enough of us, and I think ultimately it is due to resources.” He looks to Amsale for an example of how to navigate the bridal world as a Black-owned business.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/fashion/weddings/charles-dieujuste-scorcesa-bridal-designer.html,Culture,BBC,By Kelly Marie Coyne and Erin Schaff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16ST-SCORCESA-PROFILE-promo-qtjw/16ST-SCORCESA-PROFILE-promo-qtjw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:02:16+00:00,7cc2bf0cb63ae8714aff042d720d835fd29fe47f
db8fd232f09d,Ossoff Walks Political Tightrope in Georgia as Shutdown Drags On,"us politics, closings, 2026 midterm elections, democrats, republicans, senate, congress, georgia, jon ossoff","The day Senator Jon Ossoff won a tight runoff in 2021, cementing Democratic control of the Senate, his first pledge to Georgia voters was that he would protect their health care. Now, a fight Democrats have undertaken to preserve a key piece of the Affordable Care Act is at the heart of a government shutdown stalemate that could shape Mr. Ossoff’s uphill fight for re-election next year. For Mr. Ossoff, the most endangered Senate Democrat facing voters in 2026, the shutdown fight entering its third week carries both political opportunities and perils. As the only Democrat running for the Senate in a state that President Trump won in 2024, Mr. Ossoff risks alienating some voters by sticking with his party in refusing to vote to reopen the government until Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans come to the table to negotiate an extension of Obamacare subsidies that are slated to expire at the end of the year. “My constituents don’t want health insurance premiums to double next year and they want the federal government to reopen,” Mr. Ossoff, 38, said in an interview. “There needs to be real leadership from the president. He needs to come out of hiding, come up to the Hill. There is a solution.” But the shutdown fight is also a chance for Mr. Ossoff to rally core Democratic supporters behind him as he braces for a difficult campaign, at a time when many in his party are spoiling for a fight against Mr. Trump. He is “being applauded for being strong, knowing that he’s in a potentially vulnerable situation,” said Lawrence Bell, former deputy chief of staff for Senator Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia. Over 1.5 million people in Georgia are on Obamacare plans and could face substantial cost increases if the subsidies lapse. In Republican-controlled districts, premiums could increase from $1,500 to over $2,000, according to estimates from KFF, a health policy research group. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, said she was “disgusted” by the risk of rising premiums. She is one of the few members of her party who has spoken out about the issue. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” she wrote in a post on social media. A sharp rise in insurance premiums is something “Republicans really need to think about, because I do think politically it matters,” said Brian Robinson, a G.O.P. political consultant in Georgia and past adviser to former Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican. Mr. Ossoff’s political vulnerability and his moderate tendencies have made him a target for Republicans eyeing which Democrats might be persuaded to cut a deal to end the shutdown , though no serious talks have taken shape so far. He also represents tens of thousands of federal employees who are facing furloughs or delayed paychecks during the shutdown, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquartered in Atlanta. But Mr. Trump has already alienated many federal workers with his efforts to dismantle the federal bureaucracy, and his threats of layoffs and denied paychecks since the shutdown began. Many of them are now willing to suffer the pain of a prolonged shutdown if it means Mr. Ossoff taking a stand against the president, said Hillary Holley, executive director of the labor organization Care in Action. “It’s not officially, you know, a labor strike,” said Ms. Holley, a lifelong Georgia resident, referring to federal workers who are furloughed. “But that’s the sentiment that I’m getting when I hear from folks who are federal workers saying, ‘Stand up and fight, because we’ve had enough.’” The “riskier thing,” Ms. Holley added, would be for Democrats like Mr. Ossoff to not continue fighting. “Voters want us to do something about it,” said Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, referring to the expiring Obamacare subsidies. “They don’t want us to just stand by and let it happen.” But keeping up that fight could cost Mr. Ossoff among voters who support the president and are turned off by the idea that the Democratic senator is standing with party leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, in blocking a measure to reopen the government. “The Republican and White House argument that the Democrats caused the shutdown is a simple one compared to the complicated health care argument about subsidies” that will affect some but not all of the senator’s constituents, said Heath Garrett, a G.O.P. strategist in Georgia who was chief of staff to former Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican. Three Republicans have jumped into the primary race to challenge Mr. Ossoff next year. And they are eager to attack him for voting to shut down the government. “We can discuss health care after they end the Schumer shutdown,” Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia, one of the challengers, said in a statement. He also accused Mr. Ossoff of “marching in lockstep” with the “radical left” of his party. In the Senate, Mr. Ossoff is seen as a centrist. He has broken with his party at times during his first term, including to vote in January for the Laken Riley Act, an immigration enforcement law named after the Georgia nursing student who was attacked and killed by an immigrant who had entered the country illegally. If he were to play a role in a deal to end the shutdown, it would give him a bipartisan selling point for his candidacy. But he could face a backlash from the Democratic base if he were to join a handful of defectors in voting to end the shutdown. Republicans, who hold a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate, need eight Democrats to vote to pass a short-term funding bill , since one of their own members, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, is opposed. Three Democratic-aligned senators have broken ranks so far, leaving the G.O.P. five short. Charles S. Bullock III, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said that such a deal would not be likely to sway voters who are fiercely loyal to the president, but that it could help Mr. Ossoff win over some independent voters. “It’s a calculated risk,” Mr. Bullock said. “But I think it’s reasonable to take this position.” But undecided voters will only matter if Democrats turn out across Georgia to vote for their incumbent, and some strategists say Mr. Ossoff’s more pressing imperative is to focus on the base of the party that is clamoring for their representatives in Congress to defy Mr. Trump. “He can’t paralyze himself worried about what this sliver of the electorate might think,” said Mr. Bell.

Delta Air Lines and United Airlines make lots of money. And then there’s everybody else. Those two airlines have pulled ahead of the pack in recent years after making a few big bets. They expanded loyalty programs and leaned into selling more first- and business-class seats. And they operate lots of international flights. That has paid off handsomely. Delta and United have generated most of the industry’s profits since 2022. And some experts believe their lead is only expanding. “This is kind of the industry paradigm now,” said Tom Fitzgerald, an airline industry analyst for the investment bank TD Cowen. “I think the divergence is set to become more and more stark every year.” Last week, Delta said it had earned more than $1.4 billion from July to September, up 11 percent from the same period a year earlier. United said on Wednesday that it had earned $949 million in the third quarter. Both airlines have benefited substantially from increased revenue from loyalty programs and the sale of premium seats.

9f01cc95e8b4,"Carbon Dioxide Levels Jumped by a Record Amount, U.N. Says","climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, wildfires, world meteorological organization","The average level of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere climbed by the largest amount on record between 2023 and 2024, the World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday. Human activities, mainly the burning of coal, oil and gas for energy, have been driving carbon dioxide concentrations higher and higher for more than half a century. This has warmed Earth rapidly, as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases cause energy from the sun to remain trapped near the planet’s surface. Last year was Earth’s hottest year in recorded history. Human-caused emissions remained the major driver of the record recent jump in carbon dioxide levels, the largest since modern measurements began in 1957, according to the organization, which is the weather and climate agency of the United Nations. But an uptick in emissions from wildfires was also likely to have played a role, as was decreased absorption of carbon dioxide by the land and the ocean, the agency said. Severe drought and forest fires can degrade the ability of soil and plants to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while rising ocean temperatures lessen seawater’s capacity to harbor the gas. Carbon dioxide that is not absorbed by the land or by the seas can remain in the atmosphere for centuries, influencing the climate long after its original release into the skies. “The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbocharging our climate and leading to more extreme weather,” Ko Barrett, the World Meteorological Organization’s deputy secretary general, said in a statement. “Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being.” Since 1960, humankind has released roughly 500 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. China is the world’s top emitter today, though when adding up emissions from the whole of the industrial era , the United States comes out on top.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/climate/carbon-dioxide-emissions-record-jump.html,World,BBC,By Raymond Zhong and Sachi Kitajima Mulkey,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16cli-record-pollution-tcgk/16cli-record-pollution-tcgk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T14:52:25.693000+00:00,b7d1c9ef630ec6eec097f08e661de22e44cf74b2

Trump’s New Tariff Could Make Things Worse.,"trucks, tariff, manufacturing, cars, steel iron, price, daimler truck, ford motor, freightliner, paccar, ab volvo, donald trump","Companies involved in transporting goods into and around the United States are bracing for another tariff — this time on trucks. President Trump is planning to impose a 25 percent tariff on medium- and heavy-duty trucks and truck parts on Nov. 1. The Trump administration has released almost no details, creating confusion among truck makers and truckers and prompting much lobbying to try to shape the final policy. If few exemptions are granted, industry analysts say, the tariff could raise the cost of manufacturing trucks and repairing old ones. Mr. Trump is imposing the tariff under a national security provision, known as Section 232, that he has also used to tax imports of steel, aluminum, cars, medical devices and lumber. “We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social last month. The tariff was originally meant to take effect on Oct. 1. Prior Trump tariffs have already had an impact on trucking, sometimes negative. Steel and aluminum tariffs have pushed up the cost of the metals for truck makers like Daimler Truck, which makes Freightliner rigs. Daimler said in its most recent quarterly earnings report that “uncertainties resulting from U.S. tariff policy” had contributed to a steep decline in sales.

3eb9622ea065,The Latest Victoria’s Secret Show(girls),"lingerie and underwear, advertising;marketing, fashion, women and girls, victoria's secret, adam selman, your-feed-fashion","The reinvention of the rebrand of the rebrand of Victoria’s Secret took place Wednesday night at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn. This time it may work. There were the usual Angels (Adriana Lima, Candice Swanepoel, both the Hadids) and an attempt to tap into the current vogue for athletes with the W.N.B.A. star Angel Reese and the Olympian Sunisa Lee. There was musical talent like Madison Beer, Karol G and Missy Elliott. There were wings, but no actual feathers. And there was a real designer behind it all: Adam Selman, formerly of Savage x Fenty and his own brand and the man who put Rihanna in her nude dress , now the executive creative director of VS. Most of all, however, there was a good-natured self-awareness about the whole exercise. VS isn’t fashion, though this time there were more clothes, or clothes-adjacent garments, on the runway than usual. It’s certainly not female empowerment . (Thank god. That was always an impossible sell.) It’s part of a tradition that stretches back through Florenz Ziegfeld, the Rockettes and the Las Vegas of the mind, and it is currently back in the mainstream thanks to Taylor Swift . The VS show is an expression of showgirl culture, the consumer version. Deplore that fantasy or partake in it, it’s impossible not to recognize it, and to see its continued role in how we got to here. Mr. Selman understands that. Which is why, rather than tart up his models up in the ridiculous Victoria’s Secret costumes of yore that seemed calculated to cater to the most camp male fantasies, or render the gear so accessible it looked like a Halloween outfit purchased at Walmart , or hit anyone over the head with How Much VS Has Changed , or even bother going on about the glorification of different body types (that’s now part of the package), he leaned into the sparkle. The crystals and gilded faux feathers and chrome. The tone was set from the first exit — a very pregnant Jasmine Tookes in a pearl-festooned net backed by a cloud of stars — and the first performance: Ms. Beer, surrounded by a lot of fan-wielding backup dancers whose choreography recalled an Esther Williams movie on dry land. There was Ms. Lima with wings trailing acres of silver fringe; here was Angelina Kendall with what seemed like a whole rosy trellis springing from her back. There was Irina Shayk with a spray of pink ferns popping out of the top of her head like a rooster’s crown; here was Awar Odhiang with a crown of silvery shooting stars. There were a lot of billowing robes. The models, mostly, looked as if they were having fun while strutting around in their undies and high heels for public consumption. (The exception was the K-pop girl group Twice, who seemed so bored with their set that most of the time they didn’t even pretend to lip sync, leaving their microphones down by their thighs as their songs were piped over the sound system.) Karol G even donned her own wings and took a turn in a red lace VS bodysuit to cap off her performance. The risk, however, in embracing the showgirl model is that the mood the VS show most captured is the same mood crystallized by the 2024 film “ The Last Showgirl ,” the one starring Pamela Anderson and suffused by nostalgia for a time gone by and dreams that had begun to crack at the seams. Maybe that’s a good bet and people will want to buy into it. The past can take on a rosy glow, especially in an uncertain present, especially when bathed in ruby light. It’s obviously entertaining to watch and has an audience. But it’s not exactly a compelling proposition for the future — even just the future of your underwear drawer.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/style/victorias-secret-vs-show.html,Business,BBC,By Vanessa Friedman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/fashion/16ST-VICTORIAS-SECRET-02/16ST-VICTORIAS-SECRET-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T14:00:11.501000+00:00,b0b5b1bbb34c8958edf96cf3c357e7798a908673
f0ac287561f6,Johnson & Johnson Sued in U.K. Over Baby Powder Cancer Claims,"asbestos, lawsuits, hazmat, cancer, johnson & johnson, kenvue","Thousands of people in Britain are suing the health care giant Johnson & Johnson over claims that the company’s baby powder caused cancer, mirroring a long-running litigation battle in the United States over the talc-based product. More than 3,000 people have joined the lawsuit, which was filed in Britain’s High Court on Tuesday. The initial value of the claim is 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion), said KP Law, which filed the case on behalf of the individuals. It is the first group claim against the company in Britain. The claimants allege that from 1965 to 2023, Johnson & Johnson sold talc products, which it knew contained carcinogenic fibers, including asbestos, in pursuit of profits. The company stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the United States and Canada in 2020, switching to cornstarch, which it adopted globally in 2023. The claims in Britain are similar to others made in the United States, where the company has faced accusations from tens of thousands of people. Last week, Johnson & Johnson was ordered by a Los Angeles jury to pay $966 million to the family of a California woman who died from a rare and aggressive cancer. This year, the company’s request to use a bankruptcy court for a $9 billion settlement to resolve around 70,000 claims was rejected. For decades, Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder was made from the mineral talc. The company has spent years claiming that the product is safe. Internal memos have shown, however, that the company had long been concerned that talc could be contaminated with asbestos, a known carcinogen that often appears underground near talc. In 2023, Johnson & Johnson spun off its consumer brands to a stand-alone company called Kenvue. “We sympathize deeply with people living with cancer,” Kenvue said in a statement on Thursday. Kenvue defended the safety of baby powder, saying it is “backed by years of testing” by laboratories, universities and health authorities around the world. The talc used in baby power “was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer.” The legal action in Britain includes people who developed diseases including ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a type of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. They say they were exposed to the product for at least five years, during infancy and childhood and sometimes continuing into adulthood. The claim says that baby powder was marketed in Britain with packaging that said it was “mildness clinically proven.” “For decades, Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,” Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law, said in a statement. “We will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/business/johnson-johnson-talc-lawsuit-uk.html,Business,BBC,By Eshe Nelson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16biz-uk-talc-hbzq/16biz-uk-talc-hbzq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T13:52:13.766000+00:00,cb72db7f9a5f0cdfcdaa78635a69c7bbed3afb6b

There are no tourbillion movements or white gold cases on display. Here, Hublot might as well be a four-letter word, and Rolex waiting lists are someone else’s problem. Instead, the Windup Watch Fair serves as an annual jamboree for watch enthusiasts who have embraced, and even championed, the rise of microbrands — smaller, independent companies that lean toward novel design and more sensible prices. Jonathan Ferrer, the founder of Brew Watch Co., a microbrand in Hoboken, N.J., knows to leave his blazer at home. “I think the appeal of these shows is that they’re so authentic and approachable,” he said in a recent interview. “Your audience just wants you to know that you’re with them.” The 10th edition of the Windup Watch Fair is set for this weekend at Center415, a 30,000-square-foot event space in Midtown Manhattan. Organizers are expecting about 150 brands and more than 10,000 attendees at the event which began in 2015. “From the beginning of Windup,” said Blake Malin, one of the event’s founders, “we’ve been like, ‘It can’t just get busier.’ And it just gets busier.

The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this . Joshua Plotnik: For about 20 years, I have been studying Asian elephant cognition. The biggest issue for the conservation of Asian elephants is human-elephant conflict. Humans and elephants are fighting to share limited resources, and you’re starting to see conflict that is resulting in the loss of human and elephant life. For the past seven years, what we have done is systematically identify the individual elephants in the Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. We’ve identified more than 300 of them and created personality profiles. The idea is: If you can identify an elephant that is raiding a farmer’s crop field, can you direct your mitigation toward that particular elephant’s personality? We’ve developed this device called a targeted personality device. It can play a strobe light or display different colors. We can play sounds of predators or novel sounds, depending on whether the elephant is more afraid of predators or novel stimuli. It can spray the odor of potential predators. You can program this device based on all the data you’ve collected on the personalities of the elephants that have come into the crop field. We’re just starting to test that. The majority of funding for this project has come from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They have funded us continuously until the president’s executive order freezing foreign aid in January. U.S. Fish and Wildlife sent a stop-work order. And there’s been no word whatsoever since. It’s been pretty devastating. We haven’t been able to expand at the exact critical moment when we need to . We’re going to have to go month by month until we can figure out how to support this project long term. We’re not willing to shut it down. We get asked all the time: Why should the American taxpayer contribute money to the conservation of wildlife abroad? The biodiversity of the planet is everyone’s responsibility because we’re all interconnected. And when you lose an animal like the elephant, you lose an incredible seed disperser who enables the biodiversity of plants, which leads to increased food resources for other wildlife, which leads to increased resources for humans. But you also lose the ability to teach your children about these animals. What I think people don’t recognize is how incredibly influential the American taxpayer dollar is to conservation. I’ve been proud to be an American for this reason: We have, for so long, been a steward for conservation. And now, practically overnight, that’s been shut off. It’s really almost soul-crushing.

A performance artist sitting inside a cello-shaped echo chamber. A tank full of exotic plants to sustain human life in outer space. These artworks, on show at the 22nd annual edition of the Frieze London fair, whose preview opened on Wednesday, didn’t have the shock value that the works of the Young British Artists once had in their iconoclastic heyday. But they did at least show that London’s contemporary artists and gallerists are prepared to take some conceptual and commercial risks. “Outside, the headlines about Britain are all gloom and doom . Yet Frieze is more energetic than it has been for several years,” said Lars Nittve, the head of the investment committee at Arte Collectum , a $60-million Swedish-based art fund, browsing the fair for potential purchases. Nittve was the founding director of Tate Modern when it opened in 2000, transforming London’s cultural life. “The 1990s didn’t seem to be a great time either,” Nittve said. “Culture is a counterintuitive force. When things are really bad, culture happens.” Frieze London, which takes place in a temporary structure in Regent’s Park and this year features 168 galleries from 43 countries, is the centerpiece of a busy week of fairs, auctions, dealer and museum shows that try to maintain the British capital’s long-held reputation as a global art hub. But nine years after Britain’s seismic vote to leave the European Union, London’s art scene and market have become a mess of contradictions. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

79ae2509102d,Eye Injuries Are Rising Among Pickleball Players,"pickleball, eyes;eyesight;ophthalmology;ophthalmologist, research, aging, emergency medicine, sports injury","Some pickleball players took a direct hit from a fast-moving ball. Others were struck by a paddle. Some fell on the court. All suffered injuries to their eyes. The injuries have spiked in recent years among players of pickleball, the fastest-growing sport in the United States, according to a study published on Thursday. As the sport has gained popularity, it may have also attracted less experienced and less fit players, who may be less agile and more susceptible to injury, the authors noted. “We’ve seen a lot more players who are not familiar with the sport entering the court, and that creates a lot of opportunity for injury,” said Dr. Jonathan C. Tsui, the study’s senior author and a professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “They’re not used to how fast the projectiles are moving and how close to the other players on the court they are,” he added. Dr. Tsui became interested in the subject when a colleague came to work with an injury after a weekend pickleball game. The number of eye injuries is small relative to the number of Americans who play pickleball, estimated to be at least 19.8 million. But some injuries were serious enough that they could lead to vision loss. They included retinal detachments, fractures to one or more of the bones that make up the eye socket, and hyphema, blood collecting in the front of the eye. Dr. Tsui urged players to wear protective eye gear, because hollow, perforated pickleballs meet little air resistance and travel quickly. The study, published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology , analyzed the number of eye injuries that brought pickleball players to hospital emergency rooms from 2005 to 2024. Dr. Tsui and his colleagues extrapolated from a database of injuries that relies on a nationally representative sample of hospitals. From 2014 to 2021, the number of eye injuries stood at about 200 a year. But as the sport took off in recent years, the number of eye injuries started to climb, growing to about 405 cases a year from 2021 to 2024, the study found. While there were just over 3,100 pickleball-related eye injuries that brought players to emergency rooms between 2014 and 2024, over one-third of them — some 1,262 injuries — occurred in 2024 alone. Players 50 and older, who were more likely to sustain ocular injuries than younger players, accounted for 70 percent of all eye injuries. Age-related decreases in muscle mass, bone density and balance may have made them more vulnerable, the authors said. Yet the biggest group of pickleball players are 25- to 34 -year-olds, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. The new study is not the first report of eye injuries on pickleball courts. Several case reports in recent years have described patients who sustained retinal tears or detachments that required treatment with cryotherapy and laser treatment. Other patients experienced dislocation of the crystalline or intraocular lenses . Among them was a 76-year-old woman who sought medical care after developing blurry vision immediately after being injured, and a 77-year-old man who saw a doctor 10 days after a game, when he noticed his vision was worsening. Ocular injuries in sports like tennis and baseball have been declining. Pickleball is played on a small court with participants often positioned only 14 feet apart, leaving them little time to react to avoid a ball or flying paddle. Newer paddles can send balls speeding up to 60 miles per hour, the study said. Biomechanical analyses have shown that a pickleball traveling 30 miles per hour or more can deform the cornea, retina and vitreous of the eye, exerting enough pressure to dislocate the lens, the study said. Eye protection is not required for professional or casual play, the authors of the study noted. USA Pickleball, the sport’s governing body in the United States, last year disapproved of a rule change that would require players to wear eye protection in its tournaments, saying it would be difficult to enforce. Pickleball clubs and courts also do not require eye protection. But the American Academy of Ophthalmology last year recommended players wear eyewear that meets the American Society for Testing and Materials F3164 guidelines, which are the standard for most racket sports. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dolly Ann Padovani-Claudio of the Kellogg Eye Center at the University of Michigan and Adam R. Glassman of the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, Fla., cautioned that there were limitations to data drawn from registries like the one used in the new study, which included just 2 percent of all U.S. hospital emergency departments. Nevertheless, the writers urged USA Pickleball to develop guidelines on protective eyewear in order to stem injuries and to introduce educational programs to raise awareness of the risk.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/health/pickleball-eye-injuries.html,Science,BBC,By Roni Caryn Rabin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16hs-pickleball-vzcw/16hs-pickleball-vzcw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T15:00:05+00:00,3b8cb7c6160d69275666b5b4599cd6791b3b717a

There’s a Word for That.,"mental health, psychiatry, depression, anxiety and stress, psychology, dopamine, happiness, emotion, brain","On Wednesday, Michela turned 49. She considered forcing herself to celebrate, but when two friends offered to take her out, she said no. First, she would have to spend time getting ready. Then, she would need to participate in conversation, act enthusiastic, appreciate the moment. “All that takes so much effort,” she said. “I just don’t have the energy.” Michela, who asked to be identified by her first name, wasn’t simply having a bad day. For years she has had difficulty enjoying the things in life that would normally bring her joy and has felt little drive to pursue them — an experience called anhedonia. Anhedonia is not a diagnosis but rather a common symptom of mental illness. It is a quiet symptom, not a blaring sign that something is wrong. And, for some people, that can mean it goes undetected, said Dr. Judith F. Joseph, a clinical assistant professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “It’s not seen as a crisis,” Dr. Joseph said. But in a way it is, she added. “It’s an existential crisis.” And although most people aren’t familiar with the word “anhedonia,” they should be, she said. It is one of the core markers of major depressive disorder, which Michela lives with, and it is also tied to other illnesses, like schizophrenia, substance use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD.

b45789efd5cb,Israel Philharmonic Draws Protesters as Talk in Gaza Turns to Peace,"classical music, israel gaza war, civil unrest, carnegie hall, israel philharmonic orchestra, lahav shani, clive gillinson","The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, a frequent guest at Carnegie Hall for almost 75 years, is accustomed to being greeted by anti-Israel demonstrations as its players arrive for work on West 57th Street. On Wednesday, when the Philharmonic began four nights of concerts at Carnegie, a smattering of demonstrators were there again, protesting the Israeli military’s killing of civilians in Gaza in the two years since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel. “Get your free programs here: Israel Genocide Orchestra,” a protester, who would not give her name, called out as she pushed pamphlets into the hands of concertgoers. This high-profile run of concerts by the Israel Philharmonic, led by its music director Lahav Shani, takes place against a backdrop of unusual uncertainty, beginning just days after Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire. For two years, protesters have targeted cultural events around the world — particularly those involving Israeli artists — to demonstrate against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. “This is a more polarized time than I can remember,” said Clive Gillinson, the artistic director of Carnegie Hall. “But I would say that’s not just in America. I think that’s worldwide.” Cease-fire or not, orchestra leaders and Carnegie Hall were resigned to the possibility of disruption given the extent to which this conflict has divided the cultural world, from concert halls to museums to Hollywood. In September, a Belgian music festival, the Flanders Festival Ghent, rescinded an invitation to the Munich Philharmonic because it was it was being by led by Shani. (He is taking over as chief conductor of Munich next year, adding to his duties at the Israel Philharmonic.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/arts/music/israel-philharmonic-carnegie-hall-protests-middle-east.html,Culture,BBC,By Adam Nagourney,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16cul-israeli-artists-kplv/16cul-israeli-artists-kplv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T15:48:50.213000+00:00,3d864ef7ef7e9120fa12931b289ea84eaa88fd6f
497009082c6c,White House Set to Announce Proposal Seeking to Make I.V.F. More Accessible,"ivf, infertility, employee benefits, us politics, donald trump","President Trump plans to announce a policy proposal on Thursday to make in vitro fertilization more accessible, according to several administration officials, the first concrete step from the White House on an issue that Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to address on the campaign trail. The White House will issue guidance on what it is calling an employer benefit option to encourage employers to offer I.V.F. and broader infertility coverage directly to workers, in the same way they would with vision or dental coverage, one White House official familiar with the matter said. Mr. Trump is expected to make the announcement from the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon. It is unclear whether the new guidance will substantively affect how many employers will choose to offer such benefits. I.V.F. typically costs $15,000 to $20,000 for a single cycle. The White House will not be providing any subsidies for employers that offer the coverage, and there will be no mandate that they participate. The development comes after months of deliberations on I.V.F. , an issue that has highlighted tensions among the president’s base. Since he took office, Mr. Trump’s administration has debated how to handle the issue, meeting regularly with leading proponents of I.V.F. and also with Christian conservatives who have deep moral and ethical concerns with the procedure, which often involves discarding human embryos. The administration issued an executive order on I.V.F. soon after Mr. Trump took office, promising to lower costs and make the procedure more accessible. The order gave no specifics on how the administration would achieve that goal but promised that a detailed report with recommendations on the topic would be prepared by late May. Five months later, the report has not been released. Specific instructions for employers will be posted on the Labor Department’s website immediately after the announcement, the official said. By offering infertility coverage separately from the major medical insurance package, the person said, the White House expected more small businesses to be able to provide the benefit. Only 1 in 4 companies with more than 200 employees currently covers I.V.F. Representatives of the I.V.F. industry wanted the White House to expand access to the procedure to as many Americans as possible. I.V.F. skeptics, meanwhile, pushed for an alternative approach in line with the Make American Healthy Again movement, called restorative reproductive medicine , which addresses what proponents call the “root causes” of infertility and leaves I.V.F. as a last resort. Mr. Trump did not plan to mention restorative reproductive medicine during his address on Thursday, the White House official said.

Independent investigators who visited Ukraine last week examined a previously unknown type of North Korean cluster munition that was fitted to a Russian drone found near the city of Kherson on Sept. 23. Cluster munitions are a class of military ordnance that break apart in midair and scatter smaller explosive or incendiary weapons, often called bomblets, over a large area. North Korea has supplied Russia with soldiers , artillery shells and ballistic missiles , but the use of North Korean bomblets as warheads in small Russian drones has not previously been reported. The investigators said the bomblet had been heavily modified and attached to a “ first-person-view drone .” That type of drone relays a video feed that enables a soldier to more easily direct it to a target. The report was published by Conflict Armament Research , an independent group based in Britain that identifies and tracks weapons and ammunition used in wars. Ukrainian government authorities have invited the researchers to the country throughout the war to analyze and document Russian military hardware.

4a1199d82948,Trump Was Not the Only President Who Tried to Force Migrants to Leave,"none, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, deportation, mexican american, homeland security, us","It was supposed to be a joke. In 1994, two Latino satirists in Los Angeles took on the anti-immigration campaign of Pete Wilson, the Republican governor of California. Lalo Alcaraz and Esteban Zul created the character Daniel D. Portado, a militant, right-wing Latino so committed to the governor’s platform that he was willing not only to be “deportado” — or deported — but to self-deport. Under a fake name, Hispanics for Wilson, they sent out news releases promoting the creation of “ self-deportation centers ” and directed questions to Mr. Portado. After the Spanish-language network Telemundo invited him onto a talk show, Mr. Alcaraz arrived in character wearing a dark-blue suit and aviators. Mr. Zul posed as his bodyguard. Latino students in the audience booed. “I was so proud of them,” Mr. Zul recalled in a recent interview. In the end, Mr. Alcaraz and Mr. Zul may have been the ones who were fooled. They thought they had created an absurdist prank, only to watch the governor embrace self-deportation as a matter of policy. They learned later that it was an age-old strategy — one that has returned to the fore of national politics. President Donald J. Trump has made self-deportation a cornerstone of his administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants. In a video, Mr. Trump said they could “self deport the easy way — or they can get deported the hard way.” Officials have offered immigrants $1,000 and free plane tickets to leave. The administration has also used the threat of arrest, detention and family separation to try to frighten people into fleeing. It has begun sweeps in major cities, including Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago. In a statement in August, Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said the administration’s campaign had worked: “ In less than 200 days, 1.6 million illegal immigrants have left the United States population.” (An analysis of census data by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found the decline to be nearly 1.5 million between January and June, an early indication that people were leaving either through deportation or by choice.) Throughout American history, political leaders and activists who oppose immigration have sought to tighten the nation’s borders over claims that immigrants diminish wages, raise housing prices, crowd schools, fuel violent crime and threaten the nation’s unity and character. Their effort to push people to self-deport dates back more than a century. While the U.S. government has issued 58 million expulsion orders since 1895, about 86 percent of those removals between 1927 and 2022 were under what is called “voluntary departure,” according to data compiled by the University of California, Los Angeles. That formal process allows unauthorized noncitizens who are tangled in the immigration system to leave on their own rather than face detention or removal hearings. An unquantifiable amount of other undocumented people has simply picked up and left, usually during periods of harsh policies and rising anger toward immigrants. In 1954, for instance, President Dwight D. Eisenhower started “ Operation Wetback ,” named after the ethnic slur, in which law enforcement officers rounded up Mexicans and Mexican Americans and also tried to make life difficult for immigrants, with legal and illegal status, to pressure them to return to Mexico. Pushing people to leave, whether through the formal immigration process or not, is the most expedient and efficient way to achieve mass deportation. But history also suggests that success often depends on a large degree of coercion. “The critical mechanism used is fear,” said S. Deborah Kang, an associate professor of history at the University of Virginia. The Start Some historians and legal scholars trace the roots of self-deportation policy to strategies used to forcibly displace Native Americans, including taking their land and restricting their abilities to find food and shelter. Through the 1800s, similar tactics were used to try to drive out freed Black people, Chinese laborers and Mormons, said Steven Hahn, a history professor at New York University. By the early 20th century, with anti-immigrant and eugenicist movements building, the government was focused on excluding and removing immigrants it saw as biologically inferior, unclean and inclined toward crime. Those included Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants. But eventually, most of the attention turned toward Mexican and Latino workers, whose numbers began to climb as wars enveloped Mexico and many began to fill jobs in the United States at mines, farms and railroads after Chinese laborers were expelled. Between 1920 and 1923, the United States offered an early version of what would later be called “voluntary departure” for about 100,000 Mexicans, providing free return passage. In 1927, the United States formalized the “voluntary departure” option. Mexicans who stayed faced the threat of violence, including lynching, as well as Juan Crow policies that enforced segregation in schools and at restaurants and other public accommodations along the U.S.-Mexico border. Though the numbers of Mexicans migrating to the United States decreased during the Great Depression, anti-Mexican hostilities intensified, as people struggled to find work and feed their families. President Herbert Hoover promised “American jobs for real Americans,” and his labor secretary, William N. Doak, supported local laws and agreements that prevented the government and American companies from hiring anyone of Mexican descent, including U.S. citizens. Though no formal mass deportation order was ever issued, state and local officers in cities such as Los Angeles and Detroit combed workplaces, churches and dance halls in immigrant neighborhoods to detain people of Mexican descent. Mr. Doak urged local leaders and newspapers to publicize these immigration sweeps to encourage Mexicans to leave the country. Private charities and companies, often instigated by government leaders, loaded people onto trains headed south of the border. More than one million people would relocate or be deported to Mexico, roughly 60 percent of whom were U.S. citizens of Mexican heritage, according to the historians Francisco Balderrama and Raymond Rodríguez. The program was called “repatriation.” But Leo Grebler, an economics professor at U.C.L.A., has described the removals as a “ huge twilight zone between voluntary and forced migration.” Self-Deport Becomes an Explicit Goal In 1954, the Eisenhower administration began its drive to ramp up deportations of Mexican immigrants, who it believed exploited the Bracero program, which allowed them to work on farms during World War II. Federal agents and law enforcement officers rounded up workers through sweeps and blunt forms of racial profiling. Tired of political rhetoric that attacked Mexican workers for carrying disease or draining the economy, historians said, many others voluntarily returned to Mexico. By the 1990s, “self-deportation” became an explicit goal. In 1994, Governor Wilson of California successfully pushed for Proposition 187, a ballot initiative that denied undocumented immigrants access to public services, including health care and education. In The New York Times, Governor Wilson made clear his underlying mission: “If it’s clear to you that you cannot be employed, and that you and your family are ineligible for services, you will self-deport.” Proposition 187 was later found unconstitutional by federal courts. But presidents and states would continue to emulate the concept. In 2008, under President George W. Bush, U.S. Customs and Enforcement would try to reproduce past “voluntary departure” programs, with the initiative “Operation Scheduled Departure.” It was meant to allow 457,000 eligible immigrants time to arrange their affairs before agreeing to be deported. Eight people agreed to participate . In President Barack Obama’s first term, the conservative Tea Party movement began pushing for immigration crackdowns, especially in the Sun Belt. Several states, including Arizona, Kansas, Florida and South Carolina, denied undocumented immigrants access to driver’s licenses and in-state college tuition rates for residents. They barred people from displaying foreign flags or speaking any language but English at public schools. Many of the measures were blocked in the courts, but the climate of fear they created, scholars say, compelled an untold number of immigrants to leave the country. By 2012, self-deportation became an issue in the presidential campaign. During a debate for Republican candidates, Mitt Romney, the party’s eventual nominee, was asked how he would force out millions of undocumented immigrants without the use of force. “Well, the answer is self-deportation,” Mr. Romney answered , explaining that people would decide to leave if they had no ability to work in the United States. The answer drew laughter and mockery — including from Mr. Trump. “He had a crazy policy of self deportation, which was maniacal,” Mr. Trump said in November 2012, after the election. “It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.” In his first term, President Obama deported more people than any president since Eisenhower. And the Obama administration would go on to use expedited forms of removal — which denied immigrants hearings and appearances before judges and allowed federal agents to persuade or coerce immigrants into signing off on their own deportations. President Trump has used similar tactics — and then some. With reality TV-style showmanship, his administration has detained a record number of people, deporting many with little or no due process. Some have landed in Rwanda, South Sudan, a notorious prison in El Salvador and a U.S. naval station at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The Trump administration has sought to end programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of people to live and work legally in the United States. And it has canceled many lawfully obtained Social Security numbers , cutting off immigrants’ access to bank accounts and credit cards. In interviews, the satirists Mr. Zul and Mr. Alcaraz said they once believed they were the originators of the concept of self-deportation. But, Mr. Alcaraz said, now that he knows its long history — and watched its modern evolution — he believes Daniel D. Portado was really “kind of a prophet.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/trump-immigrants-self-deportation.html,politics,BBC,By Jazmine Ulloa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/02/arts/self-deport-video-top-still/self-deport-video-top-still-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-16T16:15:51.697000+00:00,8f874da4b42b3e252154110d2ef516fadba859b1
6b806701fd12,Judge Says Immigration Agents Must Wear Body Cameras in Chicago,"immigration and customs enforcement;ice, chicago","A federal judge in Chicago said on Thursday that she was “profoundly concerned” that federal agents might have violated a court order that she had issued setting strict limits on their use of tear gas and requiring them to give protesters warnings to disperse. During a 55-minute hearing, Judge Sara L. Ellis of Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois said she would order the director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Chicago field office to appear in her courtroom on Monday morning. She also said she would broaden her initial order , issued last week, to require federal agents to wear body cameras. The order is focused on Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump administration’s deportation effort in the Chicago area that began in September. As agents from Border Patrol and ICE have started conducting high-profile raids, Chicago area residents have protested, especially near an ICE facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill. Residents have also clashed with immigration agents as the agents have carried out operations along Chicago streets, episodes that have sometimes ended with agents using tear gas to disperse crowds. The Trump administration has said that the protests amount to a “rebellion” that justify the deployment of National Guard troops. That effort remains blocked for now, by a different federal judge’s ruling in a separate lawsuit. Thursday’s proceeding before Judge Ellis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes confrontation next week with Russell Hott, the director of ICE’s Chicago field office. “The field director is going to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given out in the field,” she said. During the hearing, a Justice Department attorney, Sean Skedzielewski, pushed back on some of the allegations, saying that federal agents had given warnings to protesters who gathered at one point in the Albany Park neighborhood, where tear gas was used.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/chicago-immigration-agents-body-cameras.html,politics,BBC,By Mattathias Schwartz and Robert Chiarito,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16trump-news-judge-chicago-ICE-mfqt/16trump-news-judge-chicago-ICE-mfqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T16:01:48.129000+00:00,047b8b75b9b7b6d92c8820248b98194fbe19db32

It was December 2007, a few days after Christmas, and I was sitting in my house in Nairobi watching the election results stream in on TV. Raila — most people referred to him by his first name — was decisively leading. He was about to do the impossible: unseat an incumbent president, which is difficult anywhere, and usher in a peaceful transfer of power on a continent where there were precious few examples of that ever happening. Raila had built a multiethnic coalition and, as we could all see from his enormous rallies and the votes coming in, genuine popularity. I went to sleep that night excited to see how this would play out. But when I woke up, his lead had vanished. Election officials simply changed the vote tabulations. Observers, including me, were shocked by the brazen rigging. Chaos erupted . Kenyans felt wronged. Only after more than 1,000 were killed in post-election violence did international mediators hammer out a compromise that kept Raila from becoming president but that made him prime minister, which turned out to be a lame position. Raila Odinga died this week at 80 . Huge crowds have already gathered to view his body at a stadium in Kenya. The police responded by firing shots into the air. He was one of Kenya’s most colorful and influential political figures, and in the coming days, he will be lionized as a champion of democracy.

The office of the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement in Dschang, in western Cameroon, was set on fire on Wednesday night, according to Cameroonian news media, as well as a local court. Photographs and videos of the blazing building, which some reports said was badly damaged, were shared widely on TikTok and other social media. Tensions have been building in the Central African country since the Sunday vote that pitted the 92-year-old incumbent, President Paul Biya, against Issa Tchiroma Bakary, 76, a former senior member of Mr. Biya’s government. Mr. Bakary resigned in June to form his own campaign. Mr. Biya’s bid for an eighth term has faced rare opposition in what analysts widely described as the closest election of his presidency, which dates to 1982, despite the fact that his main opponent, Maurice Kamto, was barred from running. Two days after the vote, Mr. Bakary claimed a “landslide victory” and called on President Biya to concede. He threatened to call protests against the Biya government. The governing party and the electoral commission both swiftly rejected Mr. Bakary’s claim of victory. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

c6a30983ec51,‘The Mastermind’ Review: A Robbery and a Life Unraveling,"movies, kelly reichardt, josh o'connor","Not long after Kelly Reichardt’s “The Mastermind” opens, a couple of comically blundering thieves rob a small Massachusetts museum. This burglary seems too clumsy and its stakes too modest to call the job a heist. In the movies, at least, “heist” summons up suave charmers who skillfully divest vaults of their contents before sliding into a sports car. During this robbery, the burglars fumble and snap at each other, the shriveled legs of the pantyhose pulled over their heads flapping. Almost despite themselves, the thieves finish the job but one nearly gets stuck in the museum before they finally make their getaway in a station wagon. It’s 1970 and the guy who organized the robbery, James Blaine Mooney a.k.a. J.B., is going through interesting times, partly self-inflicted. Played by the agreeably ubiquitous British actor Josh O’Connor, J.B. doesn’t seem like a typical ringleader of a criminal enterprise, at least onscreen. He’s on the scrawny side, with a patchy beard and droopy affect. He wears clothes that look like someone else bought them for him, and lives in a nondescript suburban house with his wife, Terri (Alana Haim), and two sons whom he barely seems to notice. J.B. often seems like a kid himself, whether he’s eating dinner at the home of his parents (Bill Camp and Hope Davis) or lying to his mother about why he needs to borrow money. J.B. planned the museum job, but the movie’s title turns out to have a distinct ironic tang; the guy hardly comes off as the master of anything, himself most of all. That’s evident throughout his arranging of the robbery, its humorously amateurish execution and its more complicated aftermath, which takes up much of the story. In some classic heist films, like, say, Kubrick’s “The Killing” and Melville’s “Bob le Flambeur,” the focus is on everything that it takes to pull off the job: the goals and logistics, the co-conspirators you can trust, the ones you definitely shouldn’t. Here, the robbery is more of a beginning in a low-key funny and sharp look at a character — as well as a larger world — in thrall to narcissistic self-interest. Reichardt’s filmography includes micro-budgeted independent films like “Old Joy” and slightly less micro movies like “Wendy and Lucy,” “Meek’s Cutoff” and “Showing Up” (all with Michelle Williams ), work that tends to be more beloved by critics than seen in theaters. As a category, independent can be a fairly meaningless, a convenient tag for work that seems offbeat or isn’t from a major studio. Yet there’s more to independence than who wrote the check and for how much; there’s also mind and spirit. In their subject and scale, Reichardt’s movies align with these vague ideas about independence, but what’s striking about them is how her ethical sensibility informs her cinematic realism. Her work moves to her beat. Reichardt’s movies are intimate, discreet and don’t ostentatiously deviate from narrative film conventions. She doesn’t broadcast her ideas visually or with speeches but instead lets them percolate, so they trickle into the stories. “The Mastermind” is about a guy going through some things, most conspicuously a crime that soon upends what seems like an ordinary, even humdrum life. From all appearances, if things had kept going the way they had for J.B., it is a life that would probably settle into disappointment (cue the divorce, boozy ennui, the usual). It isn’t immediately clear why he robs the museum, pinching a clutch of canvases by Arthur Dove , an early American abstract painter; it’s hard not to wonder if he was just bored. Maybe he is, but J.B. also lives in the world even if he doesn’t pay much attention to it. In an early scene, he lies on the floor playing checkers with one of his sons as the other boy roams about with a paper airplane. J.B. seems just like another one of the kids, an impression that’s reinforced by the image of his own father stretched out on a couch watching the news on television. As Reichardt cuts from among the characters, you hear voices on the TV talking about a trial and antiwar campus protests. There are “tremendous feelings of powerlessness, cynicism, apathy on the part of large numbers of people,” a voice rich in emotion says as Reichardt holds on a close-up of J.B. right before he’s called to dinner. Once the museum robbery makes the news, J.B. is soon squeezed between oppositional forces and things go rapidly south for him. A couple of cops show up at his and Terri’s house, having been tipped off by one of his co-conspirators, and then a carful of mobsters stir up even more dangerous (and amusing) trouble. As J.B. anxiously navigates these complications, his home life takes a hit. Terri doesn’t say much from the start, yet while her relatively few words and averted gaze can speak volumes, her silence is initially disappointing simply because Haim (a musician and star of “Licorice Pizza” ) is a vividly real, distinctive presence. It’s only later that it becomes clear that Terri isn’t just a supporting character in the movie but also in J.B.’s life. O’Connor is one of the most exciting younger actors to have emerged in recent years, with an expressive breadth and depth that reveal new layers with each performance. (This is one of four movies he’s in which are slated to open this year.) He can be effortlessly charming and disarmingly sexy, but can just as easily go hard and cold. He seems to have no problem playing jerks but he also knows how to turn obnoxiousness into catnip (as in Luca Guadagnino’s “Challengers” ). One of the trickier things about J.B. as a character is that he isn’t obviously likable or dislikable, which makes it hard to get a handle on him. Like the overall movie, the character opens up incrementally to quiet, meaningful effect. Once J.B.’s situation precipitously heats up, he flees and the story shifts focus. Seeking a place to hide out, he looks up some old friends, Fred and Maude (a perfectly synchronized John Magaro and Gaby Hoffmann), who live deep in the country and seem like refugees from the 1960s. They feed J.B., crack open some beers and give him a change of clothes. Fred is surprised and tickled by his friend’s notoriety, and seems almost grateful for the excitement that the robbery has stirred up, including in his own life. Maude, on the hand, is openly wary. Late one night, she tells J.B. that she wants him to leave. “Look at the position that you’ve already put us in,” she says. She wishes him well, and makes him a sandwich for the road. J.B.’s interlude with Fred and Maude is melancholic and quietly moving, and it condenses a world of feeling and the movie’s ideas with crystalline economy. It’s one of the few times in “The Mastermind” that J.B. seems to really listen to someone else, even if it’s not clear that he hears Maude or any of the other voices that Reichardt delicately weaves in and out as the jazz score does, too. There’s so much to hear, though, so much to take in, if you pay attention: The voice on TV addressing protests, some guys hanging in a bar talking about military service, a report about U.S. forces fighting North Vietnamese ones in Cambodia. If J.B. scarcely seems to notice these voices it’s because he’s too busy running away, too busy playing the main character of his own story and too busy moving fast and breaking things, including his world.

He was 86. His wife, Louda Larrain, said he died of a heart attack in a hospital. Mr. Larrain spent his early career as a painter, and he came to view his ultimate medium, photography, as painting with light. Over the course of his career, he shot for magazines including Rolling Stone, Esquire, Vogue and Time, and he created shimmering, at times dreamlike, portraits of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Laurie Anderson, Norman Mailer and many others. “Idols” marked something of a departure for Mr. Larrain: He was straight, and he had no ties to the drag world. Still, the book came to be regarded as a cult classic, celebrated as an early and daring celebration of gay and transgender life when it was largely lived in the shadows. Among the “incredible birds of paradise,” as Mr. Larrain once put it, featured in “Idols” was the future actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein, then still a teenager.

473d4e541226,U.S. Special Operations Helicopters Training Near Venezuela,"us military, us foreign policy, drug abuse, us special operations command, donald trump, nicolas maduro, caribbean, venezuela, us army","The Trump administration is sharply increasing U.S. military pressure on the government of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president, with a dramatic show of aerial threats in recent days as the Pentagon mounts a major troop buildup in the region. On Wednesday, at least two B-52 bombers from Louisiana flew for several hours off the Venezuelan coast in international air space in what one senior U.S. official on Thursday called “a show of force.” The B-52s can carry dozens of precision-guided bombs. Also in recent days, an elite Army Special Operations aviation unit has been conducting flights in the southern Caribbean Sea near the coast of Venezuela. The helicopters, belonging to the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, have been flying training missions, not rehearsals for a possible military action inside Venezuela, said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. But the official acknowledged that the regiment’s presence, reported earlier by The Washington Post, was meant to provide options to President Trump as he and his administration ratchet up pressure on suspected drug traffickers in the region and on Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian leader. On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had secretly authorized the C.I.A. to conduct covert action in Venezuela. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Maj. Gen. Mohammed al-Ghomari, the Houthi military’s chief of staff, was killed along with “some of his companions” and his 13-year-old son Hussain, the militia said in a statement. It did not make clear whether the airstrike had been carried out by Israel — which has waged a bombing campaign against the Houthis that has intensified in recent months — or by the United States, which carried out a similar campaign that ended in May. However, it is common for Houthi officials to link Israeli attacks to the United States, because of U.S. military support for Israel. Israel appeared to claim the attack in a statement on Thursday. “The resolute hand of the State of Israel will reach everyone who aims to harm us,” the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said. “Another chief-of-staff in the line of terror chiefs who aimed to harm us was eliminated. We will reach all of them.” It was unclear whether the current U.S.-backed cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas would also lead to an end to the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and the Houthis. The Houthis began shooting missiles and drones at Israel and at commercial ships in the Red Sea after the war in Gaza began. The group has framed those attacks as a campaign to force Israel to end its bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, and allow more aid to enter it. Both the Houthis and Hamas, the militant group that attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, igniting the war in Gaza, are backed by Iran. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Credit... The Trustees of the British Museum Oct. 16, 2025, 1:18 p.m. ET More than a century after his death, Oscar Wilde is posthumously receiving something taken from him long ago: his library card. On June 15, 1895, the Irish poet and playwright was excluded from the British Museum’s Reading Room, the precursor to the British Library. The museum revoked his access after Wilde’s trial and conviction for gross indecency, a Victorian-era crime used to punish men for relationships with other men. Notes written on documents from 1895 excluding Oscar Wilde from the British Reading Room. Credit... The Trustees of the British Museum Wilde was already imprisoned when the library decided to bar him. “So he wouldn’t have known about it, which was probably as well,” Merlin Holland, a grandson of Wilde’s, said in a statement issued by the library. “I think it would have just added to his misery to feel that one of the world’s great libraries had banned him from books just as the law had banned him from daily life.” But Mr. Holland predicted in a phone interview on Thursday that his grandfather would have been pleased with the library’s reinstatement of his card, known as a Reader Pass, even if it was only symbolic.

7074661f9ac0,Brash Investor in Global Soccer Clubs Is Charged With Fraud,"soccer, securities fraud, fraud, foreign investment, ethics misconduct malfeasance, 777 partners, everton soccer team","The American founder of a collapsed investment firm that was once one of the biggest accumulators of European soccer clubs was charged with fraud and other counts in an indictment made public by United States prosecutors on Thursday. Josh Wander, a brash Miami businessman, drew scrutiny after buying soccer teams on three continents through 777 Partners, a firm he co-founded. According to the indictment, unsealed in Manhattan federal court, Mr. Wander fabricated financial documents and made misleading claims in an effort to “defraud lenders and investors” of as much as $500 million. In all, Mr. Wander was charged with wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy to commit each of those crimes. The charges come a year after Mr. Wander came close to adding one of the most-storied clubs in English soccer to his firm’s stable of clubs. His attempt to buy Everton Football Club caught the interest of the sports world, the investment community and the authorities. In May 2024, one of 777’s lenders accused it of running a yearslong fraud scheme . Since then, the company’s British entity was declared bankrupt by Britain’s top court and its main business in the United States was placed into limited receivership. The charges against Mr. Wander cap almost two years of spiraling allegations against him and his firm, which for years made bold assertions about its financial health — it previously claimed $10 billion in assets — even as it was trailed by a string of lawsuits , corporate failures and unpaid bills . Thursday’s 17-page indictment said many of those claims were false. “To obtain financing for the firm’s operations, for example, Wander pledged more than $350 million in assets as collateral to private lenders, knowing that 777 Partners either did not own the collateral or had pledged the collateral to other lenders,” the indictment said. It also accused Mr. Wander of using money from lenders for purposes other than what he had pledged to use them for, which included buying stakes in soccer teams and expenses related to a loss-making airline.

Trump’s ‘Compact’ for Universities Can Help Fix It , ” by Marc Rowan (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 16): We write in opposition to Mr. Rowan’s essay about President Trump’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” Mr. Rowan is the chair of the Wharton School Board of Advisers at the University of Pennsylvania and the C.E.O. of Apollo Global Management. He suggests that there is essentially unanimous agreement among administrators, faculty members, lawmakers and activists that academia has “lost its way” and that the Trump administration’s compact is badly needed. Writing on behalf of the executive committee of the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the American Association of University Professors, we beg to differ , as do more than 1,600 members (and counting) of the Penn community . Mr. Rowan’s arguments in favor of the compact are deeply flawed; it would exacerbate rather than remedy academia’s challenges. Mr. Rowan asks the government to use political power to force ideology onto universities because reform by other means is “difficult.” Here the “difficulty” skirted is no mere inconvenience, but our fundamental rights: freedom to teach and freedom to learn without being subject to the whims of bully billionaire donors or Mr. Trump himself. The compact is, sadly, just one of many examples of intensifying political interference in higher education . All institutions must follow the examples of M.I.T. , Brown and now Penn to reject the compact and any thinly veiled repackaging of it in the future.

e7c8a695c6e7,"Head of the U.S. Military’s Southern Command Is Stepping Down, Officials Say","us military, pentagon, caribbean, venezuela, pete hegseth, nicolas maduro","The military commander overseeing the Pentagon’s escalating attacks against boats in the Caribbean Sea that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs is stepping down, two U.S. officials said on Thursday. The officer, Adm. Alvin Holsey, is leaving his job as head of the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees all operations in Central and South America, even as the Pentagon has rapidly built up some 10,000 forces in the region in what it says is a major counterdrug and counterterrorism mission. It was unclear why Admiral Holsey is leaving now, less than a year into his tenure, and in the midst of the biggest operation in his 37-year career. The White House declined to comment. The Defense Department did not immediately comment. Since early September, U.S. Special Operations forces have struck at least five boats off the Venezuelan coast that the White House says were transporting drugs, killing 27 people. American officials have privately made it clear that the main goal is to drive Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, from power. But a range of specialists in the laws governing the use of force have disputed the Trump administration’s claim that it can lawfully kill people suspected of drug trafficking like enemy troops instead of arresting them for prosecution. As a matter of domestic law, Congress has not authorized any armed conflict. As a matter of international law, for a nonstate group to qualify as a belligerent in an armed conflict — meaning its members can be targeted for killing based on their status alone, not because of anything they specifically do — it must be an “organized armed group” with a centralized command structure, and engaging in hostilities. Admiral Holsey, who is Black, becomes the latest in a line of more than a dozen military leaders, many of them people of color and women, who have left their jobs this year. Most have been fired by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or pushed out. Mr. Hegseth fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who is Black; the first woman to command the Navy, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; and the U.S. military’s representative to the NATO military committee, Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield. He also pushed out Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August, the Air Force’s top uniformed officer, Gen. David Allvin , announced that he would retire early — two years into a four-year term. It was not clear on Thursday who would replace Admiral Holsey, who just this week visited the islands of Antigua and Barbuda as well as Grenada. News of the admiral’s departure comes a day after The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had secretly authorized the C.I.A. to conduct covert action in Venezuela. Mr. Trump acknowledged on Wednesday that he had authorized the covert action and said the United States was considering strikes on Venezuelan territory. All of these developments come as the U.S. military is planning its own possible escalation, drawing up options for Mr. Trump to consider, including strikes inside Venezuela. While Admiral Holsey has been the highest-ranking military overseeing the military strikes, the decision to carry them out has been driven by the White House and the strikes themselves have been conducted by Special Operations forces. The Trump administration has justified its attacks on suspected drug smugglers as national self-defense at a time of high overdose deaths in the United States. But the surge in overdoses has been driven by fentanyl, which comes from Mexico, not South America . The size and scope of the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean region is significant. There are now about 10,000 U.S. troops, most of them at bases in Puerto Rico, but also some 2,200 Marines on amphibious assault ships. In all, the Navy has eight warships and a submarine in the Caribbean.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/southern-command-head-stepping-down.html,politics,BBC,By Eric Schmitt and Tyler Pager,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16DC-MILITARY-khpl/16DC-MILITARY-khpl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T19:38:52.535000+00:00,45a14851455da49d8a6e2e8dfae188c49698e454
b5cf9e42ed88,Trump’s Unilateral Spending Cuts Complicate Shutdown Deal,"us politics, live-detached, federal budget, legislation, closings, civil service, obamacare;affordable care act;aca, democrats, republicans, omb, department of government efficiency, house of representatives, congress, senate, congress, russell t. vought, donald trump, mike johnson, hakeem jeffries, chuck schumer","Long before Republicans and Democrats reached the stalemate that has shut down the government, President Trump made it clear that he was willing to ignore Congress’s constitutional power to allocate federal spending. His Department of Government Efficiency took a hacksaw to the federal bureaucracy with little consultation and no sign-off by the Republican-controlled Congress. He pushed through legislation to officially claw back billions of dollars lawmakers had appropriated, a rare move that he and his advisers, as well as the House speaker, have promised he will resort to again. So as the shutdown enters its third week with no resolution in sight, it has become increasingly evident to lawmakers in both parties that one serious obstacle to striking a spending deal to reopen the government is the possibility — maybe even certainty — that Mr. Trump will simply turn around and ignore it, as he has repeatedly ignored Congress’s will on spending this year. With Mr. Trump and Russell T. Vought, his director of the Office of Management and Budget, promising to pursue more rescissions — deep cuts proposed by the White House in spending already blessed by Congress — Democrats are effectively being asked to sign onto a deal that they know can be unilaterally undone by a defiant president and a compliant Republican majority. “Does it make it harder to come to terms on hard things like a government shutdown?” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, asked about the prospect of rescissions. “Absolutely.” That fundamental lack of trust looms large as members of both parties settle in for what is looking like a long shutdown fight. Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked for the 10th time the House-passed G.O.P. stopgap spending bill needed to reopen the government, showing no signs of relenting on their demand that Republicans negotiate an extension of Obamacare subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. Fueling the standoff is Democrats’ anger at the White House’s repeated efforts to unilaterally cancel congressionally appropriated spending that Mr. Trump says is at odds with his political agenda, while repurposing other funds to insulate agencies he supports. After pushing through a rescissions bill over the summer to cancel some $9 billion that Congress had approved, Mr. Trump last month informed lawmakers he planned to claw back another roughly $5 billion in foreign aid at the end of the fiscal year, using a maneuver known as a pocket rescission that left no time for them to object. Mr. Trump has only accelerated his campaign to usurp Congress’ spending power during the shutdown, including announcing a series of moves to pause or cancel nearly $28 billion in funding that primarily benefited Democratic-led cities and states, and firing thousands of federal workers. At the same time, he has cushioned the blow for agencies and constituencies he supports, including signing a memorandum on Thursday that significantly expands his authority to repurpose unspent federal funds to pay members of the military during the shutdown. “We got the people that we want paid, paid,” Mr. Trump said. “We want the F.B.I. paid,” he added. “We want the military paid. We got the people that we want paid.” Speaker Mike Johnson last week offered a striking reminder about the spending feud underlying the shutdown fight when he disclosed that there would be more rescissions coming “in the days ahead,” citing them on a menu of potential actions to reduce budget deficits. “We are doing everything we can in every possible way to get us back to sound fiscal responsibility,” Mr. Johnson said. “We have to reduce spending,” he added, calling rescissions “part of our process.” That prospect galled Democrats, who note that while spending bills need 60 votes to advance in the Senate, requiring some level of buy-in from their side, rescissions can be pushed through with a simple majority vote — as happened over the summer with near-unanimous Republican support — leaving the minority powerless to stop them. “If any one person can unilaterally undo it, what’s the point of coming to the agreement? And to make it worse, the person who has that unilateral power is Vought,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, referring to the budget director. “And he can make it happen through pocket rescissions and through these impoundments. So we feel, really, that this has thrown a huge, huge impediment to getting appropriations bills done.” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, called the specter of more unilateral cuts by Mr. Trump “another indication that Republicans are not operating in good faith.” “The notion that in the midst of us trying to reopen the government and find a bipartisan path forward, the speaker of the House would threaten additional rescissions and essentially say anything we agree to is not worth the paper it is written on,” Mr. Jeffries said, “is extraordinary.” A handful of Republicans, including Ms. Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, have opposed the rescissions sent to Congress from the White House. They argue that any cuts in previously approved spending should be negotiated as part of the regular spending bills, as is done routinely. Rescission packages from the White House had been relatively rare in recent years, until Mr. Trump returned to office. “The only way we should be doing rescissions is through the regular appropriations process, not by circumventing it,” Ms. Collins said. Democrats have said that any deal to resolve the impasse should include legislation barring the White House from pursuing rescissions and requiring the administration to spend money as Congress directs. But Republicans said they doubted that they would be able to muster enough support to safeguard a compromise spending bill from being undercut by rescissions. They also say the White House is unlikely to back anything that limits its ability to spend as it sees fit as it continues to test the constitutional power of the purse. “I don’t think the president’s going to sign a bill that has language like that and that ties his hands,” said Senator John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas and an appropriator. “It’s just something we’re going to have to work through. But I don’t think there are any safeguards that you can put in a bill that would get the votes that it needs to pass, or that the president would sign.” Still, Senate Democrats who are pushing to bring Republicans to the negotiating table on the health care subsidies say that the issue would not derail a deal, if there was one to be had. “Do rescissions loom large? Yes. Does O.M.B.’s behavior make things complicated? Yes,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “But all of that could be obviated if Donald Trump himself decides that he doesn’t want 24 million Americans to see their premiums double.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/trump-unilateral-spending-cuts-shutdown.html,politics,BBC,By Catie Edmondson and Carl Hulse,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16DC-SPEND2-mbwh/16DC-SPEND2-mbwh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T19:18:17+00:00,bf5ea14c0274746c439eb4e39875cbf958687193

Putin of Russia in Budapest in the coming weeks to discuss ways to bring an end to Russia’s three-year invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Trump made the announcement after a more than two-hour call with Mr. Putin that he characterized as “very productive.” Mr. Trump said the two agreed that their senior advisers, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would meet next week at an unspecified location. The two presidents would then meet sometime after that “to see if we can bring this ‘inglorious’ War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end.” “I believe great progress was made with today’s telephone conversation,” Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post. Yuri Ushakov, an aide to Mr. Putin, told Russian news agencies that envoys from the two countries would meet “without delay” to lay the groundwork for the summit. Mr. Trump’s talk with Mr. Putin came a day before he was scheduled to meet at the White House with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who is expected to make the case that the United States should give Ukraine additional weapons. Emboldened after negotiating a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Mr. Trump seems to now be turning his focus back to Russia’s grinding war in Ukraine. In recent days, Mr. Trump has suggested that he may provide U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which would give Ukraine the ability to strike deep inside Russia.

8325442425fc,McConnell Stumbles and Falls at the Capitol,"united states capitol, republicans, senate, congress, mitch mcconnell, kentucky, us politics","Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, fell in the basement of the Capitol on Thursday while making his way to the Senate floor for a vote, the latest indication that the former Republican leader who is planning to retire in 2027 has grown frail. In a video posted on social media, Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, can be seen walking while grasping the arm of a man apparently in his security detail when a woman appears beside him asking questions about immigration raids. After briefly letting go of his companion, Mr. McConnell stumbles and collapses to the ground. The man accompanying him, with the assistance of a police officer, lifts Mr. McConnell back onto his feet and the senator turns to wave to the camera with a smile. It was not clear whether he suffered any injuries, but Mr. McConnell appeared to walk for several steps unassisted before grabbing hold of the man again as the video ended. The longest-serving Senate leader, Mr. McConnell plans to retire in January 2027, at the end of his seventh term. Senator John Thune of South Dakota replaced him as majority leader in January. A survivor of childhood polio, Mr. McConnell’s stride has long been noticeably uneven, but in recent years he has increasingly shown his age. He has fallen a number of times — suffering a concussion once and a sprained wrist another time — and temporarily relied on a wheelchair to get around the Capitol. Those stumbles, along with several freezing episodes , have raised questions about his health and ability to serve out the remainder of his final term. These days, Mr. McConnell is routinely seen around the Capitol holding onto the arm of a member of his security team, as he apparently was on Thursday. He has said he suffers from substantial hearing loss, and he rarely engages with reporters or fellow senators as he makes his way from his office to the Senate floor for votes. During his 18 years as the G.O.P. leader, Mr. McConnell played a central role in blocking Democratic legislative priorities and stacking the federal courts with President Trump’s nominees. He has recently become more willing to challenge Mr. Trump, telling colleagues he feels “liberated” now that he is no longer a party leader to take on a president he privately professed to despise but publicly backed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-fall-capitol.html,politics,BBC,By Megan Mineiro,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16trump-news-mcconnell-fall-topart-jcfh/16trump-news-mcconnell-fall-topart-jcfh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T17:55:56+00:00,56073ba8c88a2664859c2de92fd023548888ee93

On Wednesday, at least two B-52 bombers from Louisiana flew for several hours off the Venezuelan coast in international air space in what one senior U.S. official on Thursday called “a show of force.” The B-52s can carry dozens of precision-guided bombs. Also in recent days, an elite Army Special Operations aviation unit has been conducting flights in the southern Caribbean Sea near the coast of Venezuela. The helicopters, belonging to the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, have been flying training missions, not rehearsals for a possible military action inside Venezuela, said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. But the official acknowledged that the regiment’s presence, reported earlier by The Washington Post, was meant to provide options to President Trump as he and his administration ratchet up pressure on suspected drug traffickers in the region and on Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian leader. On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had secretly authorized the C.I.A. to conduct covert action in Venezuela. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

History in Latin America","coups d'etat, us foreign policy, assassination, cia, fidel castro, salvador allende, jacobo arbenz guzman, augusto pinochet ugarte, chile, cuba, latin america, us, venezuela, nicaragua","The United States has a long and, often sordid, history of intervening in Latin America. Washington once went to war with Mexico, landed troops on Cuba and invaded Panama to depose its ruler. But for much of the 20th century, U.S. involvement in the region was in the hands of the C.I.A. Now, long after the Cold War’s end, the Trump administration has secretly authorized the agency to conduct covert action in Venezuela, according to U.S. officials , stepping up a campaign against the country’s authoritarian leader, President Nicolás Maduro. The order has once again raised the specter of operations by an agency that had its hands in coups , assassination plots and the contra fight against Nicaragua’s leftist government in the 1980s. Here are some of those high-profile operations. A coup in Guatemala When Guatemala’s democratically elected president, Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán, was overthrown in a coup in 1954, the Eisenhower administration described it as an uprising against a Communist government allied with the Soviet Union. But the coup had been supported by the C.I.A., which drew up assassination lists and discussed recruiting exiles to take part, according to files released decades later. President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a request to give the insurgents bombers, and C.I.A. pilots helped build an opposition force. Mr. Árbenz had also made powerful enemies in a major U.S. corporation, the United Fruit Company . His government had tried to confiscate unused land owned by the company to redistribute it under a land reform plan, and to pay compensation for the understated value the company had claimed on tax payments. After the coup, Guatemala fell into three decades of civil war under a series of military leaders. An investigation by the Roman Catholic Church found that 150,000 people were killed and 50,000 were forcibly disappeared in the conflict, estimating that 80 percent of the casualties were caused by Guatemalan troops. The Bay of Pigs invasion After Fidel Castro swept to power in Cuba in 1959, his government’s relations with Washington swiftly unraveled. The C.I.A. soon began making invasion plans, helping arm and train an anti-Castro force at a secret base in Guatemala. The agency carried out the disastrous attack in April 1961. The plan called for Cuban exiles, backed by the C.I.A., to overthrow Mr. Castro’s Communist government as C.I.A. pilots bombed part of the Cuban air force. About 1,500 Cuban exiles were dropped on the island, outnumbered, underequipped and quickly defeated by the Cuban military, which captured nearly 1,200 of them. A scathing, 150-page review into the operation found that almost none of the C.I.A. officers involved spoke Spanish and that it had created a “complex and bizarre organizational situation” with little chance of success. “The agency was going forward without knowing precisely what it was doing,” the report said. Assassination attempts The C.I.A. made at least eight plots to kill Mr. Castro, according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report that was partly released in 1975 and fully disclosed long afterward. Some plots went much farther than others. One scheme, “involving the use of underworld figures,” went so far as to sending poison pills to Cuba and dispatching teams there, the report said. Another plan involved giving weapons and other assassination devices to a Cuban dissident, including a poison pen. The agency also explored plots to use cigars treated with a botulinum toxin, an “exotic seashell” rigged to explode in an area where the Cuban leader went diving, and a diving suit contaminated by the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. A C.I.A. agent also helped a team of Bolivian soldiers capture Che Guevara in 1967, in a mission that ended with Guevara’s execution. And in 1975, the C.I.A. supplied weapons to the dissidents who assassinated Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina, the authoritarian leader of the Dominican Republic. A ‘coup climate’ in Chile As soon as Salvador Allende took office as the socialist president of Chile in 1970, the Nixon administration began planning action against him, worried he could become a model for other countries. The C.I.A. sought to “create a coup climate” by maximizing pressure on the Chilean government, according to declassified U.S. documents . The covert operations included a C.I.A.-funded anti-government propaganda media campaign, blocking loans to Chile from multilateral financial institutions, offering secret funds to foment strikes, and assuring the Chilean military it had full U.S. support. Handwritten notes by the C.I.A. director at the time showed some of the president’s instructions: “One in 10 chance, perhaps, but save Chile”; “not concerned risks involved”; “full-time job — best men we have”; “make the economy scream.” A Senate committee investigating covert actions in Chile found that there was little evidence linking the U.S. government to direct involvement in the military coup that came to pass, according to the State Department. In that coup, in September 1973, surrounded in the besieged presidential palace, Mr. Allende eventually ordered everyone still with him to surrender. He stayed behind and shot himself. The military junta was led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who for the next 16 years consolidated power in a repressive regime accused of widespread torture, executions and disappearances.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/americas/cia-latin-america-coups.html,World,BBC,By Alan Yuhas,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16int-latam-cia-cqjw/16int-latam-cia-cqjw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T19:14:06.170000+00:00,a4abdb568b5e0c008df4e8d8529347b257abe8fa

But no one gets to the top of the world’s highest mountain without a team of unheralded helpers. The last member of the Hillary-Norgay team, Kanchha Sherpa, died on Thursday, the Nepal Mountaineering Association said in a statement . He died at 92 at his home in Kapan, Nepal, the group’s president, Phur Gelje Sherpa, told The Associated Press. Mr. Kanchha, whose name has also been spelled Kancha, was born in 1933 in Namche, Nepal. He had said that he did not know his exact birth date. As a young man, he struggled to find work to support his family, at one point walking for five days in 1952 to Darjeeling, India, in search of a job. Though he had no special interest in mountaineering, Mr. Kanchha later joined a team of 35 climbers and hundreds of porters supporting Mr. Hillary, a New Zealand explorer, and Mr. Norgay, his Sherpa guide, up Mount Everest. It had been known for a century that Everest was the highest point in the world, but the idea of climbing to the top seemed fanciful for most of that time. Wind, cold and thin air compounded the climbing challenges. A few had tried, notably George Mallory, who famously gave as his reason for his attempt, in 1924: “ Because it is there .” His remains weren’t found until 1999. Nonetheless, Mr. Hillary and Mr. Norgay were up for the challenge, aided by their vast team of helpers. Mr. Kanchha carried 60 pounds of gear, fixed ropes and scouted the trail for the team. Despite injury, cold, illness and hardship, “I got good work,” he told Climate Wire in 2011 . “I got good clothing. It was good for me.” Climbing without supplemental oxygen, he was one of a handful of team members to reach the final base camp, where they halted. Like many porters working on climbs, his role was not to reach the top. Mr. Hillary and Mr. Norgay went the rest of the way, to a summit 29,000 feet — five and a half miles — above sea level. When the team got the news by radio that the two had defied the odds and become the first to reach the top, “We danced, hugged and kissed,” Mr. Kanchha told Everest Chronicle, Nepal’s state news agency . “It was a moment of pure joy.” He continued to work on the mountain until 1970, when a fatal avalanche led his wife, Ang Lhakpa Sherpa, to urge him to stop. He began working for a trekking company, guiding visitors to safer, less elevated sites in the region. Mr. Norgay died in 1986; Mr. Hillary in 2008. Mr. Kanchha is survived by his wife, four sons, two daughters, eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter, Everest Chronicle reported . More recently, he expressed concern about the large numbers of people climbing Everest and the environmental damage they caused. Still, as a mountain guide, he told Climate Wire: “If we stop the tourists to save the mountains, we don’t have anything to do. Just grow potatoes and eat and sit.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/asia/kanchha-sherpa-mt-everest-dead.html,World,BBC,By Victor Mather,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/16Kanchha-Sherpa-wvzg-print1-sub/16Kanchha-Sherpa-wvzg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T19:30:17.433000+00:00,15d7c74b9022b87a930069cf96fab298a723edac

Systems Broadcast Anti-Trump and Pro-Hamas Messages,"hacker (computer security), airport security, airport, israel gaza war, computer security, delays, transport canada, british columbia, ontario, harrisburg pa","The public address systems at four airports in North America were hacked on Tuesday and used to broadcast messages praising Hamas and criticizing President Trump, officials said. The hacks, which also targeted flight information display screens, disrupted services and caused concern among travelers in the United States and Canada. The hacks occurred at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania, Windsor International Airport in Ontario, and Kelowna International Airport and Victoria International Airport in British Columbia, officials said. At the Harrisburg airport, video shared online by travelers seemed to capture the moments during the hack. A woman’s voice can be heard over the loudspeaker saying, “Free Palestine” and using an expletive to criticize Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. The voice also seems to say, “Turkish hacker Cyber Islam was here.” “This is absolutely unacceptable and understandably scared travelers,” Sean Duffy, the U.S. transportation secretary, wrote on social media . Mr. Duffy said he was working with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Harrisburg airport to investigate. Transport Canada, which owns and operates airports in the country, said in a statement that it was investigating the attacks on its airports and was working with law enforcement to ensure there “were no impacts on the safety and security of airport operations.” Overall, the airports said that the disruption was minimal. Scott Miller, a spokesman for Harrisburg International Airport, told WGAL-TV that one plane that was boarding during the hack was searched but that no security issues were found. The cyberattacks in Canada seemed to go further, targeting flight information display screens with pro-Hamas messaging. “Israel lost the war, Hamas won the war honorably,” read a message displayed on a screen at Kelowna International Airport, video of which was shared online and confirmed by an airport representative. In a statement, the airport said an outside party had commandeered its flight information display screen and public address system to display the “unauthorized messaging.” The airport said that it removed the messages in a matter of minutes and that the incident was limited to “a cloud-based, third-party software provider.” Mark Phillips, a security consultant at Dionac, which offers aviation cybersecurity services, said that airports were increasingly relying on cloud-based systems from third-party suppliers to manage things like check-in systems, public announcement systems and flight-time displays. “So if the hackers compromise an employee at that company with access to the management system,” he said, “they can also then perform the management tasks.” In this case, he said, the hacker or hackers most likely gained access to the third-party provider, uploaded the audio and video files, and played them on the airport systems. But Mr. Phillips said travelers should not be overly worried. “The safety critical systems, things like air traffic control, they will absolutely not be third-party solutions or managed or have remote access to those systems,” he said. Those systems are usually segregated, or completely isolated, from other networks in the airport. Kelowna International Airport, whose airport systems are segregated, said it conducted a threat assessment with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Transport Canada, and determined the messaging was not “a direct threat towards the traveling public.” Windsor International Airport said in a statement that there was little disruption because there were no flights scheduled at the time of the hack. The hacks were the latest in a series of cyberattacks that have targeted major airports in recent months. Last month, a cyberattack disrupted travel at several European travel hubs , including Heathrow Airport in London. This summer, a number of carriers including Hawaiian Airlines and WestJet said they were the target of cyberattacks . And last December, Japan Airlines briefly halted flights and stopped selling tickets after hackers disrupted its operations .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/airports-hacked-us-canada-trump-hamas.html,Business,BBC,By Jonathan Wolfe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16xp-airport-recordings/16xp-airport-recordings-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T18:03:29.187000+00:00,c6777e1446c65460b5ff537730672e22e9ca002b

Keaton died Saturday at the age of 79 at Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. according to the death certificate. No underlying causes of death were listed on the certificate, which said that no autopsy had been performed. Over the course of her career Keaton performed in more than 100 roles in television shows, in films and on Broadway. She was admired for both her dramatic power and her comedic timing. She won the Academy Award for best actress for her performance in “Annie Hall” in 1978, and was nominated three other times in that category, for roles in “Reds” in 1982, “Marvin’s Room” in 1997 and “Something’s Gotta Give” in 2004. Her final acting role was in “Summer Camp,” a comedy released in 2024 about three old friends reuniting at their childhood sleep-away camp. Tributes to Keaton and her work have streamed in since her death. Woody Allen, who directed her in “Annie Hall” and several other films, wrote that he “made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton.” Francis Ford Coppola, who directed her in all three of the “Godfather” films, called her “creativity personified.” And the writer and director Nancy Meyers, who directed her in “Something’s Gotta Give” and other films, mourned her as a “brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/movies/diane-keaton-cause-of-death.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Matt Stevens and Derrick Bryson Taylor,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/00cul-keaton-causeofdeath-plbf/00cul-keaton-causeofdeath-plbf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T17:59:56+00:00,7f6f62edeea18e2ff953f392ccd0eb7306e6ae75
5bf800e5d59f,The Liam Payne Fans Tending His Memorials,"pop rock music, fans;fandom, cemetery, one direction music group, liam payne, buenos aires","Liam Payne’s fans were running in circles in Buenos Aires last October, hoping to catch a glimpse of the former One Direction star but unsure exactly where he was staying. That changed when news broke that Payne had died after falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in a trendy part of the Argentine capital. Within minutes, they flocked to the scene. What had been a hunt for their idol quickly turned into a different mission: to create a place where fans could honor his life. The sudden grief took shape in candles and flowers outside the CasaSur Palermo Hotel, soon becoming a coordinated effort to maintain an altar. For an entire year, pictures of Payne have endured, along with handwritten letters from his fans and balloon numbers counting the months since his death. “We’re like Liam’s fairies,” said Valeria Riosa, a 46-year-old hairdresser who leads a community of hundreds of fans, mostly women and mainly from Latin America. It started as a WhatsApp group and turned into a TikTok account and Instagram page . Riosa and others visit the memorial, which is wrapped around a tall tree near the hotel, several times a week to take care of it. They sometimes travel for hours on public transportation. “Some people come for the events of monthly anniversaries, but we’re always here,” she said as other fans behind her carefully dusted laminated photos, arranged flowers and cleaned amulets. Luana Soledad Bustamante, 26, leads another fan group that set up a memorial in the Buenos Aires cemetery where Payne’s body was prepared before being repatriated to England . The shrine is at the back of a large graveyard about two miles from the hotel. There is a green bench surrounded by flowers and pinwheels, with a golden plaque featuring a One Direction quote. A mailbox nearby is filled with dozens of letters from fans. Bustamante and a friend gathered donations from around the world to raise the $400 needed for the memorial. When it was inaugurated this year, fans from Turkey and Japan joined the livestream to hear a priest’s words and a speech by the organizers. “We all cried,” she recalled. “It was very intimate.” In 2010, Payne entered the reality show “The X Factor” and left as part of the five-member boy band One Direction . The group sold tens of millions of records before splitting in 2016, after which Payne and his bandmates pursued solo careers. “Strip That Down,” his first single, rose the charts. “You know, I used to be in 1D, now I’m out, free,” Payne sang. “I just wanna have fun and get rowdy on Coke and Bacardi.” Payne, whose son is 8 years old , was open about his struggles with addiction. Although he spent some months in rehab in the United States in 2023, he relapsed last year on a trip to Argentina that was in part to see his former bandmate Niall Horan perform. On the afternoon of Oct. 16, 2024, Payne was seen inebriated in the hotel lobby. Employees took him upstairs and shortly afterward, he fell out of a window into an interior patio. A toxicology report revealed high levels of alcohol and cocaine, along with prescription antidepressants. Five people were initially indicted in the case, but three were cleared of charges of negligence in May. A hotel employee and a local waiter are still accused of repeatedly supplying narcotics to Payne, 31, during his four-day stay at the hotel. If convicted, they face sentences of four to 15 years in prison. A lawyer for the waiter, Braian Paiz, said his client was a victim of a “witch hunt,” describing him as a scapegoat because he was from a low-income background. “The most powerful remain free,” said the lawyer, Fernando Madeo Facente. Andrés Madrea, a prosecutor who led the case in its early stages, credits fans with helping to reconstruct the events leading to Payne’s death. In addition to traditional investigation methods, the authorities leaned on the insights that fans had gathered by monitoring Payne’s whereabouts in the city. “Two universes merged,” he said. Bustamante, one of the fans who reached out to Madrea, also organized events to honor Payne during those early days of shock. She helped put together an album of letters for the Payne family and hand-delivered it to the singer’s father when he visited to complete paperwork and give a statement to investigators. Fans who lived far from Buenos Aires submitted their messages for the family via WhatsApp, and Bustamante and her friend would write them by hand meticulously. “For many of the fans, coming to the memorials is still very painful,” Bustamante said. “But it gave me this friendship and shared moments.” Aside from keeping the cemetery memorial clean and tidy, Bustamante now manages the letters placed in the mailbox. She hopes to send them to the Payne family soon with the help of the local British Embassy. Bustamante also coordinates a network of fans across the world. Many of them have collected donations for children with cancer and gathered Christmas gifts for low-income communities, following the generosity they said they had learned from Payne. At the hotel memorial, Patricia Bogataj, 62, said her spirits were raised by Payne’s music and his Instagram livestreams during the coronavirus pandemic, a time when she was working hard and struggling as a health-care worker. “I found a group of support, they understand how I feel,” Bogataj said about the memorial brigade. Being an older One Direction fan has not been an issue. She proudly recalled attending a Harry Styles concert with her friend’s grandchildren, all in their 20s. A few yards away, the youngest member of the team, Rufina Gómez, 10, helped her mother hold a large plastic cover to protect the memorial from the approaching rains of spring. Romina Gómez, 49, said she found comfort in just being near the place where Payne was last seen alive. “I’ll come here forever, as long as I can,” she said. “It might sound crazy, but I know he’s here.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/arts/music/liam-payne-memorial-one-direction.html,Culture,BBC,By Lucía Cholakian Herrera,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/16cul-payne-memorial-25712-cover/16cul-payne-memorial-25712-cover-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-16T09:01:47+00:00,456837dd1125eba1a59e5fb1f84e42df57fe6a70
82e729f6cd1e,Terrorism Charges Against Antifa ‘Cell’ Show Administration’s Focus on the Left,"us politics, terrorism, antifa, justice department, fbi, pamela j bondi, george soros, donald trump, j.d. vance, texas, dallas, fort worth tx","Federal prosecutors on Thursday unsealed terrorism charges against two men accused of attacking an immigration detention center outside Dallas this summer as part of what was described as a heavily-armed “cell” of the far-left movement known as antifa. The indictment brought against the men — Cameron Arnold and Zachary Evetts — appeared to be the first time that terrorism charges had been filed against anyone said to be associated with antifa, which the Trump administration has repeatedly vowed to crack down on in recent weeks. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the charges, which were filed in Federal District Court in Fort Worth, in a brief social media post. “As @POTUS has made clear,” Ms. Bondi wrote , “Antifa is a left-wing terrorist organization. They will be prosecuted as such.” A separate shooting at an immigration facility in Dallas last month left two detainees dead. The gunman, Joshua Jahn, shot and killed himself. Last month, President Trump signed an executive order targeting antifa, which takes its name from its antifascist political alignment. The order threatened to undertake “investigatory and prosecutorial action” against those who financially support the leftist movement, and also said that Mr. Trump was declaring antifa a “domestic terrorist organization,” a designation that does not actually exist under U.S. law . The 12-page indictment accused Mr. Arnold and Mr. Evetts of providing material support to terrorists, and of attempted murder and firearms offenses after taking part in the armed assault on July 4 against the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. The indictment said that the two men were part of a group of at least 11 masked suspects clad in black who shot fireworks and ultimately rifles at the facility, striking a police officer working there in the neck before they fled into the darkness. Even though antifa has not been designated as a terrorist organization, the material support statute has been used against other extremist groups — especially on the right — that were also not formally singled out as terrorists. While Mr. Trump and some of his top aides have spoken at times of antifa as though it were a clear-cut extremist organization, like the far-right Proud Boys, with a knowable membership and hierarchy, the movement is in fact a decentralized collection of loosely affiliated groups with similar but not always identical objectives. The indictment defined antifa somewhat more precisely, calling it a “militant enterprise made up of networks of individuals and small groups, primarily ascribing to a revolutionary anarchist or autonomous Marxist ideology.” The enterprise, the indictment added, explicitly calls for “the overthrow of the United States government, law enforcement authorities and the system of law.” The use of the term “enterprise” suggested that the F.B.I. might have opened a powerful and sweeping form of inquiry into antifa known as an enterprise investigation, said Thomas E. Brzozowski, the former counsel for domestic terrorism in the Justice Department’s national security division. Enterprise investigations allow the federal authorities to deeply scrutinize the structure, finances, membership and goals of targeted groups or organizations. Mr. Brzozowski expressed concern that the Trump administration was using a somewhat vague definition of antifa that offered no clear evidence of connections between targeted people or groups other than their leftist ideology. Given the potent nature of an enterprise investigation, he said, the inquiry could end up focusing not only on those accused of committing actual violence, but on others adjacent to them who believe in similar ideas but have not acted violently. “That’s what happens when you open such a broad investigation into what is essentially an idea,” he said. “This appears to be investigation by proclamation instead of investigation by sound intelligence.” The Justice Department at Mr. Trump’s urging has already asked federal prosecutors to investigate the financier George Soros, citing a report by a conservative watchdog group that accused the liberal megadonor of financing groups “tied to terrorism or extremist violence.” More recently, Vice President JD Vance said “left-wing political violence” was such “a big problem” that the Trump administration intended “to train the investigatory and law enforcement powers of the government to focus” on it. According to the indictment unsealed on Thursday, the leader of the so-called antifa cell in Texas trained subordinates in “firearms and close-quarters combat.” The cell was armed with more than 50 weapons purchased in the Fort Worth area, it added, and used an encrypted messaging app to communicate. Before the attack on the detention center, some members of the cell gathered at a nearby house to prepare. They exchanged a map of the facility, the indictment said, and planned to bring rifles, medical equipment and fireworks. “Cops are not trained or equipped for more than one rifle,” the indictment quoted the cell’s leader as saying, “so it tends to make them back off.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/justice-department-terrorism-antifa.html,politics,BBC,By Alan Feuer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/us/politics/16DC-ANTIFA/16DC-ANTIFA-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T20:15:34+00:00,fed6471fae8d5d77f98709f74a43dd2d6100dc18

Now, Ms. Machado is the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, U.S. warships are floating near the Venezuelan coast and the United States is calling President Nicolás Maduro a “narco-terrorist” and a fugitive from American justice. The Nobel award has galvanized Ms. Machado’s movement. But it has also highlighted the challenges Ms. Machado faces in meeting the expectations of Venezuelans hungry for political change, while also focusing scrutiny on her hard-line tactics. The Norwegian Nobel Committee noted Ms. Machado's work to achieve a “peaceful transition’’ to democracy. Yet her efforts to topple Mr. Maduro have included calls for a military insurrection and unconditional support for President Trump’s military strikes against boats in the Caribbean that he says are smuggling drugs. “You can’t negotiate with a criminal narco-terrorist apparatus from a position of weakness,” Ms. Machado told Fox Noticias this month, referring to Mr. Trump’s military pressure. “The path to peace lies through liberty, and to have liberty you must have strength.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

cbd2d4ef055a,Trump Warns Hamas of Strikes if Violence in Gaza Continues,"israel gaza war, live-detached, us politics, hamas, donald trump, gaza strip, israel","President Trump said on Thursday that if Hamas continued to kill people in Gaza, “we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” a stark warning after Hamas fighters were captured on video in recent days executing members of rival groups in the Palestinian territory. “If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post. The president later clarified that the U.S. military would not be the one to target Hamas in that scenario. “Somebody will go in,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “It’s not going to be us.” Mr. Trump added that the bodies of hostages held by Hamas had been returned to Israel on Thursday. “They also said they’re going to behave,” he said. “We’re going to find out if they behave; if they behave good. If they don’t behave, we’ll take care of it.” Mr. Trump’s suggestion of potential strikes against the terrorist group came after he made a series of conflicting statements in recent days about how his administration would implement the next steps of a cease-fire deal he negotiated with the goal of ending the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Mr. Trump’s plan to end the war requires Hamas to lay down its weapons and allow an international force to stabilize the territory. Analysts, however, say that Hamas has been fighting rival groups to assert its dominance in Gaza. The outbreak of internal violence in the territory has fueled questions over how Mr. Trump can guarantee the disarming of Hamas. On Monday , Mr. Trump suggested that his administration was not opposed to Hamas reasserting itself as a police force in Gaza and shooting rivals. “They’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” Mr. Trump said. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again seemed to not be concerned about the violence. He said at the White House that Hamas had “taken out a couple of gangs that were very bad,” and added, “That didn’t bother me very much, to be honest.” On the same day, he issued a warning to Hamas to give up their weapons. “If they don’t disarm, we will disarm them,” Mr. Trump said. “And it will happen quickly and perhaps violently.” The next day, Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not see any reason for the U.S. military to get involved in Gaza.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/trump-hamas-warnings-gaza-strikes.html,politics,BBC,By Zolan Kanno-Youngs,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16trump-news-hamas1-jhml/16trump-news-hamas1-jhml-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T21:22:24.841000+00:00,64505c7f1fd5e352d7362e469a6b74b0b9d54133
fffe0afce44f,John Bolton Indicted Over Handling of Classified Information,"us politics, classified information, john bolton, donald trump","John R. Bolton, the national security hawk and former adviser to President Trump who became one of his most outspoken critics, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on Thursday on charges of mishandling classified information. An 18-count indictment accused Mr. Bolton of using an email account to send “diary” notes about his day-to-day activities as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser in 2018 and 2019. Many of those notes included “national defense information,” including details classified as top secret, the indictment charged. Those emails were later hacked by someone associated with the government of Iran, the indictment said. While Mr. Bolton is part of a string of perceived enemies of the president to become prosecutorial targets, the federal investigation into him gained momentum during the Biden administration, when U.S. intelligence agencies gathered what former officials have described as troubling evidence. The New York Times has previously reported that the United States gathered data from an adversary’s spy service, including emails with sensitive information that Mr. Bolton, while working in the first Trump administration, appeared to have sent to people close to him on an unclassified system, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive case. In August, F.B.I. agents searched Mr. Bolton’s Maryland home and his office in Washington , carrying out boxes of papers, computer files and other materials as part of the investigation. Subsequent court filings indicated that some documents with low-level classification markings were found. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

be9fe5fc02aa,How to Live a Long and Healthy Life as an Introvert,"longevity, donald trump, vladimir putin, bashar al-assad, us foreign policy, russian invasion of ukraine (2022)","Aging well as an introvert Considering all the research around socializing and longevity, some introverts can be forgiven for feeling worried. People who have strong relationships generally live longer, and the unicorns known as “ super-agers ” — older adults who have the memory abilities of someone 20 years younger — tend to be especially outgoing. On the flip side, chronic loneliness raises the risk for cognitive decline and even early death. But experts say it doesn’t take much socializing to reap those longevity benefits . It’s less about the sheer number of connections you have, and more about what those connections do for you. Our relationships contribute to health and longevity in critical ways: They provide emotional support, cognitive stimulation, care during times of crisis and motivation to have healthier habits. If your current relationships check those four boxes, you’re probably in pretty good shape. But if you’re missing one or two, it may be time to re-evaluate your social network. 1. Emotional support Emotional support typically comes from a few close friends or family members. You should feel comfortable confiding in these people and talking through important issues with them. When people feel lonely, it is often this emotional support that they’re missing, according to Dr. Ashwin Kotwal, an associate professor of medicine specializing in geriatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. And that feeling can be bad for one’s health. Experts think that one of the primary reasons loneliness is harmful is because it is inherently a stressful experience. Stress causes inflammation, and if someone is lonely for long stretches of time, it can lead to chronic inflammation . Long term, that increases the risk for heart disease, cancer, dementia and other diseases. 2. Logistical support The same people who offer emotional support may also be the ones who make your day-to-day life a little easier. Maybe they give you a ride to the airport or drop off a meal when you’re sick. That network becomes even more important when bigger issues arise, like the loss of a job or a serious health diagnosis. According to Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University, four to six close relationships is a good number to aim for. That way, you’re not too reliant on any one person. 3. Healthy habits Our relationships can also motivate us to take better care of our physical health. Research shows that people with supportive social networks are more likely to exercise and eat a healthier diet, as well as go to doctor appointments and take prescribed medications. For some, a spouse or grown child might play this role; others may have walking buddies who keep them accountable. The drive to be healthier can also come from within, Kotwal said: “You’re demonstrating the value of those relationships by taking care of yourself.” 4. Mental stimulation The benefits mentioned above often depend on friends and family. But when it comes to mental stimulation, the experts recommended looking outside your home or tightknit circles. That’s in part because conversations with strangers or loose acquaintances can require more of you cognitively, since you have to be more precise with your language than when talking to those who know you well. The conversations you have at the grocery store or during your commute can all provide this type of stimulation and be beneficial for health. Of course, a person’s subjective experience of their social life is important. If someone doesn’t feel lonely, even if they’re alone, they won’t have such a harmful stress response, Kotwal said. But don’t use this as a reason to stay home. Instead, Holt-Lunstad advised, “focus on socializing in the context that you feel comfortable, rather than just not socializing at all.” Trump plans to meet with Putin again President Trump said yesterday that he planned to meet with President Vladimir Putin in Budapest in the coming weeks to discuss ways to bring an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump announced the plans after a phone conversation with Putin that lasted more than two hours. He added that senior officials from Russia and the U.S., including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would meet next week. The Kremlin confirmed that the leaders had talked about a new meeting, about two months since they met in Alaska. Trump is scheduled to hold talks today at the White House with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who is likely to ask for more U.S. weapons, in particular Tomahawk cruise missiles . They would be the longest-range U.S. weapons provided to Ukraine thus far. The Kremlin said that Putin had warned Trump against sending the missiles to Ukraine.

Assad’s enforcers For two decades, and throughout a 13-year civil war that left half a million people dead, the Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad relied on a network of henchmen to support his rule, writes Christiaan Triebert , a reporter on our Visual Investigations team. These men tortured civilians. They built and used chemical weapons. They ran drugs that helped fund the government. They ordered the bombing of hospitals. And when the regime fell in December 2024, many of them simply vanished. My colleagues and I set out to uncover evidence of their alleged crimes and find out where they might be now — in Russia, for instance, or plotting revenge from Lebanon. We chased down fragments of information — a photo of a lavish Damascus home posted to a neighborhood Facebook page, the name of a small village mentioned in a sanctions document, a phone number with a Russian country code discreetly shared with reporters — and added the journalistic legwork of reading legal filings, knocking on doors, calling people’s friends, family and co-workers.

PHRASE OF THE DAY Mall World Thousands of people on TikTok and Reddit have said they dream of the same space , an abandoned labyrinthine mall complex that might include a hospital, a school, an airport and an amusement park. MORNING READ Space fans of all stripes descended on a university campus in California last week to spend three days immersing themselves in all things Mars. There were sessions on a Martian constitution and how to brew coffee on Mars. The convention was hosted by the Mars Society, whose mission is to get people to care about reaching the red planet. “I’d definitely answer the call of a one-way ticket to Mars,” one attendee said. “For so many of us dreamers, it’s been in our imaginations for so long, that actually doing it isn’t such reach in our minds.” Read more . What they’re stealing in … London If you live in the British capital, you’ve at least heard the stories: A person is texting or chatting away on the phone at a crosswalk when someone — usually masked and on an e-bike — speeds past, grabs the phone and disappears into the distance. Some try to chase the perpetrator. Others are too stunned to act. Either way, in many cases, their phone is gone. A record 80,000 phones were stolen in London last year, making the city a European hub for the crime. For years, police officers in the city assumed that most of the thefts were the work of small-time thieves. It is now clear that some were part of a multilayered global criminal network. Read more .

This past week, I’ve spent most evenings at the cinema. I do this only once a year, for the London Film Festival. I’ve seen several gems already, but I especially wanted to bring one film to your attention: “ It Was Just an Accident ,” by the Iranian director Jafar Panahi. The premise is heavy. A group of torture victims kidnap a man they think is their former torturer. What does justice look like? Revenge? Closure? It’s a moral thriller. It messes with your empathy. But what makes the film truly great are these wild moments of generosity and laugh-out-loud levity. (The police officer who has a card reader ready for bribes!) Also, Diane Keaton.

fcd01ebd5fd6,Kenyan Police Fire on Mourners at Raila Odinga Memorial,"raila odinga, kenya, nairobi, civil unrest, politics, funerals, police, death, tear gas","At least two people were killed on Thursday after Kenyan security forces lobbed tear gas and opened fire on a large crowd of mourners gathered to view the body of Raila Odinga, the country’s former prime minister who died this week, local police said. Footage captured at the stadium in Nairobi where the memorial was being held showed people running from plumes of gas, as shrieks reverberated in the arena. Thousands had gathered there to mourn Mr. Odinga, a champion of multiparty democracy who acted as an opposition figurehead for decades. At least two deaths were confirmed by Adamson Bungei, Kenya’s head of police operations, according to The Associated Press. The local news media reported that four people had been killed. There was no immediate public statement from the Kenyan police. The police tried to disperse the crowd after an apparent breach in the area where the coffin was being held, local reports showed. Many mourners had surrounded a procession carrying Mr. Odinga’s body into the stadium , according to footage from local news outlets. The clash at the viewing of Mr. Odinga’s body was the latest example of the Kenyan police’s using force to quell public demonstrations. In June, protests against the government of President William Ruto left at least 16 dead and hundreds wounded. Brutal policing tactics — including the killing of one prominent blogger in police custody — partly fueled those protests. Mr. Odinga ran unsuccessfully for Kenya’s presidency five times. Mr. Ruto described him as a “colossus of Kenya’s modern politics, an indomitable warrior in our struggle for freedom and prosperity.” Mr. Ruto also posted on social media about his attendance at the ceremony , but did not comment on the chaos that erupted at the event. Mr. Odinga’s death leaves a void in Kenyan politics, given his role as the principal challenger to successive governments, and has also spilled grief into the streets of the country. Thousands gathered in his political stronghold city in western Kenya, Kisumu, to mourn. The state funeral for Mr. Odinga is scheduled for Friday. A public viewing will follow the service.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/africa/kenya-police-raila-odinga-memorial.html,World,BBC,By Pranav Baskar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16int-kenya-odinga-unrest-1-tqpz/16int-kenya-odinga-unrest-1-tqpz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T20:56:10.441000+00:00,b6c9d1069ebf3717ba188317211879ca815120ff
57adeeacec80,Trump Administration Plans to Pay ICE Agents During Shutdown,"us politics, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, deportation, federal aid, immigration, immigration and customs enforcement;ice, donald trump, budget","The Trump administration plans to pay many immigration enforcement officers during the government shutdown, drawing from funds approved as part of a recent Republican package of tax cuts. The payments mark the latest in a string of unorthodox budget maneuvers by President Trump, who has stretched the limits of his power to advance his agenda and blunt the impact of a fiscal stalemate that is now in its third week. Typically, many government workers are furloughed when federal funding lapses, while others in vital roles, including law enforcement, must report for duty without pay. Only after Congress strikes a deal do these employees receive their lost wages. But Mr. Trump has looked to rearrange the budget to issue paychecks only for certain federal personnel, a set of maneuvers totaling billions of dollars that Congress has not authorized. Employees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement received an email this week saying that “law enforcement officers are to be paid through the One Big Beautiful Bill (OB3) appropriation for the duration of the furlough period,” according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times. The bill mentioned in the message is Mr. Trump’s signature tax law, which Republicans approved this year. Along with its large tax cuts, the package allocated vast new sums to pay for the president’s mass deportations, including $31 billion for ICE to hire new agents, train them and increase enforcement. The message, sent by agency leaders, applied to “excepted” employees, who are required to work without pay during a government shutdown. An official at the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the plans to pay more ICE employees, and congressional aides said they believed that the payments would include a wide range of ICE workers, including investigators and deportation officers. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the payments, or how long they might last in a shutdown with no end in sight. Broadly, the White House has also looked to provide pay for federal law enforcement during the shutdown, potentially including agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The president similarly ordered the Pentagon to rearrange its budget to pay wages to active-duty troops, and dipped into other funds for the military members of the U.S. Coast Guard. With the military, in particular, lawmakers from both parties had proposed legislation to pay them during the shutdown before Mr. Trump acted on his own. The decision to pay ICE may prove far more controversial, given the administration’s tactics in seeking to deport people it believes to be in the United States illegally.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/business/trump-ice-pay.html,Business,BBC,By Hamed Aleaziz and Tony Romm,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16dc-shutdown-ice-05-mpct/16dc-shutdown-ice-05-mpct-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T21:08:49+00:00,fdd6f9c0bd241c02435b8a09c91721f871a8b496
b73f1d218cf9,"Jeffrey Meldrum, Scholar Who Stalked Bigfoot, Dies at 67","bigfoot, obituary, science, myths, archaeology;anthropology, rumors and misinformation, jane goodall","Jeffrey Meldrum, a professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University whose expertise in foot morphology and bipedal locomotion in primates took a maverick swerve as he became the leading academic authority to vouch for the existence of Bigfoot, died on Sept. 9 in Pocatello, Idaho. He was 67. His wife, Lauren Stewart, said on social media that the cause was brain cancer. Dr. Meldrum’s willingness to bring scientific rigor to the study of Bigfoot, the hairy giant who has also been known as Sasquatch and who has resided mainly in folklore and the popular culture of the Pacific Northwest, earned him the gratitude of enthusiasts, who claimed to have sighted the creature, as well as the withering scorn of debunkers. His interest dated from boyhood, but his serious investigations began in 1996, when he examined a set of 15-inch footprints outside Walla Walla, Wash. His lab came to house more than 300 footprint casts, as well as samples of hair and feces. “I’m not out to proselytize that Bigfoot exists,” Dr. Meldrum told The Associated Press in 2006. “I place legend under scrutiny, and my conclusion is, absolutely, Bigfoot exists.” Supposed sightings of a Bigfoot-like hominid took off in the 1970s. Even the F.B.I. once investigated . But almost all Dr. Meldrum’s fellow scientists, including on his own campus, called his research pseudoscience. They said he was fanning the same distrust of learned expertise that has given rise to denials of climate change or the belief in U.F.O. abductions. Some 30 professors at Idaho State wrote to university officials in 2006 protesting the Bigfoot Rendezvous — part festival with cosplay and part academic symposium — that was held on campus and at which Dr. Meldrum was a featured speaker. A senior lecturer in the physics department, Martin Hackworth, told The A.P. at the time that Dr. Meldrum’s research was a “joke.” “He believes he’s taken up the cause of people who have been shut out by the scientific community,” Mr. Hackworth said. “He’s lionized there. He’s worshiped. He walks on water. It’s embarrassing.” Dr. Meldrum was defended by the university’s dean of arts and sciences, John Kijinski. “He provides a form of open discussion and dissenting viewpoints that may not be popular with the scientific community,” Dr. Kijinksi said, “but that’s what academics is all about.” According to an article at the time in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Dr. Meldrum was twice passed over for promotion to full professor by his department, biological sciences, because of his Sasquatch studies. “Why can’t we take a serious look at this as objective scientists?” he pleaded to The Chronicle. “It’s almost as if the spirit of exploration has kind of died.” (He eventually achieved full professorship, in 2012). Acknowledging that some Sasquatch “evidence” was the work of hoaxers, Dr. Meldrum argued in a 2006 book, “Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science,” that much of it was too sophisticated to be produced by pranksters. Castings of footprints in his collection, he wrote, showed anatomical features typical of chimpanzees, including a midtarsal break — two joints in the midfoot, a formation found in apes but not in humans. Hoaxers using wooden blocks to leave prints would have been unlikely to understand those fine anatomical distinctions, Dr. Meldrum argued. And he maintained that the purported Bigfoot in a famous film snippet made in Northern California in 1967, which skeptics have said is a person in a costume, walked in too apelike a manner to be fake. David J. Daegling, an anthropologist at the University of Florida, dismissed Dr. Meldrum’s conclusions in the magazine of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, which investigates controversial claims. Dr. Meldrum argued in a 2006 book that much of the evidence for Bigfoot was too sophisticated to be produced by pranksters. “If ‘Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science” is in fact the best, most credible and most scientific book to date on Bigfoot, the evidence is weaker than we imagined,” Dr. Daegling wrote. In a book of his own, “Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America’s Enduring Legend” (2004), Dr. Daegling wrote that hairy ape-men who live in the forest are found in myths from around the world and reflect a psychological projection of humankind’s estrangement from wild nature. Don Jeffrey Meldrum was born on May 24, 1958, in Salt Lake City, the eldest of three children of Don and Marilyn (Collings) Meldrum. His father worked for the supermarket chain Albertson’s, and the family moved around the Northwest. As a boy, Jeffrey was excited by the Bigfoot legend, telling his friends that someday he would find one in the wild. “Good luck hunting for Bigfoot,” a friend wrote in his yearbook when he graduated in 1976 from Capital High School in Boise, Idaho. He interrupted his studies at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, to serve a two-year mission in Germany for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Returning to Brigham Young, he earned a bachelor’s degree in 1982 and a master’s in 1984, both in zoology. He earned his Ph.D. in anatomical sciences from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1989. Dr. Meldrum taught at Duke and Northwestern before joining Idaho State’s faculty in 1993. His marriage to Teresa Little ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Stewart, whom he married in 2009, he is survived by his parents; his brother, Mike; his sister, Molly Meldrum; his sons from his first marriage, Colin, Sean, Devin, Trevor, Kayd and Brendon; a stepdaughter, Sarah Stewart; two stepsons, Scott and Kyle Vawter; and six grandchildren. Dr. Meldrum was the co-editor of “From Biped to Strider: The Emergence of Modern Human Walking, Running, and Resource Transport” (2004), a respected mainstream text. But he devoted much of his professional life to pursuing Bigfoot. Under “Field Experience,” his C.V. listed Sasquatch expeditions in the Blue Mountains of eastern Washington, the Canadian Rockies and Wyoming’s Wind River Range. He claimed that on these trips he heard teeth clacking unexplainably, and that something too big to be a bear once brushed against his tent. His interests in wildmen ranged to encompass others that are part of folk beliefs around the world. He published treatises on the Himalayan Yeti, the Yeren of China and the Nguoi Rung of Vietnam. One respected scientist who did not reject Dr. Meldrum out of hand was Jane Goodall, the famous primatologist who died this month. In a blurb for “Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science,” Dr. Goodall wrote that it brought “a much needed level of scientific analysis” to its subject. “I think I have read every article and every book about these creatures,” Dr. Goodall added, “and while most scientists are not satisfied with existing evidence, I have an open mind.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/science/jeffrey-meldrum-dead.html,Science,BBC,By Trip Gabriel,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/18/multimedia/16meldrum-jhbt-print2-SUB/16meldrum-jhbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T21:23:17.415000+00:00,fb8bcac04ad543f2a4e4b72c9e3e8c0a206c7ac1

Naima Green took her first darkroom class when she was 9 years old. It was at the Harlem School of the Arts in New York, and that’s where she learned to make a pinhole camera out of cardboard. Now, the artist, 35, uses photography, film and sound to document queer life, often creating intimate portraits set in forests, on beaches and in everyday urban spaces. In a solo exhibition opening today at the International Center of Photography in New York, Green explores themes of motherhood and unconventional family-building through images of herself, her family and her community, some biographical and others semi-fictionalized. (In several of the self-portraits, Green appears with a prosthetic pregnant belly.) Here, she discusses her work and those by others that have influenced her since childhood. The first work that inspired her Romare Bearden’s “The Block” (1971) Harlem, where I grew up, is such an important part of my visual and artistic memory. We used to have a reproduction of Romare Bearden’s “The Block” in my house. It was on the landing, so I saw it every time I walked up or down the stairs. It’s the first artwork that was seared into my mind. “The Block” is significant because of its vibrancy and multiplicity — it offers a look into many different stories at once. It shows the different layers of a city: all of the life happening, but also the moments of solitude. As a kid, I’d think, This is such an incredible world.

God has assigned Keyshawn an urgent mission, and it comes with a random-sounding condition. “In a matter of hours,” God tells him, “your family’s entire city will be underwater. I need you to get a boat and save them from the storm. Each member of your family has to be in the boat before the rain starts.” Otherwise: no eternal happiness for him. In Jordan E. Cooper’s pain-spiked supernatural comedy “ Oh Happy Day! ,” a very loose riff on the story of Noah’s Ark, that assignment is the reason Keyshawn (Cooper) has turned up, reluctantly, in the yard of his childhood home in Laurel, Miss., on his father’s birthday. As far as Keyshawn’s family knows, he was not murdered that very morning in the parking lot of a Motel 6 but is instead perfectly alive. A sex worker with fashion sense and track marks on his arm, Keyshawn has spent years staying away from these feet-on-the-ground, ordinary people: Niecy (Tamika Lawrence), his older sister, who remembers just what flavor ice pop her little brother likes; Kevin (Donovan Louis Bazemore), her 12-year-old son, who barely knows this visitor; and Lewis (Brian D. Coats), Keyshawn’s deacon father, who distinctly does not want him there. That’s a familiar feeling, since Lewis threw him out of the house for being gay when he was just a teenager. Keyshawn hates his father, but he has to get him in the boat. God’s orders. Best of luck, though, persuading the fam that their rain-starved patch of earth is about to be inundated.

67182bec7b3a,Parties Brace for a Political Future Without the Voting Rights Act,"us politics, voting rights act, legislation, redistricting and reapportionment, gerrymandering, state legislature, voting rights;voter registration;voter requirements, politics, supreme court;scotus, dnc, house of representatives, congress, rnc","After the Supreme Court appeared ready to dismantle one of the remaining provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Democrats and Republicans began to reckon with a political future that could see the balance of power in Congress tip decisively toward the G.O.P. and lead to further entrenchment and polarization in states across the country. For 60 years, the Voting Rights Act has been a singular force in American politics. Despite recent court cases that have weakened the law, it is still one of the most influential regulations shaping congressional and state legislative maps, expanding representation and voter participation in minority communities. Courts have required states to draw congressional districts that allow minority voters to elect the candidates of their choice, often leading to majority-minority districts that have favored Democrats. But on Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case testing whether incorporating race in redistricting, as protected by the Voting Rights Act, runs afoul of the Constitution. In their questioning, a majority of the justices appeared poised to rule that lawmakers cannot consider race, or to sharply limit their ability to do so. If the justices gut a key provision of the law, there could be a potential windfall for Republicans in Congress. An analysis by The New York Times estimated that the loss of those protections, found in Section 2 of the law, could open the way for redistricting that could net Republicans as many as a dozen seats . A study by two left-leaning voting rights groups — Fair Fight Action and Black Voters Matters Fund — set the potential Republican gains at 19 seats . Either result could place the House in Republican control for a generation. After the oral arguments concluded on Wednesday, Republicans kept their public comments to a minimum. The National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Committee declined to weigh in on the political possibilities of a weakened Voting Rights Act, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. But for Democrats, the tone of the oral arguments was met with a mix of panic, resolve, alarm and resignation, particularly amid an already contentious mid-decade redistricting fight. President Trump has been pressuring Republican-controlled states across the country to redraw their maps ahead of the 2026 midterms to create more safe seats for Republicans and to maintain control of Congress. But they have been confined in part by the Voting Rights Act, particularly in the South. “Republicans are already targeting the voting power of communities of color in their craven redistricting schemes, and if the Supreme Court sides with Donald Trump, it would be a major, generational step back in our fight for racial justice and fair representation,” Ken Martin, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. Neither party, however, was willing to engage in speculation about how many seats could be gained or lost in Congress. “No matter how the court rules, we intend to take back the majority in 2026,” Mr. Martin added. Representative Yvette Clarke, Democrat of New York and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that minority caucuses like hers and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could end up losing members, and that the loss of their voices in Congress could lead to significant policy shifts in areas like fair housing and voting rights. “It’s targeting those communities that, through the Voting Rights Act, were able to elect individuals that was more reflective of their lived experiences,” Ms. Clarke said. She added: “We stand to lose many, many seats.” Beyond the calculus of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives, some Democrats expressed alarm at the other potential consequences of the vacuum that could be left by gutting the Voting Rights Act. Without federal guardrails, states would be free to maximize one party’s hold over an area, removing region-to-region variation and locking in single-party power statewide. “You’re opening the door to creating a U.S. House of Representatives that more mimics the Senate and does not represent the people, but actually represents chunks of population that specifically have power,” said John Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “We’re talking about a massive political realignment of the way Americans are represented.” A potential decimation of the Voting Rights Act has Democrats contemplating a rapidly intensifying redistricting arms race, in which each party races to win a trifecta in a state — meaning complete control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor’s mansion — in order to draw new maps unbound by federal laws and create permanent majorities and minorities. For much of the last few decades, Democrats have been outgunned at the state legislative level, and have only recently begun to draw significant donor and voter attention to the downballot elections that determine so much of the national political climate. Republicans currently have a trifecta in 23 states. Democrats have one in only 15. “We’ll see more mid-decade redistricting, brinkmanship and laws that most of us had thought had gotten the way of the dodo in an ever more unstable and politicized environment,” said Daniel Squadron, a former Democratic state senator from New York and co-founder of the States Project, a Democratic group focused on state legislatures. “Having 50 states each unbound in the districts they can draw and the laws they can pass is going to further drive states away from each other.” Officials from both parties, however, cautioned that even without the protections from the Voting Rights Act, there were local realities — state laws, local politics and geographic limitations — that would shape any future redistricting plans. Current incumbents, for example, are often not thrilled about having to adjust to new districts, and the wholesale redrawing of maps could create an uproar among elected officials in a state. Indeed, in the Louisiana map that prompted the case before the Supreme Court, Republicans in the state took pains to protect the districts of Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Steve Scalise. If they were to redraw the maps in Louisiana to try to eliminate Democratic districts, some Republicans, including Mr. Johnson, may have to face a more competitive election. “There are political considerations in every state,” said Adam Kincaid, the executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate the party’s redistricting strategy. “This is all really hard to forecast.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/democrats-republicans-voting-rights.html,politics,BBC,By Nick Corasaniti,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16dc-voting-politics-photo-hcgt/16dc-voting-politics-photo-hcgt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T21:54:34.237000+00:00,77d79de0fd99ae3195772aa53adbbd685f5f529d
139b79093e9e,"Susan Stamberg, a Longtime Voice of NPR, Is Dead at 87","susan stamberg, obituary, npr, radio, all things considered, journalism;journalist;news media, women and girls","Susan Stamberg, a warm and familiar voice on NPR for over 50 years who in 1972 became the first woman to anchor a national evening news broadcast, “All Things Considered,” bringing an earthy informality to her pointed questioning of newsmakers, died on Thursday. She was 87. Her death was announced by NPR, which did not specify a location or a cause. Ms. Stamberg retired in September from the public broadcaster, where her last assignment had been special correspondent covering the arts. She served as host of “All Things Considered,” the weekday program of news, analysis and interviews, for 14 years, through 1986, and during that time it became NPR’s marquee broadcast, bringing prestige and seriousness to the network as it quickly grew beyond its original 63 member stations. Along with Nina Totenberg, Linda Wertheimer and Cokie Roberts , Ms. Stamberg was known in-house as one of NPR’s “founding mothers,” journalists who brought their distinctive female voices to public radio. But when Ms. Stamberg first went on the air for NPR, she tried to lower her pitch. “There were no role models for me,” she told The Seattle Times in 1999. “There were objections from station managers that women’s voices were not as authoritative.” She became known as a skilled interviewer, one who prepared deeply and listened actively to her subjects. Among the thousands of people she interviewed were President Jimmy Carter; Laura Bush, when she was first lady; the civil rights leader Rosa Parks; and the opera star Luciano Pavarotti . “I’m a natural schmoozer,” Ms. Stamberg told Newsday in 1993. “It is not my lot in life to go sit looking at a computer screen and write all day in this quiet, splendid isolation. I like to get out and scramble with people. That’s why I report, that’s why I interview.” Ms. Stamberg stepped down from “All Things Considered” in September 1986 to seek treatment for breast cancer. When she returned to the air the following January, it was to became the founding host of “Weekend Edition Sunday.” One of her innovations was to introduce a Sunday morning puzzle that became a listener favorite. She also brought on a pair of brothers, Ray and Tom Magliozzi, auto mechanics who hosted a local radio show on WBUR in Boston. They soon spun it off into a well-loved national NPR show, “Car Talk,” which broadcast original episodes until 2012. Susan Levitt was born on Sept. 7, 1938, in Newark, the only child of Anne (Rosenberg) Levitt and Robert Levitt, a salesman. She grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She attended the High School of Music & Art (now the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts) and earned a B.A. in English from Barnard College in 1959. In 1962 she married Louis Stamberg, a State Department employee. She broke into journalism as an editorial assistant at The New Republic and then was hired to produce a weekly public affairs show for WAMU-FM, a station on the campus of American University in Washington. She quickly rose through the ranks, from weather reporter to station manager. Ms. Stamberg is survived by a son, Josh, and two granddaughters. Beginning in 1971, she became known for her Thanksgiving tradition of sharing with NPR listeners a family recipe for a distinctive cranberry relish made with horseradish. She added variety by inviting celebrities like Martha Stewart and the rapper Coolio to read the recipe on the air, and it became one of her most popular segments. “That’s going to be on my obituary,” she told the NPR host Ari Shapiro in an interview that aired when she retired. “It’ll be the lead, you know?” Or maybe the ending.

He has yet to return, and now his family fears the worst. On Thursday, his name spread across social media, with users saying that he was one of six people aboard a suspected drug vessel that had been blown up by the U.S. military this week. “I don’t want to believe that this is my child,” his mother, Lenore Burnley, said in an interview. “Is this really true?” The U.S. military has destroyed five boats it has alleged were ferrying drugs into the United States, killing 27 people. And despite the mounting death toll, no authority has come forward to publicly release the names of any of the dead. Relatives have been left with rumors and social media posts — as well as their loved ones’ absences — to reach their own conclusions. Mr. Joseph’s family is believed to be the first to publicly say they believe a relative is among those killed on one of the targeted boats. Mr. Joseph’s neighbor, known by his last name Samaroo, was on the same boat and is also missing, Mr. Joseph’s aunt, Lynette Burnley said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

83ec95388749,"Ace Frehley, a Founding Member of Kiss, Is Dead at 74","ace frehley, obituary, kiss music group, pop rock music, rock and roll hall of fame","Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist of the band Kiss, who often performed in white-and-silver face makeup and sold millions of records during his two tenures with the band — from 1973 to 1982, and then from 1996 to 2002 — died on Thursday in Morristown, N.J. He was 74. A statement from his family said the cause was a recent fall at his home. A consummate showman, like all the members of Kiss, Mr. Frehley was known for playing guitars rigged with pyrotechnic effects and for his distinctive stage persona: He was known as “the Spaceman” or “Space Ace” because of the silver stars on his face. He also designed the band’s logo (with assistance from the guitarist Paul Stanley). With Mr. Stanley, the bassist Gene Simmons and the drummer Peter Criss, he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. “Out of the four founding members of Kiss, I definitely have been the most successful solo artist,” Mr. Frehley bragged in a 2024 interview with the website Antihero. That was true largely because of his 1978 single “ New York Groove ,” an enduring glam-rock anthem. His other solo projects included the band Frehley’s Comet. Paul Daniel Frehley was born in the Bronx on April 27, 1951, and began playing guitar at age 13. He was given the nickname Ace when he was 16 by the drummer in one of his early bands in gratitude for setting him up with attractive dates. In the early days of Kiss, Mr. Frehley started using the nickname full time to avoid confusion with Mr. Stanley. During Mr. Frehley’s original tenure with Kiss, the band released 11 albums, both studio and live, that went gold or platinum in the United States. He is survived by his wife, Jeanette; his daughter, Monique; his brother, Charles; and his sister, Nancy Salvner.

cd1c463fb0d9,How the Bolton Indictment Compares to Trump’s Classified Documents Case,"us politics, classified information, federal criminal case against trump (documents case), fbi, justice department, mar-a-lago, the new york times, joe biden, john bolton","The indictment on Thursday of John R. Bolton, President Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic, over his handling of classified information invites comparison to Mr. Trump’s own indictment on similar charges. Mr. Trump was accused of illegally holding onto classified documents after he left the White House in January 2021, and of obstructing the government’s efforts to retrieve them from his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. The case was dropped last year after Mr. Trump won the 2024 election. Mr. Bolton is accused of illegally sending classified information to two close family members who did not have security clearances, and of illegally holding onto copies of those messages at his house in Maryland. Here is a closer look at how the two cases compare. Both were accused of handling data insecurely. Both men were accused of not taking the proper precautions to secure classified information. In Mr. Trump’s case, he was accused of storing boxes with classified information in various insecure locations at Mar-a-Lago, including a bathroom and a ballroom stage. Because Mar-a-Lago is a club and not just a residence, many people could have gained access to the documents before the F.B.I. finally retrieved them in August 2022. In Mr. Bolton’s case, he was accused of transmitting the entries using personal email accounts and an encrypted consumer messaging app that were not approved for sending and storing classified information. One of the email accounts was apparently hacked by Iran in 2021, the indictment said. And while his house had an approved facility for storing classified information while he was Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, it did not have one afterward. Both faced multiple counts of unauthorized retention. The charges in the two indictments substantially overlap in one respect: Both men were charged with multiple counts of unauthorized retention of national defense information under Section 793(e) of Title 10 of the United States Code, part of a law known as the Espionage Act. In both cases, prosecutors picked a subset of the files recovered from the men’s homes during court-authorized searches — presumably, documents that were sensitive enough to impress a jury, but not so sensitive that it would be risky to discuss them in court — and brought a count based on each. Mr. Trump was charged with 38 such counts, and Mr. Bolton with eight. The indictments used their past statements against them. The indictments against both men cited their own public statements criticizing others for mishandling classified information, to underscore that they knew what they were doing was wrong. In Mr. Trump’s case, the indictment cited numerous statements he made during the 2016 presidential campaign about the need to vigorously enforce laws meant to protect classified information. At the time, Mr. Trump was using that issue to attack his rival, Hillary Clinton, for having used a private email server while secretary of state. In Mr. Bolton’s case, the indictment quoted extensively from comments he made in the spring of 2025 criticizing Trump administration officials who had discussed plans for an upcoming military strike in Yemen on the consumer app Signal, in a group chat that mistakenly included a journalist. Notably, the Justice Department under Mr. Trump did not treat that incident as a crime. Only Trump was charged with obstruction offenses. The charges in the two cases significantly diverged in another respect. Each man was charged with a set of offenses that the other did not face. In Mr. Trump’s case, his obstruction of efforts to retrieve files — including allegations that he caused a false statement to be made to law enforcement agents and conspired to conceal files from them — was a major part of his case. He faced eight additional charges that derived from that alleged behavior, which the indictment documented at length. Mr. Bolton’s indictment chided him for not telling the F.B.I. that he still possessed classified information when he reported that an apparent Iranian hacker had broken into his email account in 2021. But it did not charge him with obstruction. Only Bolton was charged with transmission offenses. Mr. Bolton was, however, charged with eight counts of unauthorized transmission of national defense information under Section 793(d), based on the allegations that he emailed or used a messenger app program to send diary entries to his relatives, even though they were not cleared to see classified information in them. The indictment of Mr. Trump recounted two incidents in which he was accused of showing classified files to people who were not authorized to receive them when he was no longer president, including a recorded interview at his club in Bedminster, N.J., with a writer and publisher of a forthcoming book, along with two staff members, during which he apparently showed them a classified military plan for attacking Iran. But while the indictment charged Mr. Trump with the unauthorized retention of that document, it did not charge him with showing it to people who were not approved to see it. Both got out of earlier trouble in part because of elections. There is one other notable parallel. Both men evaded at least some legal troubles because of an election. The criminal case against Mr. Trump over his handling of classified documents dissolved after he won the 2024 election. Judge Aileen M. Cannon of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida had unexpectedly dismissed the case before trial in July 2024 , ruling that the special counsel who brought the charges was improperly appointed. Her ruling conflicted with decades of decisions by higher courts. The Justice Department asked an appeals court to overturn her decision and reinstate the charges. But before the court acted, Mr. Trump won the election. Because the department considers sitting presidents temporarily immune from prosecution, it dropped the case against Mr. Trump. Four years earlier, in 2020, the Justice Department in the first Trump administration had opened a criminal and civil investigation into Mr. Bolton’s handling of classified information in connection with the publication of a memoir that criticized Mr. Trump . But in 2021, after the Biden administration took office, the department dropped that inquiry. The New York Times has reported that the current inquiry traces back to the U.S. government’s gathering of data from an adversary’s spy service, including emails with sensitive information that Mr. Bolton, while still working in the first Trump administration, appeared to have sent to people close to him on an unclassified system.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/trump-bolton-indictment-documents.html,politics,BBC,By Charlie Savage,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/28/us/politics/16dc-explainer/28dc-whattowatch1-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T00:52:57+00:00,207858c64c88ba8adca928a51c0f86ff70f83fe8
e5f3a5ff2466,Smartmatic Added to Bribery Indictment of the Company’s Executives,"bribery and kickbacks, lawsuits, money laundering, foreign corrupt practices act, justice department, smartmatic, philippines","Smartmatic, the voting technology company, was added on Thursday to a Justice Department indictment that alleged that some of the company’s executives were involved in a scheme to bribe an election official in the Philippines. The defendants are accused of funneling $1 million in bribes, from 2015 to 2018, to the man who led the Philippine elections commission for most of that time in order to obtain contracts. In August 2024 , prosecutors charged Roger Piñate, Smartmatic’s president and co-founder, and another executive, Jorge Vasquez, with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans corporate bribery overseas. Mr. Piñate, Mr. Vasquez and Elie Moreno, a former Smartmatic executive, along with the former elections commission chairman, Juan Andres Bautista, were also charged with money-laundering violations. The superseding indictment, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, adds criminal charges of money laundering and foreign bribery against Smartmatic itself. A spokesman for Smartmatic said the company categorically denied the allegations. “This is wrong on the facts and wrong on the law,” he said in a statement. “We will contest the claims, and we are confident we will prevail in court.” He added, “We believe the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida has been misled and politically influenced by powerful interests, despite our extensive cooperation with the government.” Smartmatic was a little-known company until 2020, when it became the subject of false claims about vote-rigging in the U.S. presidential election. Smartmatic filed a number of defamation suits in response, and settled last year with the right-wing networks Newsmax for $40 million and One America News for an undisclosed amount.

29c04c89d030,‘Ragtime’ Review: Checking the Status of Our American Dream,"theater, broadway theater, vivian beaumont theater, lincoln center, lear debessonet, brandon uranowitz, shaina taub, nichelle lewis, caissie levy, joshua henry, colin donnell, ragtime","Near the top of the musical “Ragtime,” which unfurls at the turn of the 20th century, the wealthy patriarch of a suburban family boards a ship bound for a polar expedition. His wife won’t miss him much, yet she thinks she will, and so he comforts her. “But it’s only a year,” he says. “Nothing much happens in a year. The world will not spin off its axis.” Oh, babe. Wanna bet? It was almost a year ago when the brief run of Lear deBessonet’s potent “Ragtime” revival at New York City Center straddled the presidential election: apt timing for a show that rummages through an American moment to interrogate the American soul. Since then, the country has been engaged in an ever-more-fractious internal tussle about its identity and intentions, its dreams and decency. So while deBessonet’s “ Ragtime ” production for Lincoln Center Theater, which opened on Thursday night at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, has much the same glorious cast it had last fall, the cultural climate has altered its alchemy. The considerable beauty of this inspiriting show — full of complicated emotions about our diaspora nation — is streaked with melancholy. The company’s abundance of extraordinary talent starts with its stars: Joshua Henry as Coalhouse Walker Jr., a Black pianist and new father flourishing in the era of ragtime music; Caissie Levy as an affluent white woman called only Mother, who comes into her own when her husband leaves on that expedition; and Brandon Uranowitz as Tateh, a poor Jewish immigrant newly arrived from Latvia with his young daughter. As the plot follows the intersecting fortunes of those three characters’ families, each seeking to redeem the country’s promise at a time of tumultuous change, old-fashioned musical-theater pleasures are very much on offer: a multitudinous cast clad in sumptuous costumes; riveting vocals undergirded by a 28-piece orchestra; a sprinkling of spectacle descending from above and rising from below. It works as rousing entertainment, full stop. But the production is also imbued somehow with a present-tense sense of civic necessity. This is simply what deBessonet, Lincoln Center Theater’s new artistic director , has done for years, notably with her productions for the Public Theater’s Public Works program . In any case, that is not a caveat. This is, though: Adapted by Terrence McNally (book), Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics) from E.L. Doctorow’s sprawling novel, “Ragtime” can be heavy-handed in its verbiage. The story’s Coalhouse strand, albeit buoyed by Flaherty’s music, leans hard into Black tragedy and white savior tropes. The script’s sheer sweep, which incorporates sundry historical characters (look, Houdini!), presents a risk of two-dimensional pageantry. But this revival, which opens with an enchanting little boy in short pants alone onstage, sidesteps each of those hazards as neatly as possible. Everything here is at human scale, intimate even on the vast Beaumont stage. And when the text doesn’t measure up, deBessonet’s impeccable actors elevate the artistry. If “Ragtime” has a dominant location, it is the home in New Rochelle, N.Y., where Mother is enjoying life as head of household while Father (Colin Donnell) is away. She has plenty of company: her unfiltered, oracular child, Edgar (Nick Barrington); her restless romantic of a younger brother (Ben Levi Ross); and her brusque and racist father (Tom Nelis). The background music to their lives evokes the calliope, while their clothes whisper loudly of prosperity: elegant, tailored and in shades of cream. They look at all times ready for a game of croquet. (The set is by David Korins, and costumes are by Linda Cho.) The day that Mother discovers an abandoned newborn in the garden, and decides to take in both infant and then mother, is the day her future joins paths with Coalhouse’s. The child is his son with Sarah (Nichelle Lewis), the woman he loved but foolishly took for granted. (Allison Blackwell, playing Sarah’s loyal friend, makes his failure indelibly clear.) In the anguished solo “Your Daddy’s Son,” Sarah pours out her pain to her baby, asking his forgiveness — and it is not Lewis’s fault that her voice is drowned out by the orchestra when the music intensifies. When Coalhouse goes looking for Sarah, wanting to win her back, he finds her and the baby living at Mother’s house. Sarah, upstairs, refuses week after week to see him. Resolutely, penitently, he keeps returning anyway, a charmer intent on proving his solidity. When at last she descends the steps as he plead-sings, “Sarah, come down to me,” it is as if a magnetic force pulls her to him — that or the sheer, stunning power of his voice. Henry, whose acting, like his singing, seems to emanate from his very core, earned more than one mid-show standing ovation at the performance I saw. In “Wheels of a Dream,” as he sang of the baby’s future — “When he is old enough I will show him America” — it was like hearing an echo of his “Soliloquy” in “Carousel”: another father thrilling to the possibilities that life holds for his son. (Music direction is by James Moore.) We root for Coalhouse and Sarah’s union, and we root too for Mother, who upon her husband’s return is not about to retreat back into the acquiescent, ornamental role she used to play in her marriage. She is disgusted by his utter lack of compassion. Put out by how drastically his home has changed in his absence, Father calls Sarah’s baby “a bastard child.” Mother is too much a lady to express her rancor openly, but Levy makes her a master of genteel subtlety and cool rebuffs. You can hear the death of her love when she tells Father: “I did not expect you to come home a different man but I had hoped to find you a kinder one.” Of the three principals, though, the penniless artist Tateh is the winsome one, even with all his worries. When he first encounters Mother, he is still tethering his little girl (Tabitha Lawing) to him with a rope, so petrified is he of being separated from her in this unfamiliar land. But Uranowitz endows Tateh with a sweetness that prevails over the bitterness in his life. He is playful, funny, sympathetic. Almost inevitably, in our perception, he is also a proxy for the many faceless immigrants lately in the news. You can feel the audience willing him to achieve the American dream. Tateh, Mother, Coalhouse — each of them is working to build a better country for their children. “Ragtime” is not blind to the uglier forces in the culture: bigotry, violence, misogyny, greed. The anarchist Emma Goldman (Shaina Taub) pops up throughout the show, fighting against — even delightfully hissing at — rapacious capitalists. Racism in particular has mortal consequences in this musical. If, at the end, the script ties up the strands of its story in a way that seems overly naïve (to offer specifics would be a spoiler), it is also an optimistic vision of American social harmony. DeBessonet presents a haunting counterpoint to that in the last word of the final song. The word is “dream,” but look at the actors’ solemn faces; listen to their intonation. It does not sound like a dream ascendant. What is the status of our American dream? This “Ragtime” wants to know. Ragtime Through Jan. 4 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Manhattan; lct.org .

a5979266c896,Trump Refiles His $15 Billion Defamation Lawsuit Against The New York Times,"us politics, presidential election of 2024, defamation, lawsuits, penguin random house, the new york times, donald trump","President Trump on Thursday refiled his defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and several of its reporters, again accusing the news organization of seeking to undermine his 2024 candidacy and disparage his reputation as a businessman. Last month, Judge Steven D. Merryday, of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, threw out the president’s original 85-page complaint, saying it was unnecessarily discursive, laden with “florid and enervating” prose, and took too long to lodge formal allegations of defamation. “A complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective,” Judge Merryday wrote at the time. He gave the president’s lawyers 28 days to refile an amended complaint. Mr. Trump’s revised legal filing on Thursday evening was 40 pages long, less than half the length of the original. One of the defendants in the original suit, the Times reporter Michael S. Schmidt, is no longer cited as a defendant. Many of the original complaint’s lengthy tributes to Mr. Trump, like a sentence that described his 2024 election victory as “the greatest personal and political achievement in American history,” are no longer present. As in the original filing, the amended complaint asks for $15 billion in damages. Mr. Trump’s lawsuit against The Times is the latest in a series of actions against major news outlets. Both CBS News and ABC News agreed to pay $16 million each to settle lawsuits that Mr. Trump brought against the networks. The ABC late-night star Jimmy Kimmel was temporarily pulled off the air last month after Mr. Trump’s top communications regulator assailed his program and suggested that he might take regulatory action against the broadcaster. Mr. Trump’s complaint against The Times claims that a pair of articles published in The New York Times sought to undermine Mr. Trump’s reputation as a successful businessman and television star of the reality show “The Apprentice.” One of the articles was written by Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner, and the other by Peter Baker. Like the original version of the complaint, the new filing also names as a defendant Penguin Random House, which published a book about Mr. Trump written by Ms. Craig and Mr. Buettner. A spokeswoman for The Times said on Thursday night: “As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: This lawsuit has no merit. Nothing has changed today. This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate P.R. attention, but The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.” A spokeswoman for Penguin Random House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The publishing house has previously referred to Mr. Trump’s claims as “meritless.” A spokesman for Mr. Trump’s legal team said in a statement on Thursday: “President Trump is continuing to hold the Fake News responsible through this powerhouse lawsuit against The New York Times, its reporters and Penguin Random House.” Judge Merryday is an appointee of President George H.W. Bush. He had said that Mr. Trump’s original lawsuit ran afoul of legal requirements that a complaint be “a short and plain statement of the claim.” Mr. Trump also sued The Times in 2021, over an article that examined his financial history; that suit was dismissed , and Mr. Trump was instructed to pay The Times’s legal expenses. Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign also sued the newspaper for libel in 2020 over an Opinion essay; that lawsuit was also dismissed .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/business/media/trump-lawsuit-new-york-times.html,Business,BBC,By Michael M.

83465f44fe66,The Real Trump Factor in the Gaza Deal,"donald trump, benjamin netanyahu, gaza strip, israel gaza war, steven witkoff, jared kushner, hamas, qatar","Praise for President Trump’s diplomacy in brokering a cease-fire in Gaza has mostly focused on how he persuaded Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to accept a deal. Many assume that Trump threatened to withdraw U.S. support from Israel, or otherwise pressured the Israeli leader into capitulating. But there is a more convincing explanation for Mr. Trump’s success. Far from merely menacing Mr. Netanyahu with consequences, the American president’s key intervention was to give a political lifeline to the deeply unpopular Israeli leader. The secret of Mr. Trump’s success with Mr. Netanyahu was offering carrots on domestic politics — not sticks on foreign policy. There were, of course, important external factors that laid the groundwork for the deal. Both Israel and Hamas had finally concluded that continuing the war was a losing proposition. For Hamas, Israel’s operations over the past year have been devastating. The group’s ability to maneuver and resupply itself is hobbled; its cash flow has been severed; and its top leaders have been eliminated. Outside Gaza, Hamas’ supporters in the Axis of Resistance have also been degraded by Israel’s strikes across Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran itself. Hamas found itself isolated in the region and increasingly unpopular in Gaza. For Israel, the war had reached a tipping point. Its operational gains no longer outweighed the collapse of Israel’s international standing , the erosion of bipartisan American support over civilian casualties in Gaza or the strain on Israel’s war-weary military . The new phase of the war that Mr. Netanyahu announced over the summer — in which Israel aimed to hold most of the Gaza Strip and once again clear northern Gaza of Hamas — committed the Israel Defense Forces to an unsustainable drain on munitions and manpower. Israel’s broad-daylight strike against Hamas political leaders in Doha, Qatar, also created an opening. Two years of rising fury in the Muslim world over the agony in Gaza were already putting stress on leaders across the Middle East. Many privately supported dismantling Hamas but would not risk potential domestic backlash by appearing to back Israel’s military campaign. But Israel’s Doha strike brought the Gaza war to them — and threatened to upend their unwritten contracts between government and governed. The unhappy Gulf leaders had Mr. Trump’s ear, and they used it. This brings us to the role of Mr. Trump himself, whose critical contribution was less about pressuring Mr. Netanyahu than diving deep into his political quagmire. President Biden never wavered in his support for Israel’s campaign to dismantle Hamas after the horrors of Oct. 7. But Mr. Biden’s team also applied pressure — including withholding certain munitions and publicly calling out likely Israeli war crimes — to push Israel to protect civilians and increase humanitarian aid. When Mr. Trump returned to office, he ended any daylight with Mr. Netanyahu on Gaza. Mr. Trump did not object when Israel halted all humanitarian aid to Gaza in March. He did not threaten to withhold U.S. support, despite alarming indicators of famine in the Gaza Strip and rising reports of civilian casualties. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Ms. Pelosi, 85, has not yet said whether she will seek another term in 2026 in the San Francisco seat she has occupied in Congress since 1987. Mr. Wiener, 55, has been waiting for Ms. Pelosi to step aside, opening a congressional committee two years ago and raising more than $1 million for it. As recently as March , he had said he would wait to run until after Ms. Pelosi retired and it would “be an honor” to succeed her. But the political dynamics appear to have changed as Ms. Pelosi, who stepped down as the Democratic leader after the 2022 midterm elections, has continued to hold her congressional seat and has declined to announce her plans for the future. Mr. Wiener declined to comment. His plans were first reported by the San Francisco Standard . Mr. Wiener, who is openly gay, has been a prolific legislator in Sacramento, known for pushing to spur more housing development and pass laws that expand rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people. He wrote a law making California a “state of refuge” for transgender people from states that banned access to gender medical care to get treatment without facing criminal prosecution. For years, he worked to change California’s landmark environmental law to make it easier to build more homes, an effort that was finally successful this year. He has also repeatedly battled Gov. Gavin Newsom for more money for public transit, and tried, unsuccessfully, to pass legislation allowing San Francisco bars to stay open past 2 a.m. Ms. Pelosi already faces another primary challenger next year: Saikat Chakrabarti, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York’s former chief of staff who has plunged more than $700,000 of his own money into the race. His campaign held a kickoff event this month with more than 700 attendees. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

In a social media post, Mr. Ranucci said the explosion had been caused by an explosive device placed under the cars. He posted a video on social media after the explosion, showing the wreckage of two cars parked on a street outside a black metal gate. Lights from an emergency vehicle were visible in the video, as well as an emergency worker in uniform. Mr. Ranucci is known as the host of “Report,” an investigative program on the Italian public broadcasting channel Rai 3. In 2021, the Italian police placed him under protection because of an assassination plot by ‘Ndrangheta, an Italian organized crime group. Mr. Ranucci wrote on social media that the Carabinieri, Italy’s military police, and the fire brigade were on the scene. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was injured by the explosion. In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Mr. Ranucci said that he and his daughter had been at home when the explosion happened.

He was 101. He died at a hospital in Oita, in Kyushu province, the Social Democratic Party of Oita said in a statement on Friday. Mr. Murayama delivered his historic apology on national television on the morning of Aug. 15, 1995, 50 years to the day when Japan announced it would surrender to the United States. It was brief and cautiously worded, completed in under five minutes. “I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history,” he said, “and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology. “Our task,” Mr. Murayama continued, “is to convey to younger generations the horrors of war so that we never repeat the errors in our history.” The apology was the defining achievement of Mr. Murayama’s 18 months in office. He had gone further than any previous Japanese leader in expressing regrets for the killing, torture and rape of millions of civilians and other atrocities. But he had been sharply constrained by conservatives in his governing coalition and the apology was not strong enough to ease resentment in China and South Korea. It also rankled nationalists.

Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now . Ballroom Blitz On Wednesday, President Trump hosted wealthy donors who opened their checkbooks for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom he’s having built at the White House, a project that has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Jimmy Kimmel called it “a fund-raising dinner for his big, beautiful $200 million wedding venue” on his Thursday show. “All the top people from Google, Apple, Amazon, you name it, lined up to eat beef stroganoff and kiss his ass, just as our founding fathers intended — to build a ballroom.

994c0a126ff9,Devastating Floods in Mexico Test a Popular President,"flood, rain, mexico, emergency response and preparedness, claudia sheinbaum, veracruz, fatalities;casualties","When torrential rains hit a swath of Mexico last week, the Cazones River swelled so fast there was virtually no time to flee. In mere hours, the river rose by many feet, the authorities and residents said, overtaking its banks and pouring into people’s homes, including in Poza Rica, a small working-class city in Veracruz State. “The alert arrived when the wave was already on top of you,” Adán González Ortega, a 78-year-old resident, said in an interview on Thursday. He made it to his sister’s house by the time the water was waist-deep, he said, but not everyone had been so lucky. At least 70 people have died in the disaster and 72 others remain missing, officials said on Thursday, placing it among the worst flooding events in the country in recent years. The sudden flooding hit the Mexican states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro and Puebla. Rivers swept over banks, landslides blocked roads and many people were stranded in homes and cars, including some who were injured. Some places received around 20 inches of rain in just four days, government figures show. The disaster has put intense pressure on the government, especially in light of a disaster fund slashed by the previous president and videos circulating widely on social media. Along with clips of a floating restaurant and of a man and his dogs rescued from a rushing river, one showed residents confronting the president herself over the official preparation and response. “They didn’t say that anything like this was going to happen,” Mr. González said as he stood in mud at his home in Poza Rica. Some residents complained that it had taken too long for assistance to arrive. Others said the first to help were fellow neighbors. President Claudia Sheinbaum visited the flooded areas this week, telling reporters on Monday that there had been no indication of what was coming. “There were no scientific or meteorological conditions that could have indicated to us that the rainfall would be of this magnitude,” she said, adding that officials had mostly been watching two major storms in the Pacific at the time. Her tour of the affected states contrasted with the response taken by her predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, when Hurricane Otis devastated Mexico’s Pacific Coast in 2023. Mr. López Obrador was widely criticized for hardly appearing before affected residents. Ms. Sheinbaum “decided to take the bull by the horns,” said René Delgado, a political commentator, in a television interview on Wednesday. But the visit has also risked making her the face of the problem for the victims, he added. Though the president has so far enjoyed broad public support — a reflection of her attention to social programs and the way she has managed relations with President Trump — analysts said the disaster appeared to be testing her in a new way. Amid recovery efforts this week, officials have tried to reassure residents that a system has been set up to locate and clear blocked roads, and that they will receive help, by aircraft and helicopters if necessary. The government’s social media accounts have filled with imagery of Ms. Sheinbaum trudging through mud and embracing residents. On Thursday, the Navy led a group of journalists, including from The New York Times, on a visit to Poza Rica to showcase its efforts. People in areas still piled high with mud and debris thanked the Navy as it handed out supplies or cleared roads. But some openly complained to the troops about what they said was insufficient help. While the Navy had cleared several neighborhoods, others remained in bad shape. Many residents said the flooding reached the ceiling of their homes, and so much — from mattresses to appliances to cars — was now irreparable. “Mud smells and is heavy,” said Lorenzo Bruno Lara, 60, a mechanic who was shoveling his property. Navy medical officials said the risk of infection from bacteria and waste carried by the mud was a significant concern. Criticism of the government has persisted, fueled largely by the video of residents confronting Ms. Sheinbaum and attacks from her political opponents. Some people have placed blame not with Ms. Sheinbaum but with Mr. López Obrador, for dissolving a special disaster relief fund over corruption claims. (No cases of corruption directly linked to the fund have been legally proven.) Ms. Sheinbaum’s response has also gained some praise, particularly from those who said she was at least taking responsibility, in contrast with other members of her party. The governor of Veracruz initially downplayed the flooding in her state last week, saying the Cazones River had a “light” overflow. Ms. Sheinbaum has said her administration will spare no expense, including for reconstruction. Eduardo Cerecedo, 32, who lives with his family a block from the Cazones, knew Poza Rica was considered at high risk for flooding. But he said he could not afford to move elsewhere and he wished the authorities had done more to help prevent this catastrophe, including by building higher retaining walls . “We have to start from scratch,” he said, “because we have nothing here.” Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/world/americas/mexico-floods-missing.html,World,BBC,"By James Wagner, Annie Correal and Cristopher Rogel Blanquet",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17int-veracruz-floods-01-cwbj/17int-veracruz-floods-01-cwbj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T07:08:54.216000+00:00,8f6acced580f688ad9937cb96a2affe2fb353f17

In meetings with officials in Beijing this week, Mr. Cook vowed to boost Apple’s investment in China, long the company’s most important market after the United States and the place where it assembles most of its iPhones. Weeks earlier, Mr. Cook had met with President Trump at the White House and promised to invest an additional $100 billion in the United States, saying he would bring more of the company’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the country. The electronics giant is one of many companies facing a delicate balancing act as the world’s two largest economies ramp up their contest for control over global tech supply chains . Officials in both countries have claimed broad authority over supplies of chips and minerals, critical inputs for everything from cars to artificial intelligence systems. China welcomed Apple’s deepening cooperation and increased investment, the commerce minister, Wang Wentao, told Mr. Cook on Thursday, according to state media. On Tuesday, Apple also announced a new donation to expand environmental education at Tsinghua University, one of China’s top universities, in Beijing. It didn’t disclose the amount of either Chinese investment, and a company representative did not immediately comment. Mr. Cook also met with video game designers and visited the set of a music video shot on the iPhone 17 Pro. And he picked up one of the world’s most coveted accessories : a custom Labubu doll, made to look like the Apple chief himself, during a meeting with Kasing Lung, the designer of the Chinese toymaker Pop Mart’s popular dolls. Over the past two years, Apple has been fighting to keep a spot among China’s five best-selling phone makers as shoppers have turned to domestic brands like Huawei , Vivo and Oppo. In January, the Chinese government launched a subsidy program for purchases of smartphones in order to boost consumer spending. But such subsidies apply to devices priced below about $840, which makes most of the new iPhone models available in China ineligible. Despite their high price tags, some Chinese consumers are still interested in the latest iPhones. The iPhone 17 Air, which Mr. Cook promoted during a stop at the Apple store in Beijing’s Wangfujing shopping district this week, sold out just minutes after presale orders opened in China on Friday. The majority of the world’s iPhones are still made in China, though Apple has shifted some production to Vietnam, Thailand and India. In China, most are made by the Apple supplier Foxconn in Zhengzhou, where years of government support and perks like roads, power plants and tax breaks have built up a network of factories known in China as “iPhone city.” Apple’s reliance on manufacturing in China shows no signs of abating. A recent investigation by China Labor Watch, a labor advocacy group, found that as many as 200,000 people worked in Zhengzhou during the busy ramp-up of iPhone 17 production.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/business/apple-china-us-tim-cook-investment-tech-war.html,Business,BBC,By Meaghan Tobin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/world/17Biz-China-Apple-0001/17Biz-China-Apple-0001-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T07:41:40.695000+00:00,a558088aadb9c1ffd2dae056c727732a78283bc2
9f697a3b1464,‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"movies, jennifer lopez, bill condon, kiss of the spider woman","new video loaded: ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ | Anatomy of a Scene transcript ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ | Anatomy of a Scene The director Bill Condon narrates a musical dance sequence featuring Jennifer Lopez. Hi, I’m Bill Condon. I directed “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” I also wrote the screenplay adaptation. So this is a scene from the movie within the movie. Jennifer Lopez plays a great fashion editor who has come to this small village with Diego Luna, who is a great photographer, and her sidekick and best friend, played by Tonatiuh. Then the gangster who owns this club and controls the village, shows up. He’s played by Tony Dovolani. Tony, a legendary ballroom dancer, is someone who was in “Shall We Dance” with Jennifer years ago. So this is a reunion too, between these two great dancers. When we were building the number, Jennifer’s credo here was don’t make it easy on me. I want to do things that are difficult. So ultimately her grabbing that glass and getting on the ground and spinning and then getting up, that was all at her instigation. And I think you’ll notice here that we shot this number when they dance in one master the way they used to very wide so that you can see a full figure. The take I chose to put in the movie is the one where Diego Luna watching Jennifer pull off this amazing number sees that incredible Colleen Atwood fringe is about to crash into the champagne glass and grabs it. I just thought it was a wonderful moment. It was choreographed by all of our choreographers led by Sergio Trujillo, Christopher Scott, Brandon Bieber because we prepared this movie in three locations. Diego Luna was working in Madrid, Jennifer was in Los Angeles, and we were prepping in New York. So it was a constant kind of exchange of ideas. “I’ll see you in the lobby in the morning?” This scene also introduces a romantic triangle within the movie. Diego Luna, still in love with a woman from the village called Paulina Paz, who is dating this gangster. And Jennifer being his new love. So this triangle then gets reflected in the prison drama itself. “And with that, I say Ciao.

Putin of Russia in the coming weeks in hopes of ending the war. Mr. Zelensky is coming to Washington aiming to win more American support, as Mr. Trump has dangled the possibility that he would provide Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles capable of striking deep within Russia . But after a two-hour call with Mr. Putin on Thursday, Mr. Trump left unclear whether he might agree to provide the Tomahawks, suggesting that he is again banking on further talks with Mr. Putin to resolve the war. It is a situation that Mr. Zelensky has encountered before with Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly delayed imposing sanctions on Russia and put off more aid to Kyiv while giving Mr. Putin chances to negotiate that yield no apparent progress. In this instance, Mr. Trump has been energized in his peacemaking efforts by bringing about a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, and he has made clear that he sees ending Russia’s war on Ukraine as his next goal. Over the last week, he had cast the possibility of the Tomahawk sales as an incentive for Mr. Putin to come to the negotiating table. The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky will be their third in the Oval Office and the sixth overall this year, highlighting Mr. Zelensky’s persistent efforts to win Mr. Trump’s backing even after a disastrous meeting in late February in which Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance castigated him for not showing the United States enough gratitude. “There is now a very strong momentum for peace in the world — following the agreements reached in the Middle East,” the Ukrainian president said this week. Mr. Zelensky has been trying to steer Mr. Trump toward his nation’s preferred strategy to end the war : fewer talks and more weapons deliveries to strike Russia and force it to negotiate in earnest. In recent days, Mr. Zelensky has pressed the Trump administration for the American-made Tomahawk cruise missiles that would bolster Ukraine’s ability to conduct long-range strikes inside Russia. Ukraine is betting that such attacks, targeting economic assets like oil facilities, would raise the cost of the war for Russia and eventually push it toward a settlement. On Wednesday, Mr. Zelensky described the strikes as “our long-range Ukrainian sanctions capabilities,” comparing them to sanctions on Russia’s prosperous oil industry, a critical source of funding for the Kremlin’s war effort. He also wants to secure more air defenses to shield Ukraine’s skies from Russian attacks, which in recent weeks have severely damaged the Ukrainian power grid. But after his call on Thursday with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump seemed to emphasize the risks of providing Tomahawks to Ukraine. “It’s a vicious, offensive, incredibly destructive weapon,” Mr. Trump said, acknowledging that he had discussed the issue with Mr. Putin. “Nobody wants Tomahawks shot at them.” The Kremlin has warned Washington against selling the weapons, saying it would be a serious escalation in the war. Even if Mr. Trump agrees to more arms sales, experts warn that Ukraine would need a lot of Tomahawks, whose range exceeds 1,000 miles, to make a difference. With the most recent versions of the missiles costing roughly $2.5 million each, it would be a challenge to find the money to buy them. Ukraine hopes to rely on a new NATO-procurement system using European money to buy American weapons. Some $2 billion worth of weapons have been secured this way, and 10 more European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization signed up to join the plan this week. A high-level Ukrainian delegation was in Washington earlier this week to lay the groundwork before Mr. Zelensky’s visit. Its members met with executives from Raytheon, the American manufacturer of Tomahawk missiles, as well as with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. lawmakers. Mr. Zelensky arrived in Washington on Thursday and also met with representatives from Raytheon.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/world/europe/zelensky-trump-meeting-white-house-ukraine-war.html,politics,BBC,By Constant Méheut and Zolan Kanno-Youngs,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17int-trump-zelensky-setup-tkwv/17int-trump-zelensky-setup-tkwv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:03:57+00:00,54c3f6c371603684d6c20ce5c579aad806ce5c22

The wife of another survivor of Hamas captivity, Elkana Bohbot, said in a video statement that he had returned with severe stomach pain because his captors had tried to fatten him up before his release, after months of receiving hardly any food. And the friends of one released hostage, Yosef-Chaim Ohana, told Israeli television on Thursday that he had been so cut off from the world for the past two years that he had not heard of ChatGPT. When Hamas returned the last 20 living hostages it was holding to Israel on Monday, their families, like many Israelis, waited with trepidation to find out the condition of the captives who had been kept largely incommunicado with little food and sometimes shackled. In many cases, they were held in dank, dark tunnels deep under Gaza. They had all been seized, along with scores of others, during the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that set off the devastating two-year war in the Palestinian enclave.

But Save the Microbes, Too.","endangered species, conservation of resources, climate change;global warming, reef, coral, bacteria, fungus, international union for conservation of nature","Hundreds of scientists have joined together to save a group of species from extinction, a group that might not seem like it needs saving: microbes. Microbes need protection for many reasons, researchers say, including the fact that other species — indeed, entire ecosystems — depend on their well-being. “We need them in order to help conserve the pandas and the rainforests and the whales and the oceans and everything else in between,” said Jack Gilbert, a microbiologist at the University of California, San Diego. We are living through an extinction crisis , but nearly all of the extinctions conservation biologists have definitively documented so far have involved animals or plants. On Friday , the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which publishes a list of endangered and vulnerable species, announced the newest additions, including the slender-billed curlew , a migratory shorebird and an ebonylike tree called Diospyros angulata . Humans are driving these species to extinction by hunting them, destroying wetlands and other habitats, cutting down forests, and heating the planet. But as powerful as these pressures are, extinction is not inevitable. On Friday, the I.U.C.N. also announced that the green sea turtle had rebounded, thanks to measures such as protecting the eggs the animals lay on beaches. The organization has officially changed the status of the species from endangered to least concern. But animals and plants represent only a fraction of the biological diversity on the planet. Fungi — which are a separate lineage from animals and plants — include millions , or perhaps even tens of millions , of species. But I.U.C.N. scientists started assessing their status only a decade ago, and so far they’ve evaluated just 1,300 species. That’s enough species to reveal that fungi are also gravely threatened. One-third of those 1,300 species are at risk of extinction . Now I.U.C.N. researchers are casting an even wider net: They’re setting out to protect the world’s diversity of bacteria and other microbes. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

So in January, when Mr. Zelensky’s wife wanted a new look for her husband, and her office reached out to Mr. Anisimov, he had a familiar thought. Suits. It didn’t matter to him that Mr. Zelensky had repeatedly said he would not wear a suit until the war with Russia was over, and that he had worn only military garb in solidarity with his troops. Nor did it matter that the designer knew Mr. Zelensky did not care about clothing. “He dressed for comfort,” Mr. Anisimov said in an interview in his workshop, surrounded by clothing racks. But, he added, “they thought he might listen to me.” Mr. Anisimov, 61, never expected to end up in the fashion world. He had planned to be a military man for the Soviet Union.

Though the authorities have since technically lifted the blackout, internet activists, tech entrepreneurs and rights monitors say that a wartime chokehold on the web remains, leaving many Iranians still in the dark. Digital rights experts say that internet speeds have been slowed, online traffic has been curtailed and geolocation positioning services, or GPS, is jammed. The use of satellite internet tools like Starlink, which could allow users to bypass such blocks, has been criminalized. The partial shutdown has left Iranians struggling to communicate with one another and the outside world. Compounding Iran’s international isolation, the United Nations recently reimposed sanctions on its nuclear program. The internet restrictions have had profound implications for ordinary Iranians. Since the war, simple tasks like finding directions, ordering a taxi or paying for groceries online have become an hourslong saga. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

536b93642fc9,Dispute Over Indiana College Newspaper Draws Censorship Accusations,"indiana university, indiana daily student, college, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, newspaper, bloomington, mass media","Newsstands for The Indiana Daily Student stood empty across Indiana University’s Bloomington campus on Thursday, after a dispute that has left student journalists and press advocates accusing the university of censorship. This week, administrators fired the Media School’s director of student media, who advised the newspaper. The director, Jim Rodenbush, said he had “no doubt” he was dismissed because he refused to order the students to stop publishing news, as he said the university had demanded. The next day, Wednesday, the university barred the students from putting out a planned print edition of the newspaper and directed them to publish online only going forward. “If it starts with us and we can’t fight back,” said Mia Hilkowitz, 21, a senior and a co-editor in chief of The Indiana Daily Student, “what happens to our colleagues and others in the media, not only at I.U. but at other universities across the country?” The order by the university to stop print publication is a culmination of weeks of turmoil over the student newspaper. The university has said the changes are about shifting resources from print to digital media, a move that would address the newspaper’s “longstanding” financial deficit, and not about controlling what the students publish. The Indiana Daily Student receives some funding from the university. The university’s chancellor, David Reingold, said in a statement on Wednesday that it was “firmly committed to the free expression and editorial independence of student media.” “The university has not and will not interfere with their editorial judgment,” he said. Ms. Hilkowitz and her co-editor in chief, Andrew Miller, also 21, said the description of the university’s decision as a business matter made no sense. “The media school tries to construe this as a business decision, but fundamentally they are trying to tell us what we can and cannot print,” Mr. Miller said. The Indiana Daily Student, which in recent years published weekly, was cut last year to about seven editions a semester that were tied to events, such as homecoming, and would contain special guides to the events that were also produced by the students. The student journalists continued to publish news coverage for those seven editions, with the special guides as inserts. They also continued to publish news articles and editorials online . Mr. Rodenbush, who had served as the Media School’s director of student media since 2018, said in an interview that in a series of meetings with administrators, he had been repeatedly pressured to tell the student journalists to stop printing news content, and that he had been fired after he refused. The student media director is responsible for the business operations of the student outlet, which has published for 158 years. Mr. Rodenbush said he began hearing in August that the provost of the university was unhappy that there were still newspapers on newsstands around campus, and instead wanted only the special guides to be produced. More meetings followed, he said, where the university again expressed the directive. Mr. Rodenbush told the students about the school’s wishes, he said, but left it to them to decide what to do because he saw his role as that of an adviser. “I wouldn’t participate in the censorship of the paper,” he said. Mr. Rodenbush was fired on Tuesday by the dean of the Media School, who said in a letter that the firing was due to a “lack of leadership and inability to work in alignment with the university’s direction for the Student Media Plan.” A copy of the letter was reviewed by The New York Times. An Indiana University spokesman declined to make the dean of the Media School or university chancellors available for an interview and pointed instead to previous statements released by officials. “To be clear, the campus’s decision concerns the medium of distribution, not editorial content,” Chancellor Reingold said in the statement released on Wednesday. The spokesman said the university did not comment on individual personnel matters. There has been a swift backlash to the university’s decision. In a letter sent to the Media School dean, David Tolchinsky, the university’s Student Publications Alumni Association Board expressed “deep concern” over reports that the university had sought to censor coverage. Any effort to “dictate coverage — and any retribution in the form of stopping publication — is a violation not only of the norms of free press that underpin democratic society, but of I.U.’s own agreements with generations of student journalists, including the current editors,” the board said in the letter. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech advocacy group, said in a social media post on Wednesday that the firing of Mr. Rodenbush showed “disregard for student journalists.” The foundation had previously placed the university in the bottom three in a ranking of free speech on 257 college campuses based on student surveys. Mr. Rodenbush described his firing as retaliation. He added that the bigger issue was making sure that freedom of the press and journalism on college campuses was still being valued and recognized. “The university and the Media School should be proud of these students,” he said. “They are taking what they’ve learned in their journalism education and they are applying it to a real-world setting. They understand the meaning of journalism and student media and how that fits into the world and they’re defending it.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/business/media/indiana-university-daily-student-newspaper.html,Business,BBC,By Katie Robertson and Jon Cherry,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/INDIANA-PRESS-01-whmv/INDIANA-PRESS-01-whmv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:04:04.801000+00:00,ed514baf900908b7b4d0b34ca4012cebddaf2b8d

But the bull market in the S&P 500 survived the severe downturn set off by President Trump’s tariffs, along with countless other setbacks. Consider how far the bull market has come since its unheralded birth a little over three years ago during the Biden administration. The S&P 500 at that point had fallen more than 25 percent amid soaring pandemic-era inflation and rising interest rates. But on Oct. 12, 2022, the U.S. stock market turned. From that date through Oct. 8 of this year, the S&P 500 stock index gained nearly 88 percent. Including dividends, according to FactSet, a financial data firm, investments in low-cost S&P 500 index funds returned more than 97 percent. That means that investors in low-cost, market-tracking index funds were able to nearly double their money since the bull market’s start. But when the bull market was born, almost nobody noticed. “There’s a saying on Wall Street that there’s always a bull market somewhere,” CNN said on Oct. 31, 2022, but, it added, wherever the bull might have gone, it certainly wasn’t in the United States. “The broader market is undeniably struggling this year,” CNN said. I missed that boat, too. On Oct. 21, 2022, I wrote a column , “Investing in the Shadow of a Recession,” with this summary: “Recessions come in many varieties. Any would bring pain, but if history is a guide, stocks and bonds are likely to rise eventually.” I was focused on a possible recession — which didn’t happen — and failed to see that a bull market had already begun. Obviously, I didn’t know where either the economy or the market was going. But at least I knew that I didn’t know. Because stocks tend to rise over many decades, I believed then, as I do now, that it makes sense to keep investing in them for the long term, regardless.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/business/bull-market-trump-biden.html,Business,BBC,By Jeff Sommer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/business/19strategies-illo/19strategies-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:02:31.638000+00:00,2d7603d466002df9202d49f264761b8fd7d2b8ce

Chatbots,"artificial intelligence, social media, instant messaging, mobile apps, computers and the internet, tech industry, teens, children, youth, facebook, instagram, meta, mark e zuckerberg","Instagram on Friday unveiled safety features for teenagers who use its artificial intelligence chatbots amid growing concerns over how the chatbots are affecting young people’s mental health. The features, which will be rolled out early next year, would give parents more control over how teenagers use Instagram’s “A.I. characters,” which have fictional personalities that users can message with as they would other human accounts. Parents would be able to block their children from having conversations with certain A.I. characters, and Instagram would send them summaries of their children’s chats, the company said. Instagram would also limit chatbot conversations on topics like self-harm, eating disorders and romance, while allowing “age-appropriate topics” like education, sports and hobbies. “We hope today’s updates bring parents some peace of mind that their teens can make the most of all the benefits A.I. offers, with the right guardrails and oversight in place,” the company said in a blog post. The post was signed by Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, and Alexandr Wang, the chief A.I. officer of Meta, which owns Instagram. A.I. chatbots, which can generate responses in chats in seemingly humanlike ways, have been under scrutiny for how they affect teens who spend hours a day confiding in them. They have been blamed for driving some children to suicide and sending some adults into delusional spirals . Meta is not the only company contending with how to make its chatbots safer. Last month, OpenAI, the A.I. start-up behind ChatGPT, announced new teen safety features such as parental controls. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Eleven buildings, nearly identical, look like bland, oversize backyard sheds. Several large R.V.s are parked nearby. Not long ago, cows grazed here. But as the sun sets on a clear day, the buildings groan and creak as the roof of each shed rolls back, like the sliding lid on a wooden box. Revealed within the sheds are hundreds of telescopes, which intermittently twitch and pirouette, a robot army awakening. Their owners are nowhere to be seen. This is Starfront Observatories. If you want to explore the universe but do not want to go outside, this might be the place for you. In an age of digital cameras and state-of-the-art internet, amateur astronomy can now be a remote-controlled hobby, and a far more sophisticated one. Today’s telescopes provide much more than a magnified view of the night sky. For many practitioners, the name of the game is astrophotography — taking exquisite, long-exposure photographs of objects too dim to be seen with the naked eye. “It’s the most efficient way for astronomy to be done,” said Dustin Gibson, one of the company’s founders.

Those a little bigger were placed in a bed in a packed room for feeding with therapeutic peanut paste. The ones with rashes, fevers and deep, hacking coughs — potential diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, maybe cholera — were tucked into bare isolation rooms. It wasn’t like this even six months ago. Here in Baidoa, a city in southern Somalia, community health workers used to go door to door looking for children who were too thin or sick. Care was swift, and free, at rudimentary clinics set up in camps and neighborhoods. Families received parcels of special foods packed with nutrients. As a result, it was rare for children to deteriorate to the point they needed to be transported to a center for 24-hour care. But the community health clinics, and emergency food, were paid for by the United States, through its Agency for International Development. When the Trump administration dismantled the agency and ended vast swaths of foreign assistance to the world’s poorest countries, much of the food aid and health care for children across Somalia were abruptly cut off.

Though it involves a real institution and real matters of serious debate, reality was not the main goal when choosing the characters’ wardrobes, Ms. Piersanti said. “It’s more about vision and creating something that’s true to my vision and a bit iconic,” she said. “I’m scared sometimes of being too real and flattening things out.” That meant avoiding elbow-patched corduroy blazers and other staples signifying academia in the wardrobe for Alma (Julia Roberts), a philosophy professor striving for tenure, who finds herself caught in the middle after Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), a wealthy doctoral student, accuses Hank (Andrew Garfield), Alma’s fellow professor, of assault.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/style/after-the-hunt-puma-osmosis-sneakers.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Yola Mzizi,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17FASHION-CHATTER-HUNT-01-cvwb/17FASHION-CHATTER-HUNT-01-cvwb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:03:23.993000+00:00,2fe0a53835a98814c795406267737a36e3612794

Karma, says Anwar Congo, the murderous subject of Joshua Oppenheimer’s documentary “The Act of Killing,” is what you might call punishment from God. In the distance, lightning splinters through the sky. “Imagine, in all this darkness, it’s like we’re living at the end of the world,” he says. “We look around … There’s only darkness.” What Congo really sees, perhaps, is himself. For October’s column, you won’t find traditional works of horror, but instead films that examine those things that are realer and all the more chilling: the terrors of humanity and the grave things that we are capable of doing. One of the most enduringly vital works of the century, Oppenheimer’s 2013 documentary is a harrowing masterwork (furthered strengthened in this extended cut) not only as an essential document of historical atrocities, but also as a portrait of the knotty psychology of power and our human capacity for cruelty.

See new episodes in the series on Fridays. You can also watch our collection of more than 150 videos on YouTube and subscribe to our YouTube channel . Jennifer Lopez pulls off some dazzling footwork in this scene from the musical drama “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” the latest adaptation of the work, this time by the screenwriter and director Bill Condon. The film is set partly in 1983 Argentina and tells the story of Luis Molina ( Tonatiuh ), who is incarcerated and shares a cell with Valentín Arregui (Diego Luna). Luis has a passion for a Rita Hayworth-style movie star, Ingrid Luna ( Jennifer Lopez ) and, to pass the time, tells Valentín the narrative of one Ingrid’s movies, “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” This scene is set in the movie within the movie, and has Diego Luna and Tonatiuh playing characters alongside Lopez. In the sequence, Ingrid’s character dances with a mobster played by Tony Dovolani. In the sequence, Lopez pulls off some high-energy choreography, including a moment when she is spun on the ground while holding a glass of champagne. “When we were building the number,” Condon said in his narration, “Jennifer’s credo here was, ‘Don’t make it easy on me. I want to do things that are difficult.’” So, he continued, when it came to the impressive movies she pulls off in this scene, “that was all at her instigation.” Read the “Kiss of the Spider Woman” review.

He Kept Making Movies.,"movies, political prisoner, iran, jafar panahi, it was just an accident, personal profile;people story","The Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi has been imprisoned twice for making movies about his home country. It has yet to stop him. In 2010, he was sentenced to six years in prison for “propaganda against the state.” He was released after three months. In 2022, he was arrested again and served seven months, an incarceration that involved hours of blindfolded interrogation. Panahi translated the experience into the Palme d’Or winner “It Was Just an Accident.” Due in theaters on Wednesday, the film examines the effects of torture on both victim and perpetrator. Lesser men might have been cowed into submission by those experiences. For Panahi, now 65, they were invigorating. “The reality is I don’t know anything else other than cinema, so I prepare myself for everything, and I accept all costs,” he said. Panahi wasn’t thinking about filmmaking when he was last in jail. He was held in a very public ward, among 300 prisoners, some 30 to 40 of them there for political reasons. He said he spent most of his time listening to the fellow inmates’ life stories. “When I got out of jail, I turned around and looked at the gate, and I remembered all those faces,” Panahi said through a translator during an interview at the Telluride Film Festival in August. He added that months later, “these faces started becoming more real and marched in my head. I felt that I owed them something.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/movies/it-was-just-an-accident-jafar-panahi.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Nicole Sperling,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15cul-jafar-panahi-wklv/15cul-jafar-panahi-wklv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:02:45.088000+00:00,22ca11f4e293f5c28e7fb3e024cbb614efbbb32d

From our review: Del Toro has always had an eye for the ways beauty and brutality weave themselves together in human life, and “Frankenstein” is an ideal text for that interest. But the movie also spotlights something he understands intuitively: the difference between the destruction of life … and the heartbroken and lovely form that life can take at its end. In theaters now. Streaming on Netflix on Nov. 7 . Read the full review . Ethan Hawke as a malevolent force … In this horror sequel directed by Scott Derrickson, a brother and sister (Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw) discover they are not yet free of the Grabber (Ethan Hawke), who terrorizes them from beyond the grave. From our review: Derrickson has crafted a sequel that is remarkably different from the original — up in the frosty mountains, this is more of an ax-murderer ghost chase than a trip to a serial killer’s horrific basement — and with that comes a ratcheting up of grisly theatrics. In theaters. Read the full review . Hawke portrays the celebrated lyricist Lorenz Hart, who wrote classics like “My Funny Valentine” (with Richard Rodgers), in this Richard Linklater biopic. It captures a pivotal moment in Hart’s life, career and battle with alcoholism. From our review: The whole film is pretty much nonstop Hart chatter, as he throws off witticisms and barbs and compliments — some tender, some terribly insincere — and Hawke does it all with aplomb, in a terrible comb-over, and you love him. In theaters. Read the full review . This year’s Palme d’Or winner defies easy categorization. The Iranian writer-director Jafar Pahani draws from his time imprisoned by his country’s regime and the experiences of other political prisoners for this tale of revenge rooted in reality. From our review: It’s a drama about retribution, a comedy about collective action (and action in general), a low-mileage road movie and a slow-boiling ethical thriller. It’s a cry from the heart, a comic howl in the dark and one of the year’s essential movies. In theaters. Read the full review . In this amusing caper by Kelly Reichardt, set in 1970 Massachusetts, Josh O’Connor plays an Everyman who tries his hand at art theft and fails spectacularly. From our review: In some classic heist films … the focus is on everything that it takes to pull off the job: the goals and logistics, the co-conspirators you can trust, the ones you definitely shouldn’t. Here, the robbery is more of a beginning in a low-key funny and sharp look at a character — as well as a larger world — in thrall to narcissistic self-interest. In theaters. Read the full review . A fleet-footed period piece. Ido Fluk directs this dramatization of the events surrounding a concert by the pianist Keith Jarrett. First focusing on the show’s promoter, Vera Brandes, the film introduces Jarrett midway, along with a journalist who breaks the fourth wall to spotlight Jarrett’s skills. From our review: Such breezy asides suggest a movie that’s a little too eager to be liked. But it’s also tough to resist, particularly as Brandes has to scramble as the clock ticks down to the concert and Jarrett’s preferred piano is not in place. In theaters. Read the full review . A tale of anti-Hitler youth, elevated by the acting. After seeing Nazis haul off his Jewish friend, a young man starts a resistance campaign with other teenagers in Matt Whitaker’s depiction of a true story from World War II Germany.

b9ee0a14000a,"In ‘The Perfect Neighbor,’ a Terrible Crime Collides With Ethical Concerns","documentaries, geeta gandbhir, susan louise lorincz, ajike owens, florida, murders and homicides","The new documentary “ The Perfect Neighbor ” (on Netflix ) couldn’t exist outside of a surveillance society. But that’s the world we live in. So, using mostly police body-cam footage, along with news imagery and videos from home security cameras and an interrogation room, the director Geeta Gandbhir reconstructs the story of the 2023 killing of 35-year-old Ajike Owens , a Florida woman who was shot by her neighbor, Susan Lorincz, then 58. Owens was Black. Lorincz is white. And after Lorincz’s arrest, sheriff’s deputies found evidence that she had researched Florida’s “stand your ground” statute, which allows residents to use deadly force if they feel threatened on their own property. It’s a heart-pounding documentary, because we know what happens to Owens from the beginning. For much of the movie, we’re watching the escalation. Owens’s children enjoy playing on property that did not belong to Lorincz but was next to her home. She complains for many months, calling the sheriff over and over again. Because the deputies are wearing body cameras, we get multiple views of their visits along with neighbors’ accounts, as well as Lorincz’s version, which often paints the events in a significantly different light. She represents herself as the victim of unruly and disrespectful children. Eventually, she shoots their mother when Owens goes to confront her. The point of “The Perfect Neighbor” is to show how devastating and manipulative the effects of “stand your ground” laws can be, giving cover to those whose motives might not, in fact, simply be self-defense. After Owens’s death, Gandbhir shows protesters mourning the loss and questioning law enforcement’s treatment of Lorincz compared with that of Black people in similar situations. And through interrogation-room footage, we listen in on Lorincz’s conversation with the authorities, which involves racial slurs and language clearly lifted from the “stand your ground” law as well as Lorincz’s insistence that trauma from her own childhood sexual abuse caused her to feel afraid. There’s no editorializing here, but we can see just how much of what she’s saying is actually true. (Lorincz was ultimately convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 25 years in prison.) Having all of this footage makes for an unusually thorough retelling of the crime. In a fiction film, a director often shoots a scene from different angles, with wide and close-up shots, and various characters in the foreground. Here the same effect is accomplished just from the many cameras around. That’s remarkable, especially in true crime, which leans so heavily on recreations, interviews and speculation. In “The Perfect Neighbor,” it’s just footage and eyewitness accounts — but we also become eyewitnesses. Yet “The Perfect Neighbor” does raise a few ethical issues that, while not precisely the fault of the film, should at least give the audience something to chew on beyond the cruelty of the events and the laws it aims to indict. One is a simple transparency issue: Gandbhir has revealed in interviews that her sister-in-law was best friends with Owens, a connection that probably should be disclosed in the documentary (and may have made for an even stronger film if revealed).

a7a65d9998f1,‘Good Fortune’ Review: Life Swap,"movies, aziz ansari, keanu reeves","More cute than hilarious, Aziz Ansari’s disarming first feature, “Good Fortune,” is, on its surface, a familiar role-reversal caper in the vein of John Landis’s 1983 comic marvel, “Trading Places. ” Yet Ansari, as we saw in his sharp and often poignant television show “ Master of None,” usually has more on his mind than jokes: Here, it’s a social injustice so shamefully recognizable that at times it’s difficult to laugh. Ansari plays Arj, a harried Los Angeles gig worker whose situation is so dire even his name sounds like a grunt of frustration. Arj longs to edit documentaries, but he’s trapped in a low-pay loop of food deliveries and menial, Taskrabbit-style jobs. Shifts at an emporium called Hardware Heaven — where a sign encourages shoppers to donate canned goods for the help — fill the rest of his time, if not his wallet. Then a random encounter with Jeff (Seth Rogen), a cheery venture capitalist, leads to a brief job as Jeff’s assistant before a fateful error causes him to be fired. Not only must Arj return to his miserable existence, he now has to compete with robots. Watching all this from a perch high above the city is Gabriel (Keanu Reeves), a minor angel who yearns for more meaningful assignments than stopping people from texting while driving. With his shabby trench coat and woeful expression, Gabriel recalls the weary celestial hero of “ Wings of Desire” (1987) , but there the similarity ends. A hopeful innocent, Gabriel thinks Arj and Jeff each have something to learn from the other, and so he swaps them, believing that Arj will discover that money can’t buy happiness. You can see Gabriel’s mistake. As can his irritated boss, Martha (Sandra Oh), who demotes Gabriel to human form — a move that allows Reeves to cut loose and the film to lighten up. Gabriel’s enthusiastic embrace of simple pleasures like chicken nuggets and cigarettes is endearing and funny, as is a running joke about his irrefutable hotness. At the same time, Gabriel’s remaining assignment — like the movie’s — is to make Arj voluntarily reverse the swap. Short of afflicting him with brain damage, that seems a tall order.

6b428ba80b48,"On ‘Abbott Elementary,’ Tyler James Williams Shows His Work","tv, abbott elementary, tyler james williams, abc","“Young guys see themselves in him, flaws and all,” she said. “He’s not afraid to still be funny or less than perfect.” Williams is happy to model a more expansive vision of Black masculinity. Being a role model, that’s a weight, too, but he doesn’t mind. “It’s one of the best weights I’ve ever been able to carry,” he said. “Part of what I search for is freedom and liberation from those standards that feel unrealistic to some.” As a director, Williams is also trying to model how a show that includes children can serve those children. (He directed the science fair episode last season and is gearing up for one that he describes as “equally if not more chaotic.”) Randall Einhorn, a veteran director on the series, noticed how Williams spoke to the young cast members. “He wasn’t talking down to anybody,” Einhorn said. “He’s respectful of those young kids, and he tries to speak their language.” He knows to speak firmly and kindly, to encourage children to do their best without forcing them beyond their comfort or capabilities. “You just want to rally them,” Williams said, “not intimidate or put pressure on them.” Over a couple of hours in the park, Williams snapped pictures of a giant bug, a few trees, a lone pigeon that had separated from the flock and perched on the head of a statue of Eleanor Roosevelt. Behind the lens, he didn’t have to perform for anyone else or meet anyone’s expectations.

7337ffd2a51e,"A Soprano’s Decade at the Met, Capped With a Thrilling High Note","opera, metropolitan opera, nadine sierra, la sonnambula","When Nadine Sierra let out a high F at the end of Bellini’s “La Sonnambula” last week at the Metropolitan Opera, you could sense a bit of her personality in the sweet-hearted sleepwalker she was playing onstage. It was three hours into the opening night of a new production of “La Sonnambula,” a fizzy bel canto opera with a silly plot but sensational writing for its lead soprano role, Amina, and Sierra had the audience on her side. Fans cheered her every aria, and, riding the euphoria that permeated the house, she sang the final high note with carefree joy and assured triumph. It was hard to tell where Amina’s happiness ended and Sierra’s began. “There was a lot of myself happening on that stage,” Sierra, 37, said in an interview. “I couldn’t help it. The majority of my career is in Europe, and to come back home to New York, I feel like I can be my truest self. And in that moment I felt a lot of gratitude: that I could sing a role that is so hard, but in a setting that allows me to feel at home.” The Met has also become a home of sorts for Sierra. “La Sonnambula” comes almost exactly 10 years after her house debut, as Gilda in Verdi’s “Rigoletto.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/arts/music/nadine-sierra-soprano.html,Culture,BBC,By Joshua Barone,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/arts/17cul-nadine-promo-still/17cul-nadine-promo-still-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:03:38.947000+00:00,0c8d8cdee610ed7a0943c05a4c8f330b3a8aaf9c
e848e1be3121,Nightmares So Charming You’ll Want to Bring a Friend,computer and video games,"An irascible clerical worker with spidery limbs. Forlorn laborers at a carnival who turn one of their own into a piñata. A towering baby with a searchlight for an eye. These are a sampling of the sights in the tastefully morbid Little Nightmares III, a game that forgoes run-of-the-mill jump scares, excessive gore and the other emblems of outright horror for the series’s trademark atmospheric creepiness. The first Little Nightmares (2017) struck me as one of the best side-scrolling adventure games to hit the market since the genre was reinvigorated by Limbo (2010), which combined the aesthetics of silent film with the endangered-child theme of a European fairy tale. Little Nightmares told the story of a girl named Six who traverses a resort filled with skin-care-lacking grown-ups who’d like to nibble on her. In Little Nightmares II (2021), players took on the role of Mono, a young boy who, together with Six, tries to locate the source of a mysterious signal that keeps city inhabitants enraptured before their television sets. It closes with one of the more haunting endings of any game I’ve ever played. Little Nightmares III doesn’t quite hit the same high notes as its predecessor, a stranger and ultimately less predictable entry. Even so, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it twice: by myself, and with a friend. Certain sections require the use of the two main characters’ special abilities: Low can use his bow to shoot at buttons too high up for him to push, while Alone can use her wrench to smash through partially damaged walls. The game opens in inky darkness before a gilt-framed mirror swirls into view, revealing a room with a window. The scene then cuts to Low lying on the floor in a room that looks like a ship cabin; behind him stands a shattered mirror. Upon startling awake, he is approached by Alone, who gently offers him her hand. Together, they set out and soon emerge from the steel interior into a luminous, orange-hued desert — the graveyard of a dead civilization. This gorgeous, unexpected transition is a callback to the opening of the first game, which saw Six emerge from what appeared to be a ship into an incongruous space absent of water. The two will journey from the desert to a candy factory, carnival and asylum. Gameplay is divided among light puzzles, chase sequences and brief combat encounters. My friend and I did run into a couple of frustrating sequences where a running jump was required and we watched our feet bounce off the edge of an object. But those moments were exceedingly rare. The puzzles are clever and legible. Combat sequences are short. Thank goodness for a horror game that privileges flow over grindy challenges . Coralie Feniello, the global producer on Little Nightmares III, which was developed by Supermassive Games, emphasized the game’s “charming horror” that juxtaposes the cuteness of children with a disturbing world. It visually employs a lot of round shapes to tease out this cuteness, she said, before developers break it at certain points to create disturbing tension. The studio’s overarching strategy was to think about the setting for a puzzle first. “You really want to have the aesthetic serving the gameplay, not the reverse,” she said. Two small moments perfectly capture what I enjoyed about Little Nightmares III’s approach to collaborative puzzle solving and environmental design. In one room, the children come upon a puppet that is chained to a pipe. Low can use his arrow to shoot the puppet’s head off, and then Alone can use her wrench to smash its skull to reveal a key. This dynamic is later built upon for a memorable combat encounter. Elsewhere, when the children reach a candy factory, they must wade through a landfill full of discarded sweets. As they do so, the camera pulls back to reveal an ominous mechanical claw, dumping yet more candy onto the dunes of refuse. The droning sound effects suggest there is something very important about the contraption, but there isn’t. It’s not Chekhov’s claw. The scene exists purely for its atmospheric quality. Such moments go a long way to immersing players in a world that is not always clamoring for them to do something. Feniello said the development team internally referred to the game’s point of view as a “dollhouse camera” because players experience the world like gazing from a distance through a window. “Each room is kind of a portrait, like a painting,” Feniello said. “Each room says something about the world.” Little Nightmares III was reviewed on the PlayStation 5 Pro.

A sturdy kettle to make coffee for early-rising railway workers. A colorful cart of a paletero (ice cream vendor). A century-old lithograph of the patron saint of the Mexican people. These and other everyday objects and treasures will be on display in Chicago, as two museums celebrate the city’s Latino communities. “ Aquí en Chicago ” (“Here in Chicago”), a bilingual show that opens Oct. 25 and runs for over a year — through Nov. 8, 2026 — at the Chicago History Museum , will explore the cultural heritage and traditions of Latino people. The idea developed after area high school students on a social studies field trip protested the lack of representation of local Hispanic history. “We say that we are about sharing Chicago stories,” Elena Gonzales, the museum’s curator of civic engagement and social justice , said in a telephone interview, “but how can we do that if we’re leaving out a third of the city ?” The mandolin that is being played by the young girl at the right in the second row of musicians in the photograph above. Credit... via The Padilla Family “The exhibition is going to be about the lives of the people who built, worked to maintain and lived along the train tracks,” Cesáreo Moreno, the museum’s chief curator and visual arts director , said in a phone interview, “and how these people and families were able to create community and keep their culture alive.” (Admission to the museum is free.) One neighborhood the railway workers helped form is Pilsen, where prominent murals reflect its largely Mexican heritage. The area is also home to both the National Museum of Mexican Art and the Instituto Justice and Leadership Academy, whose student protests in 2019 led to the Chicago History Museum’s “ Aquí en Chicago ” exhibition. “There’s a long history that’s been overlooked,” said Lilia Fernández, professor of history at the University of Illinois Chicago and author of “ Brown in the Windy City: Mexicans and Puerto Ricans in Postwar Chicago .” “Latinos have been a very important part of the U.S. work force for decades. They have been in the Chicago area for well over a century. They came in significant numbers in the early 20th century, and in even greater numbers after World War II.” The first wave of Mexican immigrants arrived in the 1880s, primarily to work on the railways, driven by the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers. Other major spikes in Latino migration came during World War I, a time of labor shortages. But the largest recruitment initiative began during World War II, when many American men left to serve in the armed forces, Fernández said in a phone interview. The Bracero Program (from the Spanish word for a laborer), which resulted from an agreement between the United States and Mexico, recruited Mexican workers to fill jobs in agriculture and on the railroads from 1942 to 1964. The 4,000-square-foot “ Aquí en Chicago ” will examine the city’s immigrant lives with more than 700 artworks, photographs, clothing, personal items, protest posters and music. Items include quinceañera gowns for the traditional 15th-birthday coming-of-age celebrations for young women and a collection of 265 tiny terra cotta models of local landmarks, businesses and homes made in response “to feelings of historic erasure and being under threat of displacement,” Gonzales said. The paletero’s cart that will be on display traveled some 100,000 miles over 35 years. “Anybody who’s been to Chicago knows that sound of the bells and the sight of the paletero or paletera, walking around the city, pushing the cart, selling frozen treats,” she said. Interactive features will include a digital communities’ scrapbook that invites visitors to upload personal photos and a listening station where they can hear Latin American Indigenous languages spoken in the Chicago area. Thematic sections will explore issues like the challenges of housing inequality and how wars, work and sanctuary have been the main drivers in Latino immigration to Chicago. Cecilia Beaven, a visual artist from Mexico City who is based in Chicago and is the show’s co-designer, said the first goal was to establish the mood through color. “I started by creating a palette that is used throughout the exhibition,” she said, inspired by colors used all over Latin America for millenniums. “They used colors coming from natural pigments, like seeds and flowers,” she said: blues from the añil flower, purples from the mollusk and reds from the cochineal insect. Beaven painted a series of character-based murals. One is a reflection on identity and what it means to be from Latin America; another is on resistance and public protests. “It’s about having a voice and advocating for ourselves as Latin Americans,” she said. About a third of the material on display will be on loan from the local community, and some items are accompanied by oral histories. Fernández, the historian, who served as an adviser to the museum, is sharing the old metal kettle that has been in her family since her grandfather found it and took it home in the 1950s, soon after he arrived from Mexico, when he briefly worked for the railroads. “I imagine the kettle had an earlier history, perhaps used by previous rail workers to make their coffee on cold mornings,” she said. Regardless of its origins, she added, “for me and my mother, it symbolizes the hard work that my grandfather did when he first came to Chicago and our family’s history of making this city our home.” Antonio Alcala, marketing manager for Alcala’s Western Wear , a family business started in 1972 by his grandfather, donated the company’s first pair of custom cowboy boots, a shirt and a family member’s silver belt buckle. Originally from Durango, Mexico, his grandfather worked in the fields and in odd factory jobs and sold items from the trunk of his car: anything that it took to provide for his 11 children, Mr. Alcala said, “that was better than what he had back home.” His grandfather eventually became a tailor and bought a store that sold Mexican-inspired and Western clothing. The items given to the museum, he said, symbolize his family’s legacy and commitment to hard work, as well as the determination and resilience of immigrants. “My grandfather and parents always said, ‘You can’t take anything with you, but you can leave behind how people see and remember you,’” Alcala said. The museum will continue to collect material and oral histories for its permanent collection, Gonzales said. “Weaving in the personal stories is how we connect to bigger stories.” More accounts of immigrant life emerge at the National Museum of Mexican Art. After moving to Chicago for jobs, “many railroad workers stayed and became part of the American dream,” said Alejandro Benavides, who curated “ Rieles y Raíces ” with Ismael Cuevas. “They were able to maintain their culture, their language and their faith because they lived together, many in boxcars alongside the tracks.” Benavides and Cuevas developed an interest in the topic independently. Benavides lived near a former boxcar camp in Aurora, Ill., and wrote “ Olivia ,” a fictional account of a young Mexican American girl who lived there. Cuevas began researching rail history at Amtrak, where he worked recently. Photographs, paintings, linoleum cuts, works on paper, documents, census records and maps of railroad routes and migration patterns are among the items that will be on display, many obtained through a community collection process . “How do we take that and shape it into a story?” Benavides said. “We want to make it family-friendly and visibly engaging.” Models of a train yard and boxcars are ways to do that, he added. Informing the research for the exhibits were archival documents and accounts in books like “ Mexican Labor in the United States ,” by Paul S. Taylor, Cuevas said. The author, he added, “literally was out in Chicago in the late 1920s interviewing people off the street.” Other highlights include a black-and-white photo featuring a young woman playing music in front of a boxcar and the mandolin she used. “That instrument was used to tell stories and to carry on the culture, the songs that working-class people sang at a celebration or after a hard day of work,” Moreno explained. Cuevas said, “We’re trying to find music of the era so that the visitor can listen to how it would have sounded 100 years ago.” Another photo depicts a small chapel built inside a boxcar. In the background is an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, protector of the Mexican people. The original lithograph will be on display. Among the jobs that women held were janitor, engine wiper, even forklift operator. “Women were not only staying at home in the boxcars caring for the family; some actually put on overalls and went out to the yards and worked alongside the men,” Moreno said. “It makes you respect the determination and the hardship and what was required.” The Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago reflects its largely Mexican heritage. It includes elaborate, colorful murals, like this one by Greg Gunter. Credit...

489029533efe,"At the Detroit Institute of Arts, an Attempt to Make Connections","native americans, art, museum, indigenous peoples, detroit institute of arts, great lakes, michigan","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. How do contemporary Anishinaabe artists explore their roots and their future, and speak today with one another? The answers to these questions are the subject of an exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts of close to 100 works — primarily contemporary — by 62 Anishinaabe artists from 21 tribes from Michigan and the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. The Anishinaabe, according to the Canadian Encyclopedia, are “a group of culturally and linguistically related First Nations,” who live “from the Ottawa River Valley west across northern Ontario to the plains of Saskatchewan south to the northeast corner of North Dakota, northern Minnesota and Michigan, as well as the northern shores of Lakes Ontario and Erie.” The population, estimated at 320,000 to 330,000 across North America, includes the Ojibwe (including Saulteaux and Oji-Cree , also known as Chippewa), Odawa (also known as Ottawa), Bodewadmi (also known as Potawatomi ), Mississaugas , Nipissing and Algonquin peoples, according to Kevin Leonard, the director of the Native American Institute at Michigan State University. The goal of the exhibition, “Contemporary Anishinaabe Art: A Continuation,” is to highlight “how contemporary artists connect with Anishinaabe ancestors, teachings, communities, values, stories, future generations and each other,” according to the exhibition’s wall text. “Diverging from the belief that Native American Art belongs only in certain places and spaces, and rejecting the narrative that Native American art is solely craft, not fine art, this exhibition challenges perceptions about what Native American art can be, how it should be seen and how it can be interpreted,” the catalog reads. “By including works by artists who continue many long-established practices and mediums while engaging with current themes, as well as artists who work with a variety of other materials, the exhibition presents a more expansive view of Native American art.” The work in the exhibition — which includes beadwork, birch bark artistry, clothing, film, photography, graphic design, jewelry, painting, pottery, sculpture and woodwork — is primarily by contemporary artists. There are also several marble sculptures by Mary Edmonia Lewis, an artist of both Anishinaabe and African descent who lived from approximately 1844 until 1907. They include an 1871 bust of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, as well as an 1868 bust of Minnehaha, a Native American character in Longfellow’s 1855 epic poem ‘The Song of Hiawatha.” The exhibition begins with “Totemic Columns” by George Morrison (1919-2000). Designed in 1995 but fabricated after Morrison’s death, it features rectangular, totemic prisms that are not meant to tell “a story through animal and human images,” according to explanatory text by Morrison displayed near the work, “but (make) an abstract version of structural and organic vertical form.” Also on display is Jim Denomie’s 2016 “Untitled (Totem Painting),” created in honor of Morrison. It features a self-portrait of the artist and three rabbit figures, which represent a guardian, a trickster and Denomie’s alter ego. Robin Waynee, 54, a member of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, created the 2023 “Warclubs” white gold, diamond and Tahitian pearl earrings. According to wall text quoting the artist, “warclubs have been used by Indigenous warriors for centuries, symbolizing strength and bravery. These earrings can remind wearers of the fierce spirit of those who came before them. Strength comes in many forms, and wearing these earrings can be both powerful and beautiful. Reimagining a weapon as adornment transforms it into a symbol of empowerment.” “Cradle of All Colors” is a 2019 work by Pat Kruse, 54, a member of the Ojibwe Tribe. Made of dyed porcupine quills on birch bark, imitation sinew, red willow, sweetgrass and birchwood, it was inspired by an 1860s birch bark quill cradle. Its bold colors “represent diversity,” the artist said, according to explanatory text. “While cultures vary, the desire for a bright future unites us,” it reads. “The design blends old and contemporary Ojibwe floral patterns.” It continues, “This piece honors heritage, diversity and shared dreams of generations to come.” Two works grew out of artists’ experiences with disease: “Fever Visions I,” a 2023 photographic print, is part of an infrared photography series, born out of a transformative illness, by Cressandra Thibodeaux, a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. “During a period of intense fevers, I experienced vivid hallucinations that profoundly altered my perception of reality. This series reflects my desire to explore altered states of consciousness through vibrant color, ethereal light and distorted form,” she said, according to the accompanying text. “On Loving,” a work composed of vinyl, beads, thread and zippers in 2022-23 by Maggie Thompson, a member of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, refers to the collective loss and grief of the Covid-19 pandemic, “with star quilts paying homage to the Indigenous communities that were impacted at higher rates. During the last week, I put out a call to the community and on social media to help finish the beadwork in time for a deadline. People just started showing up. Many connections were made. This brought a whole new meaning to the work,” Thompson explained, according to exhibition materials. One unexpected work is a 1989 painting by the Ojibwe artist Norval Morrisseau, “Punk Rockers Nancy and Andy,” who are dressed in bright green jackets, their black hair flying. According to the museum, Morrisseau (1932-2007) “defied expectations about what Native American art should look like and be about.” “In this work,” according to text in the exhibition, “he chose to paint people he may have met out and about in the city, challenging the expectation that Native American artists should depict Native American themes.” The exhibition, which is the first major Native American art show at the Detroit Institute of Arts in more than 30 years, is the creation of Denene De Quintal, the museum’s curator of Native American art who was hired in 2019. Before her appointment, no one had held a similar curatorial role for more than a decade. In a phone interview, De Quintal said she chose the exhibition’s theme “to build connections between the D.I.A. and Anishinaabe communities, especially because all of the federally recognized tribes in Michigan are Anishinaabe.” The exhibition’s wall décor — much of it royal blue, some featuring abstract designs of waves, woodland flowers and starry skies — is by Eva Oldman, a tribal citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Native Americans in Michigan. Salvador Salort-Pons, the director, president and chief executive of the museum, stressed the exhibition’s educational aspects. The museum brings in more than 75,000 local students annually in kindergarten through grade 12, including fifth-grade students who focus on the D.I.A.’s Native American galleries because of a Michigan state learning requirement. Native Americans who present tribal identification receive free general admission to the museum and exhibition, which will be on display through April 5.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/arts/design/detroit-institute-arts-native-americans.html,Culture,BBC,By Jane L.

f118fc399260,Bringing the Portland Art Museum Back to Life,"portland art museum, art, museum, philanthropy, mark rothko, portland oregon","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. How does a museum come back from the brink? That question may have been on the mind of Brian Ferriso in 2006, when he took on the job of director of the Portland Art Museum. On the way to his first week of work at the museum, Ferriso overheard a conversation during which someone tried to identify one of the museum’s buildings to a friend. Ferriso, who arrived after running the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Okla., recalled, “They said, ‘I think it’s a museum, but I don’t think anything happens there.’” At the time, the Portland museum had only three full-time curators and one working part-time. A little anonymous carping was nothing compared to the surprises to come. A couple of weeks into the job, Ferriso was informed that the museum would struggle to make payroll. The museum had around $20 million in debt, about half of which was because promised pledges had such long time horizons — up to 20 years away — that it was hurting the budget. The other half was unfunded, meaning that there was nothing coming in to plug the holes. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

But Not Fully, It Seems","art, museum, personal profile;people story, smithsonian american art museum, anna moses, washington dc","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. Anna Mary Robertson Moses, best known as Grandma Moses , began painting seriously only when she was close to 80, in the late 1930s, but the more than 1,500 canvases she churned out in her final two decades brim with childlike wonder and glee. Her most abiding works — bird’s-eye scenes of rolling farmland and wooded hills — are full of action: neighbors gathering to make apple butter or maple sugar, roof a barn or bring in the hay, their smiling, noseless faces dabbed on with a charming, kindergartenlike air. Tubby horses plow the fields as geese graze, loyal dogs stand at the ready and the harvest piles high. Born in upstate New York, Moses began working as a hired girl at the age of 12, and her 101-year life spanned the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and civil rights eras, but there’s no sign of servitude, hierarchy or strife in her complex compositions, where her subjects — almost exclusively white — labor side by side as equals, in community, with an air of clear purpose and belonging. She once told an interviewer, “What’s the use of painting a picture if it isn’t something nice?” Her approach was met with astounding popular and commercial success, thanks to mass media, commercial licensing and her strategic embrace of the “Grandma” persona. (By 1953, Hallmark had sold 48 million greeting cards featuring her paintings, Time magazine reported at the time.) Nevertheless, critical success eluded her. Her first big break — inclusion in a private group exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1939 — came from a wave of Modernist interest in the “primitive,” but the establishment soon came to deem her kitsch rather than avant-garde, largely dismissing her as self-taught, elderly, female — a naïve farm wife who had stumbled into the art world. In a coming exhibition, “ Grandma Moses: A Good Day’s Work ,” the Smithsonian American Art Museum hopes to correct that image, reframing her as a serious, workmanlike artist. “She became one of the most famous female artists of her time, self-taught or not,” said Leslie Umberger, one of the show’s curators , in a video interview. “Whether the art world liked her or not, she had more press and media attention than many artists of her day. So even if she had been pushed out of her contribution to the American art story a bit, she needed to be brought back into that story and represented in it.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

327cc2b632dd,Atlanta’s High Museum Charts the Mystical Art of Minnie Evans,"museum, art, minnie evans, high museum of art, atlanta","This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times. On a spring day in 1935, Minnie Evans was finishing up a grocery list when she had a vision. Evans, who was 42 at the time, tore off a piece of scrap paper and began drawing a flurry of images that formed in her mind: rainbowlike nested arches, serpentine creatures, concentric circles. “Something told me to draw or die,” she later recalled. “It was shown to me what I should do.” Over the next five decades, Evans created intricate drawings, paintings and collages that fused botanical forms, classical stories and biblical imagery. She developed a cult following in her hometown, Wilmington, N.C., where she worked for more than 20 years as a gatekeeper at Airlie Gardens, a 67-acre private estate-turned-public botanical garden. When the weather was good, she drew outside, hung her pictures on the gatehouse walls, and sold or gave them to admiring visitors after taking their tickets. This fall, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta presents “The Lost World: The Art of Minnie Evans,” a nationally touring retrospective that charts the artist’s evolution through around 100 works (it runs Nov. 14 to April 19). The exhibition is the culmination of a rising tide of interest in Evans and other female artists who cited mystical visions as a source of inspiration. At the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, 16 of Evans’s multimedia works are on view in “The Visionary Art of Minnie Evans” (through Oct. 26); her life is also explored in a new documentary produced and directed by Linda Royal. The film, “Minnie Evans: Draw or Die,” will premiere at Thalian Hall in Wilmington on Nov. 7 and will be available to stream next year. (In 2022, Evans appeared alongside artist-mediums like Georgiana Houghton and Agnes Pelton in “The Milk of Dreams,” the central exhibition of the Venice Biennale, and “Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art” at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.) Evans had a late-in-life brush with fame in the 1970s, when she became one of the first Black artists to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. But her work faded from public view in the decades after her death in 1987, at age 95. She has not been the subject of a major solo exhibition since the 1990s. “If you are in a marginalized position as a woman, Southern, self-taught, Black artist, the chance that your legacy is going to continue in an uninterrupted line is very low,” Katherine Jentleson, a senior curator of American art and curator of folk and self-taught art at the High Museum, said in a recent interview. In a full-circle moment, the High’s show will travel next summer to the Whitney, which also owns Evans’s post-grocery list drawing. (She titled it, auspiciously, “My Very First.”) Evans began experiencing visions as a child, but they intensified in middle age, when she felt compelled to translate them into art. She is best known for her symmetrical drawings of arching foliage and angelic figures, which have been likened to Buddhist mandalas. Lush and richly colored, they look as if they have blossomed from a seed planted at the center of the page. Wayne Evans, the artist’s great-grandson, recalled in an interview that Mama, as he and his cousins called her, was never far from an easel when he was growing up. Even when there were more than a dozen children “making all kinds of noise inside and out,” she could be “in a trance-like space,” humming and whispering as she filled in her images with Crayola crayons, her preferred medium. The establishment art world has long had an ambivalent relationship with artists who were not formally trained. Tastemakers were especially dismissive of women who said they were guided by visions, according to Jennifer Higgie, the author of “The Other Side: A Story of Women in Art and the Spirit World.” “For any postwar art historian, the word ‘spiritual’ was a dirty word,” Higgie said in a recent interview. “Art history was about formalist ideas.” Over the past decade, however, curators and critics have begun to recognize just how many gifted artists were excluded by that traditional narrative, as well as how inaccurate it was. “All artists are all channelers in a way — often they don’t understand what it is they are making,” Higgie said. In 2018, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York presented a revelatory exhibition of work by Hilma af Klint, the Swedish mystic painter born in 1862 who created dizzying abstract compositions before her male counterparts were credited with pioneering the style. It became the most popular show in the museum’s history. Jentleson, who is organizing the Evans exhibition at the High Museum, aims to make the case that just as af Klint deserves a place in the pantheon of great European painters, Minnie Evans “should be counted as one of the major American artists.” Perhaps even more ambitiously, Jentleson wants to change the way museums talk about self-taught artists as “closed vessels” of inspiration. She is seeking to present Evans as a three-dimensional person whose work reflects her life experience, family history and local environment. The blooms at Airlie, for example, often found their way into her work. And scholars have recently drawn a connection between Evans’s most frequent motif — a pair of eyes peering out of thick foliage — and her experience as a Black employee working for a wealthy white family, constantly surveilled and silently watching. (Before she became a gatekeeper, Evans was a domestic worker at the estate of Pembroke and Sarah Green Jones, which became Airlie Gardens.) For Jentleson, Evans’s visions were just one facet of her creative process — in addition to being an effective rhetorical device in a world that was unlikely to celebrate her inherent talent, artistic evolution or ambition. “If you are marginalized, explaining things through visions gives you a justification for what you are doing that you wouldn’t otherwise have,” Jentleson said. In a letter to Nina Howell Starr, a longtime supporter of Evans who curated her 1975 Whitney show, the artist seemed to recognize that a simple tale of divine inspiration would be safer than the more complicated, but possibly truer, version: that her work reflected her life and surroundings as well as her spiritual visions. “I think it would be better,” Evans wrote, “to have a short story that the public would take than to have a long story the public would not.” With this new exhibition, the public has an opportunity to hear the longer story.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/arts/design/high-museum-atlanta-minnie-evans.html,Culture,BBC,By Julia Halperin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19sp-finearts-highmuseum-06-lvhj/19sp-finearts-highmuseum-06-lvhj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:00:26.234000+00:00,09a572cde34b51c8f5b814cd3a078859c8182a27
0878615b4e25,The Supreme Court Is Looking Beyond the Trump Era,"amy coney barrett, supreme court;scotus, justice roberts, antonin scalia, donald trump, us constitution;united states constitution","new video loaded: The Supreme Court Is Looking Beyond the Trump Era transcript The Supreme Court Is Looking Beyond the Trump Era What do we expect from the Supreme Court and what can it actually do? On “Interesting Times,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Ross Douthat discuss how the court makes decisions, with an eye toward the future, rather than focusing on the moment we live in right now. We’re living through an era when it seems to a lot of observers that Congress is increasingly unwilling to or at least unexcited by the exercise of its own powers. Is that something that enters into judicial considerations when you’re thinking about the cases that you take, the scope of the rulings that you decide to make? Does the existing balance of power between the branches matter at all to jurisprudence? So there’s a lot in that question. I think maybe I’ll hit two points in response: I think at a broad level it’s important to say — and I think this is actually a disconnect between what observers of the court expect to see and what the court can actually do. I think the press and the public live in a particular moment. You’re either living in the Watergate years, or you’re living right now. And so you’re seeing everything through that lens. The court has to take a longer view. And so the content of doctrine cannot turn on just the precise political moment, because the doctrine we’re drawing on, the cases that have come before — and I’m not saying, this just isn’t anything to do with just being an originalist. The court decides cases, not just like in a “one ticket, this train only.” What we decide today is going to apply tomorrow. One point that I’ve made, I talk in the book a couple of times about decisions that John Marshall made, including in the trial of Aaron Burr. Those cases got cited within the last couple of years on more than one occasion. So what we decide now would be cited, seven, eight or nine presidents from now. We have to be very careful that the content of the doctrine isn’t fashioned just for the moment, because one reason that the Constitution has been able to survive is that it isn’t contingent only on a particular period. So that’s kind of at a broad level. But I do think there is a lot of discretion. You asked: Does it affect the scope of decisions? Yes, I think it can. I think those kinds of considerations — the court does have a little bit more room in that regard, in deciding the breadth of a decision. And whether to leave certain questions temporarily unanswered, maybe? That is not always possible. But yes, where it is possible, that is the kind of a thing where the court can decide, where it can, there is sometimes a range of discretion in deciding how broadly or narrowly to write a rule — or a rule should be. The Supreme Court Is Looking Beyond the Trump Era What do we expect from the Supreme Court and what can it actually do? On “Interesting Times,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Ross Douthat discuss how the court makes decisions, with an eye toward the future, rather than focusing on the moment we live in right now.

3701aae34556,Why Was Roe v. Wade Overturned?,"amy coney barrett, supreme court;scotus, justice roberts, antonin scalia, donald trump, us constitution;united states constitution","Obviously, one of the most controversial decisions that you’ve been involved in so far at the court is the Dobbs decision that overruled Roe v. Wade. The Constitution obviously doesn’t say anything about abortion. There’s no abortion provision in the Bill of Rights or anywhere else, right? Right. Does that just mean from an originalist perspective: Case closed, abortion is left to Congress or left to the states, and that’s all that needs to be said? No, because the Dobbs decision was interpreting the 14th Amendment’s due process clause — which says that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law — because, to the extent one might argue that there is a right to an abortion in the Constitution, it’s located in that clause. That’s where Roe found it. “No person shall be deprived of liberty” would be the relevant one there. And so the court’s — the line of cases is known as substantive due process — and so there are some things that the legislature can’t take away, be it Congress — and the 14th Amendment applies specifically to the states. Liberties, to be clear, that are not themselves enumerated. That are not constitutional enumerated. But yes, that word liberty does protect some content above and beyond things that are expressly stated in the Constitution. But you see the problem. I might think a lot of things are in liberty that you may not think are in liberty that one would disagree with. And there’s a lot of risk. And this has been a very contested area of constitutional law for a long time. There’s a lot of risk and making judges the final arbiters of exactly what the content of that word liberty is. So in an effort to reconcile this idea that if there are some things that are so deeply entrenched and so fundamentally a part of American society, that they go without saying, we don’t need to enumerate them, we don’t need to say them out loud, then those are the kinds of things where it’s just widely understood, so widely understood that we don’t have to put it in writing. We don’t have to commit it to paper, commit it to parchment, so to speak. Then those kinds of things inhere in that word, liberty, and they have the status of constitutional guarantee. So what would be some examples of those kind of liberties apart from the abortion question? Marriage, the right to direct the upbringing of one’s children — these are all ones I’m pulling from precedent — the right to use contraception. The court has said that the ones that are not included are the right to assisted suicide, the right to abortion. I think those are probably the two most prominent ones that have been held not on the list. And you were one of the people who held that the right to abortion was not on the list.

fae2ee9debb8,Can the Israel-Hamas Deal Hold?,"robert malley, hussein agha, israel, hamas","If they came to you for advice — if they said: Just tell me what not to do this time — what would both of you tell them? Starting with you, Rob. Malley: That’s a tough one because, at this point, I think there is really no clear blueprint. The best advice, I guess, is what you’re referring to, which is what not to do and not to replicate the ways of the past — which I think they’re unlikely to do in any event — but not to simply decide, as we see some people doing, jumping to the next shiny object, which is: Let’s try to revive the two-state solution. Let’s try to revive negotiations between the two sides. It hasn’t worked, and it hasn’t worked for 30 years under the much, much more auspicious circumstances than we see today. So we have to discard all of the formulas, all of the plans that people may come up with, however tempting they may be. And, in the case of the two-state solution and the pursuit of peace, it’s not a couple of mishaps. It’s decade after decade after decade — not just of mishap but of failures that have led to the catastrophe, the horrors of Oct. 7, and of what followed. It’s not as if Oct. 7 and the war that Israel waged on Gaza afterward are disconnected from what came before. They’re the logical consequence of those failures, of the pursuit of an illusion and of the quieting of any alternative in the name of that illusion, which is that we’re going to get a hard partition on the basis of two states — which neither Israelis nor Palestinians continue to believe in after some time. I don’t think they need to hear it from me, but I think that the reflex to go down to plans, whether it’s 20, 30, 40 points and let’s just apply to the two sides — I think at this stage, it really is a matter of the deep emotions of the two sides, which have been exacerbated by the last two years: coming to terms with those, breaking convention, talking to all sides. Not just the sides that we’re comfortable with, the ones who parrot our words and who dress like we dress. I speak about Americans, but there’s going to be Islamists, and there’s going to be refugees, and there’s going to be settlers, and there’s going to be religious Zionists.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-robert-malley-hussein-agha.html,Society,BBC,By Ezra Klein and Annie Galvin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/opinion/17eks-malley-agha/17eks-malley-agha-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:03:47.872000+00:00,f7b1971818095e9cb703ae42378d738b4960cd16
49a4017e2d95,NATO Must Defend Its Airspace Against Russian Incursions,"russian invasion of ukraine (2022), drones, war;armed conflicts, military, missiles and missile defense, nato, friedrich merz, vladimir putin, donald trump, ursula von der leyen, denmark, estonia, poland, russia, ukraine","Russia has launched a new and dangerous campaign of provocation against NATO. Over the past six weeks, it has sent drones over Poland and Romania and flown fighter jets into Estonia. Russia was also very likely behind drone flights that disrupted activity at airports in Denmark, Belgium and Germany. President Vladimir Putin has unconvincingly denied responsibility for all these acts and in fact seems happy for the world to believe Russia is behind them. His goals are to scare, exhaust and divide Europeans, causing them to question their support for Ukraine and undermine its efforts to repel Russia’s invasion. Ultimately, he also wants to make the United States look weak and fragment the NATO alliance. Responding wisely to him is vital for Washington and Europe. It is not easy. Striking back hard risks escalating conflict, while doing nothing conveys a weakness that invites future aggression. NATO allies are aware that Russia is testing them and so far have done a good job of responding. They have denounced the incursions, forthrightly blamed Russia for them and met this month in Copenhagen in a show of unity. “We are not at war,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany said recently , “but we are no longer at peace either.” There is more to do. European leaders should make clear that Russian aggression against NATO countries risks a forceful response, including the shooting down of drones — as the West has already done — and potentially of Russian fighter planes that enter NATO airspace. The United States and its NATO allies should also use the new Russian aggression as a reason to increase their support for Ukraine, sending the message that Mr. Putin’s attempt to weaken Western resolve has backfired. The visit this Friday of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to the White House is an opportunity for President Trump to commit to new military and economic aid for Kyiv. All these responses bring risks, including the dangers of escalation. By now, though, the world should know that there are no safe options with Mr. Putin. Ignoring or downplaying his aggressions encourages more of them. If he comes to believe that he can menace Poland, Estonia and other NATO members without consequence, he will become bolder about doing so. “We must not only react, we must deter,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. “Because if we hesitate to act, the gray zone will only expand.” She is right. Sometimes, the best way to prevent military escalation is to draw a firm line. The latest Russian provocations began on Sept. 9 with more than a dozen drones that crossed into Poland after having flown over Belarus and Ukraine. Five days later, a drone crossed into Romania, near two Romanian fighters on patrol. Five days after that, three Russian MiG jets flew into Estonia. Then came a mysterious intrusion of civilian drones around commercial airports. The week after the Estonian incident, several drones flew near two airports in Denmark in what the country’s defense minister called a “hybrid attack,” and officials briefly closed the airports to avoid the risk of a crash. Drones later disrupted air travel in Belgium and Germany. NATO responded well to these provocations. The MiGs over Estonia created the thorniest problem because they raised the prospect of a military confrontation between human pilots. But Swedish and Finnish pilots engaged with the MiGs, and the Russian pilots stood down, leaving Estonia escorted by the NATO planes. The response to the drones was even more aggressive. A combination of Polish, Dutch, Italian and German pilots intercepted the drones flying over Poland, shooting down several of them. In Romania, pilots tracked the Russian drone, and it left NATO airspace on its own. One downside to destroying drones is that it can be expensive. Some of the missiles that NATO used cost $1 million, many times more than a drone. To address this problem, NATO should expand the production of armed drones, develop more effective electronic warfare defenses against them and fund research into other countermeasures. Russian aggression should serve as a reminder that warfare is changing and that defense industries must change with it. As for future intrusions by piloted Russian jets, some Eastern European countries are arguing for loosening the rules for how and when NATO pilots can confront Russian jets that enter alliance airspace. A mix of caution and firmness is the best course. Nobody wants direct conflict between NATO and Russia, but history shows that the use of force can lead Mr. Putin to pull back. In the mid-2010s, Russian jets sometimes flew over Turkey, and Turkey, a NATO member, told Russia to stop. Only after Turkey downed a jet did Russia retreat. It is also important to respond in the theater that Mr. Putin cares about most: Ukraine. The incursions appear to have been partly a reaction to recent American equivocation. They came less than a month after an Alaska summit during which Mr. Putin succeeded in getting Mr. Trump to step back from his efforts to pressure Russia into accepting a cease-fire in Ukraine. Europe was rightly disappointed . Still, if Mr. Putin thought that Alaska provided an opening to further divide the allies, he miscalculated. In response to the incursions, and perhaps thanks to the lack of diplomatic progress, Mr. Trump has expressed growing frustration. He said last month that Mr. Putin “has really let me down.” Mr. Trump also said that NATO planes should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter allied airspace and raised the possibility of new forms of support for Ukraine. Already, he has authorized more intelligence sharing with Kyiv to heighten the effectiveness of its attacks, including those on Russian oil and gas facilities. Another option involves allowing Ukraine to get Tomahawk missiles . The missiles have a 1,000-mile range, and Ukraine could use them to strike deeper inside Russia. Mr. Trump’s history of impulsiveness and his long record of coziness with Mr. Putin offer reasons to remain skeptical that this new posture will be a lasting one. On Thursday, the two leaders spent more than two hours on the phone together, and Mr. Trump described the conversation as “very productive.” They plan to follow up by meeting in Budapest soon. That meeting will be an opportunity to draw a firm line. Russia’s recent aggression toward NATO shows that Russia’s war in Ukraine is about much more than Ukraine. It is about Mr. Putin’s revanchist ambitions in Europe. The only way to contain him is with resolute strength.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-nato-putin.html,Society,BBC,By The Editorial Board,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/opinion/17nato-editorial-image/17nato-editorial-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:03:29.923000+00:00,6dcc58c5982742c9fe00442356d447e25a1c35eb
f0bd1099b35f,‘The Only Candidate With a Coherent Vision’: 3 Opinion Writers on the Mayoral Debate,"mayoral races, us politics, presidential debates;democratic debates;2020 debates, police, public transit, rent, democrats, nypd, andrew cuomo, zohran mamdani, donald trump, jessica tisch, nyc;new york city, queens, curtis sliwa","On Thursday night the candidates for New York City mayor — Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani and Curtis Sliwa — squared off for their first debate ahead of Election Day, Nov. 4. John Guida, an editor in Times Opinion, moderated a written online conversation to assess the debate and the candidates with Mara Gay, who writes about politics for Opinion, and the contributing Opinion writers Nicole Gelinas and Josh Barro. John Guida: The debate covered a lot of ground about life in New York City: affordability, education, quality of life, transportation, debates over Israel and Hamas, President Trump. Who won and why? Mara Gay: What a night for New York City Hall nerds. Mamdani’s performance was just OK but he won anyway, because Cuomo and Sliwa looked out of touch and badly dated. They were talking about Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and relitigating the 1991 Crown Heights riots. Mamdani looked and sounded like someone who lives in and understands New York City in 2025. He stayed on the message a majority of New Yorkers care about the most, which is affordability. Nicole Gelinas: Sliwa, oddly, won. He showed easy fluency on issues and demonstrated empathy with voters; he was the only candidate to acknowledge two specific violent subway crimes — stuff that happens in the real world. This does not mean that Sliwa will be mayor, but it does mean that Cuomo lost. Cuomo didn’t perform disastrously; he was more relaxed than he was in the primary debates and he made some strong points, particularly on education and domestic violence. But Sliwa made too many of the quick rebuttals to Mamdani that Cuomo should have made. Cuomo was stuck on the defensive, fighting off both Mamdani and Sliwa, and he never effectively presented his own theme of governing experience. Josh Barro: Mamdani won for the same reason he’s winning the campaign: He’s the only candidate with a coherent vision that addresses New Yorkers’ concerns about affordability, and who actually seems to want to be mayor. This campaign has been painful for me as a political centrist because Cuomo, the purported standard-bearer of the political center, has no vision and is the architect of many of the state-level policies that have led to the disorder in the city he now decries. (And he also has personal behavior problems.) Sometimes your side deserves to lose an election; this feels like one of those times. As for Sliwa, Trump’s dig at him as “not exactly prime time” is unfortunately apt. Guida: Was there a pivotal moment? Gay: When Sliwa began joining in on some of the attacks on Cuomo — notably when he questioned Cuomo’s dismissive tone around the sexual harassment allegations against him — the debate took a bad turn for Cuomo. “Come on, Andrew, all 13 women were lying? A state trooper, too?” The moment revealed weaknesses with Cuomo as a candidate that transcend policy debates and reminded voters about the former governor’s worst instincts. Another turning point for me was the disgust I felt listening to Sliwa suggest that Mamdani would abandon Jewish New Yorkers, as he accused the former mayor David Dinkins, the first Black mayor, of having done during the 1991 race riots in Crown Heights. Cuomo piled on. Both men looked old. It was cathartic to hear Mamdani talk about the history of surveillance against Muslim communities after the Sept. 11 attacks and to mention Sean Bell by name, the unarmed Black man killed by the N.Y.P.D. in 2006 outside his bachelor party. The views Mamdani expressed represent the views of many, many New Yorkers, which is that we can have public safety without accepting racism in policing. Gelinas: Cuomo stumbling and seeming uncertain on what should have been his best question: What’s his pitch to keep a major business from leaving New York City? His answer was too slow and negative, highlighting things the city would stop doing, rather than things the city would do. It was an opportunity to remind people of his infrastructure successes or to recommit to an immediately noticeable and measurable change in street disorder. Barro: Mamdani was offered a mulligan on the “Should Hamas disarm?” question and he took it, saying, “Of course.” Cuomo seemed a little knocked off-kilter, as he had to keep attacking Mamdani for a position he’d already disclaimed. Mamdani’s opponents always hope to beat him by painting him as too extreme, and he shows awareness of this, acknowledging when he’s given out ammunition and looking for ways to defuse it. He did so again tonight. Guida: What was something small but revealing? It could be about a candidate, a policy — anything. Gay: It was interesting to hear Mamdani say he was open to scrapping a tax increase to pay for his universal child care initiative if an alternative were offered. This was the root of the bad blood between Cuomo and the former mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014 — de Blasio wanted to raise taxes to pay for a prekindergarten program, seeing it as a more reliable funding stream, and Cuomo wanted to allocate state funds without a tax hike. Gelinas: When Mamdani said that he would “deliver the safety that is the cornerstone of an affordability agenda.” It was something we’ve heard over and over from Mayor Eric Adams: that public safety is the requisite for prosperity. Mamdani is clearly beginning to internalize that the public would acutely care about his performance on crime and disorder. Barro: The moderators devoted 15 minutes to Israel, not a policy matter within the mayor’s purview, before they asked questions about the N.Y.P.D., education or housing. It’s another reflection of the ludicrous amount of space that Mideast policy has taken up in this campaign — sometimes because of the media, but often at the instigation of the candidates themselves. Guida: What policy idea from any candidate struck you as most promising for the city? Gay: I’m excited to see Democrats across New York begin to embrace Mamdani’s universal child care proposal. It’s practical; it could help many people (maybe me one day!) and it is a great way to make a great but expensive city an easier place to live in. Gelinas: Cuomo’s idea to double the number of specialized high schools is solid. There is demand for rigorous secondary education, so why not meet that demand? Barro: Nothing sticks out, unfortunately. While Mamdani is charming and shows a refreshing willingness to listen to his critics, he’s not deep. Cuomo and Sliwa aren’t deep either. I didn’t see a lot of policy wisdom on the stage. Guida: What policy idea from any candidate struck you as least, or at least not very, promising for the city? Gay: I think the mayor should retain control of the city’s public schools, and that this is the best way to ensure accountability. I’m curious about how Mamdani came to the conclusion that relinquishing mayoral control was a good idea, and I hope he changes his mind. Gelinas: Yes, Mara, Mamdani comes off as muddled and weak on education — and just plain uninterested in it. The worst idea, though, remains Mamdani’s “department of community safety” plan to replace police officers with civilian social-services workers and clinicians on mental health calls citywide. An abruptly scaled-up program of clinician and social-services responses to people in distress beyond what the city already has would actually require more police officers, not fewer, to back up these civilian workers as they encounter dangerous and unpredictable situations. Barro: Sliwa is obsessed with the idea that office buildings should be converted for residential use. This is one of those ideas that sounds clever but usually isn’t — most office buildings are inappropriate for residential use, with floor plans that are much too large and windows that don’t open. Converting them is very expensive, and the resulting layouts often don’t make sense as apartments. It’s an idea people talk about because they want to pretend it’s not necessary to build new residential buildings near people who might complain about them. Guida: There was a lot of talk about standing up to Trump. Did anyone impress you with the way he said he would work with the president? Gay: This is where, for me, the debate got a little messy. It was hard to follow, with several moderators and candidates talking over one another. Compared with the strength of Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago on this issue, the candidates in New York City seemed less compelling. Gelinas: I was surprised that when Mamdani was asked what would be seen as his biggest accomplishment after a year in office, he put standing up to Trump ahead of achieving affordability. He said he would work with the president if the president wants to make New York City more affordable — a serviceable enough thought. But the best way to stand up to Trump is not to give him a new opportunity to exploit, like an increase in crime or disorder, real or perceived. Barro: No, and I’m not sure there is very much to say. The president is a wild card. New York’s Gov. Kathy Hochul has shown a good ability to balance fighting him in areas of disagreement with working constructively on issues of shared interest. But that balance necessarily involves a lot of improvisation; I don’t think you can describe on a debate stage how you’ll do it. Guida: Did anyone miss Mayor Adams? If we could, for a moment, set aside the scandals and his baggage, how would you assess his mayoral record? Gay: No, I didn’t miss him. Adams’s biggest achievement may come to be seen as the citywide zoning amendment that eases the way for at least some new housing development. But overall he was unfocused and mired in corruption scandals while New Yorkers were priced out of their homes. Gelinas: I didn’t miss Mayor Adams. But we may miss him next year. Adams has made slow and choppy progress on crime and disorder, but at least it has been progress. One worthy Adams initiative is deploying police officers and mental health workers in co-response teams to engage with mentally ill people. The program has been slow to achieve results in part because it’s hard to recruit clinicians for this job. Barro: Mayor Adams got the trash put into containers — finally! — and shepherded the City of Yes reforms that should lead to the construction of many new homes. He’s also gotten charter amendments put on the ballot that would make the city more friendly to new development. He had some misadventures with the N.Y.P.D., but he finally installed a great commissioner in Jessica Tisch (and actually let her do her job) and crime has been falling under her leadership. His accomplishments will linger longer than his embarrassments, and I think he’ll actually look like a pretty good mayor in retrospect. All three candidates on the stage would likely be worse than him. Guida: Most attention going into the debate was on Mamdani and Cuomo. But as Nicole pointed out, there was a third candidate, Sliwa, the Republican nominee. He has been on the scene in New York for decades. What was your favorite moment of his? Gay: Every City Hall reporter has a few Sliwa stories, but my jaw dropped when he said he had been shot in a mob-related attack in the back of a yellow cab. It did happen over 30 years ago, in 1992, so I was 4 years old. Gelinas: He does present a different image without the beret. My favorite Sliwa moment was when he reminded the audience that he has two children with the Queens district attorney, its own tabloid story. (Look it up!) Barro: His declaration that all parades deserve to exist and the mayor must go to every parade. Guida: Mamdani has been the focus of intense attention, particularly for a Democratic Party eager for a new star. If he wins, he would be the most prominent Democratic Socialist in an executive office. What did you see in the debate as promise or peril for this future? Gay: Mamdani appeared unprepared for the level of detail in some of the questions, like one from a moderator asking how he could promise to freeze the rent ahead of time when the law requires him to factor in inflation and other costs for landlords. It’s a reminder that while he has enormous political talent, the campaign has mostly been on his terms so far, whereas governing means managing a city in which many things are out of your control. Gelinas: Yes, Mamdani continues to leave details out of his plans. He needed a follow-up question to his assertion that free buses would reduce transit assaults, drawn from a tiny sample. He needed a question as to why his argument for free buses — that many people can’t afford to get around — wouldn’t also hold for subways, thus imperiling all transit fares. Mamdani is proof that a smile and sticking to one theme (affordability), even superficially, can go far. Barro: Mamdani is very likable. I even like him, and I think he’s way too left-wing. But some of the campaign moves that read as charming — offering New Yorkers a rose in a “Bachelor”-style ad, for example — could wear very thin once he actually is mayor if people feel their needs aren’t being met by city government. And most of the time, that is how New Yorkers feel. So I think he might be eaten alive. Guida: Final question: Let’s assume that this debate does not meaningfully change the trajectory of a race that Mamdani seems on a path to win. He takes office in January 2026. What should his top priority be? Gay: Universal child care. Then housing. Gelinas: As Mamdani himself said Thursday night, public safety is the “cornerstone” of his agenda. The question is how he squares continuing Adams’s halting progress on crime and disorder with the D.S.A.’s anti-police and decarceration platform. If New Yorkers perceive that the city is spiraling out of fragile control — and subway assaults and homicides, a good proxy for that sense of control, continue to be disturbing — then he will lose control of his own agenda. Barro: His first priority should be the one he has set out: affordability. But affordability can’t be achieved just through mandates and price controls. He needs to cut through the morass of regulations that make New York an incredibly expensive place to live and do business. There are hundreds and hundreds of regulations requiring us to bear costs that people elsewhere in the country don’t pay. If he fights this thicket of regulation, it really will be possible to freeze the rent, because landlords’ operating expenses will fall. But cutting costs for real means taking on entrenched lobbies in city government — often unions — that neither Democrats nor even Republicans in city government have showed much appetite to fight.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/opinion/nyc-mayor-debate-mamdani-cuomo-sliwa.html,Society,BBC,"By Mara Gay, Nicole Gelinas, Josh Barro and John Guida",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/opinion/17debate-roundtable/17debate-roundtable-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:02:37.693000+00:00,a0b22c0f9f00174077e29106278c5b262d07d970

You might spend big at his hotels or invest in one of the many companies owned by him and his children. You might buy his sneakers, NFTs and other branded products. In the case of President Trump, a potential influence peddler has a vast menu of choices. But why bother with all that? While campaigning, Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial, and, just days before inauguration, his namesake memecoin. Anyone can indirectly deliver money to a Trump family entity simply by buying World Liberty’s tokens. Mr. Trump and his family have accrued billions of dollars in paper wealth through crypto ventures owned by the president, his sons and family friends. With World Liberty, Trump has created a powerful vehicle for those seeking influence. Anyone — you, me, an Emirati prince — can put money in his pocket by simply buying the tokens the company issues. The key is the convenience factor. For influence peddlers, bags of cash and Swiss bank accounts have been replaced by crypto tokens that can be quickly shuttled between digital wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges. Savvier crypto users — nation-states, hacker groups, money launderers — can use digital “mixers” and other tools to obfuscate their trail. It’s precisely these conveniences that have also made crypto a favored tool of criminal organizations and sanctions evaders. We’ve never seen anything like this before. You can tick off notorious executive branch scandals — President Ulysses S. Grant’s rogues’ gallery of corrupt advisers, Teapot Dome’s bribes for oil leases in the Harding administration, Watergate and the downfall of Richard Nixon — but none of them featured this scale of mixing of personal and government interests, much less the sheer accumulation of profit, of Mr. Trump’s multibillion-dollar crypto windfall. There’s little innovation at work here, except the bold use of the sitting president’s name, image and social media presence to promote crypto products that are little different than thousands of others in the volatile, fraud-riddled crypto markets. For MAGA fans and everyday speculators, buying these tokens might lead to them losing their shirts. And certainly, a president roping his political supporters into an investment as risky as crypto is condemnable. But the larger risk concerns Mr. Trump and the huge amount of money that powerful overseas actors can potentially funnel toward him. If you are a head of state, it is in your direct political interest to buy Mr. Trump’s tokens or invest in one of his crypto ventures. These are the skewed incentives that Mr. Trump’s crypto dropbox brings to the political scene. Take a look at two recent multibillion-dollar deals involving Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, one of the most influential figures in the United Arab Emirates, and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy. In the first deal, the state-backed investment fund that Sheikh Tahnoon heads pledged $2 billion in USD1 tokens, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, to complete an investment in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. (Stablecoins are supposed to remain at a stable value and operate as a kind of ersatz digital dollar, and thus are widely used in crypto transactions.) A Binance founder, Changpeng Zhao, is seeking a pardon from Mr. Trump after pleading guilty to money laundering. In the second deal, Mr. Witkoff and David Sacks, a longtime venture capitalist and tech executive who was named Mr. Trump’s A.I. and crypto czar, secured a deal that allows the Emirates to buy hundreds of thousands of high-end chips needed for artificial intelligence data centers. These chips are highly coveted in the larger global A.I. race, and they are subject to stringent export regulations. In this case, experts expressed concern that the U.A.E. might share the chips with Chinese concerns. While there was no evidence of an explicit quid pro quo between these deals, they included many of the same people and overlapping interests. And they blended private and government business in a manner that has become a hallmark of this Trump administration. Sheikh Tahnoon’s decision to use $2 billion worth of USD1 stablecoins is revealing. If his goal was to merely invest in Binance, he could have wired $2 billion directly to it. By using World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoins as a kind of financial intermediary, Sheikh Tahnoon was also jump-starting a company that has financially benefited Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Trump. Despite the whiff of scandal, much of Mr. Trump’s crypto activity has happened in the relative open, with some of the crypto industry’s most notorious personalities celebrating eight- or nine-figure purchases of World Liberty Financial’s WLFI token. The flamboyant Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun has posted repeatedly on social media about his many millions of dollars worth of World Liberty tokens and Mr. Trump’s memecoin while positioning himself as a major backer of Mr. Trump’s crypto ventures. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal judge to pause a civil fraud case against Mr. Sun. The pause was granted. In May, Mr. Sun’s position as the top holder of Mr. Trump’s memecoin earned him, and dozens of other top $TRUMP owners, an invitation to a dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. There, Mr. Sun received a gold watch. In another era (in other words, a few years ago), we would have already had congressional hearings and law enforcement investigations into the president’s crypto business interests. But the Supreme Court’s recent decision related to presidential immunity signals that such moves could end up being practically superfluous. The Department of Justice will not indict a sitting president, and to start his term, Mr. Trump fired 18 inspectors general, who might otherwise have been able to investigate and shine light on the crypto activities of this administration. In February, he ordered the Justice Department to suspend enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits the bribery of foreign officials. (Four months later, the suspension was lifted.) Enforcement agencies have shifted their priorities away from crypto, while the administration has helped usher in legislation favored by the crypto industry. Mr. Trump and his sons’ enormous accumulation of crypto wealth appears set to continue throughout his term. There seems to be no upper bound to how much foreign money can be channeled toward him. It’s an open door to a form of corruption, at the highest level, that Americans have never had to confront. But we must confront the dark possibilities it presents.

Hey, boomers! Younger Americans would like a word.

We’ve noticed that many of you are pretty upset about the state of the nation. And we get it. We really do. But do you ever stop and ask yourselves how we got here?

In the Opinion video above, younger Americans from the New York region spell out the frustrations of the generations that followed the baby boomers. Like so many of us, they’re struggling with the high cost of education, a scarcity of affordable housing and a diminished American dream.

We live in communities that are still divided by race, in a nation burdened by debt, on a planet that keeps getting hotter.

We have one simple request: How about an apology?

Now we’re all paying for it. “Hey, boomers!” “It’s easy to wave signs saying, ‘I can’t believe I’m still protesting this [EXPLETIVE]!’ But if you’re looking to hold someone accountable ——” “Own the world you made.” “Protest yourselves.” “Americans born in the decades after World War II were handed the world on a silver platter.” “Cheap college.” “Cheap housing.” “Abundant opportunity.” “The vast majority of you ended up wealthier than your parents.” “And Lord knows it wasn’t because you were smarter or worked harder.” “It was because America was an escalator.” “You just had to stand on it.” “You’ve been an electoral powerhouse since the ‘80s.” “When presented with a choice between protecting your interests” “or investing in a better future for your children ——” “You usually chose yourselves.” “Can you believe it?” “More benefits for boomers.” “More tax cuts for boomers.” “And borrowed money to make up the difference.” “Over the past quarter-century, you’ve put almost $30 trillion on the national credit card on behalf of future generations stuck with the bill ——” “What’s your problem?” “What’s your problem?” “A year at a public university ——” “Costs almost four times as much as it did in 1970 after adjusting for inflation.” “The average house cost more than two times as much.” “And you made it difficult for younger Americans to live in the cities with the best jobs.” “You regularly use your electoral might to squash ——” “Plans for new construction and protect your property values.” “It’s like you think democracy only exists so that you can band together en masse to freeze your communities in time.” “You’re the reason so many Americans sleep in their cars.” “You’re the reason that public schools today are more segregated than they were in 1968.” “It’s easy to blame the nation’s political leaders.” “But let’s be clear: For the last few decades, they’ve mostly been members of your generation ——” “Elected with your support ——” “To protect your interests.” “From the first boomer president, Bill Clinton ——” “To the current boomer president, who is hopefully the last one.” “The Bush years were peak boomer. In 2001, when the government’s coffers were overflowing ——” “You did what you always did.” “You passed a giant tax cut dividing the money amongst yourselves.” “In 2003, you did it again.” “And in 2006, you were all in for a big increase in government spending ——” “On Medicare, just in time for the first boomer retirees.” “You decided you’d rather have Walmarts than factory jobs.” “And you didn’t ask too many questions about the low, low price of your super-size flat-screen TV.” “You enjoyed the short-term benefits of deregulating the banking industry ——” “Telecommunications ——” “And a host of other industries ——” “Leaving future generations to clean up the mess of corporate consolidation and junk fees.” “But hey, making things cheaper for yourself at everyone else’s expense is kind of your M.O.” “You tree-hugging hippies championed environmentalism. But what is your legacy?” “A world that keeps burning more carbon and a planet that keeps getting hotter.” “Instead of actually confronting the problem, you embrace recycling, a con game that allows people to pretend they care about the planet without doing anything even a little difficult ——” “Like using fewer plastic bottles.” “You exported your waste to less wealthy nations or you just dumped it in the ocean. Thanks to you, there’s an island of trash three times the size of France swirling off the coast of California.” “But don’t think we’re entirely ungrateful.” “We appreciate the progress that you made on civil rights and gender equality ——” “Although you don’t always seem to understand that there’s still a lot of work to do.” “Thanks for the avocados, some good music and the World Wide Web.

ef0043b7c19c,"Vivienne Westwood Show Opens Riyadh Fashion Week, as Saudis Highlight Creative Side","riyadh saudi arabia, fashion, vivienne westwood, mohammed bin salman, politics","Vivienne Westwood, the brand founded by Britain’s queen of punk, opened Riyadh Fashion Week on Thursday, becoming the first international label to present at the Saudi Arabian event, which is now in its third year. On its face, this was a curious choice for an affair that is the brainchild of an actual royal in a conservative Islamic kingdom where modest dress is mandated. Famously provocative, Ms. Westwood pioneered punk fashion, dressing the Sex Pistols in pins, tatters and lewd graphics in the 1970s, and then built a luxury brand that amplified her left-wing activism before her death in 2022 . This week, the Vivienne Foundation, a charity she founded, rereleased one of her famous early creations, a T-shirt featuring framed female breasts , which was worn by the Sex Pistols guitarist in a notoriously crude 1976 live television interview that scandalized Britain . It is the kind of garment that might to result in a fine for violating Saudi Arabia’s public decency rules. Over the past decade, the crown prince has led a widespread crackdown on dissent while loosening social restrictions. But for some Saudi designers, the addition of the rebellious brand to the local lineup was just one more sign of the times, a testament to official efforts to cultivate the kingdom’s cultural allure and nurture a creative scene. “It’s a way to platform the area,” said Mohammed Khoja, 38, designer and founder of the Saudi brand Hindamme, who will show at Riyadh Fashion Week on Sunday. With Vivienne Westwood designs kicking off the event, and those of Stella McCartney closing it, Mr. Khoja said that he was thrilled to be in the company of “huge, very respected global brands,” and that he hoped it was the beginning of a new era for Saudi designers. “Traditionally, banking and petroleum were the main driving economic forces, and creativity was never spotlighted,” Mr. Khoja said of Saudi society. When he started his brand in 2016, “creativity was not necessarily part of the zeitgeist,” he said, although designers like Adnan Akbar and Yahya Al-Bishri had gained acclaim designing for the likes of Princess Diana. Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has in recent years has dramatically relaxed religious restrictions and moved to diversify the economy beyond oil. Investing in business, sports , tourism and culture, as well as hosting major events , are all part of an initiative called Vision 2030. Fashion is part of the picture. This month, Saudi Arabia created an $80 million fashion fund . Last month, the Ministry of Culture held its first Cultural Investment Conference , focused on “advancing cultural capital,” among other things. In August, the Italian fashion school Istituto Marangoni opened a campus in Riyadh. Such moves have drawn criticism from human rights groups and public figures, who have argued that Saudi Arabia is trying to deflect attention from domestic repression — and that global participation enables that effort . In recent weeks top comedians, including Marc Maron, have criticized some of their peers, like Dave Chappelle, for participating in the Riyadh Comedy Festival . News that Vivienne Westwood would show in Riyadh prompted a rebuke from the designer’s granddaughter, Cora Corré, who told The Guardian that the brand’s decision did not align with her grandmother’s values. Ms. Corré broke with the company last year, saying it had strayed from its roots, but continues to work with the Vivienne Foundation charity. She and the foundation did not respond to requests for comment; nor did Vivienne Westwood, the company. The company has previously said its first show in the Middle East is a way to foster cultural exchange, a framing that others have also used to defend participation in the kingdom’s transformative endeavors . In Riyadh, Vivienne Westwood showed embroidered gowns made with local artisans from Art of Heritage , an organization that preserves cultural objects and trains Saudi women in traditional crafts. That group is headed by Princess Nourah bint Mohammed Al Faisal, founder of Riyadh Fashion Week, who told Harper’s Bazaar Arabia that the collaboration showed how Saudi craftsmanship can speak to the world . This echoes the message Mr. Khoja wants to send. His designs are a homage to home and places he has lived, including Texas, where he spent nine childhood years, and Paris, where he studied business administration and fell for fashion. A print in one of his collections depicts petroglyphs from local rock art to highlight “the beginning of visual culture in Arabia,” he said. Criticism of global participation in the Saudi projects has generated a backlash , too, with some saying that whitewashing accusations are hypocritical and ignore the genuine ambitions of the kingdom’s leadership to diversify its economy and cater to a young, very online population. “It’s not a monolithic society,” Mr. Khoja said. “There’s creative expression.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/world/middleeast/riyadh-fashion-week-vivienne-westwood.html,World,BBC,By Ephrat Livni,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16int-saudi-1-whlt/16int-saudi-1-whlt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T09:56:34+00:00,87fdb2226e67ec7bf60649f65ffba9859f66b622

Fired Employees Reopened It Without Pay.,"foreign aid, closings, hospital, humanitarian aid, health care workers, international medical corps, united states agency for international development, baidoa, somalia","Word spread, and within days, the employees had reopened the hospital: doctors, mental health counselors, cleaners and the pharmacist. None of them are being paid. “Whether you get something or nothing, you have to do what you can for your society,” said Abdikadir Hassan, the pharmacist. The medical center is next to a bustling livestock market on the outskirts of Baidoa, a city of 750,000 that has absorbed an additional 770,000 people displaced by drought and war into makeshift camps scattered around the town. The hospital is nominally run by the state government. Officials could unlock the doors and welcome staff members back to work. But like nearly all other health facilities in the country, this one depended on foreign assistance to staff and equip it. Until January, the United States was the largest donor to Somalia, spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year on health, nutrition, shelter and sanitation projects. Most of that funding was channeled through the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations that provided those services. Since the Trump administration took office, much of the assistance that flowed to Somalia through the United States Agency for International Development, or U.S.A.I.D., has been cut off, either through terminated grants or through annual awards that were not renewed. For each of the past eight years, International Medical Corps had received a U.S.A.I.D. grant worth about $10 million to staff and equip the medical center and ones like it in three other districts of Somalia. When that grant ended in July, it was not renewed. In a statement, the State Department said that both military and humanitarian assistance to Somalia continued but that the administration was “significantly enhancing the efficiency and strategic impact of foreign assistance programs and ensuring that foreign assistance reaches those in need.” The Trump administration has said that much of the funding that went through U.S.A.I.D. in the past was wasted and that the United States was covering an unfair share of the burden of foreign aid.

32e583f3dc94,Senior Chinese General Is Ousted on Corruption Charges,"china, people's liberation army, communist party of china, xi jinping, corruption","China announced on Friday that one its top military commanders had been dismissed and would be prosecuted on charges of corruption and abuse of power, confirming that the Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s extraordinary succession of purges in the People’s Liberation Army had reached its topmost ranks. The commander, Gen. He Weidong , a member of the 24-member Politburo, the Chinese Communist Party’s second-highest tier, was also a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, the party body that controls the armed forces. That put him third in China’s military hierarchy, after Mr. Xi and another commander. The Ministry of National Defense said General He and eight other senior military officers had been expelled from the military and from the party. Some were already known or rumored to be under investigation, and General He stopped making public appearances earlier this year, an indication that he was probably in trouble. The ministry gave no details about the misdeeds that General He and the other commanders were accused of. But it said the charges involved corruption. The punishments “underscore the clear stance that there is absolutely no place for corrupt elements to hide within the military,” Senior Col. Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesman for the ministry, said in a statement on its website . Some experts have said that the recent graft investigations and the ensuing disruption in the military command may have undermined Mr. Xi’s confidence that the People’s Liberation Army was ready for major combat. But Colonel Zhang offered a positive view, saying the punishments would “further strengthen the purity” of the military and give it “greater cohesion and combat effectiveness.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

84fc6e62f50f,"Putin’s Trump Strategy: Lots of Flattery, and Talk of Business Deals","russian invasion of ukraine (2022), vladimir putin, donald trump, volodymyr zelensky, budapest, hungary, russia, ukraine","After weeks of rising tensions with President Trump, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia picked up the phone. The Kremlin said Russia had initiated the call on Thursday between the two leaders, a telling acknowledgment of a Russian priority as important as any battlefield in Ukraine: appeasing Mr. Trump. Even as Mr. Putin has pounded Ukrainian cities and waged grinding warfare in the country’s east, he has invested dozens of hours into flattering Mr. Trump, dangling the prospect of Russian-American business deals and sending the message that Russia is open to talks to end its invasion. The tactic has helped Mr. Putin head off repeated deadlines and sanctions threats by the American president without curtailing Russia’s war effort. In June, a time when some Republican allies of Mr. Trump were pushing for sanctions against Russia , Mr. Putin called Mr. Trump to wish him a happy birthday ; Mr. Trump said Mr. Putin had acted “very nicely,” and the sanctions never appeared. In August, as Mr. Trump was threatening to enforce a 12-day deadline for Mr. Putin to end the war, the Russian leader hosted Steve Witkoff , the White House envoy and close friend of Mr. Trump, for a three-hour meeting that set the stage for the two presidents’ summit in Alaska. This week, the cease-fire in Gaza gave Mr. Putin a new pretext to call — and praise — Mr. Trump. More relevant to Mr. Putin, however, was the fact that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was scheduled to visit the White House on Friday. “We proposed the phone conversation on the heels of President Trump’s successful trip to the Middle East,” Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Friday. “President Putin’s first thought, of course, was to congratulate Trump on such a success.” Thursday’s call, coming after Mr. Trump’s threats to send Ukraine powerful Tomahawk cruise missiles “if this war doesn’t get settled,” was Mr. Putin’s eighth phone conversation with the American leader this year. He has held five hourslong, in-person meetings with Mr. Witkoff. Combined with the August summit in Alaska, Mr. Putin has held about as many meetings and calls with Mr. Trump and Mr. Witkoff this year as he has with his closest international ally, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, according to official Kremlin statements. On Friday, Mr. Putin was already preparing for another face-to-face meeting with Mr. Trump, while signaling that an end to the war in Ukraine was still a ways off. He took a call from Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, to discuss a possible Trump-Putin summit in Budapest. But the Kremlin’s statement about that call added that Mr. Putin told Mr. Orban that U.S. and Russian officials would first need to “discuss the algorithm for further actions in the context of finding ways to peacefully resolve the Ukrainian crisis.” The Kremlin was also getting more creative in trying to appeal to Mr. Trump not only by praising him, but also by pitching business deals. In February, Mr. Putin said American companies could help develop aluminum production in Siberia and help mine rare earth metals in Russian-occupied Ukraine. On Thursday, one of his senior aides, Kirill Dmitriev, posted on X that Elon Musk’s tunneling company could build a “Putin-Trump tunnel” between eastern Russia and Alaska. “We also spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over,” Mr. Trump posted on social media after Thursday’s call. It was unclear what kind of trade was discussed. From the Kremlin’s perspective, the charm offensive has been well worth the effort even though it has not yet resulted in business deals being announced, let alone in Mr. Trump conceding to Mr. Putin’s wide-ranging demands over Ukraine. But it appears to have succeeded in stopping Mr. Trump from significantly increasing American assistance to Ukraine. A renewed sign of that came after Thursday’s call, when Mr. Trump expressed doubts about whether he would be willing to provide Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. “Putin hasn’t wasted any time in learning how to massage Trump’s ego,” said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. He predicted that the United States would pause meaningful aid deliveries to Ukraine while a potential Budapest summit was being prepared. “Even if that buys Russia a month — it’s already a good investment.” Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/world/europe/putin-trump-call-meeting-ukraine-russia.html,World,BBC,By Anton Troianovski and Nataliya Vasilyeva,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17putin-strategy-hvwz/17putin-strategy-hvwz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T12:12:23+00:00,2f1d9a9a86aa68a4db96d996f08ba9df12cbb119
db28f0bc30e1,Want to Know What You’ll Pay for College? There’s a Fast New Calculator for That.,"college, tuition payments, price, calculator, scholarships, service content, personal finance","High school seniors applying to college may cross some schools off their list when they see the nearly six-figure “sticker” prices, not realizing that the actual cost may be far lower. Now, to persuade promising but wary students to give them a closer look, nearly two dozen private colleges are offering a new online tool that factors in aid, including need-based grants and scholarships. The cost calculator, created by the nonprofit MyIntuition, requires just two pieces of information from users: their family’s income and the number of siblings they have in college. Users click a button on a chart and can instantly see a range that they would probably pay at various incomes. “A quick estimate might lead them to do more research,” said Ronné Turner, vice provost for undergraduate enrollment and student financial aid at Washington University in St. Louis, which has been testing the tool for the past year. The tool arrives as many Americans worry that college has gotten too expensive. In a new survey by the Pew Research Center, about eight in 10 adults said colleges and universities were doing a “fair or poor” job of keeping tuition affordable. How is this tool different from other cost calculators? Colleges are required to publish their full cost of attendance — commonly known as the sticker price — and to offer calculators showing the estimated net price after financial aid. But some calculators request a lot of financial detail and can take some time to complete. That’s often daunting for students from low- or middle-income families, who may consider the sticker price out of reach and move on to other options, said Phillip Levine, the founder of MyIntuition and an economics professor at Wellesley College, who has studied college pricing.

271d34e76467,The Growing Blowback Against Marc Benioff,"internal tag to designate no storyline, marc benioff, salesforcecom, ron conway, immigration and customs enforcement;ice, national guard, donald trump, software","Andrew here. We’re keeping an eye on credit fears roiling global markets — and also how politics has come to the workplace, again. Marc Benioff of Salesforce is under fire, this time from the left, for seeking to do business with ICE under President Trump. The pushback is coming not only from activists, but from allies as well. Remember when Google staff members staged a mass walkout over the company’s military work, or when Amazon employees protested the sale of surveillance products to the government? Here is the question of the morning: Is there a red line for companies doing business with the government? Should they have one? Watching the ICE fallout For years, Marc Benioff, the C.E.O. of Salesforce, loomed over San Francisco as the city’s most generous donor, and a decidedly progressive one. But Benioff’s growing embrace of President Trump underscores how some tech leaders have shifted to the right, a turn that is increasingly alienating some allies. The latest: Heather Knight, a Times reporter, obtained screenshots of internal documents and communications about Salesforce pitching ICE on using its artificial intelligence tools to help staff up. Among them was a five-page memo to the agency arguing that the company could help “nearly triple its work force.” (A caveat: Salesforce had also contracted with ICE during the Obama and Biden administrations.) San Francisco officials leveled fresh criticism at Benioff over the news. “For someone to claim that they support San Francisco and then be embedded with ICE like this is deeply concerning,” Danny Sauter, a member of the city’s Board of Supervisors, told The Times. That’s on top of the heat Benioff got over his support of a National Guard deployment to San Francisco. “We don’t have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I’m all for it ,” he told The Times. (Trump himself suggested this week that he might do just that .) Benioff’s comments prompted Ron Conway , a prominent venture capitalist and longtime friend, to resign from the board of Salesforce’s philanthropic arm. “I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired,” Conway, a big Democratic donor, wrote in his resignation note. Benioff is the latest sign of a rightward turn in the tech world . Apple, Google and Meta all donated to Trump’s inaugural committee, and their leaders have since attended presidential events at the White House and abroad. Worth noting: The U.S. government is Salesforce’s biggest customer, with federal contracts worth billions. Falling afoul of Trump could also lead to negative consequences . Could others in Benioff’s orbit turn on him? The Times said its information came from “an individual with ties to Salesforce.” Over the past decade, tech employees have spoken out against policies they oppose. Most recently, employees at Microsoft staged a protest at the tech giant’s headquarters over its contracts with the Israeli military. (Microsoft later barred the sale of some A.I. products to an Israeli defense unit that were used as part of Gaza operations.) Whether that will happen at Salesforce is unclear. In an internal Slack channel discussing the ICE memo, some employees responded to it with fire emojis. One wrote, “I wish you the best of luck with this one!” HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sues over new H-1B visa fees . The business group argued that the Trump administration’s new $100,000 charge for skilled-worker visas violated the Immigration and Nationality Act and was “misguided policy.” Silicon Valley start-ups and tech giants have complained that the steep fee would make it impossible to hire employees with specialized skills. The Trump administration reportedly weighs tariff relief for the U.S. auto industry. The Commerce Department is set to extend an arrangement that lets automakers reduce duties they pay on imported car parts to five years from two years, Bloomberg reports. That would be a major win to carmakers, which have lobbied the White House to ease the hit they’ve taken from the president’s levies. Instagram unveils new A.I. chatbot teen safety features. The Meta-owned social network said it would let parents block their children from having conversations with certain A.I. characters, limit chats on topics like self-harm and romance and send parents summaries of their children’s chats. It’s the latest change by the company after criticism over its effects on young people’s mental health. Saudi Arabia is said to discuss a defense deal with the U.S. The kingdom has talked with the White House about an agreement that would be similar to the one between the U.S. and Qatar , in which Washington would see any attack on it as a threat to American “peace and security,” The Financial Times reports. Saudi Arabia spent months negotiating a defense pact with the Biden administration before talks were upended by Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel. Credit contagion Alarm bells are ringing in global markets on Friday as fresh worries about the banking sector — and the possibility of more cracks emerging after a yearslong credit boom — prompt a broad stock sell-off. The latest: Shares in European banks fell sharply, and the S&P 500 looks set for another rough open. The CBOE Volatility Index, the so-called fear gauge, jumped to its highest level since the April sell-off that followed President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, according to Deutsche Bank. All this came after tremors in the KBW regional bank index, which fell more than 6 percent. The scare is over losses at two regional U.S. banks , Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp, which reported exposure to what they said was fraud by two investors . (Lawyers for the two men “vehemently deny” the allegations.) Neither bank lost much money — Zions said it had taken a $50 million hit — but the lenders saw their stocks plunge by double-digits Thursday on the news. Regional banks have been causes for concern since 2023, when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed and set off a mini-implosion in the industry. Both Zions and Western Alliance got hammered during that crisis. Worries about bad loans have been growing in recent weeks as investors increasingly fear that the boom in private credit and other lending has led to costly mistakes. Shares in Jefferies, which disclosed that it could lose about $715 million from the collapse of the auto-parts maker First Brands, have tumbled 26 percent over the past month as details of its exposure have emerged. Analysts have peppered bank C.E.O.s with questions about their exposure to First Brands and the auto lender Tricolor. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, which reported a loss tied to Tricolor, warned that more bad news might yet come to light: “ When you see one cockroach , there are probably more,” he told analysts this week. Some bank watchers say the latest drop has gone too far. The sell-off in Zions and Western Alliance shares looks “overdone,” Jon Arfstrom, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote on Thursday in a research report. He noted that regional bank stocks have improved their finances significantly since 2023. Still, investors will be keying in on the sector’s finances, with several regional lenders set to report results in the coming days, including Zions and Western Alliance next week. Mamdani faces a grilling Last night’s New York City mayoral debate had several big moments. But it failed to deliver any body blows to the front-runner, Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist and Democratic Party candidate whose campaign has roiled the city’s business community. Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, landed some jabs in what’s likely to be their final face-to-face confrontation before Election Day. The city’s affordability crunch was a main topic, as were hot-button issues like policing, Israel and President Trump. A breakdown: Mamdani painted Cuomo as out of touch on financial issues, especially over housing. Sliwa seemed to go after Cuomo more than Mamdani. Here are The Times’s takeaways . Mamdani has successfully reached out to business leaders recently . He has gained audiences with the likes of Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Mike Bloomberg as his wide lead in the polls solidifies. But Mamdani’s foes dug in on debate night. Bill Ackman, the hedge fund billionaire who has donated $1.25 million to help stop Mamdani, asked on X how the candidate would “ pay for your programs and ideas if you drive away the biggest NYC taxpayers?” While Cuomo has attracted much of Wall Street’s support, it was Sliwa who impressed at least one prominent voice. “Sliwa proved that he is ready for prime time,” Kathryn Wylde, the C.E.O. of the Partnership for New York City, told The Times . Talking A.I. with the C.E.O. of Duolingo Every week, we’re asking a chief executive how he or she uses generative artificial intelligence. Luis von Ahn, who leads the language learning app Duolingo, told DealBook that he keeps the technology’s limitations in mind. His answers have been condensed and edited. How do you personally use A.I.? The usual: I search for things like recipes; I use it for health symptoms — like, my body aches, what do I have?; and every now and then I use it to simplify emails. What directives have you given your employees on A.I.? On Fridays, we’re giving everybody two to three hours to just experiment. We have Slack channels where people can share A.I. wins. We’ve now added Slack channels for A.I. losses. Because it turns out there are all these things people tried to do, and it just did a horrible job. For example, we have a model that generates images of our green owl. It insists on putting a headband on it. Even when you say, please generate this image with no headband, the guy comes out with a headband. You sent a memo to employees about your “ AI-first ” philosophy. Did it have its intended effect? I think the most important thing is to give context, both internally and externally, about what you mean. In my case, I failed to make it clear that our use of A.I. is not meant to save costs. It really is meant to try to augment the productivity of our employees. And we are seeing that it is doing that. At the same time, people sometimes think it has already completely changed everything. This is just not true. In general, my biggest advice is, No. 1, be curious about all the new technology. And then No. 2, understand that anybody who’s talking about A.I. usually has a vested interest. So the people who sell you vibecoding tools will tell you they are perfect. I’ve personally tested out a lot of the tools, and you can really see they’re great at some things and really bad at others.

53918de5487a,How Ace Frehley Made ‘New York Groove’ His Own,"pop rock music, ace frehley, fatalities;casualties","It was 1975, and Russ Ballard was in a New York state of mind. The English singer and songwriter had recently left Argent, the hard-rock band responsible for hits including “Hold Your Head Up,” and moved into producing. That year, one of Ballard’s studio gigs required him to relocate to New York — his first trip to the city in 18 months. During the flight, a phrase popped into his head: “Back in the New York groove.” “That’d be a good title for a song, I reckoned,” Ballard told Classic Rock this year. When he returned to Britain, Ballard teamed up with Hello, an upstart glam-rock band in need of a new tune. He didn’t have a finished song to offer, but he showed up at a session equipped with a cool title, and a musical jumping-off point. “In my brain, I wanted to make it a Bo Diddley beat,” Ballard explained to the podcast VRP Rocks . As the members of Hello began improvising a track — at one point stomping their boots on a table — Ballard wrote a series of lyrics about a wide-eyed hedonist taking in the Big Apple, for the first time, all over again: Here I am in the city With a fistful of dollars And baby, you better believe: I’m back in the New York groove “I just made up the tune as we went,” recalled Ballard , who put together “New York Groove” in about two hours. The relatively spare finished track — which featured chugging harmonica, a scraping guitar riff and that thumping boot-beat — arrived in late 1975, and became Hello’s last British Top 10 hit. But “New York Groove” would find a bigger audience, and a more blistering groove, a few years later, when the song was covered by one of rock’s most reliably spaced-out guitar heroes: Ace Frehley. In September 1978, while Kiss was in the middle of a yearslong commercial zenith, Frehley and his bandmates — Peter Criss, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — each released self-titled solo albums. Frehley’s contribution included big-riff shout-alongs (“Rip It Out”) and a sinister five-minute guitar instrumental (“Fractured Mirror”) that Frehley would compare to Mike Oldenfold’s “Tubular Bells.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

d79ebae1ec02,"Baek Sehee, Korean Writer Who Bared Her Struggles With Depression, Dies at 35","mental health, books, writer, death, baek sehee, south korea","Baek Sehee, the best-selling South Korean author whose frank conversations about therapy and mental health helped her become a cultural phenomenon in her home country and beyond, died on Thursday at 35. Her death, at a hospital in Goyang, west of Seoul, was confirmed by Kim Yunsik, a spokesman for the Korea Organ Donation Agency. He said her family did not wish to state the cause. Ms. Baek was best known for her memoir “I Want to Die, but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki,” a deeply personal account of her struggles with depression and anxiety. The book, published in 2018, includes conversations that Ms. Baek had with her therapist, which she recorded, and essays that explored topics like sexism and self-doubt. The book was embraced by a broad audience that was drawn to its frank discussion of mental health, especially in South Korea, where stigma and family shame around mental illness persist. In the prologue, she writes: “I realized that opening the dark part in my heart was a very natural thing, just like showing the bright part of it.” “I Want to Die” was published in 25 countries and has sold over a million copies worldwide. Ms. Baek told PEN Transmissions in 2023 that the inspiration for the book came from someone who had commented on her blog, where she was posting notes on her experiences in therapy. The commenter said they were experiencing similar emotions, and felt relieved to know someone else was going through the same thing. “When they said it was like a light was shining into the darkness of their life, I was so surprised,” Ms. Baek said. “All I’d done was be honest in public, but here was someone comforted by that.” Anton Hur, who translated Ms. Baek’s book into English, wrote on social media on Friday that she had touched “millions of lives” with her writing. As news of her death spread, fans shared personal testimonies on social media about Ms. Baek’s significance. “Her book was the catalyst to one of the most profound discussions on mental health we’ve ever had,” one wrote . In a statement, her sister Baek Dahee said that Ms. Baek “loved writing, connecting with others through writing and nurturing hope in other people.” Ms. Baek was born in Goyang in 1990, the middle of three sisters. She studied creative writing at Dongguk University in Seoul and worked at a publishing company for five years. During that time, she was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, according to the Korea Organ Donation Agency. She began attending therapy sessions at counseling centers and psychiatric clinics, experiences she recounted in her memoir. In 2019, she published a sequel, “I Want to Die, but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki,” which explored her struggles with self-harm and suicidal thoughts. (Tteokbokki is a popular Korean dish of rice cakes in a spicy sauce.) Ms. Baek was modest about any influence she had on conversations surrounding mental health, particularly those in South Korea. In the PEN Transmissions interview, she noted that personal writing on mental health topics had become more common, adding that “it makes me glad that we are at least talking about it more.” Ms. Baek is survived by her parents and two sisters.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/arts/baek-se-hee-dead-author.html,Culture,BBC,By Jonathan Wolfe and John Yoon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/podcasts/17xp-baek-alt/17xp-baek-alt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T12:44:36+00:00,aac9b9b83ca9f1b9cee9f2455eebd30d914df90e
0df9f12d08bb,"Live Updates: Trump to Meet With Zelensky, Making New Push for Ukraine Cease-Fire",,"The indictment on Thursday of John R. Bolton, President Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic, over his handling of classified information invites comparison to Mr. Trump’s own indictment on similar charges. Mr. Trump was accused of illegally holding onto classified documents after he left the White House in January 2021, and of obstructing the government’s efforts to retrieve them from his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. The case was dropped last year after Mr. Trump won the 2024 election. Mr. Bolton is accused of illegally sending classified information to two close family members who did not have security clearances, and of illegally holding onto copies of those messages at his house in Maryland. Here is a closer look at how the two cases compare. Both were accused of handling data insecurely. Both men were accused of not taking the proper precautions to secure classified information. In Mr. Trump’s case, he was accused of storing boxes with classified information in various insecure locations at Mar-a-Lago, including a bathroom and a ballroom stage. Because Mar-a-Lago is a club and not just a residence, many people could have gained access to the documents before the F.B.I. finally retrieved them in August 2022. In Mr. Bolton’s case, he was accused of transmitting the entries using personal email accounts and an encrypted consumer messaging app that were not approved for sending and storing classified information. One of the email accounts was apparently hacked by Iran in 2021, the indictment said. And while his house had an approved facility for storing classified information while he was Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, it did not have one afterward. Both faced multiple counts of unauthorized retention. The charges in the two indictments substantially overlap in one respect: Both men were charged with multiple counts of unauthorized retention of national defense information under Section 793(e) of Title 10 of the United States Code, part of a law known as the Espionage Act. In both cases, prosecutors picked a subset of the files recovered from the men’s homes during court-authorized searches — presumably, documents that were sensitive enough to impress a jury, but not so sensitive that it would be risky to discuss them in court — and brought a count based on each. Mr. Trump was charged with 38 such counts, and Mr. Bolton with eight. The indictments used their past statements against them. The indictments against both men cited their own public statements criticizing others for mishandling classified information, to underscore that they knew what they were doing was wrong. In Mr. Trump’s case, the indictment cited numerous statements he made during the 2016 presidential campaign about the need to vigorously enforce laws meant to protect classified information. At the time, Mr. Trump was using that issue to attack his rival, Hillary Clinton, for having used a private email server while secretary of state. In Mr. Bolton’s case, the indictment quoted extensively from comments he made in the spring of 2025 criticizing Trump administration officials who had discussed plans for an upcoming military strike in Yemen on the consumer app Signal, in a group chat that mistakenly included a journalist. Notably, the Justice Department under Mr. Trump did not treat that incident as a crime. Only Trump was charged with obstruction offenses. The charges in the two cases significantly diverged in another respect. Each man was charged with a set of offenses that the other did not face. In Mr. Trump’s case, his obstruction of efforts to retrieve files — including allegations that he caused a false statement to be made to law enforcement agents and conspired to conceal files from them — was a major part of his case. He faced eight additional charges that derived from that alleged behavior, which the indictment documented at length. Mr. Bolton’s indictment chided him for not telling the F.B.I. that he still possessed classified information when he reported that an apparent Iranian hacker had broken into his email account in 2021. But it did not charge him with obstruction. Only Bolton was charged with transmission offenses. Mr. Bolton was, however, charged with eight counts of unauthorized transmission of national defense information under Section 793(d), based on the allegations that he emailed or used a messenger app program to send diary entries to his relatives, even though they were not cleared to see classified information in them. The indictment of Mr. Trump recounted two incidents in which he was accused of showing classified files to people who were not authorized to receive them when he was no longer president, including a recorded interview at his club in Bedminster, N.J., with a writer and publisher of a forthcoming book, along with two staff members, during which he apparently showed them a classified military plan for attacking Iran. But while the indictment charged Mr. Trump with the unauthorized retention of that document, it did not charge him with showing it to people who were not approved to see it. Both got out of earlier trouble in part because of elections. There is one other notable parallel. Both men evaded at least some legal troubles because of an election. The criminal case against Mr. Trump over his handling of classified documents dissolved after he won the 2024 election. Judge Aileen M. Cannon of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida had unexpectedly dismissed the case before trial in July 2024 , ruling that the special counsel who brought the charges was improperly appointed. Her ruling conflicted with decades of decisions by higher courts. The Justice Department asked an appeals court to overturn her decision and reinstate the charges. But before the court acted, Mr. Trump won the election. Because the department considers sitting presidents temporarily immune from prosecution, it dropped the case against Mr. Trump. Four years earlier, in 2020, the Justice Department in the first Trump administration had opened a criminal and civil investigation into Mr. Bolton’s handling of classified information in connection with the publication of a memoir that criticized Mr. Trump . But in 2021, after the Biden administration took office, the department dropped that inquiry. The New York Times has reported that the current inquiry traces back to the U.S. government’s gathering of data from an adversary’s spy service, including emails with sensitive information that Mr. Bolton, while still working in the first Trump administration, appeared to have sent to people close to him on an unclassified system.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/17/us/trump-news-zelensky,politics,BBC,By Jeanna Smialek,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17trump-news-putin-hungary-zghq/17trump-news-putin-hungary-zghq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T13:20:37.036000+00:00,860c964534b02ea4b4526d4206cd699100f7a008

The measure faces long odds given the unwillingness of most Republican lawmakers to challenge President Trump, who would be all but certain to veto it. But a vote on the legislation, which is required, would put Congress on the record on whether to rein in Mr. Trump’s escalating and legally questionable military campaign against Venezuela . Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam B. Schiff of California, both Democrats, have teamed with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, on the resolution, worried that the Trump administration’s order of covert C.I.A. action in Venezuela could be the first step toward an all-out war. The measure would block the president from carrying out any military action “within or against” Venezuela unless it was “explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force” by Congress. Under the 1973 War Powers Act, aimed at limiting a president’s power to enter an armed conflict without the consent of Congress, such a resolution must be considered and voted upon under expedited procedures. The Trump administration has directed U.S. Special Operations forces to strike at least five boats off the coast of Venezuela since last month, claiming the vessels were transporting drugs, and escalated pressure on the country’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, with a buildup of troops and show of aerial threats . This week, Mr. Trump suggested he might consider a ground war. “We are certainly looking at land now,” he told reporters on Wednesday, “because we’ve got the sea very well under control.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Though fans have been barred from European soccer matches before, including at least twice this season, the involvement of an Israeli team coupled with a roiling debate around free speech in Britain and fears of antisemitism there escalated the criticisms of the ban. “This is the wrong decision,” Mr. Starmer said on Thursday on social media . “We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.” Multiple British government departments were in discussions on Friday to resolve the issues that led to the ban, a government spokesman said. Mr. Starmer’s political opponents condemned the decision in even stronger language, highlighting the pressure on Mr. Starmer’s governing Labour Party to respond.

c1cd59a77a39,OpenAI Blocks Videos of Martin Luther King Jr. After Racist Depictions,"mobile apps, artificial intelligence, copyrights, freedom of speech, openai, king center, martin luther king jr","OpenAI said Thursday that it was blocking people from creating videos using the image of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with its Sora app after users created vulgar and racist depictions of him. The company said it had made the decision at the request of the King Center as well as Dr. Bernice King, the civil rights leader’s daughter, who had objected to the videos. The announcement was another effort by OpenAI to respond to criticism of its tools, which critics say operate with few safeguards. “Some users generated disrespectful depictions of Dr. King’s image,” OpenAI said in a statement. “OpenAI has paused generations depicting Dr. King as it strengthens guardrails for historical figures.” OpenAI, which also operates ChatGPT, launched the latest version of Sora on Sept. 30, and it quickly became the most downloaded iPhone app in the United States. The app enables people to create videos from artificial intelligence using simple text prompts. Users created clips featuring King and other figures making invented remarks that were often vulgar or racist. People posted other realistic-looking videos that feature dead celebrities, including of Amy Winehouse hosting a cooking show, of Michael Jackson working at Walmart, and of a fake conversation between the actors James Gandolfini and Robin Williams. In response, Zelda Williams, Mr. Williams’s daughter, this month urged people to stop using her father’s likeness. “Please, just stop sending me AI videos of Dad,” Ms. Williams wrote. Ms. King agreed: “I concur concerning my father,” she wrote on social media . “Please stop.” OpenAI’s response was to say that representatives of dead public figures could request to limit the use of their likeness in Sora’s videos. “While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,” OpenAI said on Thursday. More broadly, experts worry that apps like Sora could become breeding grounds for disinformation and abuse. Other strikingly realistic videos made with the app depict ballot fraud, immigration arrests, protests, crimes and attacks on city streets. Sora, which is able to use the likeness of fictional characters, has raised questions about copyright infringement. The app has also garnered criticism in Hollywood, with studios expressing concern that videos generated with Sora have already infringed on copyrights of various films, shows and characters. With Sora, OpenAI has turned toward building a social network after years of focusing more on deeper research applications for artificial intelligence. Building a big user base for Sora could open up new ways of making money for the company, which is not profitable.

be9b8fec6a7c,U.S. Threatens Countries That Back a Fee to Clean Up Ship Pollution,"climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, us politics, vehicle emissions, regulation and deregulation, international trade, ships and shipping, pollution, cargo, international maritime organization","The limits of American influence are being tested on Friday, as the Trump administration brings a battering ram of trade and visa threats to try to stop a proposed global pollution tax on the shipping industry. At issue is a scheduled vote among the 176 countries that belong to the International Maritime Organization, an agency of the United Nations, to require cargo ships to lower their greenhouse gas emissions below a certain threshold or pay a fee. That proposal has the backing of the leading shipping lobby, and most of America’s most steadfast allies, including Britain, Canada, the European Union and Japan. China too supports the measure. A vote is expected Friday. The Trump administration has brought a raft of threats to dissuade countries from voting for the measure, including visa restrictions and additional fees on flagged ships from those countries landing at U.S. ports. On Thursday President Trump said he was “outraged” that the organization was considering a carbon-emissions price on global shipping. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form,” he wrote in a social media post. In a joint statement issued last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the United States is considering antitrust investigations into countries that support the measure and “blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.” The statement referred to the proposed fee as a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations” and said that it would raise shipping costs. The European Union then issued a two sentence statement of support for the tax proposal, saying it would “ensure a global level playing field.” The conflict at the I.M.O. comes at a time when the high seas have become a high stakes battleground for American power. The president has upended global trade with a series of unpredictable tariffs. The U.S. and China are charging extra fees on each other’s ships docking at their ports. Sam Hargreaves, a spokesman for Transport and Environment, an advocacy group that follows global shipping negotiations, said the Trump administration’s tariffs would have a far greater financial effect than emissions fees. “The additional costs to shipping companies and consumers they are concerned about are likely minimal compared to the potential impact of tariffs or other sanctions being threatened against supportive I.M.O. member states,” he said. In response to a request for comment, the State Department pointed to the joint statement. Traditional shipping fuel, also known as bunker fuel, is a heavy oil that produces carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide when burned. New kinds of fuels are being developed, including ammonia and hydrogen-based alternatives. The proposed Net-Zero Framework, as it is called, would require cargo ships weighing 5,000 tons or more to pay a fee if their carbon dioxide emissions exceed a threshold level and in effect, reward ships that use cleaner fuels. If passed, the levy would take effect in 2028 and would mark the first time an entire industry paid a price for its climate pollution. The proceeds would mostly be used to help the industry transition to less polluting fuels. The World Shipping Council called it a “carefully balanced regulatory package.” Another industry lobby, the International Chamber of Shipping, backed the measure too. “Only global rules will decarbonize a global industry,” its statement read . It had earlier estimated that the carbon fee would have a negligible effect on the price of goods. The threshold would grow more strict over time. It could allow the industry to switch to biofuels to meet the standards. That is a contentious approach, since biofuels are made from crops, and growing more crops to make fuel could contribute to deforestation. Many environmentalists said the targets fell short of their demands. This week’s planned vote follows a 2023 agreement by the International Maritime Organization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. Last year, it offered a more concrete plan, which included an industrywide carbon price. In April this year, countries voted on a draft agreement.

a40c1853ac3f,Salesforce Offers Its Services to Boost Trump’s Immigration Force,"salesforcecom, marc benioff, artificial intelligence, immigration and customs enforcement;ice, government contracting and procurement, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, us politics, donald trump, san francisco","Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, shocked San Franciscans last week when he said that he “fully supports” President Trump and wants National Guard troops deployed to their city. But his allegiance to Mr. Trump goes much further. Screenshots of internal documents and communications obtained by The New York Times show that Salesforce has pitched Immigration and Customs Enforcement on using the company’s artificial intelligence capabilities to help ICE staff up as Mr. Trump expands immigration raids and deportations around the country. Mr. Benioff’s support of the National Guard ran counter to the city’s famously liberal underpinnings and to his own reputation as a benefactor of progressive causes. San Francisco leaders, already outraged by those remarks, were upset to learn on Thursday that the homegrown company was trying to help Mr. Trump with his immigration crackdown. The internal documents include a five-page memo sent on Aug. 26 that explained how Salesforce is best suited to help the agency with “talent acquisition” to achieve its goal “to nearly triple its work force by hiring 10,000 new officers and agents expeditiously.” The company, which had hoped to land a paid contract, was responding to an ICE request that firms explain how they could help the agency hire more agents. It was not clear how much money the services could raise. Other Salesforce documents included a spreadsheet of ICE “opportunities,” the company’s term for possible contracts, as well as an internal brainstorming slide deck about how artificial intelligence agents might help ICE evaluate information sent to the agency’s tip line and improve investigations. The internal information was provided to The Times by an individual with ties to Salesforce who was granted anonymity because the person was not authorized to share it. The Times described the documents to Salesforce, and the company did not dispute their authenticity. Mr. Benioff declined to comment publicly for this article, and a Salesforce spokeswoman said the company does not discuss contracts. The company said in a statement that it has served the U.S. government under many administrations and that all of its customers are bound by company policies to use its products responsibly. Salesforce, which also contracted with ICE under the Obama and Biden administrations, is far from the only tech company helping ICE drastically expand its enforcement efforts under Mr. Trump. Palantir, the Denver-based software company co-founded by the conservative billionaire Peter Thiel, is a major partner of ICE. Microsoft and IBM also have contracts with the agency. Tech leaders have increasingly catered to Mr. Trump this year, from giving him gifts in the Oval Office to joining him at state dinners, as Mr. Benioff did in England last month. Critics have suggested that the executives are well aware that Mr. Trump can help their companies thrive — or try to punish them in various ways. Salesforce relies heavily on federal contracts and is looking to expand that business line. Mr. Benioff said in an earnings call on Sept. 4 that the U.S. government is “our largest and most important customer” and that its contracts across numerous departments are worth billions to the company. He cited the U.S. Army, U.S. Coast Guard and the Veterans Affairs Administration among the agencies that use Salesforce products. “But we’re starting to expand what we do even more,” he said. Deep in the company’s most recent earnings report is an acknowledgment of the risks of relying on government contracts. Politicians could change their policies, or budgets could dry up. And some partnerships might hurt the company’s image. “Our relationships with certain government entities may result in negative publicity or reputational harm,” the earnings report states. Salesforce is in various stages of trying to sign new ICE contracts, with some already completed, according to the spreadsheet tracking business possibilities with the agency. The Aug. 26 memo, a response to a request for information issued by ICE, explained how Salesforce is an “ideal platform” to modernize ICE’s hiring process and “implement an aggressive, high-yield marketing strategy” to reach recruits. Salesforce can help ICE, it says, “identify, engage and acquire the talent profile proven to drive ICE mission success, and in turn, administration priorities.” When a Salesforce account executive posted in the company’s Slack channel dedicated to discussing “sales and business development for ICE” that this document was “out the door,” her colleagues responded with fire emojis and the word “amazing,” according to a screenshot of the conversation. “I wish you the best of luck with this one!” another colleague wrote. San Francisco leaders were surprised on Thursday to learn that one of the city’s signature tech companies, with a rocket-shaped skyscraper that defines the city’s modern skyline, was working on software that could help the Trump administration expand its immigration enforcement efforts. Danny Sauter, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said it was more proof that Mr. Benioff is “straying farther and farther from San Francisco values.” Mr. Sauter said that as a sanctuary city, San Francisco aims to protect undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes, not round them up. “For someone to claim that they support San Francisco and then be embedded with ICE like this is deeply concerning,” he said. Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who represents the city, said on Thursday, “It’s completely unacceptable for any San Francisco company to help ICE scale up so that it can deploy more secret police to terrorize people in American neighborhoods.” At his annual Dreamforce conference in downtown San Francisco this week, Mr. Benioff hyped the company’s “agentic enterprise,” a business model that uses A.I. agents that can help companies work more efficiently, with little human intervention. At the Moscone Center, where the conference was held, it was sunshine and rainbows — literally. The décor included brightly colored cartoon characters and a man-made waterfall, and Mr. Benioff preached unity. “I want to put all of our political situations aside, all of our divisiveness, and just come together as one ohana right now,” he said from the stage, using the Hawaiian word for family. (Mr. Benioff has principally lived on the Big Island of Hawaii with his actual family for the past five years.) In an infomercial-style presentation from a circular stage, Mr. Benioff touted everyday uses for his A.I. agents. He talked with an executive from Williams Sonoma about how A.I. could help people plan their holiday menus and generate shopping lists, and with a leader from the jeweler Pandora about how it could help sell charm bracelets. There was no mention of its applications for immigration enforcement. The company’s ICE Slack channel included chatter about Salesforce employees attending a Border Security Expo in April with the hopes of meeting Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, to “applaud him on his efforts.” On Sept. 9, Salesforce staff met with Rob Thorne, the chief information security officer for ICE, and employees discussed in Slack how using A.I. to help ICE process its detainees represented a huge opportunity for Salesforce. Many residents in San Francisco were aghast after Mr. Benioff said that the National Guard should be deployed there. Mr. Benioff, a fourth-generation native of the city, has long been considered a liberal benefactor compared to other tech leaders who have been more libertarian or conservative. He hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton when she ran against Mr. Trump in 2016. He funded the campaign for a 2018 city ballot measure to tax businesses, including his own, to support homeless services. He canceled Salesforce travel to Indiana after the state enacted a law that allowed companies to refuse business to L.G.B.T.Q. people on religious grounds. To many San Franciscans, Mr. Benioff’s politics have taken a right turn during Mr. Trump’s second term. But he said last week that he had never been progressive and that he was a longtime Republican before he switched to become an independent voter. Some have blamed him for saying the National Guard should come to the city. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump reiterated that the deployment of federal troops to American cities was “just at the start” and that he wanted his administration to “start looking” at San Francisco. He also mentioned having “great support” in the city, which was seen as a reference to Mr. Benioff and Elon Musk, who backed Mr. Benioff’s call for the Guard. At the Dreamforce conference, Mr. Benioff hosted David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist now serving as Mr. Trump’s A.I. and crypto czar, for an onstage talk that centered around Mr. Sacks’s life story. Mr. Benioff said that the two were close friends and liked drinking bourbon together. That night, Mr. Sacks posted on X that Mr. Benioff had been “fawning” over him and included a photo of the Salesforce executive sloppily kissing his cheek. Mr. Benioff reposted it. Mr. Benioff has faced criticism for immigration-related Salesforce contracts before. In 2018, when the first Trump administration was separating families at the border, Salesforce employees and immigration activists pressured Mr. Benioff to cancel his company’s contract with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Salesforce did not cancel it, but Mr. Benioff did offer $250,000 to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. Jonathan Ryan, an immigration attorney who was the center’s executive director at the time, rejected the money, calling it dirty. A Salesforce spokeswoman did not comment Thursday on the matter. Mr. Ryan said in an interview this week from his home in Texas that he was not surprised that Salesforce was trying to win contracts with ICE this year. He felt that Mr. Benioff was like the vast majority of business leaders, motivated primarily by money. He said that Mr. Benioff told him, in a phone call from Hawaii back in 2018, that he would visit Texas to see the family separation crisis up close. He never heard from Mr. Benioff again.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/salesforce-benioff-ice.html,Technology,BBC,By Heather Knight,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16NAT-BENIOFF-ICE-fqmc/16NAT-BENIOFF-ICE-fqmc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T01:43:30+00:00,41094e5c659fdb9b06566d367415ba3ba721f79a
58a1fa0619f9,Covering an Artist With Unconventional Materials: Strict Rules and Time,"tehching hsieh, art, performance art, the new york times, dia beacon","Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. I was a sophomore in college when I first learned about Tehching Hsieh, the Taiwanese American artist who lived alone in a cage for one year between 1978 and 1979 for a work of all-consuming performance art. Flipping through my art history textbook, I stopped at a grid of portraits of a young man staring straight at me, as if posing for a passport photo, or a mug shot. Hsieh took a portrait of himself every day he spent in the cage; people could come and view him on appointed days. The passage of time is discernible only by the length of his hair. I remember thinking, This guy seems out of his mind . I never imagined that, 16 years later, I would be standing inside the same cage I had seen in my textbook. Hsieh had saved every element, down to his original tube of toothpaste, from “One Year Performance 1978-1979 (Cage Piece).” In late July, he installed the cage at Dia Beacon, a museum in the Hudson Valley in New York, for a retrospective — his first — which opened on Oct. 4. As a freelance journalist who covers the art world and contributes to The New York Times, I keep an eye out for art that challenges us to look at the world, and our lives, differently. Hsieh’s five yearlong performance art pieces — some of the most grueling the medium has ever seen — certainly tick that box. So when I learned this summer that Hsieh, now 74, would be opening his retrospective this fall, I knew I wanted to chronicle the process of putting it together. That’s how I found myself in the dark basement of Dia Beacon, as Hsieh and a cast of curators, conservators and art handlers examined the bars of the meticulously preserved cage. Someone from the facilities department asked whether the door was supposed to have a hinge. No, Hsieh replied with a smile: “It only opened once.” Hsieh is a mysterious figure with a cultlike following in the art world. He rarely attends parties or openings, and he stopped making art in 2000. Rather than paint and canvas, his artistic materials are strict rules and time. He is so allergic to the idea of playacting his work, rather than truly living it, that he refused to have his photograph taken inside the cage for my article, “The Artist Who Lived in a Cage for a Year.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

3b822585e724,Bolton Pleads Not Guilty to Charges of Mishandling Classified Documents,"us politics, classified information, john bolton, justice department, federal courts, ethics misconduct malfeasance","John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser to President Trump who became one of his most outspoken critics, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges he had mishandled classified information while a top White House aide. Mr. Bolton appeared in federal court in Greenbelt, Md., a day after he was indicted by a grand jury. The presiding judge, Timothy J. Sullivan, set two conditions to Mr. Bolton’s release, requiring him to hand over his passport to his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, and limiting his travel to the continental United States. The 18-count indictment against Mr. Bolton accused him of using personal email and a messaging app to share more than 1,000 pages of “diary” notes about his day-to-day activities as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser in 2018 and 2019. The notes, which were sent to two family members who did not have security clearances, included national defense information, such as details classified as top secret, according to the indictment. While Mr. Bolton is part of a string of perceived enemies of the president to become prosecutorial targets, the federal investigation into him gained momentum during the Biden administration, when U.S. intelligence agencies gathered what former officials have described as troubling evidence. The prosecution appeared to follow normal department channels. Kelly O. Hayes, the U.S. attorney in Maryland, was among the career prosecutors to sign off on the charges in conjunction with the Justice Department’s national security division. By contrast, Mr. Trump in recent weeks has removed or sidelined prosecutors in order to secure indictments against two of his longtime targets: James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, New York’s attorney general. If convicted of the charges, Mr. Bolton, 76, could spend the rest of his life in prison. Each count carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/politics/bolton-pleads-not-guilty.html,politics,BBC,By Minho Kim and Devlin Barrett,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17trump-news-bolton-topart-pbhq/17trump-news-bolton-topart-pbhq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T15:36:19+00:00,1ae49558e5413db84572ebaf225a210a0483c127
0366b51fa6e3,Trump Pushes Indiana Lawmakers to Redraw State Maps,"us politics, state legislature, redistricting and reapportionment, gerrymandering, federalism, donald trump, indiana, us","President Trump called Indiana Senate Republicans on Friday morning to encourage them to redraw the state’s congressional maps to benefit Republicans ahead of the midterm elections, according to two people familiar with the call. Mr. Trump was expected to ask the state lawmakers to support a new map that would eliminate the state’s two Democratic districts and give Republicans all nine congressional seats, the people said. The call is part of an escalating White House pressure campaign on Republican-led states to redraw congressional maps to help the Trump administration retain control of the U.S. House in the midterm elections next year. Vice President JD Vance has made two separate trips to Indiana to meet with state lawmakers and make the case for why the state should redraw the maps. Mr. Trump’s involvement signals that the White House is concerned that not all Republican lawmakers in Indiana are on board with the plan. The White House has lobbied Indiana state officials to call a special session to approve a new map, but officials have encountered resistance from Indiana Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, a Republican, according to people briefed on the process.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/politics/trump-indiana-senate-state-maps.html,politics,BBC,By Tyler Pager,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17trump-news-redistricting-topart-hqfk/17trump-news-redistricting-topart-hqfk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T15:22:15.631000+00:00,b080fbec7547055d24049d56dfb18ac07e378326
573548880138,Unions Return to Court as Trump Eyes Additional Cuts During Shutdown,"us politics, federal budget, federal aid, donald trump, american federation of government employees, interior department, susan illston, layoffs;furloughs","Days after a federal court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from laying off workers during the shutdown, a set of unions said that they had evidence the government might try to violate that order and fire thousands of civil servants imminently. The possible violation prompted the judge in the case to schedule an emergency status conference for Friday, the day that President Trump had promised to unfurl a list of steep cuts targeting what he has described as “Democrat programs.” The accusations and attacks framed the rising stakes of a governmentwide closure that has reached its 17th day, with seemingly no end in sight. On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans appeared no closer to negotiating a deal that would fund federal operations into the new fiscal year. And, at the White House, Mr. Trump remained disengaged from the work to forge a truce, opting instead to leverage the ongoing stalemate to slash the budget without the approval of Congress. So far, the administration has paused or canceled about $28 billion in federal aid that had been primarily reserved for Democratic-led cities and states, while embarking on an effort to lay off about 4,000 workers across eight major federal agencies. Mr. Trump also promised a fuller roster of steeper cuts, saying of his plans at one point: “It’s thousands of people and it’s billions of dollars.” The president declared that on Wednesday, just after a federal court temporarily blocked his attempts to fire government employees during the shutdown. Judge Susan Illston of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California sided with unions, which had sued, as she blasted the White House for having “taken advantage of the lapse in government spending.” But lawyers for the unions, led by the American Federation of Government Employees, told the court late Thursday that they had reason to believe the Trump administration might be trying to violate the judge’s order. They said in a filing that they had learned one agency, the Interior Department, was “actively preparing a large-scale” layoff, known as a reduction in force. They estimated the cuts could range in the thousands, and they said they expected it to begin on Monday. The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not clear if those layoffs would occur, or if they had been in the works before the shutdown. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has presided over a wide-ranging campaign to shrink the federal work force, which is expected to employ 300,000 fewer people at the end of this year compared with January, many of whom were fired or pressured to resign. Still, the allegations prompted Judge Illston late Thursday to move up the deadline by which the government must provide more details about its layoff plans. Now, the administration must file that response by Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern time, before she is set to hold another conference to discuss the allegations.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/politics/trump-shutdown-cuts-unions.html,politics,BBC,By Tony Romm,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17DC-SHUTDOWN-CUTS-01-gjlw/17DC-SHUTDOWN-CUTS-01-gjlw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T14:51:37+00:00,3fd450bfa53ebbf3325d1a418e0c84383d63468e

But Not for Fossil Fuels.,"climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, us politics, federal lands, regulation and deregulation, mining, oil and gasoline, offshore drilling, environment, coal, air pollution, energy department, epa, interior department, closings","More than 700,000 federal employees have been sidelined and thousands more are at risk of being fired as the government shutdown drags on. But the workers responsible for carrying out the president’s plans for more fossil fuels and less wind and solar power are still hard at work. Some are approving permits for companies that want to extract metals, coal, oil and gas from public lands and federal waters. Others are rolling back limits on the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change. On Thursday the Bureau of Land Management approved the expansion of a copper mine on public land in Utah. Earlier this week the Interior Department prepared to open more than 250,000 acres of land in Wyoming and Nebraska to oil drilling, and held a coal lease sale for access to Montana’s Powder River Basin. And at the Environmental Protection Agency, employees are finalizing a plan to allow more mercury emissions from coal plants, according to two people familiar with the work underway. Charlotte Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said the agency was doing what was necessary in light of President Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency. “Work related to permitting, leasing and other essential energy operations is continuing as excepted work to help strengthen the nation’s energy security, maintain reliable supplies and protect American consumers from disruption,” Ms. Taylor said. Most experts say that there is no national energy emergency, pointing to record amounts of oil and gas that is being produced in the United States. Electricity demand, however, is on the rise, driven largely by the explosion of data centers as well as population growth and the rise of artificial intelligence applications. At the same time, the Trump administration has been trying to slow or stop the expansion of renewable energy that could add to the nation’s electricity supply.

1f2e0628369d,"How would Putin, who faces an international arrest warrant, get to Hungary to see Trump?",,"President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin say they plan to meet in Hungary in the coming weeks, but a potentially major roadblock stands in the way. To get there, Mr. Putin will need to pass through airspace over European countries that belong to the International Criminal Court. And that court has a warrant out for the Russian leader’s arrest. On one hand, that very arrest warrant makes Hungary a natural choice for the meeting. The nation is in the process of dropping out of the court, a move it initiated earlier this year when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visited President Viktor Orban of Hungary in Budapest. The I.C.C. has also issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Netanyahu. But to get to Hungary, Mr. Putin will likely need to fly over nations — such as Poland, Romania or Ukraine — that are party to the Rome Statute , the treaty that established the court. Given that, questions have arisen over whether Mr. Putin could be subject to arrest while in transit. “I think the answer is: He just goes,” said Philip Bednarczyk, the Warsaw office director for the German Marshall Fund. Mr. Bednarczyk said that while I.C.C.-aligned nations can arrest someone subject to a warrant who travels over their airspace, it is not necessarily the case that they must — especially if they are not sure exactly which plane he’s on. “It’s risky, but it leaves the door open for Putin to fly on over,” he said. Alternatively, the United States could ask an ally like Poland to allow Mr. Putin’s flight path in service of diplomacy, Mr. Bednarczyk said. When asked whether the arrest warrants would apply in Mr. Putin’s case — or whether there might be some sort of diplomatic exemption — the I.C.C. public affairs office said only that states must enforce arrest warrants as “a legal obligation to the Court.” The I.C.C., which responded by email, added that “in case of noncooperation, the Court may make a finding” and alert an oversight group.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/politics/putin-budapest-trump-icc-arrest-warrant.html,politics,BBC,By Jeanna Smialek,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17trump-news-putin-hungary-zghq/17trump-news-putin-hungary-zghq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T13:20:37+00:00,4b8148bff664cd78714e7a6176ea101226297956
8a5be2c0731c,Russia Jails Street Band for Performing Antiwar Songs,"russia, saint petersburg, vladimir putin, russian invasion of ukraine (2022), ukraine, civil unrest","A Russian court has sentenced three members of a popular street band to jail after they performed antiwar and anti-Kremlin songs in St. Petersburg, as Moscow continues to crack down on open displays of dissent against its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. On Thursday, a district court sentenced Diana Loginova, the lead singer of Stoptime who goes by the stage name of Naoko, and Vladislav Leontyev, the band’s drummer, to 13 days of administrative detention. Aleksandr Orlov, the guitarist, was sentenced to 12 days. They were found guilty of organizing a concert that obstructed pedestrian access to a subway station. The band members were detained on Wednesday and denied the charges, pointing out that no one had complained that they made it difficult to enter the station. Court records showed that another case was opened against Ms. Loginova, 18, for allegedly discrediting the Russian Army. If she is found guilty, she could be fined. The number of subscribers to the band’s Telegram channel has surged this week, to 37,000 on Friday from 11,000 on Monday. In its last post on the social media app, Stoptime said it would not comment on the situation and confirmed all future performances were suspended.

b75bbb5bae75,"Funeral Is Held for Raila Odinga, a Pillar of Kenya’s Democracy","funerals, raila odinga, william ruto, uhuru muigai kenyatta, kenya","Kenya held a state funeral on Friday for Raila Odinga, a former prime minister and opposition leader whose decades of political struggle made him a powerful symbol of the country’s democracy. Thousands of people attended the funeral, held at Nyayo National Stadium in the capital, Nairobi, many waving handkerchiefs and bearing large portraits of Mr. Odinga, who died Wednesday at age 80 in India, where he had gone for medical treatment. At the funeral, President William Ruto of Kenya paid his respects to Mr. Odinga. “Every once in a generation, there comes a leader whose impact transcends their moment, whose courage inspires change and whose vision shapes destinies,” he said. Mr. Odinga “may no longer walk with us, but his spirit lives within every Kenyan and every African,” Mr. Ruto added, standing on a dais before the coffin, which was draped with the national flag. The presidents of Somalia and Ethiopia and other senior politicians from the region also attended the funeral. Mr. Ruto has declared seven days of national mourning for Mr. Odinga, who played a pivotal role in the fight for multiparty democracy as the Cold War ended and as Kenya emerged to become one of Africa’s leading powers. On Thursday, at least three people were killed at a memorial for Mr. Odinga held at a different stadium in Nairobi, according to Kenyan news outlets, when the police, apparently trying to control the large crowds, opened fire and used tear gas.

1292e02e4c07,Investors Shudder at Signs of Loan Trouble in Banks,"stocks;bonds, banking and finance, debt, bankruptcy","Through the summer, stocks were riding a resilient economy and corporate earnings that, in large part, exceeded analysts expectations. But as summer has turned to fall, investors are being rattled by a renewed trade dispute with China and reports from banks of souring debts on their balance sheets. The S&P 500 index was flat in early trading on Friday, after recording a loss the day before when troubles at smaller banks spooked investors. The regional bank Zions Bancorp on Thursday disclosed a $50 million charge-off related to loans made to a pair of real estate investors looking to buy distressed commercial mortgages. Western Alliance Bank also disclosed on Thursday that it believed it was the victim of fraud involving commercial real estate loans and that it had sued the borrowers. The disclosures come on the heels of the downfall of the subprime auto lender Tricolor and the auto parts supplier First Brands Group, with banks including JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bancorp and Jefferies disclosing losses from loans to the companies. “My antenna goes up when things like that happen,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, said on the bank’s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday. “And I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Those bankruptcies also flared concerns that the strength of the consumer, which has propped up the economy since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, might be waning. With the government shutdown, economic data tracking the current health of the economy is sparse, adding to the nervousness. Major stock indexes have soared to record highs, prompting worries that the market has become overvalued and that a three-year bull market may be slowing down. And with the end of the year approaching, investors tend to try to protect their gains, while banks pull back from the market to shrink their balance sheets ahead of important regulatory calculations made at year end. That can make financial markets more vulnerable to short-term shocks. Bank stocks, in particular, are reflecting the jitters. The KBW Bank index has tumbled 7 percent from its peak in September. On Thursday it fell 3.6 percent, its largest one-day decline since April. And that’s despite big banks like JPMorgan, Citi and Goldman Sachs reporting bumper profits for the recent quarter, with all three banks’ share prices moving more than 5 percent lower this month. Zions and Western Alliance both fell by double digits on Thursday, after their losses were digested by stock investors. Jefferies, the investment bank that was involved in First Brands’ financing, sought to assure its shareholders that its losses in the bankruptcy would be limited. But its stock fell almost 11 percent on Thursday, adding to its recent losses. The stock is down roughly 38 percent since the start of the year. Most analysts downplayed any immediate risk to the broader economy. Corporate borrowing costs remain low, which is a sign of healthy investor demand to lend and robust strength among borrowers. “Is this weakness warranted? Yes,” noted analysts at Bank of America in a research note this month, citing the concerns stemming from recent bankruptcies. “Importantly, does this signal something bigger? Not per our assessment as broad credit market fundamentals remain in good shape,” the analysts added. The sharp stock slide on Thursday for both Zions and Western Alliance instead shows investors’ sensitivity to the potential for risks lurking in some of the darker corners of debt markets, said Justin D’Ercole, the founder of ISO-MTS, a hedge fund that specializes in bank debt. “We have a serious credit bubble right now,” he said. He doesn’t necessarily believe the bubble is about to burst, but that markets are becoming more vulnerable to the economic outlook. “You need a perfect economy, with low volatility, very stable interest rates and everything else to go right for this stuff not to become an issue,” he said. Mr. Dimon said that recent bankruptcies should be a warning of more unpleasant surprises ahead. “Everyone should be forewarned on this,” he said. Longer-dated Treasury yields, typically a haven asset that investors buy during periods of worry, rose in value on Thursday, pushing yields lower. The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 4 percent to its lowest in more than a year. Ian Lyngen, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said that “the aggressiveness of the move” in bonds highlighted the vulnerability of markets to bad news about the economy or financial conditions. As recent debt defaults have raised worries about other bad loans and a pullback in bank lending, there has been a rush to shore up short-term cash loans, said analysts, used by a host of market players to cover fluctuations in daily costs. Cash had already been leaving the market to pay corporate taxes and to pay for recently auctioned government bonds, raising demand for new funding. The increased demand for cash at a time when willingness to lend in money markets has appeared more scarce has pushed up the cost of borrowing cash overnight — a vital source of funding that lubricates the financial system and helps money flow where it is required each day — to banks, hedge funds and other investors. On Thursday, one crucial interest rate drifted outside the target range set by the Federal Reserve for the first time in more than a year, a sign that the financial system is starting to get clogged. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, rose to 4.29 percent on Thursday, above the upper bound of the Fed’s target range, which is set at 4.25 percent. It is very rare for short term interest rates like SOFR to move out of the Fed’s target. Thursday’s move arrived after a period of increasingly jumpy money markets — the broad term for the short term funding markets that help keep the financial system moving and are separate from corporate bond and loan markets. For now, the market moves remain modest, but investors and analysts are watching short-term interest rates very closely in case the current funding strain continues. “It’s too early for me to tell whether this funding demand will fade or sustain at this point,” said Guy LeBas, an interest rate strategist at Janney Capital Management. Ultimately, the Fed has the tools to step in and fix a funding squeeze should it worsen. “Markets are a little more skittish,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities. Mr. Goldberg also said he expected the volatility to abate, for now. “I’m not dismissing it,” he said. “I am just a little dubious that this will be what breaks the camel’s back.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/business/stock-market-banks-debt.html,Business,BBC,By Joe Rennison,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17BIZ-STOCKS-WORRY-lwvg/17BIZ-STOCKS-WORRY-lwvg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T15:17:16+00:00,ed08d32d9ab3fc32330f235e06cde08ddfda397c
0104d7ba031d,Five International Movies to Stream Now,"movies, documentaries, boca chica","‘Milisuthando’ Stream it on Criterion Channel . The South African artist and filmmaker Milisuthando Bongela had never really encountered racism until she was 9 years old — or so she thought. Born in 1985, Bongela was raised in the Transkei, one of South Africa’s many Bantustans: segregated regions that the apartheid government claimed conferred autonomy on the country’s native Black population, when in fact, they only entrenched white control of the land and ideas about racial purity. After apartheid was outlawed, and the Transkei was dissolved in 1994, Bongela and her family moved to Cape Town, where she experienced a mixed community for the first time — and what it felt like to be perceived as “different.” In “Milisuthando,” a stunningly poetic reflection on her history and that of her nation, Bongela tries to untangle the complex, often contradictory feelings that characterized her upbringing. There was an idyllic quality to her childhood environment, yet, as she realized only later, it was rooted in a deeply internalized sense of racial inferiority and parochialism, whose enduring traces she uncovers through interviews with her older relatives. “I have to ask dangerous questions,” she says in the lyrical voice-over that ties together the film’s cascade of archival materials, home videos and scenes of performance. Across five chapters, beginning with her birth and ending with the making of this very film with Marion Isaacs, a white South African friend and producer, Bongela does exactly that, examining her memories, her relationships and her own convictions to ascertain what it means to really, truly belong. ‘Guardians of the Formula’ Stream it on Tubi . Dragan Bjelogrlic’s drama is set in 1958, in the midst of the global arms race, as various countries rushed to develop nuclear weapons to consolidate their geopolitical positions in the Cold War. But unlike the typical thrillers set in the era, like Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” “Guardians of the Formula” (also inspired by a true story) is concerned less with the making of the bomb and more with the terrible cost of that race — and those who dedicated themselves to cleaning up its lethal messes. The movie opens in a lab in France, where Georges Mathé (Alexis Manenti), a professor, is experimenting with mice to find a cure for exposure to radiation. Success still eludes him when he’s enlisted to treat a group of Yugoslavian physicists who suffered an accident at a nuclear research institute near Belgrade. Prof. Mathé is ethically opposed to the atomic bomb and reluctant to help those involved in its making, but he’s also driven by a commitment to scientific progress — and to saving lives. The leader of the Yugoslav cohort, Prof. Dragoslav Popovic (Radivoje Bukvic), is battling his own demons while his cells battle the effects of radiation; in flashbacks, we see how state pressure (and his own obsession with cracking the code) made him put himself and his students in danger. These two prodigious scientists, one tasked with facilitating death and the other with keeping it at bay, become the two poles that structure this handsomely shot and tautly edited film. But the movie’s real heroes are ordinary people: the working-class French people who volunteer to participate in Mathé’s experimental bone marrow transplants — the first to be performed on humans — and take on great risk for the sake of complete strangers.

b90784af14b8,Brandi Carlile Climbed Music’s Peak. Then She Had to Start Over.,"pop rock music, personal profile;people story, brandi carlile","When Brandi Carlile woke up in an unfamiliar barn one morning last fall, she was a little lost, more than a little hung over and feeling unexpectedly, profoundly alone. She had arrived the day after her final Joni Jam, the epic series of concerts that Carlile had helped orchestrate at the Hollywood Bowl with the long-elusive Joni Mitchell, one of her lifelong heroes, alongside a constellation of rock and pop luminaries. The performances capped a period of incandescent ascent for Carlile, the singer-songwriter with the golden-ranging voice, 11 Grammys and a sideline as an icon whisperer. Her musical idols — Sir Elton John! — were now her regular-phone-call besties. She had a devoted wife and two daughters, a family compound stuffed with loved ones and an acclaimed supergroup . She was in almost every respect at the top of the mountain: “I had done everything,” she said. “Twenty-five years of career-development work, in five or six years.” And yet, she was also at “a breaking point, where I realized I had sort of totally forgotten how to stand on my own two feet.” In that rural refuge in upstate New York, she wrote a poem that captured her mood: “Why is it heroic to untether? / How is alone some holy grail?” It was a song. And a midlife crisis. The verses became “Returning to Myself,” the title track off her new album , due Oct. 24. She recorded it with Aaron Dessner of the National — the man with the barn studio — the first time they’d worked together, and he later pulled in his pal Justin Vernon, of Bon Iver. The result is a sound that pinpricks her usual plaintive guitars and orchestral strings with occasional distortion and delay. Except for one song, she is the only vocalist — the background harmonies are just her protean voice, stacked on top of itself. The project and the new collaborators “put me in a really permissive space, sonically,” she said. “But it didn’t feel new. It felt really old. Like back to my very beginnings, when I first started writing songs, and the way I first felt living outside of Seattle.” At 44, Carlile, who grew up and still lives in rural Washington, has been a bandleader for more than a quarter-century; the symbiosis of writing with her bandmates, particularly the twin guitarists Phil and Tim Hanseroth, was ingrained. This record, she started on her own, to tunnel into her story herself. It is, in her words, a turning-point album, modeled after Lucinda Williams’s “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,” or Emmylou Harris’s “Wrecking Ball.” It has the luster and confidence of an artist realizing her prime, finding memory and maturity in the lyrics. “I’m not scared at all about what people think about the album,” she said. “I’m way past that, and I’ve never felt that way before putting out music.” We were lounging, one recent afternoon, in a greenroom at Electric Lady, the storied Greenwich Village recording studio, where Carlile had just played her album for invited guests. Sipping an espresso martini and rife with anecdotes, she mouthed the words and pounded along to the beats (“I know every drum fill, every tom hit”). Cross-legged from her club chair, she nonchalantly seduced the whole audience. Later, when she had at last been pried by her wife, Catherine Shepherd, from greeting everyone in the room, Carlile plopped onto a couch and put her feet, in white Chucks, up. She wore jeans and a Valentino tweed jacket, decorated with stylist-supplied pins and one of her own: a tiny silver guitar with working strings, a gift from John. When she removed the blazer, she morphed from rock star into real-life Brandi Carlile, complete with a hole in her T-shirt. When she was younger, Carlile said, she had “tunnel vision. I couldn’t even carry on a conversation with you unless we were talking about music and my ambition. But now it’s really diversified. I feel like I’m a more balanced and centered woman, at this age.” In a nearly two-hour conversation, I saw them both: the far-reaching artist, with a best-selling memoir, who has built a brand — and multiple music festivals — propelling herself creatively, and the local Pacific Northwest mother (her daughters are 7 and 10) who lives near the elementary school she attended, relishes grocery shopping and cooking, and spends as much of her time as possible on the water, crabbing, shrimping and catching rockfish and halibut. (She may be knuckle-deep in fish guts, but her boat is named Captain Fantastic, à la John’s 1975 album.) In neither case is she a loner; she and her bandmates, who have married into her and her wife’s families, live in a bohemian utopia of communal child-rearing and music-making, yards apart in the wooded foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Carlile has refused to pave the path leading to her home, “because,” she said, “that sound of car wheels on a gravel road means somebody’s coming. And whatever’s happening in the day, it’s about to change.” That made her solo foray all the more rare, and — at least at the beginning — unsettling for her. But lyrically, it worked. “It was just coming, all fully formed — like she’s tapping into some ancient thread of consciousness,” said Dessner, a go-to for cinematic, emotionally driven compositions, and a regular producer for Taylor Swift since “Folklore.” “Musically, for me, it’s always really interesting when people are in transition,” he added. Carlile had long been on his wish list. “She’s incredibly personable and magnetic, but she also has these legitimate artistic gifts,” he said. “She’s just one of those singular voices in music.” In the studio and out, he found her unusually open. “A lot of artists are more cagey,” he said. “Brandi is very much about community and building connections.” One of her sparks was attending Lilith Fair, Sarah McLachlan’s all-women music fest, as a teenager. It inspired Girls Just Wanna , an annual weekend-long showcase of female and nonbinary artists — many of them queer — that Carlile has programmed in Mexico since 2019. (Between her band and her friends, “I travel there every year with 28 kids,” Carlile said. “Their sunscreen will never be topped up more.”) McLachlan, who performed in 2024, called it “a well-run, inclusive, joyous festival.” “Her ability to manage so much at once with such grace is inspiring,” she said of Carlile. Outside of her own, career-making songs — like “The Joke,” an anthemic ballad for the persecuted, and “The Story,” a soaring love song — Carlile is known for her collaborations as a vocalist and producer. She has duetted with a pantheon of rock, country, folk and pop stars, including John; “Who Believes in Angels?,” their album together, was released in April. In 2019, as a producer, she helped coax the rabble-rousing country star Tanya Tucker into a comeback record . It won two Grammys, including best country album. When Carlile gets involved with an artist she loves, “I’m obsessed,” she said. “I see the whole path, from the first downbeat to the Grammy.” (She is the rare artist for whom having a big Grammy night six albums deep into her career proved trajectory-changing.) Producing a record for the country singer Brandy Clark, she said, “I would stay up, beat myself up at night,” worrying about Clark and “how she does interviews and whether or not she gives herself enough credit as a songwriter.” (Their admonishing crooner, “Dear Insecurity,” also won a Grammy last year.) Carlile’s most notable pairing has been with Mitchell, the 81-year-old folk legend. When they met, six or so years ago, Carlile said that Mitchell, who was recovering from a debilitating 2015 brain aneurysm, seemed to believe that culture had passed her by — that music fans “didn’t appreciate” her, Carlile said. “Not just that, but they didn’t even like her.” That misinterpretation was enough, Carlile said, to galvanize her into arranging what became an astonishing run of performances hailing Mitchell, who sang, robustly and delightedly, from her thronelike chair. It was, Carlile said, “me getting the front-row seat to a miracle.” It ended because it had to; Mitchell’s music is such a draw, Carlile said, that if the concerts didn’t stop, “I would just do that.” But Mitchell herself was onto other things, like her paintings and a planned biopic. “The less she wants to do it,” Carlile said of the Joni Jams, “the happier I am for her.” She still visits, when she has the fortitude. “Joni will drink your ass under the table,” Carlile vowed. “She’s really burly; people don’t know.” On “Returning to Myself,” there’s a sweet and funny, sax-spiked ode to her, called “Joni,” that celebrates her as “a wild woman.” (One of Mitchell’s favorite places to party, Carlile said, is around a tombstone she owns in Hollywood — she’ll turn up there with a picnic of sandwiches and Champagne to dance, with friends, on her own grave.) When Carlile played her the song, she said, Mitchell only laughed in unexpected places. “And when it was over, she just said, ‘You [expletive].’ But she was beaming.” The Hanseroth twins, who are 51 and have been inseparably working with Carlile since she was 18, had no expectation that they would be making another album so soon after the Elton and Joni trains stopped. Shepherding all those other projects, alongside her own career, Carlile “just seemed really spent,” Tim Hanseroth said, in a joint phone interview with his brother. Then again, he added, “she operates at a high level of performance, not like the rest of us do. She’s kind of a machine that way.” Onstage, though, she can still be walloped by emotions. “When I first walked out onstage at Madison Square Garden, I cried,” she said. In the listening session, the achingly tender “You Without Me,” about the moment a parent realizes their child’s fledgling independence, made me weep. “About half the time when I sing it, I have to, like, go to another place,” she said. “And if I look out and I see another woman crying while I’m singing it, it’s like, that’s it.” (The track had originally appeared on her album with John, and he suggested it for this one. “Get that [expletive] banjo off!” he demanded, of the song it replaced.) When Carlile emerged from Long Pond, Dessner’s studio, with a clutch of nearly finished songs, she and her band high-tailed it to Los Angeles, where they worked with the producer Andrew Watt , who’d also done the Carlile-John LP. He and the introspective Dessner have almost comically opposing vibes. “You don’t ever have to worry about what’s on his mind,” Tim Hanseroth said of Watt. “It’s coming out of his mouth half a second later — which is great.” Vernon’s drop-ins provided the finishing magic. The first day, “He was wearing an Emmylou Harris ‘Wrecking Ball’ T-shirt,” Carlile said. “It was a sign.” She described his contributions as “otherworldly.” She is so glued to the material that she has, unusually, not been able to let it go. The galvanizing political rocker “Church & State” had a spoken-word recitation of the First Amendment. Performing it at the Red Rocks amphitheater in Colorado last month, she screamed that part. “I decided I liked that better. So now I’m going to go in and record over the talking bit, and have it be screaming.” (The crowd loved it.) In “Returning to Myself,” Carlile wonders aloud about what it means to be solitary, asking, “Is it evolving turning inward?” She made her exploration. What did she conclude? “I don’t think so,” she said. “I do think it is essential to learn how to be steady in yourself.” But “aloneness is not necessary to find yourself.” It’s just one starting point.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/arts/music/brandi-carlile-returning-to-myself.html,Culture,BBC,By Melena Ryzik and Chantal Anderson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/26/multimedia/26cul-brandi-carlile-promo/26cul-brandi-carlile--02-bpqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T15:06:30+00:00,e93e85a317ad60d0bfad08a199beeaa4256321b8
5de51d856e8b,Looking at the Unseeable With Gerhard Richter,"art, gerhard richter, fondation vuitton","What does it mean for an artist to declare, as Gerhard Richter did in 2017, that their painterly output is “complete?” It means we can identify a beginning and an end, with an implied trajectory in between, supported by the fact that Richter subsequently numbered his catalog of paintings from 1 to 952. This is how a vast retrospective that just opened at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris unfolds, with 275 pieces — spanning sculpture, drawings and paintings — across 34 rooms. The exhibition covers six decades of work by the artist who was born in 1932 in Dresden, Germany, where he lived under fascism and then communism before fleeing to study art in the West, in Düsseldorf. Today, the artist’s practice is devoted to drawing, but it is his work as a painter that remains unparalleled. In spite of the implication of orderly lineage, Richter’s work defies a straightforward sense of artistic evolution. The only constants in his oeuvre, which takes in every traditional genre — portrait, landscape, history painting, still life, abstraction — are change, relentless curiosity and, perhaps most of all, an insistent question: What is an image? His painting “Tisch” (1962), has the daunting catalog position of painting No. 1. It introduces the trademark blur and use of found photographic imagery for which Richter is now well-known. Based on an image sourced from a 1950s edition of Domus, an Italian design magazine, the large canvas shows a modern white table in a slightly compressed picture plane, its angular legs almost floating against a plain background of dark and light grays. The scene is, however, obscured: A roiling mass of sweeping, agitated strokes hovers over the center of the image like a cataract, or an accident, or an exasperated defacement, or all of the above. A wall text tells us that the artist originally painted the table as it was, directly from the source image; dissatisfied, he smeared the magazine photograph with solvents and then reproduced the result, in which the table has all but disappeared. Just by looking, we would never know which came first: the table or its obliteration. Time is scrambled by a maelstrom of gray that tells us in a few fell swoops that painting, in Richter’s work, is always an intervention in reality. More works in grisaille tones follow, based on a range of found images, including newspaper clippings, studio portraits and family photographs: a raft of American planes bombing Dresden in 1944, eight Chicago nursing students who met grisly deaths, an Uncle Rudi who was killed early in World War II, an empty wooden chair. Richter painted these figures and objects with photorealist exactitude, only to blur them by dragging a dry broad brush across the still-wet paint on the canvas — not so much erasing as displacing what was depicted and adding another layer to the final work by emphasizing its painted surface. “The blurring is an opportunity to express the fleetingness of our ability to perceive,” Richter said in a 1972 interview with the writer Rolf Schön. This “ability to perceive” applies to great historical moments, and also to everyday ones. Rather than flatten the subjects of these paintings, Richter’s treatment requires that we see how history, particularly of the conflict-ridden 20th century, lives in the smallest, most incidental details. We are all part of its relentless flow and, while we may freeze this instance or that, no single image will suffice. Richter’s encyclopedic approach is at once precise and beguiling. For the German pavilion at the 1972 Venice Biennale, the artist painted 48 black-and-white portraits of great men — composers, writers, scientists, philosophers. You may only recognize a few (I got six), but that’s the point: A neutral collection of faces loom, imposing an official history that is now obscure to most. Around this time, Richter was still painting in grays, though often laid on thick. He zoomed in so close on his subjects — the moon, the Himalayas, aerial cityscapes, clouds — that the canvases verge on abstraction. He also extended his blur technique to colored landscapes that look like everywhere and nowhere. This mode of painting continues through the 1980s, while Richter was concurrently making works about color and, sometimes, its absence. (I may not have recognized Anton Webern in “48 Portraits,” but I certainly remember Richter’s famous “Candle” from the album cover of Sonic Youth’s 1988 “Daydream Nation.”) In “1024 Farben” — a series that continued, in various configurations, from the 1970s to the 2010s — a grid of 1,024 randomly sequenced color squares dance across the canvas in an image made of hues alone. Three works from 1972 to 1974, all titled “Gray” are just that: large canvases painted in a single tone — one matte; one stippled; one shiny, like lacquer. Gray, Richter is quoted saying in the accompanying wall text, “has the power to make ‘nothing’ visible.” These paintings we stand looking at are “pictures of nothing.” Other times, we are looking at something that is at once represented yet not quite visible: not unseen, but perhaps unseeable. In 1988, while working on vividly hued abstractions made by blurring thickly painted surfaces with a giant squeegee, Richter returned to gray and realism to make a cycle of paintings called “October 18, 1977.” The title is the date on which four members of the far-left Baader-Meinhof terrorist group killed themselves in a south German prison, and the paintings blur and distort newspaper images from the time. The news media printed stark images of the group’s young members when they were arrested and after they were dead, as well as the sympathizers who mourned them. Richter’s paintings are likewise startling: A woman lies dead, in triplicate, with a dark bruise visible on her neck from the electrical cord she used to hang herself. A figure hangs from a noose in a cell. Each painting is just blurred enough that, if you didn’t know what it depicted, you might not guess — but the sense of something ominous is overwhelming: Representation of some subjects must remain incomplete or implied, like a question without an answer. Richter has said that he wanted to avoid the obvious, sensationalized images of these young people’s deaths, but found himself inexorably drawn to them. The same is true of a series of images that form the basis for a cycle of four monumental canvases titled “Birkenau” (2014). In an essay by the French philosopher Georges Didi-Huberman, the artist came across four photographs taken secretly by prisoners at the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. Richter has said that he originally intended to reproduce them on canvases, but found his strategy inadequate. So he began to cover the images with paint, using the squeegee he had employed for his abstractions to mix hues of black, white and gray, shot through with green and red. The original images are now invisible but not diminished; they are beneath the surface, just as history undergirds the everyday. (Though not always installed this way, the original photos hang nearby at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, along with four large gray mirrors that reflect the viewer as a witness or bystander.) Yet history is not all horror; Richter says that its flip side, joy, defines his relationship to making art. In his first cycle of paintings, “Annunciation After Titian” (1973), four canvases based on a 1535 work by the Italian Renaissance painter show the angel Gabriel coming down to Earth in a radiant beam to tell the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to the son of God: A new world beckons.

f3928d64b279,Treasury Secretary Stakes Credibility and Taxpayer Money on Argentina Bet,"scott bessent, argentina, currency, debt, banking and finance, foreign investment, economy, us foreign policy, us politics, exchange stabilization fund united states treasury, treasury department, imf, donald trump, javier milei","As a top investor for the liberal philanthropist George Soros in the 1990s, Scott Bessent made a splash for a $10 billion bet that the British pound was overvalued. That wager helped “break” the Bank of England with devastating trades against the pound. In 2013, Mr. Bessent netted $1 billion for Mr. Soros’s fund with a giant bet against the Japanese yen. Now, in an unconventional move with little precedent, Mr. Bessent is staking his credibility as President Trump’s Treasury secretary — and billions of taxpayer dollars — on another type of currency bet. Mr. Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, is orchestrating a $20 billion lifeline to prop up the Argentine peso, which has been declining in value. The backstop is intended to support Argentina’s economy and its president, Javier Milei. On Friday, Mr. Bessent said the Treasury Department had intervened for at least a second time to buy pesos. “Treasury remains in close communication with Argentina’s economic team as they work to Make Argentina Great Again,” he wrote on social media on Friday. “Treasury is monitoring all markets, and we have the capacity to act with flexibility and with force to stabilize Argentina.” On the sidelines of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank this week, Mr. Bessent toyed with an additional $20 billion in financing for the beleaguered country, on top of a $20 billion infusion in the form of a currency swap with its central bank. At the center of his bet is that the currency of Argentina — a debt-ridden country whose economy has required more than 20 bailouts — is undervalued. If he is right, the United States could make money by acquiring pesos that will eventually be worth more and by gaining access on favorable terms to Argentina’s natural resources. If he is wrong, the United States could wind up subsidizing yet another failed bailout for a country that has defaulted nine times. It is highly unusual for the United States to directly intervene in another country’s economy. Although it did rescue Mexico in 1995, historically it involves other nations or institutions such as the I.M.F. to share the burden of risk. The outcome carries steep political consequences for both Mr. Bessent and Mr. Trump. The president is already facing criticism for bailing out Argentina at a time when American farmers are struggling as a result of his trade war with China and federal workers are going without pay during a government shutdown. “They’re putting their reputation on the line, especially Bessent’s reputation,” said Martin Mühleisen, a former I.M.F. official who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. If the United States ended up losing money, “they would have a lot of egg on their face,” he said. The lifeline that Mr. Bessent has orchestrated involves what is known as a central bank currency swap. It is essentially a loan that the United States is providing through Treasury to Argentina’s central bank, which has been forced to sell its holdings of U.S. dollars in recent months as it seeks to support the declining value of its currency. Mr. Bessent is using a bucket of money that the Treasury Department controls, known as the Exchange Stabilization Fund, to buy pesos. He said previously that he was prepared, if necessary, to provide Argentina with a line of credit and to buy government bonds. The peso has plunged on fears that Mr. Milei’s political fortunes are fading and that the economic reforms he is pursuing could be derailed if his party does poorly in midterm elections this month. The United States has pledged to back Argentina’s economy, but the Trump administration has remained vague about the specifics of how those interventions will work and what is being done to protect taxpayers from losses. Brad W. Setser, a former Treasury official who is now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said spending that money on Argentina was “pretty much the most risky use imaginable of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.” The fund holds dollars, foreign currency and I.M.F. assets that the United States controls. The Treasury secretary has broad discretion over how the funds are deployed, but they are traditionally used to help stabilize economies that are facing crises or default, primarily through loans or currency purchases. As of late August, the fund had a net balance of about $43 billion. So far, no details or conditions related to the central bank loan have been made public. Santiago Bausili, the president of Argentina’s central bank, said this week that he hoped the U.S. currency swap plan would be activated before elections on Oct. 26. Speaking at an Atlantic Council event, he declined to say what kinds of assets would comprise Argentina’s side of the swap nor what the United States was seeking in return. U.S. officials have been pushing Argentina for access to its uranium and lithium supplies and for it to scale back its ties to China, according to a person familiar with the talks. Mr. Trump said this week that a free-trade agreement between the two countries was also a possibility. The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment. However, Argentina’s history of economic crises has raised concerns that the United States could ultimately end up losing money if Argentina’s economy does not stabilize and if the value of the peso continues to fall. The country has received more than 20 economic support packages from the I.M.F. since the 1950s. Of the monetary fund’s roughly $164 billion in support outstanding to countries around the world, Argentina accounts for about 35 percent. That checkered history has not deterred foreign investors, who until Mr. Milei’s recent drubbing in local elections last month had appeared optimistic that their bets on Argentina would finally pay off. “Argentina is the gift that keeps on giving,” said Douglas A. Rediker, a managing partner of the political advisory firm International Capital Strategies. “It is unbelievably predictable in its cyclicality over the past decades, and there is always a new crop of investors and traders who think they know better.” Mr. Trump made clear this week that U.S. support was contingent on Mr. Milei’s party doing well in the elections. Otherwise, the president said, the United States would not “waste our time.” But if Mr. Milei prevails, there are likely to be many more questions on what the United States will demand in return to ensure that it is ultimately paid back. Although Mr. Milei has won international praise for his economic agenda, analysts have argued that he has mishandled Argentina’s currency. They contend that for the peso to stabilize in the long run it should be allowed to “float” freely, and that without such a policy change the infusion of U.S. funds could be wasted. “Were the United States to offer Argentina a longer-term support package to back an unsustainable exchange rate, that would be a major folly and waste of U.S. taxpayer resources,” said Mark Sobel, a former Treasury official. Without requiring Argentina to move toward a more market-based system, the fear is that it will continue to burn through any available cash reserves to keep the peso within a certain range. That is likely to mean the government will not have enough available funds to pay its debts next year, leading to another cash crunch. But no such plan has been enacted. In fact, Mr. Bausili of the central bank said this week that Argentina intended to maintain its policy of allowing the peso to move within a specific range. According to Alejandro Werner, who previously ran the Western Hemisphere department at the I.M.F., a freely floating peso is a necessary condition but not the only change required for Argentina’s financial situation to stabilize. He also urged the country’s central bank to adopt a “more normal” approach to monetary policy that involved inflation targeting while also cutting back further on fiscal expenditures. “You want your allies to be able to stand on their own two feet after you support them, and that is where conditionality comes in,” Mr. Werner said. “So far, we haven’t seen it.” Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, likened the Trump administration’s decision to help Argentina as a “Catch-22 situation” for both countries. “If the U.S. stops providing dollars to the country, it is unlikely that they will be repaid, and Argentines will suffer,” she said. “If the U.S. decides to help Argentina regardless, it still faces the likelihood of nonpayment or endless arrears, while Argentina flounders with its unsustainable currency regime.” Mr. Bessent, who has steered the plan from the start, is instead wagering that the United States could turn a profit on this Argentina bet and that keeping the country’s resources from China is strategically important. If the wager is successful, Isabelle Mateos y Lago, who previously worked at the I.M.F. and is now the chief economist at BNP Paribas, said it could become a new way for the United States to offer economic support to its allies outside traditional avenues like the I.M.F., which ties loans to specific reform goals. Eschewing that safeguard though was a “big risk for U.S. taxpayers,” she said. If Argentina becomes an economic quagmire, however, Mr. Bessent may shoulder much of the blame. “You generally don’t want your first use of the E.S.F. to be a failure,” Mr. Setser said, referring to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. “I do think it would impact the broader credibility of Secretary Bessent’s financial management.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/politics/trump-argentina-bailout-bessent.html,politics,BBC,By Alan Rappeport and Colby Smith,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/DC-ARGENTINA-04-gtjb/DC-ARGENTINA-04-gtjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T16:38:31.673000+00:00,a1012835175b9cc8051d25ed9bed491c50d205c7

She was 75. Her death, at the home of her daughter, Graciela Colin, was announced by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, of which Ms. Ulloa was the executive director for Latin America and the Caribbean. Her daughter said the cause was lung disease. In Mexico, where the cult of machismo has long held sway, Ms. Ulloa waged a lonely, sometimes dangerous and often single-handed fight against prostitution and organized sex rings. Trained as a lawyer, she never received a license, but rights advocates said she was nonetheless a major influence on Mexican legislation designed to reduce or eliminate the oppression of women. For 30 years, beginning in the 1980s, she helped draft laws in Mexico’s state and federal legislatures that “increased punishment for rape and closed loopholes for rapists,” the Coalition said. She helped with the drafting of a 2012 law that increased penalties for trafficking and a 2007 law that sought to protect women from violence. She was legal representative for women and girls in more than 25,000 rape cases and rescued more than 650 women and girls from trafficking rings, according to The Harvard Kennedy School Journal of Hispanic Policy, which interviewed her in 2011. That year, Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government awarded Ms. Ulloa the Gleitsman International Activist Award. The sex trafficking rings were increasingly under the control of drug cartels, Ms. Ulloa told the Harvard journal. “The people that are involved in this crime are really powerful,” Ms. Colin, her daughter, said in an interview. “She was always threatened and persecuted. It was really dangerous, the work she did.” She added that her mother had received beating and kidnapping threats over the phone. In 1994, Ms. Ulloa founded the organization Defensoras Populares A.C. to advocate for women’s rights. Through that group, she conducted nearly two dozen rescue operations in Mexico City brothels. She sometimes went into brothels in Mexico City herself to initiate anti-trafficking operations. “She dressed up like a nun, a prostitute, whatever she could figure out, to get into the brothels, to have a conversation with the women who were being exploited,” Ms. Colin recalled. “Once she had all the information, she could come back with the police. She was like an intelligence agent.” Graciela Colin said that her mother performed these rescue operations perhaps 20 times in the Harvard journal interview, Ms. Ulloa said: “We deal with power and violence, sexism, patriarchy and phallocentric syndrome. The bodies of women and girls are reduced to commodities, to objects, to war trophies.” She forcefully rejected the idea that prostitution could be a choice, calling that view “patriarchal.” In a tribute to Ms. Ulloa, Dorchen Leidholdt, a founder of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, said her “contributions to the movement to end sex trafficking, sexual exploitation and the system of prostitution are too numerous to be recounted.” Like other human rights advocates in Mexico, Ms. Ulloa received an early education in political and social causes during the student movement of 1968, which culminated in a massacre that October when government forces opened fire in the capital city’s Tlatelolco Plaza, days before the Olympic Games. The Mexican government claimed that 30 people died, but witnesses said that the death toll reached into the hundreds, and that many more were injured. Ms. Ulloa began working as a legal adviser for Mexican unions in the early 1980s. One day, she said in a Harvard video interview after she won the Gleitsman award, a group of women came to her asking for help: Two girls — one 12 and one 3 — had been gang raped. The union assigned Ms. Ulloa to assist them. “That changed my life forever. I started working against sexual violence,” she said. But, she added, even though, along with other advocates and lawyers, “every day we put more rapists in jail, we realized we were not making a difference.” To address that, she said, she developed a more “holistic” approach to sexual violence, which involved educational efforts aimed at young men as well. One of her best-known interventions came in 2014, after a journalist reported that Cuauhtémoc Gutiérrez de la Torre , the former president of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in Mexico City, was running a prostitution ring using the party’s money. Ms. Ulloa aided the victims through counseling. Mr. Gutiérrez de la Torre, who denied wrongdoing, was not arrested until 2021 and remains in preventive detention . “She helped unveil the corruption in the PRI,” said Lucia Lagunes Huerta , a rights activist in Mexico City, using the Spanish acronym for the party that long held power. “She helped unveil the abuse of power.” Teresa Columba Ulloa Ziáurriz was born in Mexico City on Dec. 31, 1949, the older of two daughters of Armando Ulloa, an insurance salesman who later managed a Chrysler dealership, and Graciela Ziáurriz Hernández. Ms. Ulloa attended the Colegio Francés Mayorazgo and the Panamerican Workshop in Mexico City and received a bachelor’s degree in education and human relations from the Instituto Nacional de Pedagogía in 1973. She later graduated from the law faculty of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico in 1984, four years after founding a women’s legal collective, Compañera, which was dedicated to helping victims of sexual violence. Besides her daughter, Ms. Ulloa is survived by her sister, also named Graciela. Her husband, Leopoldo Colin, died in 2023. Prostitution is never free, Ms. Ulloa told The Harvard Kennedy School Journal of Hispanic Policy. “You cannot resign your human rights: They are part of you,” she said, “even if you try to resign them. You are not free to be subject to mistreatment, to torture, to be degraded as a human being.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/world/americas/teresa-ulloa-ziaurriz-dead.html,World,BBC,By Adam Nossiter,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16ulloa-gcwm/16ulloa-gcwm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T16:14:44+00:00,52a2332a93258a5c2866d643ee9a3c580b3a1408

A Mystery Ailment, a Stunning Diagnosis.","mosquito, none, medical test, virus, health department nys, long island, climate change;global warming, disesases;health;illness;medicine, invasive species, infection","She almost never left Long Island, so the test results and diagnosis simply did not make sense. Not to her, not to her doctors, not to the local health authorities. She was sick with a mosquito-borne tropical disease. A disease that wasn’t supposed to be in New York. And yet she had the telltale symptoms of chikungunya: fever and joint pain so severe that it made walking difficult and driving impossible. It hurt too much to grip the steering wheel. Her shoulder felt as if it was being wrenched apart. In the middle of the night, she would wake up, drenched in sweat, a hot pain in her toes and a weird sensation: It felt as if someone was pulling on them. Chikungunya has surged globally in 2025 — with outbreaks in places including Brazil, islands in the Indian Ocean and China , with more than 445,000 cases worldwide. But the United States has long seemed immune. Only a smattering of cases resulting from local transmission had been reported, in Florida and Texas, and those happened more than a decade ago. The virus had never been known to circulate in New York. And yet, in lab test after lab test during the past five weeks, the 60-year-old woman tested positive for chikungunya. The health authorities questioned her skeptically about her travel history, insinuating that she was concealing an overseas vacation to the buggy tropics, she said. But she had not traveled to any of the hot spots recently. The last trip she took, she said, was to Rhode Island in March. And she had been to Maine in 2017. In fact, she said in an interview, she rarely left Long Island. Her husband had commuted into Manhattan for 41 years, by car, amid some of the most reliably clogged traffic in the country . And now retired, he was done traveling. They liked to stay put, on Long Island. They live in the Town of Hempstead in central Nassau County, some 20 miles east of Manhattan. She fills her days with grandchildren, gardening and taking photographs of birds, nature and sunrises. “Somehow, it found me here,” she said. The patient spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want to be associated online with an unusual virus. On Tuesday, the state health authorities confirmed what the woman had known for a month. She had chikungunya and appeared to have caught it on Long Island, the first such case of local transmission ever recorded in New York. That meant that the virus was circulating in mosquitoes, or at least one mosquito, locally. The arrival of chikungunya only adds to the health threats posed by arthropods on Long Island. Tick bites sicken thousands of people there each year. Suffolk County, which covers Long Island’s eastern two-thirds, has more Lyme disease cases than any other county in the nation some years. Alpha-gal syndrome, a meat allergy linked to tick bites, is also a growing health problem on Long Island. Living on Long Island, the patient had long taken care to avoid tick bites. On walks, she never strayed from the path. Now, the first patient to catch chikungunya in New York has begun taking new precautions against mosquito bites. An avid gardener, she had never allowed pesticides or any mosquito repellents to be applied to her yard, unlike many Long Island residents . But since her diagnosis, she and her husband have bought a natural mosquito repellent and sprayed it around the perimeter of the garden, hoping to keep mosquitoes at bay. Chikungunya, which was first identified in Tanzania in the 1950s, means “that which bends up” — a reference to the contorted postures of those suffering extreme joint pain. The spread of the virus to new regions is driven partly by climate change, which creates new habitats for the mosquitoes that transmit the virus. But it also reflects the adaptability and extraordinary spread of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, which is one of two species that drive much of the disease’s spread. It shows signs of adapting to colder climates , such as laying eggs that can outlast long, cold winters . But the question remained: How did the virus end up here? One possibility is that a mosquito infected with chikungunya traveled in a plane or in a passenger’s luggage from a region where the disease is endemic back to New York, health experts said. A spokeswoman for the state health department, Danielle De Souza, offered a second possibility: A New York resident who was infected abroad with chikungunya might have returned home and was then bitten by “vector-capable mosquitoes,” such as the Asian tiger mosquito. Those mosquitoes, in turn, became infected, and one went on to bite this woman. This year, health authorities are aware of at least a half-dozen people in New York who tested positive for chikungunya after being infected abroad. The First Sign On Aug. 21, a Thursday, she woke up, and her shoulder felt as if it were on fire — “like nothing I’d ever experienced before in my life,” she said. She felt chills and feverish. By that night, she was vomiting. The pain moved from body part to body part. The balls of her feet ached so she shuffled around on her heels. The pain worked its way up her ankles and then to her knees. She had no idea what ailed her but remembered wondering if it might be West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne disease that infected 100 people across New York last year . “I thought West Nile because nothing else was clicking,” she said. She went to an emergency room on Aug. 23 but learned little about what had beset her. She recalled asking about West Nile but said she wasn’t tested for any mosquito-borne diseases then. The following week, she went to another hospital, Mercy, in Rockville Centre, staying for three days. Tests showed that her white blood cell count was severely low. A doctor warned that she should prepare for the possibility of a diagnosis of lymphoma, a form of cancer. A subsequent doctor ruled that out. Doctors at Mercy also suspected she might be having issues with her gallbladder, which can lead to pain in the right shoulder, just as she had. But that was eventually ruled out. In the days after she left the hospital, she went to see a rheumatologist, where she caught a break. The rheumatologist ordered a test for West Nile and chikungunya, too, she said. The blood draw for these tests occurred on Sept. 5, about two weeks after she fell ill. During that time, she had stopped driving, unable to grip the steering wheel. Everything was swollen, especially her hands, which were puffy all the time. Putting her shoes on was an ordeal. At night, she was drenched in sweat. Her sleep was cut short by that strange pain, as though someone were pulling her toes. On Sept. 15, she received her test results. She was stunned at what she saw. She turned to her husband with a question: What exactly is chikungunya? He didn’t know either. The test detected chikungunya antibodies. That led to further blood tests for the virus itself, not just antibodies. Samples went to a commercial laboratory and the state’s public health lab, the Wadsworth Center, in Albany. Over the next few weeks, she began getting calls from a Nassau County health department employee who was investigating how she might have been infected. Had she traveled anywhere in recent months or years? The same health investigator called back later, the woman said in an interview. Apparently skeptical of her previous answer — no overseas travel — the investigator asked the same question again but added, “Now that you’ve had time to think about it,” the woman recounted. Nassau County officials did not respond to requests for comment. To the woman, it felt as though everyone doubted that she could have gotten chikungunya on Long Island. She told the investigator she had been to Huntington and Riverhead — towns on Long Island — and suggested they search for chikungunya in those areas, too. Another doctor told her that the antibody test results were probably a false positive, noting there wasn’t any chikungunya in New York. More than a month had now passed since she fell ill. Her joint pain was less excruciating, but her hands, fingers, wrists, knees and ankles still ached. On the couch at home, she read articles about chikungunya and how patients fared. For some, the joint pain eased in a week or so, while others experienced debilitating symptoms for months or longer. In early October, she began a four-week course of steroids, which lessened the joint pain. On Tuesday, the state health department announced “the first locally acquired case of chikungunya” in New York. “An investigation suggests that the individual likely contracted the virus following a bite from an infected mosquito.” The state health commissioner, Dr. James McDonald, said the risk of infection was low. Testing by health authorities of batches of mosquitoes — a practice called “mosquito pool testing” — had not turned up further evidence of mosquitoes carrying chikungunya. In addition, Dr. McDonald noted the seasons were changing. “Given the much colder nighttime temperatures, the current risk in New York is very low.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/nyregion/chikungunya-long-island-case.html,Health,BBC,By Joseph Goldstein,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16met-chikungunya-patient-01-fchq/16met-chikungunya-patient-01-fchq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T16:00:25+00:00,a7780fa9b304bad613ed754f873653625c290f63
7340cd645361,The Secret Weapon of ‘S.N.L.’ Finally Gets the Spotlight,"comedy, tv, movies, documentaries, personal profile;people story, writer, jim downey, lorne michaels, saturday night live, the chair company, one battle after another","Until this year, Jim Downey was the great secret of American comedy. He had a cult following as a longtime writer of “Saturday Night Live” who Lorne Michaels himself said was, more than anyone, the voice of the show for at least its first two decades. But he was unknown to the general public. To comedy nerds, he inspired considerable lore. Downey who has been the youngest writer in the history of “Saturday Night Live” and the oldest, started in the show’s second year, on the same day as Bill Murray, who shared an office with him. After helping create one comedy institution in the 1970s, Downey, 73, did his part to build another the next decade, becoming the second head writer of “Late Night With David Letterman.” Whether he is the true inventor of the Top 10 list can cause fights in certain circles. He eventually returned to “S.N.L.,” where he led arguably the greatest writers’ rooms in comedy history , which included Robert Smigel, Jack Handey, George Meyer, Bob Odenkirk and Conan O’Brien. Downey played understated roles in many beloved sketches ( First CityWide Change Bank ), wrote jokes for Norm Macdonald’s fabled run on Weekend Update, and dominated the show’s political writing (Dana Carvey gives him credit for his George H.W. Bush line “Na Ga Da It”) for decades until he retired in 2013. He might be best known for an appearance in “Billy Madison,” when he tells Adam Sandler he said something so idiotic that “everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.” Now Downey is finally having his moment in the spotlight: He plays a member of an elite racist cabal, the Christmas Adventurers Club, in the critically acclaimed Paul Thomas Anderson movie “ One Battle After Another ,” and delivers an understated turn in Tim Robinson’s new HBO series, “ The Chair Company .” And on Friday a long-gestating documentary about his huge contribution to American comedy, “ Downey Wrote That ,” starts streaming on Peacock. In a recent phone interview, he reflected on his career. Here are edited excerpts: Do you approach acting in a movie like “One Battle After Another” the same way you do a comedy sketch? When I read the script, I thought it was satirical. I thought it was funny, but then I tend to find more things funny than the typical person. Seeing you as part of the Christmas Adventurers Club reminded me of the great 1984 Eddie Murphy “S.N.L.” sketch, “White Like Me,” where you also delivered dry line-readings as a store clerk who’s part of white supremacist conspiracy. Maybe dry is what I’m best at. When you get into wetter, more emotional-charged things, that’s thin ice for me. Sizing myself up as a performer, I am best suited to what I call room temperature kind of performance. As a writer, I tend to prefer quieter stuff, where if you watch it with the sound off, you couldn’t be certain you were watching comedy. And yet, you also wrote the Chris Farley-Patrick Swayze Chippendales audition sketch. See, the part that you never see highlighted is that the judges in that sketch have a difficult decision to make. “Can’t we hire both?” “No, no. We have to make a decision.” To me, that was the joke. A lot of the piece was cutaways from the two guys dancing to Jan Hooks and Mike Myers taking notes, staring intently as if they were judges in an Olympic gymnastics competition. It’s not what the audience liked the best, but it’s what I like the best. I’ve heard that you’re generous about giving cast members suggestions for line readings. I try to be polite about it. Are there performers who balk? I probably shouldn’t say this, but now that I’m retired, who cares? One of my techniques for sneaking a line reading would be, let’s say the performer had just been steadfastly doing it in a way I didn’t think was helping. I would say: “There was this thing you did that I liked” and it would be something that the performer in no way did. Then I’d give them a line reading pretending I was merely quoting them. Brilliant. It worked? There’s almost no limit to what you can get people to do if you let them think it’s their idea. You’ve written so many great sketches. Which one best represents your sense of humor? It was an investment banking house where I play the founder. In antique footage from the 1920s, I laid down the principles of the firm saying: “Trendy investment fads come and go, but at Grayson Moorhead, we’ve always stuck by the principles laid down more than 70 years ago. We will take our client’s money and invest it . Part of the profit we’ll keep for ourselves. The rest we will give to the client.” And then he explains that we will make a list of each of our clients and how much they have invested. The comedy of overexplaining. I think so, yes. The other is when Jon Lovitz plays the devil on “The People’s Court.” When Lorne Michaels received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, that’s the sketch they played in full to represent the show. I was there and very touched they chose that one. I originally wrote this for David Letterman when I worked on “Late Night,” but Dave said I can’t pretend that Satan is in the studio. Do you have a favorite host to write for? The people we had a lot, that speaks for itself. John Goodman is great, Buck Henry, Steve Martin. Marty Short. There were people who only did it once who were great, Colin Farrell. I thought he was really impressively funny. You famously wrote for what is now considered by many the greatest era of Weekend Update, for Norm Macdonald . Do you have a favorite Norm joke? We would do this thing where we would have a story that’s really innocuous. It’d be like: “This week, the City Council of Denver voted on its third attempt to come up with funding for a new streetlight on Madison and Third.” Then Norm would stare very importantly and say: “Maybe if instead of a streetlight, the funding was for rich white men, it would have happened sooner.” And then a graphic would come up, “Applaud now.” I hear you still send in Update jokes. What’s an example? The joke was that Trump was saying, “It’s the lowest Black unemployment in history.” And then Michael Che said, “I’m pretty sure during slavery times, it was zero.” Political comedy seems to be treated with more weight than ever. Does comedy have too much power now? I’m a big believer in comedy, so I want it to have all the power. Al Franken said he thought that the debate sketch you wrote with Al Gore and George W. Bush lost Gore the 2000 election. Agree? I hope not because then you’re getting the Iraq War. I just think, even when you’re trying to help someone in comedy, you’re not. A lot of times when something is so sharply partisan, it can drive people who might be brought around to your way of thinking away. I care about certain issues strongly, but I’ve never been partisan. We’re in such a partisan time I’m kind of happy I got out when I did. Curious what you think of Shane Gillis getting hired and fired from “S.N.L.”? I do remember Lorne asked me if I would look at his audition tape, which was entirely him doing sketches of different characters, and I said, “Oh yeah, I can really see how this guy would help you.” Lorne asked you to look at him before he hired him? No, it was during the controversy. He said, “What do you think?” I knew that Lorne and I liked him for the same reasons. I called other people on the show, and asked what’s wrong with this guy? Why is this a problem? And they’re like: “Oh no, no, we can’t have him. No way.” Well, why? You and Norm Macdonald were fired because your O.J. Simpson jokes angered the NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer . Did Lorne try to get you to cut back? I’m glad you asked me that question because I always wanted to be able to say that’s one of the things that I’m very grateful to Lorne about. He doesn’t tend to like mean stuff. And our Update could be mean. He was put in the position where it wasn’t probably his favorite type of comedy, but he defended it on principle. What happens to “S.N.L.” after Lorne? Whoever follows Lorne is going to have the most hellacious time, because Lorne has developed an inscrutable persona, and people within the network are afraid to second-guess him because he has outwitted and outlasted them. I just think anyone who replaces him, it’s going to be tough. There’s a pent-up desire to attack. I hope they bioengineer him to live to 180.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/arts/television/jim-downey-saturday-night-live-writer-actor.html,Entertainment,BBC,By Jason Zinoman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17cul-jim-downey-gwmj/17cul-jim-downey-gwmj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-17T15:57:10+00:00,d2ee90bd8fc12330b2c93a19676bd877920adf91
