bf2824c76da6,"Jonathan Powell had no role in dropping of China spy case, senior minister says",,"The government’s national security adviser had no involvement in the prosecution being dropped against two British men accused of spying for China, a senior cabinet minister has said. Jonathan Powell had no connection to discussions about the “substance or the evidence” of the case, Bridget Phillipson said on Sunday, adding that Keir Starmer had full confidence in him. Powell’s role has been under intense scrutiny since it emerged that the sudden abandonment of the prosecution in September appeared to be because Starmer’s government was unwilling to say that China posed a threat to UK national security, a decision to which Powell would appear to be central. According to reports, the cases against Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China, were dropped after Powell said China would not be described as an enemy in any trial – considered necessary for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Cash and Berry deny accusations that they provided information about Westminster to China’s politburo. Under the updated national security strategy released in June, China was listed as a “geostrategic challenge” rather than an enemy. Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, Phillipson was asked why the case had lapsed. She said: “Obviously, the Crown Prosecution Service are best placed to explain why they were not able to bring forward a prosecution, but what I can be absolutely clear about is that ministers and others, including the national security adviser, had no role to play in either the substance of the case or the evidence in question.” Speaking earlier on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, the education secretary was asked for assurances that Powell took no part in the decision. “Yes, I can give that assurance,” Phillipson replied. “We’re very disappointed that the CPS were not able to take forward the prosecution.” Asked if the prime minister still had full confidence in Powell, she said he did. The centrality of government decision-making emerged last week when Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, wrote to the chairs of two parliamentary select committees to say that the case was dropped after ministers and officials declined to set out that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, despite what he called “many months” of efforts. This is key because of case law relating to the Official Secrets Act, which emerged after Cash and Berry were charged. This, connected to the separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, clarified that under the act, a country must be a threat to the UK’s national security at the time of the offence, prompting the need for clarification from the government. Phillipson told the BBC that because some of the legal changes dated back to 2023, it was a matter for the previous Conservative government. “I’m not making a partisan point when I say this, but there was a different government in office then,” she said. In a letter to the prime minister on Sunday evening, Kemi Badenoch urged Starmer to address “key questions which remain unanswered” about the case, claiming the government’s “account of what has happened has changed repeatedly”. She added: “This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on members of parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It puts them on a potential course to overtake the Conservatives and comes little more than a week after the Greens announced they had moved past the Liberal Democrats in membership numbers, getting to 83,500. If the same momentum continues, party officials say, they could be on course to become bigger than the Conservatives. Tory party membership figures are not made public, but recent reports say the total is slightly above 120,000. Such numbers do not necessarily translate into electoral success, with Labour having had a peak of more than 500,000 members under Jeremy Corbyn, who lost two general elections. And while one recent poll put the Greens at 15%, most such surveys have put the party nearer to 11% or 12%, not much changed since Polanski took charge. But the influx of members does point to Polanski’s apparent ability to galvanise attention and enthusiasm for a party that has often struggled to get its message across, with a mass of interviews, social media videos and TV appearances. The Greens’ surge has caused worries among some senior Labour figures, who believe it could take votes and seats from the party in next May’s local elections in England, particularly in some London boroughs. Polanski has repeatedly set out what he sees as the Greens’ ambition to supplant Labour. In a speech this month to the party’s annual conference, he said that without action Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK. Responding to the new membership figure, Polanski said: “More than 100,000 people have now joined the Green movement. That’s 100,000 people who believe politics can be honest, fair and hopeful again. “When I was elected leader last month, I said that we’re not here to be disappointed with Labour but that we’re here to replace them. I was serious. Because while Labour talks about change, people can see in their weekly shop, their utility bills and crumbling services, Labour are offering more of the same. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

9e7e2fd304dd,UK to host international summit on Gaza recovery plan,,"The UK is to host an international summit on the recovery of Gaza, Downing Street has said, as Keir Starmer prepared to attend a multi-nation event in Egypt intended to finalise a truce in the Palestinian territory. The prime minister will be among an estimated 20 national leaders, among them Donald Trump, who will gather in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, with Starmer saying the aim must be to ensure a lasting peace after two years of devastating loss of life. As humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza , the UK has said that £20m in already-pledged aid will now be focused on water, sanitation and hygiene services. The funding will be delivered through Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Norwegian Refugee Council. The UK will also host a three-day conference organised by the Foreign Office’s Wilton Park agency, based in West Sussex, beginning on Monday afternoon. The event will include representatives from the Palestinian Authority as well as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and Italy. Other participants will include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, and private sector and development financiers. The discussions “will also cover efforts to support the Palestinian Authority’s own transformation and reform programme to ensure it can support Gaza’s recovery”, a Downing Street statement said, adding that while the process would be Palestinian-led, there was “absolutely no role for Hamas”. In a comment at the summit in Egypt released in advance, Starmer said: “We stand determined to seize this opportunity to deliver a lasting peace, and a stable, secure future for the whole region. “Today is the first, crucial phase of ending this war and now we must deliver the second phase, in full. “The UK will support the next stage of talks to ensure the full implementation of the peace plan, so that people on both sides can rebuild their lives in safety and security.” Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, said: “The UK has worked intensively with international partners in recent months to create the momentum that has led to President Trump’s peace initiative, and to support the ceasefire that is now in place, but we now need to work with the same intensity and urgency to develop a plan for Gaza’s recovery and reconstruction. “Gaza has been completely devastated. The ceasefire gives us the opportunity not just to urgently scale up humanitarian efforts but also to look to the future of Gaza’s recovery. Rubble must be cleared, infrastructure repaired, healthcare restored and homes rebuilt.” Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “We know that we need to see a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel . That’s the government’s position. That’s what we want to continue to be involved in making happen and why the prime minister, Keir Starmer, is tomorrow travelling to Egypt.” Asked what part the UK had played in the ceasefire, she said: “We do have a role, but of course, the role of the US has been critical in this. We can all recognise that.” Speaking later to the BBC, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “I think we have to be honest at the fact that Britain has had no role, no role whatsoever.” She added: “I think it’s extraordinary that Keir Starmer apparently is going to Egypt tomorrow when we’ve got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving and sorting out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/uk-to-host-international-summit-on-gaza-recovery-plan,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05db5169b643683a8fbce122f7804296b83cda85/435_100_1417_1134/master/1417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=edb0027368d74ace55f247031b7d6ebd",2025-10-12T21:00:02+00:00,924679a4f4a29eb1fe9e44ed40fa7275b6830d0c
c650ed8e9ace,Lucy Powell calls on Labour not to ‘write off’ May local elections,,"Labour should not “write off” next May’s elections as a likely moment for big losses but use the budget as a way to seize back voters’ attention, Lucy Powell has said as the battle to be the party’s deputy leadership entered its final period. With voting among party members under way, Bridget Phillipson , Powell’s rival for the post, said if she won she would set up a formal system to reflect the views of members and unions to the cabinet on a regular basis. Powell was sacked from the cabinet in last month’s reshuffle after the departure of Angela Rayner and has become the favourite to win on an outsider platform, promising to present tough truths to Keir Starmer and his team when necessary. Speaking after a series of events with members over the weekend, Powell said there was concern about the possible impact on the party of the elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and councils across England next May, with Labour predicted to see heavy losses, many to Reform UK. Powell, who was leader of the Commons until the reshuffle, said she was “not prepared to write off this hugely important set of elections” as inevitable midterm pushback, calling for a bold budget in response. “It’s not OK if we are losing good Labour councillors and councils through no fault of their own, because of the missteps we’ve taken nationally,” she said. “We need to reset the agenda so that more communities don’t wake up to Reform and other councils after election day next May.” The 26 November budget should be “a moment to draw a line under our past mistakes, and show the country whose side we are on”, Powell said, saying it should lift the two-child benefit cap and make sure the tax burden was shared more fairly. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson, the education secretary, indicated she believed the cap would be lifted. “I am confident that we as a government will do the right thing by children growing up in poverty in our country,” she said. “We’ve already started that process. There’s more to do. I will make that happen.” Phillipson argued that as a cabinet minister she could make sure members’ concerns were heard directly at the top of government. In a subsequent pledge, her team said she would formally solicit views from members and trade unions every three months to present in this way. She said: “The Labour party draws its strength from its members. That’s why I want to give them a stronger voice in how the government delivers its agenda, with more avenues for our movement to tell us about their priorities. “Only under my deputy leadership will members have their voices heard loud and clear at the cabinet table.” Electronic voting among party members began last Wednesday and will run until 23 October, with the result announced two days later.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/lucy-powell-calls-on-labour-not-to-write-off-may-local-elections,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ab272bb5d2ecfbb71be150d5f8572aba021427/254_0_3099_2480/master/3099.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=636f15cf5b081eb1160cfd43ac2c4c7d",2025-10-12T16:00:21+00:00,b38b8c9a89ef79a170dcffbfb1a29dc4220c81cd
6bcca05532c9,William Hill owner says it could shut shops if Reeves raises gambling taxes,,"The debt-laden company behind William Hill is considering closing up to 200 betting shops if Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget raises taxes on the gambling sector. Evoke, formerly known as 888, which acquired William Hill in a £2bn takeover in 2022, is drawing up plans for different scenarios before expected gambling tax increases in the chancellor’s budget on 26 November. Evoke is considering shutting a number of outlets, in news first reported by the Sunday Times , which said closures could range from 120 shops to closer to 200. This would amount to between 9% and 15% of William Hill’s chain of 1,300 betting shops, with up to 1,500 jobs potentially affected. Between five and 10 people typically work in a betting shop. Evoke, which also owns the 888 and Mr Green brands, has 10,000 staff in total. The FTSE 250 company is struggling under a debt pile of £1.8bn after its largely debt-funded acquisition of William Hill, and made a pre-tax loss of nearly £78m in the first half of the year. A spokesperson for Evoke said: “We are mindful of potential tax increases in the forthcoming budget which would impact investment in the UK and drive more customers to the black market. “As part of our ongoing planning, we are assessing the potential impact of different overall tax scenarios on our UK operations. This includes the difficult but necessary consideration for shop closures.” The company stressed that no decision had been taken yet. It is the second big gambling company to warn of the impact of tax rises within a week. Stella David, the chief executive of Entain, the FTSE 100 owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, also said higher gambling taxes could lead to shop closures and investment being diverted to other countries. The government has been consulting on gambling taxation, and wants to simplify the various rates of duty applied to gambling products – a move the sector fears would raise its overall tax bill. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are consulting on bringing online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy. It is not about increasing or decreasing tax rates, and we welcome all views.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

5896dcb868dc,UK ministers take control of £10bn Lower Thames Crossing,,"Ministers have stripped the government’s road-building agency of responsibility for a £10bn tunnel under the River Thames amid a drive by Keir Starmer’s cabinet to take tight control over important infrastructure projects for fear of cost overruns and delays. Oversight of the Lower Thames Crossing – the UK’s largest planned infrastructure project – has been taken away from National Highways and handed to the Department for Transport (DfT). An artist’s impression of the Lower Thames Crossing, southern tunnel entrance. Photograph: Joas Souza/National Highways Internal consultation documents, seen by the Guardian, said the costs of the Lower Thames Crossing would be overseen by the DfT, leaving National Highways to “focus on managing, maintaining and renewing the network”. However, campaigners warned that the move could in fact lead to HS2-levels of overspending and ministers approving developments behind closed doors that would harm the environment. Treasury officials are thought to be behind the shift to centralise the management of large infrastructure projects after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made clear her frustration at “ bats and newts” delaying major schemes and adding to the final costs. The consultation documents showed that the “Tier 1” project – which is considered by the DfT to be “one of the largest, highest risk, novel and/or contentious” schemes now being undertaken – would be overseen by the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander . Reeves and Starmer have put planning reform at the heart of their growth plans after drafting legislation earlier this year to make it easier to build without paying as much for expensive wildlife protection . The chancellor is keen to include a number of initiatives designed to allow developers to build houses and infrastructure projects, in the hope that higher economic growth will fill about £3bn of an estimated £30bn shortfall in the Treasury’s finances. Earlier this week, Reeves was taped claiming that she had unblocked a development of 20,000 homes that was being held up by a rare snail. The new Thames crossing has received final planning consent and secured £590m for early-stage excavation, surveys and consultations. In addition, the construction firm Balfour Beatty has landed a £1.2bn contract to build roads connecting to the tunnel. However, funding for the full project has been delayed while the chancellor searches for a partner that could contribute as much as £2bn to the scheme in return for charging a toll. Work is expected to get under way before the end of the decade. The site lies east of the Dartford crossing, which takes traffic from the M25 and lorries travelling to and from the ports of Dover and Folkestone. A map showing the Lower Thames Crossing route Environmental campaigners argue that vital habitats on Kent’s north shoreline and the south Essex coast will be lost if the tunnel goes ahead. It will also increase carbon emissions without solving congestion on existing roads, they added. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alexander said earlier this year that the government was “finally getting on” with the crossing, adding that the “crucial project” had “been stuck in planning limbo for far too long”. National Highways has said that an extra connection between north Kent and Essex is also needed to allow for maintenance on the existing Dartford tunnels. It is understood that National Highways will remain responsible for the development of the crossing and will publish a breakdown of costs in its annual report, but decisions over the scope and funding of the project will be taken by ministers. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Backed by £590m, the Lower Thames Crossing is the most significant road-building project in a generation – and will cut local congestion, better link up motorists and businesses in the Midlands and north with key ports in the south-east, and spreading growth throughout the regions, as set in our plan for change.” Quick Guide Contact Guardian Business about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

40c8f01a1917,SNP backs Swinney’s ‘clear’ strategy for new independence referendum,,"SNP members have overwhelmingly backed leader John Swinney’s “clear and unambiguous” independence strategy that a majority election win is the only route to another referendum. On the first day of the party’s annual conference in Aberdeen, the vast majority of members backed the leadership’s motion that next May’s Holyrood elections should be fought on a “clear platform of national independence” and that winning a majority in the Scottish parliament – by securing 65 seats or more – would be “the only uncontested way to deliver a new vote on Scotland’s future”. After a passionate – and at times highly technical – debate, the conference rejected a rebel amendment put by more than 40 local branches that set out a more fundamentalist strategy of treating next year’s election as a de facto referendum, meaning that if the SNP and other pro-independence parties win a majority of the popular vote in 2026, it should be treated as a mandate to open independence negotiations directly. This de facto idea was first promoted by the former party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who acknowledged it as a “mistake” in her recent memoir. Echoing the confidence of SNP strategists reported in the Guardian yesterday, Swinney told the packed conference hall that “we are within touching distance of the 65 seats that will make the world sit up and take notice” and urged the party to back taking a “clear, unambiguous message” to the public. Depute leader Keith Brown, who seconded the motion, told delegates: “The only way we can achieve independence is to ask a clear question and get a clear answer.” This call to clarity is key: while independence is not high on the list of voters’ priorities, activists have unhappy memories of trying to explain what many believed was a fatally muddled independence strategy on the doorstep for the general election last year, where the SNP was humiliated by the resurgent Labour party, losing 38 of its 48 Westminster seats. A year on, the party’s pivot to its core message is a mark of renewed confidence, with the SNP once again leading the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, and an understanding that the battleground demographic for the coming campaign is made up of those “soft yes” independence supporters who have drifted away from the party. Speaking for the de facto amendment, veteran activist Graeme McCormick insisted that it was not proposed by “romantic nationalists”. He warned that the SNP was being “hollowed out” because it had failed to inspire its membership with a date for another referendum. The former MP Tommy Sheppard said it was “remarkable” that such a large conference was able to have such a detailed discussion in public and in front of the media, but insisted there were “no quick fixes”. “We have been chasing the next election for too long,” he said, arguing that the party needed a strategy to take it into the 2030s and deepen support for independence. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

382d275f6695,"The Guardian view on Labour targeting nature: the problem isn’t snails, but a broken housing model",,"I t began with gastropods. Last Tuesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told a conference of tech executives that she’d intervened to help a developer build about 20,000 homes in north Sussex that had been held up, she said, by “some snails … a protected species or something”. She added that they “are microscopic … you cannot even see” them. No one could miss the direction the chancellor was headed in. The snail in question, the lesser whirlpool ramshorn, is one of Britain’s rarest freshwater creatures, found in only a handful of locations and highly sensitive to sewage pollution . But Ms Reeves portrayed it as a bureaucratic nuisance. She then bragged that she’d fixed it – after a friendly developer gave her a call. It’s a bad look for a Labour politician, let alone the chancellor, to boast that green rules can be bent for chums. The scheme was given the go-ahead a day before drought was declared in Sussex, potentially giving water companies cover to breach their licence obligations – including measures meant to protect the snails. Ms Reeves won’t like being compared to Liz Truss, but the analogy works. Three years ago, Ms Truss railed against an “anti-growth coalition” of environmentalists, lawyers and regulators who, she claimed, were blocking Britain’s path to prosperity. Ms Reeves is framing the issue the same way: growth is the priority, nature the obstacle. But the public don’t agree. Luke Tryl of More in Common told a Conservative conference fringe meeting that most Britons can’t be categorised as “ nimby ” or “ yimby ”. They want both: to build and also to protect the countryside. However, when asked whether wildlife should be protected even if it delays or raises the cost of infrastructure, every single voter group – including Labour, Conservative and Reform UK – chose wildlife. Among the general public, 62% prioritised nature protection while 18% sided with building at any cost. The Treasury reportedly plans to gut green rules with amendments to its planning and infrastructure bill – ditching the precautionary principle, slashing species protections and curbing legal challenges. The bill, currently in the Lords , already allows developers to bypass environmental obligations by paying into a fund to offset damage elsewhere. Under its “environmental delivery plans”, ministers could disapply environmental protections in exchange for vague promises of ecological improvement within 10 years. Labour, significantly, is turning its back on the work of the Dasgupta review . This argues that nature is not a constraint on growth but its foundation, a form of capital on which the economy depends. Labour is not only rejecting that view but deluding itself by claiming housebuilding will be accelerated by dismissing concerns around conservation. The Wildlife Trusts points out that more than a million homes already have planning permission since 2015, but remain unbuilt. The real barriers to housebuilding are skills shortages, hoarded land and slow delivery. They need sorting out. Blaming snails, it would seem, is easier. Many of Labour’s younger voters are already tempted by the Green party, which combines environmentalism and leftwing economics. Now, by mocking green protections and cosying up to developers, the chancellor is giving these voters more reasons to jump ship. The problem isn’t the planning system . It’s a broken, profit-driven housing model that banks land and starves supply. Scrapping nature protections won’t build 1.5m homes , it will just bulldoze public trust and the countryside.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/the-guardian-view-on-labour-targeting-nature-the-problem-isnt-snails-but-a-broken-housing-model,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d22c32e1b9889c35a88e06ee05667588a092dd/329_0_4304_3442/master/4304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2e9683e3222c856e2225a65397fff8c7",2025-10-12T16:30:56+00:00,9af80332755b16e08e499dc65da5d37ab2ecb960
18fae14c0868,France is not alone in its crisis of political faith – belief in a democratic world is vanishing,,"E mmanuel Macron sounded like a man in grief. Not angry, not defiant, just a little triste . Europe, he lamented, was suffering a “ degeneration of democracy ”. Many threats emanated from outside, from Russia, from China, from powerful US tech companies and social-media entrepreneurs, France’s president said. “But we should not be naive. On the inside we are turning on ourselves. We doubt our own democracy … We see everywhere that something is happening to our democratic fabric. Democratic debate is turning into a debate of hatred.” Squeezed between vituperative extremes of right and left, Macron knows of what he speaks. But “ungovernable” France is not alone in its bitter, intractable divisions . Across Europe, in the UK and the US, distrust and grievance daily deepen political dysfunction and social discord. Macron’s words apply, in fact, to almost any country espousing democratic principles. Belief that democracy is the form of governance best suited to the modern world is dwindling, especially among younger people . Meanwhile, the public space grows coarser and more violent. Macron was speaking at an event marking the 35th anniversary of Germany’s 1990 reunification, a moment of great optimism. Yet, like France, today’s polarised Germany faces an acute crisis of political faith. Just look around. In elections last weekend, the Czech Republic followed Poland, Austria and other EU states in lurching towards the populist hard right, swept along on a rising tide of anti-establishment negativity. Support for opportunistic bigots who feed on fear, resentment and loss – while lacking credible policies on complex issues such as migration – is not an endorsement of democracy but its despoliation. This ugly rush to extremes is a vote of no confidence in the democratic system itself, exacerbated by reduced levels of participation and turnout among disadvantaged social groups. In all these countries, a national democratic consensus is woefully lacking. In declining, despairing Britain, where national flags are worn like comfort blankets, both leading mainstream parties are flailing; yet the alternatives are implausible or downright pernicious. In the US, the “home of democracy”, effective opposition to Republican one-party rule has all but collapsed, at least at national level. Striving to gerrymander congressional districts , Donald Trump increasingly resembles a dictator. Lack of genuine democratic choice and economic opportunity, fuelling alienation and revolt, beset countries as diverse as Morocco , Kenya and Bangladesh , all of which have witnessed recent upheavals. In the Philippines, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia and Madagascar, corruption and abuse of power have triggered anti-government protests. In Nepal last month, young people powered a “gen-Z revolution”. All these countries, in Europe and beyond, are different – except in one vital respect. Compared with authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia, their societies remain relatively open and free, for now. This is the fundamental challenge each faces: democracy isn’t working, or it is working so badly it risks being jettisoned. The once exemplary US – a paradigm lost – and fractious western Europe are faltering. And once again, less established democracies in the global south, and in central and eastern Europe, are frontline states in a reviving cold war of influence and values fought against the Beijing-Moscow axis. Like Moldova and Georgia , to name two recent battlegrounds, they could go either way. A crunch is coming. In its annual report, Freedom House, the US-based rights watchdog, found that violence, poll manipulation and repression marred more than 40% of national elections held in 2024. Global freedom, assessed in terms of political liberties and civil rights, declined for a 19th consecutive year. “Conflicts spread instability and thwarted democratic progress around the world,” the report concluded. In the US, a recent survey found a record 64% of Americans believe their democracy “is too politically divided to solve the nation’s problems”. In the UK, a poll of people aged 16-29 found 63% think democracy is in trouble . While young people “preferred to live in a democracy over a dictatorship by 57% to 27%”, only 35% said they would consider getting involved in organised politics. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Short- and long-term economic issues – the cost of living, inflation, lack of good jobs, de-industrialisation, shattered communities, institutional failures, wealth inequality, globalisation, mass migration linked to the climate crisis, the busted myth of infinitely sustainable growth – are all factors. Untrustworthy leaders, reflecting falling moral standards, is another. Insidious election meddling and online fakery by Russia and others hasten breakdown. Younger generations are pitted against ageing populations. And there is hopelessness, as well as anger, about the mess the world is in, environmentally and geopolitically. For Andreas Reckwitz of Humboldt University of Berlin, all this discontent is rooted in an overall, profound and ubiquitous sense of loss. “Western modernity’s foundational lie” – the post-Enlightenment belief that human progress is constant and inevitable, that everything gets better over time, that life improves – has been brutally exploded by the experience of recent decades, Reckwitz argues . “Loss has become a pervasive condition of life … The question is no longer whether loss can be avoided but whether societies bound to ‘better’ or ‘more’ can learn to endure ‘less’ and ‘worse’.” Seen this way, rejection of failing democratic structures and the advance of demagogic throwbacks pledging a return to “the way things were” are more easily understood. “If politics continues to promise endless improvement, it will fuel disillusionment and strengthen populisms that thrive on betrayed expectations,” Reckwitz writes. “Populism channels anger over what has disappeared but provides only illusions of recovery. The crucial question then becomes: how to deal with loss?” Reckwitz has his own suggestions, involving resilience and redistribution. If anyone has a definitive answer, Macron, with much to lose, would surely love to hear it.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/france-crisis-political-faith-belief-democratic-world-vanishing,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5622669477b5eae1034bdd5e7b06e606031d3067/404_0_4492_3593/master/4492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c1d471c87aa33813482b70b453549c64",2025-10-12T05:00:42+00:00,2133eefdc3204ea52dee6e4981014d6e78b6ca47
286be389b0af,Don’t fall for the authoritarian hype – Reform and the hard right can be stopped in their tracks,,"N igel Farage portrays his Reform UK party as a unique phenomenon that has burst on to the global stage, its meteoric rise an exceptional epochal event. But this week, in every one of Europe’s major countries and from India and Thailand to the US and Argentina, hard-right, anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation parties like his are also ahead in the opinion polls. In last Saturday’s Czech elections, the rightwing, pro-Putin populist Andrej Babiš toppled prime minister Petr Fiala. National Rally , which has just brought down yet another French prime minister , is leading the polls for both the French presidency and parliament. In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is currently the most popular party. Hungary’s Fidesz party, Robert Fico’s pro-Russian Slovakian coalition and the Brothers of Italy are already in government, while the Freedom party of Austria (FPÖ), the Netherlands’ Freedom party (PVV) and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang – all hardline nationalists – are part of an international coalition of anti-internationalists, inspired by far-right propagandists like Steve Bannon , seeking to dethrone the international rule of law, diminish human rights and destroy multilateral cooperation. The populist nationalist surge exposes a new and unavoidable truth that democrats ignore at our peril: an authoritarian ethnic nationalism – once thought toppled with the Berlin Wall – has replaced neoliberalism as the dominant ideology of our age, giving us a world of firsts: “America first”, “India first”, “China first”, “Russia first”, “my tribe first” and often “my tribe first and only” regimes. It is this ethnic nationalism that helps explain why the world is now composed of 91 autocracies and only 88 democracies , and ethnic nationalism is the force behind the violations of international human rights law not just by Russia in Ukraine but in almost every one of the world’s 59 cross-border conflicts and civil wars. It is important to understand the underlying forces, common to almost every country, that have fuelled this new age of nationalism. It starts with a widely felt sense that a globalisation that was open but not inclusive has been a free for all that has not been fair to all. For more than a decade, leaders have not only been slow to respond to the millions who feel left out and left behind, but also to the changing balance of global economic power, moving us from a unipolar world once dominated by the US to a multipolar world of competing superpowers, and from a rules-based order to a power-based one. The ethnic nationalism that this has incited means free trade is giving way to protectionism. Where economics used to drive politics, the politics of nationalism is now driving economic decisions, and already more than 100 countries are running mercantilist policies marked out by reshoring and friend-shoring and by bans on cross-border trade, investment and technology transfer, sinking international cooperation to its lowest ebb since 1945. But all is not lost. The cement is still wet, and even as it hardens we can find hope in the common sense of the global public. In a survey by Focaldata , of 36,000 people in 34 countries we find a clear majority are more resistant to an exclusionary nationalism and more willing to embrace international cooperation than many of the leaders who rule over them. Across the world there is, perhaps surprisingly, only a small group of hardened anti-internationalists representing 16.5% of the global population (even if 25% in today’s US) who either feel coexistence between ethnic and religious groups is impossible or have a zero-sum mindset that if they or their country do well, it has to be at the expense of others doing badly. But there are another 21% at the opposite extreme, whom we might call committed internationalists, who either still see cooperation across borders through open trade as a positive sum win-win, or are what the US philosopher and writer Kwame Anthony Appiah calls “rooted cosmopolitans”. Nigel Farage 'doesn't like Britain': Keir Starmer takes dig at Reform leader – video The vast majority of the global public are somewhere in between: not narrow, inward-looking nationalists, as “America first” ideology would suggest, or all-in cosmopolitans. They are patriotic but don’t see the world as in a never-ending struggle between the “us” and the “them”, adversaries permanently set apart from each other in an unbridgeable divide. Do the majority in the middle prefer a duty-free or a dutiful world? Are they prepared to accept obligations beyond their garden gate or city wall? Yes, under certain conditions. A first group, 22%, will back humanitarian action to relieve suffering and are prepared to act out of altruism, supporting emergency help for disaster zones. Those we might call “good cause” multilateralists feel the pain of others and believe in something bigger than themselves. A second group comprising 22% are pragmatic multilateralists who want to know that any taxes paid out for international development are spent well. And there is a third group, 21%, self-interested multilateralists, who will endorse cooperation if they can see that it benefits them and their communities, whether it be through guaranteeing them food on the table or peace and security. So a clear majority can be constructed not just for humanitarian aid if money is well spent but also for global action to deal with global problems, like climate crisis and pandemic prevention, as long as this case is argued on grounds of enlightened self-interest, and if we stress the reciprocal benefits that flow to them and their own country. And thus for those who have long wondered whether we cooperate out of need or if we have a need to cooperate, the answer is both. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And while in-depth polls tell us that across the west, illegal immigration is currently the biggest national issue – and no one should doubt that it must quickly be brought under control – the snapshots of opinion also tell us that the public are even more concerned about what is happening in their own lives and within their own local communities. Last month, Keir Starmer spoke movingly about how what’s good about Britain can drive out what’s bad, doing so precisely because in most western countries, “broken” and “in decline” are the words people have for years most commonly cited when asked about both our economy and society. But as the prime minister also reminded us, the far right is more interested in exploiting grievances than ending them. Farage hailed Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget as “ the best Conservative budget since 1986 ”. But he would also enact Truss act two – what she planned to deliver – the biggest ever cuts in public services. Reform’s plan to reduce public spending by £275bn would not repair downtrodden communities but ravage them, turn citizen against citizen and wreck any spirit of solidarity. Under a Farage hard-right regime, you will not be able to afford to be sick, disabled, poor or vulnerable. Every day from now on, and in every constituency, Reform should be asked which hospital, which school and which public service will be the first to be cut or closed. “Faragism” is neoliberalism at its most inhumane, more destructive even than monetarism, and vindictive far beyond austerity. What the public are telling us all over the west is that they want their governments to rebuild our economies and our civic societies . “Reform” and its global allies should be exposed day after day for policies that would devastate both. And for those of us who believe our best days could be ahead of us, we can go beyond highlighting Reform’s hypocrisy by setting out a case for a better Britain that appeals not just to idealists, but to pragmatists, to self-interest, and to the everyday compassion of the British people.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/reform-nigel-farage-hard-right-politics-gordon-brown-labour,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f88d36ac4c240f8bd0bb64e9786d1fd1839191/1122_0_6436_5151/master/6436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=febc73ddb146d4cbf657336b940b2883",2025-10-11T09:00:20+00:00,6ff5a86b90109092b817a5bde8dd5cccc005e2a1
3a023e18e83e,Why should you be Labour’s next deputy leader? Guardian readers quiz the candidates,,"What would you do to tackle the cost of living crisis that has ravaged working-class communities? Stephen Heinson , Cardiff Bridget Phillipson: I wouldn’t be here without Labour governments. They spurred me on my journey from a tough council street in the north-east all the way to the cabinet. We had no heating upstairs when I was growing up, and we struggled with damp. But that story’s not unique: it’s shared by so many working people across Britain. That’s why I have been fighting for changes that will make a difference to working families. Such as reviving Sure Start for a new generation, funding childcare from nine months old, rolling out free breakfast clubs, expanding free school meals for half a million more children and capping the branded items schools can require. Together these changes save working-class families thousands of pounds. As co-chair of the Child Poverty Taskforce, I am clear everything is on the table, including removing the two-child limit. As deputy leader I would continue fighting for policies that change the lives of working people: investment in public services, ensuring the full delivery of our employment rights bill so people get fair pay for a fair day’s work – change that makes Labour members proud of this government, proud to campaign, proud to win again. Lucy Powell: The cost of living crisis, Covid, austerity and the global financial crisis have all hit working-class communities hardest. Each has deepened inequalities in class, region, education and opportunity. Addressing this is what this Labour government is about. We have an economy that serves the few, not the many – a “trickle-down” model that needs rewiring. I want to see a much stronger sense that tackling economic inequality and fairness unites everything we do. That’s one of the reasons I strongly support lifting the two-child benefit cap at the forthcoming budget, looking at Gordon Brown’s measures on gambling taxes to pay for it. As deputy, I would help to seize back the political megaphone to set the terms of the debate, being clear about what we are doing to reshape the economy in the interests of working-class communities – buses and trains back in public hands, a new energy company, GB Energy, owned by us all, more dignity and security in work and at home with the employment bill and renters rights bill. The job of the deputy leader isn’t to write a separate budget or policy programme but to ensure that our values shine through, and what we are doing is rooted in the communities we are here to serve. Stephen Heinson: Sadly, neither candidate seems able to acknowledge that the cost of living crisis is really a crisis of our failed economic model. There’s a direct link between declining living standards and unrestrained corporate greed: the private energy companies skimming off huge profits from ballooning household bills, for instance, or the property developers and letting agents cashing in on renters’ misery in a broken housing market. Tackling this crisis meaningfully would mean defying the corporate interests of Labour’s CEO donors. How are you going to address the rise of the far right in this country? Dominique Sandring , London BP: The Labour movement has been defined for generations by our core values – solidarity, compassion, fairness and social justice. As deputy leader, I’d campaign with hope and optimism, underpinned always by those Labour values that mean so much to our members. We should be proud of our values – proud to stand up for them, never ashamed of them. The far right feeds off fear and negativity, exploiting the struggles of people across the country and offering false solutions and empty promises. Let me be clear: we won’t win by parroting the language of Reform UK and Nigel Farage. We are Labour and we must govern, campaign, and win as Labour. We must deliver on the change that we promised voters so we can build the society we all want to see. That means expanding free school meals, renewing Sure Start and reforming employment rights to make work pay. It is only a united Labour party, the greatest vehicle for social justice this country has ever seen, that can deliver real change in our communities and country. LP: Fighting the forces of division and hate is the challenge of our age. The future of our democracy depends on us winning the battle of hearts and minds, showing that mainstream progressive politics is a force for change. We’ve got to up our game. As deputy leader I would help Labour do that. We shouldn’t try to out-Reform Reform UK. Nigel Farage wants the country to believe that immigrants are the root cause of all our problems. I wholeheartedly reject that. Yes, we need secure and strong borders as a foundation of a secure and fair country, but the reasons for deep-seated inequalities go much deeper. We need to seize back the political megaphone and set out far more strongly our diagnosis of what is really wrong with this country, and what Labour is doing to fix it. We have an economy that hasn’t worked for ordinary people for decades. From Margaret Thatcher to austerity, Covid and the energy crisis, those with wealth and assets have done well. For everyone else, life has got harder and less secure. We need to show that every single thing we are doing is in service of addressing this – to tell our own story about how we’re fixing the real problems. Dominique Standring: Reading the answers side by side, my sense is that Lucy Powell has answered the question better in that she has identified that Reform are winning the battle of hearts and minds – and that Labour’s message is not cutting through. Bridget Phillipson talks of Labour’s values being “solidarity, compassion, fairness, and social justice”, but I have not seen much evidence of this with the Labour government: from its stance on family reunification for those with visas to the genocide in Gaza and focus on ID cards. Crucially, neither of them have answered the “how” part of my question in any detail. Why isn’t Labour adopting a wealth tax? Can you give an example of a country where such a tax has been successful? Norma Spark , London BP: I’ve always believed in progressive taxation – it’s at the core of building a fairer and more equal society. The nature of our economy has been changing, with more people earning money from the wealth they hold; we have started to address that through the changes on carried interest, by increasing capital gains tax. And of course through non-dom reforms – you can’t simply be allowed to opt out of paying your fair share. It’s right that we all pay a fair share to deliver a better public realm, and that the broadest shoulders carry the greater burden. In government, I’ve put those values into action already, taking on the private school lobby to end tax breaks so we can invest in state education. I’ve been pilloried for it across the rightwing press, but I’ll never back down on that. I’m not afraid to take on vested interests to improve public services. The chancellor sets and makes our policies on taxation, but with a seat at the cabinet table and as deputy leader, I’d be relentlessly focused on pushing for more investment in public services so we can fix the foundations of our society and give everyone the best chance in life. LP: Let’s be honest, we need to tell a much stronger story about fairness and addressing inequalities, and whose side we are on. That must run through everything we do, including the budget. We have an economy in which those with assets and wealth do very well, yet for ordinary working people or those on fixed incomes, life has got harder and harder. Turning that round should be at the core of what this – and any – Labour government is about. That’s why I’ve been clear that the two-child benefit cap needs to be lifted. It’s also why we need to recognise how trust in us has been damaged by mistakes on the winter fuel allowance and proposed cuts to Pip. These measures did not seem fair. We need to give a much clearer sense of whose side we are on – and in whose interests we are governing. It’s not my job to write the budget, but it will be my job to ensure that what we do is connected with the views and experiences of our broad movement and the communities we seek to serve. Norma Spark: Bridget Phillipson cites steps the Labour government has taken or is taking to address tax inequity – all of which I applaud, but I hope Labour can be bolder. Lucy Powell recognises the need for Labour to “tell a better story” and acknowledge the mistakes it has made. This doesn’t address the benefits or pitfalls of a wealth tax. Last year, the G20 leaders agreed to engage cooperatively to ensure high net-worth individuals are effectively taxed. Neil Kinnock advocates an annual wealth tax of 2% on people with wealth of more than £10m. And Gordon Brown is advocating raising tax on the UK gambling industry to lift 500,000 children out of poverty. Though the deputy leader of the Labour party does not set the budget, they do have an important seat at the table. In advocating for options for a wealth tax, both candidates could signal their commitment to a more equitable and fair society and tell a good story! Would you tell Keir Starmer some home truths about policy, about sidelining the north-west – and about his perceived arrogance? Lee Stringfellow , Bury BP: I know this government has made mistakes – I won’t pretend otherwise, but I will promote our achievements. I have fought for policies that are true to Labour values – investing in state education by ending private schools’ tax breaks, reviving Sure Start, rolling out free breakfast clubs. I have argued for policies true to my values, to Labour’s values, and I worked with Angela Rayner doing the same. She challenged us as ministers to always go further for working people, to be impatient for the change they deserve. With my own mandate as deputy leader, I would continue that role. But I absolutely refuse to pit one area of our country against another. It’s the role of the deputy leader to bring all the parts of our party together, from every corner of our country. Last year I campaigned up and down the country to get Labour candidates elected, I’ve not stopped as education secretary and I won’t stop as deputy leader. With local elections and elections in Wales and Scotland around the corner, the role is going to be more important than ever. LP: This isn’t about personalities, it’s about how we use power effectively after 14 years out of government, and we have some achievements to shout about. The problem is they are being drowned out by unforced errors. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a straight talker, unafraid to be an honest voice. I told home truths on welfare, and maybe it wasn’t well received, but it won’t stop me speaking truth to power. But I won’t snipe from the sidelines or take to the airwaves. Discussion isn’t dissent – it’s vital if we’re to rebuild our electoral coalition. I really want this government to succeed. With the mandate of members I would have a strong, independent role, outside but alongside government. It’s a responsibility I would take very seriously and use wisely, but I think it’s self-evident that we can do better. There’s been too much groupthink, disconnected from the voices, talents and experiences of all of our broad movement, which is Labour’s strength. I’ll be that bridge with our members and elected representatives, pushing us all to be the best version of a Labour government we can be. Lee Stringfellow: All Bridget Phillipson has done with her answer is given a response Starmer would want me to hear. She has zero credibility as a serving minister to fight against the wrong decisions and actually listen to members. As for Lucy Powell: what is wrong with a little discord and actually saying what you believe – and indeed, what the party members and voters believe? This government has tied itself in knots with its no-sense fiscal rules and left itself with little room to manoeuvre; and all the while, who suffers? Normal taxpayers. We are heading for electoral oblivion sooner than we think if we do not grasp the nettle this year with some zinger policies that outflank Reform. Powell answered the better of the two – but I suspect Starmer will sideline her. Thanks for your answers, but this longtime Labour voter is now considering the Lib Dems. Why isn’t the government considering rejoining the customs union? What will you do to convince Starmer to see sense? Toby Hannam , Bristol BP: Back in 2016 I argued that Brexit would inflict serious economic damage on areas such as Sunderland. No part of the UK had more at stake than the north-east of England. That’s why I campaigned for remain and was one of the first MPs to call for a second referendum on the details of the deal. But those decisions are in the past – we need to focus on the future. What businesses need most now is certainty to drive economic growth and stability. The progress we have made securing an SPS trade deal with the EU is essential for British businesses, as are the protections secured for British steel. In my own portfolio we’re working on opportunities to once again boost educational exchange through schemes like Erasmus+, but of course there is more to do. I will say that I think we need to change this debate and challenge toxicity. Reform are far too happy to whip up anger about immigration, and I won’t do it. My family came to Britain as immigrants, and our story is shared across this country. I want to campaign and win on Labour values, not use the language of Reform. LP: I voted remain, and worked cross-party during the Brexit years on a proposal called Common Market 2.0, because I felt strongly that we needed to respect the outcome of the referendum, even though it was not what I voted for. One of the main reasons why we ended up with Boris Johnson as prime minister and a hard Brexit, losing so much of the so-called red wall, is because we didn’t listen and accept that a majority voted to leave and wanted Brexit. We shouldn’t reopen old wounds but focus on how we can make that botched Brexit deal better so ordinary people can feel the benefits – whether that’s action on e-gates to ease travel, closer ties on goods to lower food prices, or joint action on defence, security and irregular migration. People voted for Brexit, they voted for Johnson – and they voted for us in 2024 because they want change: more control over their lives and an economy that works for them, not just those at the top. The most important thing now is that we deliver the change people voted for. Toby Hannam: This is very much the party line response. The fact is we are willingly economically harming ourselves with the appalling deal Johnson and David Frost made. This idea that nothing can be done is symptomatic of the utter capitulation Labour have allowed. They’re too frightened to go near the issue due to the howling of the press and Reform – even when the benefits to the country are so clear. The deals that the government have obtained in office are such small beer. Other countries use the customs union and are not in the EU. Personally I would rejoin tomorrow. Without the significant improvement that the customs union could bring, our economy will continue to stumble on anaemically. The massive rebuilding that Labour wants to achieve won’t happen because they need at least another term. Why doesn’t Labour commit to building council houses? Sarah Woods , North Yorkshire BP: Labour’s £39bn social and affordable homes programme aims to deliver 300,000 new homes, 60% of them, or 180,000, for social rent – including new council homes. This is six times more than delivered in the past decade. It’s the biggest increase to social housing in a generation. I grew up in a council house in Washington, Sunderland, raised by a single mother and reliant on free school meals. I know first-hand the importance of council housing. Angela Rayner’s sense of the urgency of this was exceptional – she knew, as I do, that children need secure, warm, dry and safe homes in order to have the childhood and the opportunities all of us deserve. The changes Angela announced to the right to buy scheme – protecting existing social housing stock to meet housing need and delivering a fairer, more sustainable scheme – are essential. Councils will be able to retain 100% of receipts from the sale of right to buy so it can be invested in delivering more social homes. I’ve secured more than £600m to boost construction skills to ensure we have the workers we need to build housing – including introducing new construction technical excellence colleges in each region of the country. LP: We have committed to building more council housing – the biggest such commitment in a generation. Maybe people don’t hear enough about the good things Labour are doing, and that’s something I will seek to put right. The legacy Angela Rayner leaves on housing is a great one. As well as being a colleague and friend, I saw up close what an effective minister she was. More social homes, changes to right to buy so we don’t lose as much stock as we have been doing, a massive housebuilding programme and much more. Having a secure home is the bedrock of everything. In government I led on legislation, and I was proud we included a strengthened renters rights bill in the king’s speech. Sarah Woods: Bridget Phillipson has helpfully provided figures, but this raises further questions. The social and affordable homes programme has a 2035 horizon. Is the intention to build 18,000 council houses a year? According to Shelter England, as of 2023-24, there are 1.33m households on the social housing waiting list. In that year, their figures show a net loss of homes for social rent of 650. I am very glad to hear of the changes to protect existing stock from right to buy, but there will still be a loss through housing stock deterioration. Unfortunately, a considerable “Brexit benefit” was to lose free movement of workers, leaving a hole in construction capacity. It is good to see that Bridget Phillipson has secured funds to boost construction skills. However, this doesn’t deal with the immediate problem. Lucy Powell raises a very valid point on Labour’s messaging. I would like to see clearer messaging – Green party leader Zack Polanski is a breath of fresh air, showing how it’s done. Both candidates agree on the importance of a secure home. My husband and many of my schoolfriends were raised in council housing. The costs to this country from the failure of successive governments to replenish this asset are immense. A Labour government should be building with the rapidity of the 1950s, when 200,000 council houses were built annually. Do the candidates agree that reports that Earth’s carbon sinks are failing should be a turning point for humanity? Sigurdur Bennett , Edinburgh BP: The climate crisis is the biggest challenge facing humanity. I’m proud of the strong climate action this Labour government has taken to bring down emissions, showing leadership on a global stage. The weakening of the global consensus on the urgency of climate action is profoundly troubling, and Labour must continue to show that leadership. This is another example of where I’ll be ensuring we stay true to our values. I want the world of tomorrow to be a world worth living in, not a planet on fire, and the responsibility falls to us to make that happen today. We’re already seeing the effects of global warming – wildfires, failing carbon sinks , flooding. But with decisive action it’s not too late to turn things around. We simply must not let ourselves be blown off course by climate deniers and opponents criticising our vital net zero policies. LP: We have a strong agenda on the environment, and I’m proud to have Ed Miliband’s backing to be the next deputy leader. Ensuring there’s a just transition, tackling the climate crisis and achieving clean power by 2030 is a huge task, but one that Labour is up for. It’s not the job of the deputy leader to write an alternative policy manifesto – we were just elected with a strong programme on climate and nature. As deputy leader I would make sure that Labour is shouting about what we’re doing to improve our environment and motor ahead to net zero – and call out the backwards policies of Reform and the Tories, which would cost jobs and investment and worsen the climate and nature crisis. Sigurdur Bennett: Repeated failure of Earth’s carbon sinks now seems to be a serious possibility, which is frightening. Not that you’d know it from the candidates’ responses. Which might explain why the government may incentivise further North Sea oil drilling. What can you say about such an initiative? Only that it’s insane.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/labour-next-deputy-leader-guardian-readers-debate-candidates,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18fb58e2c2ef78ea0b9d13f50db22de3c0ab58b/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3ffbfe5e9808e6351591b10b93b69e6e",2025-10-11T05:00:18+00:00,ac7243c733be1ce3488a88d65af462b9e24ddcd2
d2390a6c3cd3,English democracy relies on local councillors. So why are so many facing the axe?,,"I t’s extraordinary that a profound reshaping – and shrinking – of our democracy is happening under our noses, and virtually no one notices. For baffling reasons, soon after the general election a government with a sky-high in-tray of problems embarked on a gigantic local council reorganisation no one knew about. It didn’t feature in the manifesto, nor in the local government secretary Steve Reed’s conference speech last week – but England has plans to axe unknown numbers of local councillors – some estimates put it at nearly 90%. The white paper outlining these plans actually boasts that there will be “fewer local politicians”, pandering disgracefully to the general scorn for politics. Yet voters trust councillors twice as much as they do Westminister politicians. For all the talk of localism and connecting to neighbourhoods, these are the unheralded foot soldiers of democracy. It is councillors who run political parties and much that binds their communities . Few people ever join political parties, yet the whole tottering democratic system relies entirely on those who do. Running the council and becoming a councillor is part of party members’ purpose and motivation. Abolishing so many will diminish democratic engagement over time. Many councils will be ordered to merge into unitary councils to serve a population of at least 500,000 , to deliver all local services; this will entail the abolition of hosts of district councils. (There is some “flexibility” for some with populations of fewer than 300,000.) Some won’t go quietly. Some submit alternative plans, grouping together so more of them survive. County councils, the winners from enlargement, strongly support the plan: today they launched a salvo urging the government to plough on and block their ears to the districts’ counter-plans. The budget approaches, a wretched brew of hard choices whichever way the chancellor turns. On all sides the beleaguered government faces bereft public services in need of money. The plight of councils is particularly serious: there is no money for social care’s escalating needs, Send children or the rising numbers being taken into care. There were smirks all round from other parties when Kent council, one of many captured by Reform, had to backtrack on nonsense promises for cutting of waste and taxes in its array of unicorn policies: within months Kent and the others declared defeat, finding few “net zero” and “equality” savings; it is likely to raise council tax by the maximum 5%. Council budgets have dwindled sharply as a proportion of all spending says Prof Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, and now councils’ democratic voice will shrink too. Hoping to save money with fewer councils “rationalised” under larger unitaries means some will be enormous. North Yorkshire will be a three-hour drive across; forget delivery close to home. Is there a perfectly efficient size of council? “No,” says Travers. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.” Will this save money? House of Commons library research finds : “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.” Portsmouth, one of the many towns and cities resisting , protests that its 208,000 population is an adequate size: it already delivers all services well, has no debts, and no wish to be swallowed by Hampshire. Susan Brown, Labour leader of Oxford city council with 166,000 people, is struggling to avoid being eaten by Oxfordshire into a monster council unitary of 750,000. She tells me she’s bidding to enlarge the city’s border to include its green belt, and become a unitary controlling all their services. All these boundaries will be marked out finally next March by the minister. Does anyone care much, when most are clueless about what councils do and few vote in local elections? Well they may sit up and take notice when it dawns on them that Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more ancient towns and cities will be devoured by mega-county councils that feel distant, not local at all. It may dawn on Labour MPs that this is a reverse gerrymander, damaging parties of the left. Many of these lost town councils have been little islands of Liberal Democrat yellow and Labour red, amid deep blue counties, which will now outvote them. Besides, Reform will sweep through quite a lot more next May. Don’t lose these small strongholds. Britain already has fewer elected representatives than European countries of a similar size, says Travers. Cavalier map planners at Westminster never consider how reorganisations cause huge waste of time and effort. Council CEOs complain of time spent on this, amid all their other crises. What to do about contracts when the council may no longer be there? Who wants to absorb Thurrock with its £1bn debt ? Oxfordshire county council just signed an eight-year highways contract : can that be unpicked if Susan Brown of Oxford city gets her way? skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

efbbc07815b4,We all know Brexit’s to blame for the crisis facing UK steel – it’s time for politicians to be honest and reverse it,,"W hile Keir Starmer fiddles in India , Rome burns. The British steel industry now faces a calamity so severe, insiders say it could be “terminal”. The vast majority – 80% – of its exports go to the EU , which this week revealed plans to cut tariff-free steel import quotas by almost half. The remainder will be subject to a 50% tariff. The UK steel industry will be butchered. Thank you, EU. Thank you, Brexit. Whenever I meet politicians who championed Brexit nowadays, I ask them a simple question: do you still think you were right? A few fools mutter, “Yes, on balance” and “In the long term, perhaps.” The honest ones shrug and look uncomfortable. We can all accept that some day a new generation of British politicians will resume open trade across the Channel. It is normal for an island, and makes sense. So I ask the honest ones: why not go public? Make a headline, stand up, apologise and get the ball rolling? None has done so. In May, Starmer timidly negotiated a “Brexit reset” with Brussels. This injected pockets of sanity into increasingly chaotic border controls, especially on food. A few more EU students whom Brexit had crassly restricted may be admitted, along with a new e-gate for passport entry. There must still be checks – they start rolling out from this Sunday – to enforce the rule limiting Britons to no more than 90 out of any 180 days inside the Schengen area . Further resets are mooted in coming years. According to the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, most industries just cannot wait. They are struggling to keep open markets, and if necessary realign themselves with the EU by the back door. The chemicals industry exports more than 60% of its output to the EU. Brexiteers boasted it would be liberated from EU regulation, but setting up the UK’s own regulator cost £2bn and has not worked. According to the Chemical Industries Association, output has fallen by 35-40% since 2021. Between 2021 and 2023, British exports to the EU fell by a serious 27% . Brexiteers boasted that leaving the EU would be worth hundreds of billions a year. Cambridge Econometrics estimates that over the next decade Britain’s economy will be £300bn smaller than if we had not left the EU. This is self-harm on a heroic scale. What matters is how to scramble out of the pit. For most politicians, Brexit was never a policy priority. It was a leadership stunt, conducted with the grain of Britain’s shambolic political climate in the mid-to-late 2010s. Parliament enacted what a majority of members on all sides of the Commons knew was wrong. Worse still, when a soft Brexit was a feasible least-bad option, the Labour party failed to unite with anti-Brexit Tories to retain trading links with Europe. A hugely critical national issue sank into a swamp of parliamentary infighting, on a level approaching that now being repeated in Paris . The excuse was that the public wanted it. There is no such excuse now. Voters have had the courage to look at the facts and admit the mistake. According to YouGov, 61% have concluded that Brexit is a failure. Just 13% now regard it as more of a success. Almost half want another referendum within five years, and 63% oppose loosening ties with the EU any further. That figure should daub every public meeting staged by Nigel Farage. The need is urgent for some coalition of politicians to take the lead and state baldly that Brexit was an error. Of the many failings of parliament, its inability to rise to the occasion above party politics is the most glaring. Britain’s re-entry into some trading relationship with Europe should now be the subject of a crossparty forum or select committee. They should press Starmer towards an urgent and concerted bid to reassociate with the EU. It will not be cheap, but it will be worth it. The leadership of the Tory party may find it hard to get its head round the necessary U-turn. That is tough. Its failure to explain or justify other aspects of its performance in government is already not serving it well. To accuse Starmer last May of “betrayal” and “surrender” over his EU deal was idiotic. There must be Tories who know the truth: honest politicians who follow Keynes’ purported advice and allow circumstances to alter their views. At present, as with anti-Trump Republicans in the US, the question is, when do they have the guts to surface? The public is clearly ready to see Brexit reversed. There cannot be a single industry that would oppose it. The need is for leadership. This should not be a partisan matter, except insofar as it might isolate Farage’s Reform party – and perhaps be his undoing. It should become a consensus. Of course it will not be easy. But it will be right. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

d7609ad3a0d2,I saw desperation at the Tory conference – but all traditional parties may be in this position soon,,"M uch of democratic politics is about getting people’s attention. That’s a particular problem for struggling, less-than-compelling leaders. The further your party falls in the polls, the larger the temptation to launch dramatic, supposedly transformational policies. It’s like speaking more and more loudly to someone who has stopped listening. Thus this week’s Conservative conference in Manchester, with the party at historic lows in the polls, featured a frenzy of policy announcements, on once-successful Tory themes such as tax cuts, law and order, welfare and immigration, that were often made to half-empty rooms. Expanses of blue carpet had been installed in the huge, barn-like convention centre – as if to reassure delegates that the party still had an identity – yet much of the time they were eerily deserted. The Conservatives, famed and feared for their durability, seem to be disappearing before our eyes. Their current crisis, probably their worst ever, is not just one of popularity; but of leadership, political positioning, ideology and credibility. Within a few minutes of arriving at the conference, I overheard two delegates, both suited Tory Boys of the kind that traditionally express total confidence, having a conversation that would become very familiar, away from the fixed grins of the main stage events. “I don’t think the Conservatives are in a position to win,” said one delegate, self-protectively referring to his party in the third person. “They’re in a position to stay alive.” The other interjected: “If you replace her [leader Kemi Badenoch] now, you’re polling at 10%. I think she should resign in 2028. Be a sacrificial lamb.” The other nodded. “We don’t have many [leadership] choices. A lot of good people have lost their seats …” Even more drastic solutions to the crisis are also being considered. According to a new YouGov poll, almost half the Conservatives’ shrinking membership support a merger with Reform UK – the erasure of the Tories as an independent party after almost 200 or almost 350 years, depending on how you define their hazy origins. British Conservatives can be brutally pragmatic, and the defection of their voters, members and politicians to Reform may soon reach a tipping point. “As long as there’s a rightwing party,” another delegate told me who had been a Tory for decades, “I don’t mind which one it is.” Yet frequently in Manchester the Conservative crisis created not equanimity but feverishness. Each new policy or rhetorical trope seemed more rightwing, and often more authoritarian, than the last. Deporting migrants, deregulating business, disciplining schoolchildren, dumping net zero targets, detaining more minor criminals, dismantling the supposedly liberal judiciary: all the favourite preoccupations of modern rightwing populism and much older, free-market Conservatism were recited like articles of faith. Fringe meetings with hard-right themes were better attended than most events in the main hall, with chairs running out and sweat shining on speakers’ foreheads in fuggy rooms. At one gathering, Chris Philp spoke so fast, almost ranting, about the “scourge of illegal migration”, and how “many of those migrants in hotels commit crimes and work illegally”, that he sounded more like a hotel protester than the shadow home secretary. Elsewhere on the fringe, the Tory peer David Frost had an ominous explanation for why their party is radicalising. “A good chunk of the public is probably to the right of where [Nigel] Farage is.” The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, told a fringe event: “Public opinion is shifting very fast right now, on a whole range of issues.” In his speech from the main stage, he put it more melodramatically : “The collapse of the old order is in sight. A new one is coming!” Offstage, his replacement of Badenoch as leader was constantly discussed. Yet the argument that more hard-right policies will revive the Tories, under him or anyone else, is undermined by the fact that Reform, and Tommy Robinson, are already catering to that market. Moreover, Badenoch has already moved the Conservatives sharply rightwards without halting their decline. After years of austerity, acute inequality and growing public anger at the privatised utilities, Reform’s promise to address these issues, however partially and cynically, makes their reactionary populism more in tune with the times than the Tory version, which is still stuck in the 1980s, dreaming of a small state and endlessly dynamic businesses. In the more depopulated zones of this year’s conference, there were sometimes as many cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher as delegates. Badenoch’s speech on Wednesday – her second of the conference, a break with precedent that suggested a desperation to be heard – pledged “a new approach” to Britain’s problems. But it stayed in the traditional Tory comfort zone of promising to liberate individuals and businesses while reining in the state. Even the speech’s supposed big surprise, a vow to abolish stamp duty, had a retro flavour: a tax cut that would most benefit the wealthiest in the old Thatcherite heartlands of southern England. Nothing Badenoch said suggested that she or her party were doing the self-questioning and fresh thinking that their dire position ought to prompt. If you’re not a Conservative, and have suffered from their decades of dominance, it’s tempting simply to relish their difficulties. But the attention-seeking in Manchester this week was just the most extreme and undignified version of a neediness that also afflicts other parties, in an era of tuned-out voters, low election turnouts and political fragmentation. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s cartoonish stunts and Farage’s hyperbolic press conferences, while seemingly more successful as political theatre, are also pleas to voters to notice their parties. Meanwhile Labour’s conference in Liverpool last week, which tried to use attacks on Reform to make the government’s underlying principles more compelling, has so far generated no improvement in the polls . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

4ff1ab93a1f1,Tories and Reform battle to be heirs to Thatcher’s legacy on her centenary,,"It is a glittering annual dinner in honour of the Conservative party’s most successful leader and, on the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher’s birth, one that is bigger than ever. Yet as Tory grandees, celebrity backers and wealthy donors prepare to sit down at a gala dinner at London’s Guildhall on Monday evening, a battle for her legacy is under way between the party she once led and the insurgent threat to its survival, Reform UK. Boris Johnson will make a keynote speech at the event, the Guardian has been told by its backers, joined by the main speaker, Thatcher’s son, Mark, and guests including Joan Collins, Julian Fellowes and Jeffrey Archer. But a notable absentee will be Kemi Badenoch , as the current Tory leader struggles to stave off the threat of extinction looming over the party Thatcher led to three consecutive election wins. “There is a competition as to who is best to carry forward her legacy,” said the event’s main sponsor, Mohamed Amersi, who has donated £500,000 to the Tories in the past but, like other donors, has been backing Nigel Farage’s party more recently. He said: “There’s no doubt that she would have been sympathetic to much of what Reform are saying, though at the end of the day she was still a reluctant remainer.” Amersi said it would “take time but we will find somebody”, adding there was “not a chance in hell” that Badenoch was the answer to the Tories’ challenges. Badenoch is expected to appear instead at an official party fundraiser dinner in Greenwich. She has likened herself to Thatcher, telling Tories at their annual conference that she too was being written off like Thatcher once was. While Thatcher’s face was a constant presence at this year’s Tory conference, party sources say even many on its rightwing pay lip service to her memory while regarding her small-state philosophy as out of kilter with Britain in 2025. “She is very important though when it comes to mobilising donors,” they added. Many of those donors and those who were close to Thatcher are preferring to go to more private dinners. Among those is Sir Rocco Forte, the Brexit-backing hotelier who helped to fund Johnson’s election win and knew Thatcher. He remains tentatively supportive of Badenoch. He said: “I don’t think there really is a standard bearer for [Thatcher] at the moment in politics. I would say the Conservative party itself now is divided between a big faction which I would not even call Conservative and Kemi Badenoch, who I do still think is a serious believer in what Margaret Thatcher advocated.” Tickets for the sold-out Guildhall event ranged in price from £195 for an individual up to £3,000 for a VIP table. While there will also be Tory grandees such as Michael Howard at the dinner this year, they will be joined by Reform UK figures including its deputy leader, Richard Tice. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tice said: “She was always about challenging the status quo, with strong conviction, and in a sense that is Nigel’s philosophy. The key thing is that she was a transformational leader of a country that was in trouble then, as it is now.” Events elsewhere include a dinner at the Carlton Club and an 80s-themed disco that Conservatives are holding on Monday at a location described as an ‘‘iconic central London nightclub”. Organisations that have been putting on events include the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the thinktank Thatcher co-founded and which provided the intellectual stimulus for her policies. Its director, Robert Colvile, said the Tory conference had probably gone “too far” by displaying her dresses in glass boxes. But he insisted that her political echoes remained powerful, pointing to a CPS event that was packed out by delegates. “If you look at the polls, she is consistently viewed as the most effective leader we have had. Her self-appointed mission was to turn around a Britain that was in decline and we are pretty obviously in that situation again now. Even people like Keir Starmer, while disagreeing with her policy, admit that they admire her for bringing change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/tories-reform-uk-battle-heirs-margaret-thatcher-legacy-100th-birthday,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a15d5961b573f74f5ffc8396e485daaa59fd191/921_0_4658_3726/master/4658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c34d340e0be1764e13134c3d5f5bdfc",2025-10-12T14:00:56+00:00,21057734a504112a0daf702bfb112ad9fb6b26f7
d86adcf17b9b,‘Brummies united against racism’: poster campaign takes on the far right,,"W hen Mus unfurled the leaflet lying on her driveway, she was left shocked, angry and upset. “White Britons are already a minority in London … it is clear that if these trends continue white people will become a minority in Britain,” it read. The leaflet, written by a far-right group, was distributed along her street three years ago in Moseley, a leafy suburb of Birmingham . It went on to blame NHS waiting lists, a shortage of social housing and even traffic on “the rising population”. “There we go again, blaming us for everything and causing division,” she thought at the time. But instead of ignoring it, her neighbours came together to figure out a response. “That’s what gave me hope, that people stood together and said ‘not in our names’.” They decided to fight back with their own words by creating a poster with the message: “Brummies united against racism and hate crime”. They were placed in the windows of homes all along the street. “Not long after, a neighbouring street said: ‘Oh, we had those leaflets. Can we have your posters?’” Mus said. Mus was horrified to find far-right propaganda on her doorstep. Photograph: Andrew Fox The campaign continued to grow and last year was endorsed by Birmingham city council. Now it has found renewed salience after a number of alleged hate crimes carried out in the city. Last month a Sikh woman was allegedly raped in a park in Oldbury, in what police are treating as a hate crime. A few weeks later in another park, a 12-year-old boy was allegedly beaten up in what his father described as a racist attack. A man in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of assault. “Operation raise the colours” in which St George’s and union jack flags have been erected across the UK has also caused fear and anxiety. Hope Not Hate and Stand Up to Racism said it had been organised by well-known far-right figures. The Birmingham campaign has been inundated with people who want to show solidarity with people of colour and religious minorities under increasing threat. “People are literally begging us on WhatsApp, can we have a poster?” said Anthony, who lives on the same street as Mus. To meet the demand, a fundraiser has been launched to print out 10,000 posters and distribute them across the city. “Birmingham is a multicultural city and I think it’s important to stand in solidarity with our neighbours, regardless of race, culture or religion,” he said. “Recent events such as flagging and rise of Reform UK are not things I feel comfortable with.” The campaign also hopes to spread beyond the city. According to Mus, activists in Worcester want to mobilise a similar, poster-led initiative. Like Birmingham, the city has recently had a number of racist incidents. Last month, swastikas and the words “no Jew” were painted on garages and on Friday a man and child were sprayed with an unknown substance in an attack described by police as “racially aggravated”. Mus said since the attacks she had avoided visiting parks for fear of being attacked. She is not alone. As a Muslim woman, Raiza* said she felt like a “walking target” in the city. She said her area was full of lamp-posts adorned with the St George’s flag. “I felt quite intimidated by it. I thought, how am I going explain this to my young kids?” One woman felt that Robert Jenrick’s attitude was ‘irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community he is commenting on’. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty She has also stopped taking her children to the park after the alleged assault on the 12-year-old boy. “You don’t know who’s hostile towards you or who’s completely fine. My kids are fourth-generation British, so we’re pretty established here, but I haven’t felt like this in the past.” She feels that politicians have “done nothing to stop this”, adding “if anything, it’s been encouraged”. Earlier this week, comments by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, complaining about visiting an area of Birmingham where he “didn’t see another white face” were revealed by the Guardian. Razia called the comments by Jenrick, who is seen as still harbouring ambitions to become the next leader of the Conservative party, “unhelpful, irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community that he is commenting on”. She has a poster, but she is hesitant to display it in her window for fear of being marked as a target. “We don’t know if we have any allies where we are living,” she said. “I think it’s important for white people to actually stand up and say, ‘no, I’m not having it’, now more than ever,” said Anthony. “If people want to wave flags and be patriotic, I have no problem with that, but the way that it’s being used now is to stir up resentment. It intimidates people, which I don’t think some seem to understand.” It is hoped that the posters will draw lines in the sand to fend off the far right and show solidarity to those feeling under threat. “People are really behind the idea. It doesn’t take a lot of effort to put up a poster in your window,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/12/brummies-united-against-racism-birmingham-poster-campaign-takes-on-the-far-right,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e306031449b36a3a35df4c311a007b7c99b75fef/610_0_5581_4463/master/5581.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=475ab66a4bc66673b680059a39913f66",2025-10-12T06:00:44+00:00,cfdabe3a97aae4eb09275a618211c4e3994209b9
2785e1d33eba,Rachel Reeves v the OBR: chancellor aims to loosen the watchdog’s grip,,"For a crew of 50-odd nerds sharing an uninspiring concrete block in Westminster with the Ministry of Justice, the Office for Budget Responsibility has come to wield extraordinary power. It was the OBR projections of Rachel Reeves’s evaporating headroom that left the chancellor scrambling for welfare cuts in March. And it is the watchdog’s rethink about productivity growth that means the chancellor is sure to deliver a second tax-raising budget on 26 November. The Treasury is determined to avoid being dragged around by the OBR in 2026. And so, as she draws up a revenue-raising package, the chancellor is aiming to accumulate more headroom against her fiscal rules, so that every £1bn shift is less make-or-break; and to downgrade the status of the OBR’s spring forecast. Set up during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, the independent forecaster was meant to prevent politicians from tweaking economic forecasts to suit their own ends. As Labour came to power it embraced the new system, now 15 years old, with Reeves even legislating to prevent future fiscal events taking place without an OBR forecast, as she sought to remind voters of Liz Truss’s catastrophic tenure. Labour saw complying with the the watchdog’s strictures as a crucial signal to investors in government bond markets that the incoming administration had a clear plan for fixing the public finances. Led by the former Treasury and International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Richard Hughes, recently reappointed for a second five-year term, the OBR produces two forecasts a year by law, measuring the chancellor’s tax and spending plans against her fiscal rules . With Reeves’s tricky second budget approaching, it is the OBR’s decision to revisit its long-term assumptions about productivity growth that is causing alarm in No 11. The OBR’s view of this key determinant of economic growth has long looked optimistic relative to the consensus. The resulting reassessment is expected to put forecasts for the public finances in 2030 between £10bn and £30bn adrift of where they appeared to be in March. Reeves and her ministerial colleagues privately grumble that the OBR could and should have reviewed its productivity forecasts earlier. If it had done so while the Conservatives were still in power, Jeremy Hunt’s pre-election cuts to national insurance contributions might have looked unaffordable. Instead, with Labour already struggling in the polls, it will be Reeves who has to explain to the public that the economy is weaker than previously thought – and impose tax increases to make up for the shortfall. Tensions between the OBR and the Treasury have spilled into the open in recent weeks, with Reeves using an interview to call on the forecaster to “score” , that is to say include in its projections, pro-growth government policies. To avoid another spring scramble for savings, Reeves is also considering having the OBR assess her against her rules only once a year. As recommended by the IMF in May , the spring forecast would be indicative rather than binding – perhaps focusing on economic growth rather than the fiscal picture. “The IMF have said that we should move to just one major fiscal event a year, and I agree with their recommendations,” Reeves told Times Radio last week. “To be able to do that, we do need to change the way that the OBR do their forecasting. Two full forecasts a year make it harder to have that one fiscal event.” Hughes has expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for that plan, however – telling MPs at a recent Treasury select committee hearing: “The UK has been doing two economic forecasts and fiscal forecasts a year since 1975 … Were we to reduce the number of forecasts to one, that would make us one of the least fiscally transparent countries in Europe and of any major advanced economy.” Adding that his reading of the IMF’s recommendation was that if the government looked set to miss its fiscal rules in the spring it could “let it ride, and make more policy decisions in the autumn”, Hughes insisted: “The government have that option now, and they always had that option.” With Labour losing support in the polls, some of the party’s backbenchers have expressed concern about what they see as the OBR’s malign influence, with Louise Haigh calling it an “unelected institution” that “dictates the limits of government ambition” . Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England, said: “It’s really about how do you stop this silly dance where the government adjusts long-run plans to short-run moves in bond markets. Forecasts are not a bad thing per se, but it’s the tail wagging the dog.” The leftwing thinktank the New Economics Foundation has called for forecasting to be taken back into the Treasury , with an external Office for Fiscal Transparency acting more as a quality check and the chancellor making the final decision. It argues this would be a more democratic framework. James Meadway, a former economic adviser to John McDonnell and host of the podcast Macrodose, argues that it is impossible to drain the politics out of forecasting. “These aren’t neutral facts at all – they’re hotly contested, just like everything else in economics,” he said. He argues for the OBR to act more like the US Congressional Budget Office, which has a wider role in analysing economic policies, including costing opposition plans, for example. However, Jonathan Portes, a former government economist and now professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, said it was a mistake to lay the blame for the government’s predicament with the OBR. “Are the current rules and the current horizons the right ones? There is no right answer. But the big picture is, that’s not the constraint at the moment – the constraint at the moment is the markets’ view of whether the UK’s position is fiscally sustainable.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/11/rachel-reeves-v-the-obr-chancellor-aims-to-loosen-the-watchdogs-grip,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff33dfa476f52d953898428179b241bf0362054f/529_55_2275_1820/master/2275.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=232c0f68c346a12756cbd95133c8637e",2025-10-11T06:00:17+00:00,55faae680a6d8d737b0dd0ee873d6cedc69f8f24
be9e4c47e93e,Will UK taxpayers get their £122m back from PPE Medpro?,,"The five-year unravelling of Britain’s most high-profile Covid contracts scandal involving a baroness, her husband and multimillion-pound government deals accelerated last week with a high court judgment against the company linked to the former Tory peer Michelle Mone . The judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, ruled that PPE Medpro, owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, supplied defective personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in the NHS during the pandemic. Cockerill ordered that PPE Medpro must return the sum of £122m, which the Department of Health and Social Care paid for the order of 25m sterile surgical gowns, under a contract awarded in June 2020 via the VIP lane. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hailed the judgment as vindication for the Labour government’s stated determination to recover some of the billions of pounds in public money wasted during the Covid crisis by Boris Johnson’s administration. “We want our money back. We are getting our money back,” Reeves posted on X . “And it will go where it belongs – in our schools, NHS and communities.” The June contract, and another worth £80.85m to supply face masks, also paid for by the DHSC, were granted to PPE Medpro after Mone approached the then Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in May 2020. Her offer was processed via the “VIP lane”, the system operated by Johnson’s government, giving priority to politically connected people such as Mone, treating them as more credible than experienced PPE suppliers. For years afterwards, Mone and Barrowman through their former lawyers denied involvement in PPE Medpro, until in late 2023 they acknowledged their roles and Mone admitted they had lied . Michelle Mone first approached the the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, in May 2020 with an offer to supply surgical equipment. Composite: Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock/Indigo/Getty The gowns were rejected on inspection in September 2020 at the NHS warehousing facilities in Daventry, Northamptonshire, because their labels were invalid, and also signalled that they had not been certified as sterile, a life-protecting requirement. Cockerill ordered that the £122m be repaid by 15 October. Yet in this apparent tale of British justice finally restoring taxpayers’ millions paid out for unsafe medical supplies, there is a looming snag. The judgment is not against Barrowman personally, but his company, which has been left with very little money or assets. In fact, on 30 September, the day before Cockerill delivered her judgment, PPE Medpro Ltd was put into insolvency and administrators appointed. So although the company has until Wednesday to repay the £122m, there appears no realistic possibility that it can. In a series of public statements since the judgment, Mone has accused Reeves of inflammatory language after the chancellor jokingly confirmed that the government had “a vendetta” against the couple, and Barrowman has repeatedly said the judgment was wrong, “a white wash [sic] of the facts”. Neither had given any indication that they intended to fund the repayment of the money, until a new statement on Friday evening when their spokesperson said for the first time that the PPE Medpro “consortium” was prepared to discuss “a possible settlement with the government”. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had been paid at least £65m from PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. The couple said in a BBC interview in December 2023 that Barrowman’s children were also beneficiaries of the trust. In a statement on 4 October, Barrowman’s spokesperson hit out at PPE Medpro’s supply-chain companies, saying the administrator could bring legal claims against them. It is difficult to see the basis for this, given that PPE Medpro accepted the gowns five years ago and has always argued they complied with the DHSC contract. Barrowman describes PPE Medpro and its supply-chain companies as a consortium. Barrowman’s spokesperson confirmed PPE Medpro’s profits, saying of the £203m from the DHSC, the company paid £137m to the supply-chain companies to source and buy the PPE, which left a profit of £66m for Barrowman’s company. Of that, according to the spokesperson’s figures, PPE Medpro made a £39m profit on the contract for the gowns that were never used. However, although Barrowman made so much from the PPE Medpro deals, and the couple have over the years owned luxury yachts, a private jet and prestige properties in different locations, there is no clear route to the government recovering even a penny after the judgment. The Guardian asked the couple’s spokesperson this week if Barrowman intended to provide the £122m so that PPE Medpro could repay the DHSC. The spokesperson replied: “We are unable to comment on any matters that relate directly to PPE Medpro Ltd. This is not an attempt to avoid your questions. PPE Medpro is now in administration and only the administrators are able to comment on the company. It is vital to make clear, to avoid any misunderstanding, that the court case and subsequent ruling was against PPE Medpro, NOT Mr Barrowman.” The Guardian asked the spokesperson to clarify if that meant Barrowman and Mone did not intend to fund the return of the £122m, or repay any of the money received from PPE Medpro profits. The spokesperson replied: “This is not what my statement said at all, and is a huge leap and incorrect for you to reach this conclusion. Let me be clear: ‘At no stage have we stated that Mr Barrowman has no intention of making any payment to the DHSC. We have been clear that we cannot answer any questions regarding PPE Medpro.’” Michelle Mone and her husband, Doug Barrowman. Photograph: Jeff Moore/PA Media The spokesperson added: “Furthermore, you include Baroness Mone – why? She received no money from the DHSC contract. Her involvement as an introducer was fully disclosed to the DHSC … so to connect her and suggest she must repay money simply because she is married to Mr Barrowman is both unfair and disingenuous and shows that you have a personal/public agenda against her.” In the new statement sent on Friday evening, Barrowman’s spokesperson said: “The consortium partners of PPE Medpro are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government.” PPE Medpro is now bust – put into administration by Perree Ptc, a private trust company linked to Barrowman registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, which had a mortgage-style charge against the company. Barrowman’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about Perree, or the circumstances in which it had put the company into administration. The whole legal basis for limited companies is to protect the people who have put money in from becoming personally liable for all its debts: to give the owners limited liability. If Barrowman, who described himself in the 2023 BBC interview as the ultimate beneficial owner of PPE Medpro, and who received £65m in profits, does not wish to pay the DHSC, the legal routes to enforcing the judgment appear difficult. There are only narrow circumstances in which an administrator or somebody owed money, the government in this case, can get behind a company’s limited liability – “pierce the corporate veil” in legal terminology – and enforce payment from directors or shareholders. “There is no obvious, easy route to recover money from any individuals behind the company in this case,” Simon Walsh, a commercial litigation partner at SA Law , said. “The circumstances for piercing the corporate veil can include where an administrator proves that transactions have been improper, or fraudulent. This may not apply here and investigating it will inevitably be costly, complex and time-consuming. There is a real risk of a pyrrhic victory for the government in this case.” It appears that any process for seeking repayment of the £122m is separate to the long-running investigation by the National Crime Agency into PPE Medpro and whether Mone and Barrowman may have committed criminal offences, including fraud by false representation , in the procurement of the contracts. The couple deny any criminal wrongdoing. The NCA has confirmed that it began its investigation in May 2021, and in April the following year law enforcement officers raided the couple’s mansion on the Isle of Man and their London home, as well as the PPE Medpro offices. In December 2023, Mone and Barrowman agreed to a freezing order of more than £75m worth of assets, including bank accounts, wealth management accounts and shares held in companies owning luxury properties, after an application by the Crown Prosecution Service under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The NCA has not provided any detailed information about the time it is taking or when the CPS might decide whether there will be any criminal charges. PPE Medpro’s barrister, Charles Samek KC, complained during the high court trial that the NCA investigation was “long-running and seemingly never-ending”, and “hanging … like Damocles’ sword” over the company “without ever seemingly being progressed”. In response to questions about how long it was taking, the NCA has said in a statement: “Investigations must pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. In serious economic crime investigations these lines of inquiry can be incredibly complex. It can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted.” Illustration: Guardian Design Reeves has insisted the government is determined to recover money lost in failed pandemic spending, pointing to the establishment of the Covid counter-fraud commissioner among other initiatives. In the PPE Medpro case, however, it risks having spent more millions for an expert legal team led by Paul Stanley KC to win a hard-fought £122m judgment it cannot enforce. Government sources have not provided any information about what it might do if the money is not paid on Wednesday. The DHSC has declined to expand on the comments of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who said on the day of the judgment: “PPE Medpro must now repay the government and the taxpayer £122m. My department will work closely with PPE Medpro Limited’s administrators to recover everything we can.” Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, a key member of the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition which was a core participant in the Covid public inquiry into the pandemic contracts debacle, said: “There appear to be very few levers the government has available to recover anything close to the £122m the high court has ordered PPE Medpro to repay. The whole case stands as a further indictment of the ‘VIP lane’ and the flawed, wasteful procurement of PPE during the pandemic.” This saga of the Conservative peer, her businessman husband, Johnson’s Tory government and the multimillion-pound Covid contracts has some way to run yet.

5b3062cc6487,Israelis and Palestinians Await Hostage-Prisoner Swap With Relief and Elation,"israel gaza war, palestinians, kidnapping and hostages, israel katz, benjamin netanyahu, abdel fattah el-sisi, donald trump, hamas, egypt, gaza city, gaza strip, israel, jerusalem, sharm el sheikh, internal-open-access-from-nl","Israelis and Palestinians prepared on Sunday for an exchange of all of the living hostages still held in Gaza for about 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, the cornerstone of a new cease-fire agreement. The Israeli government said the exchange was expected to begin on Monday morning local time, but Israel was prepared for it to happen even sooner. Under the agreement, Israel is supposed to free the Palestinian prisoners — scores of them serving life terms for deadly attacks on Israelis — in parallel with the hostage releases. “This is a historic event that blends sorrow over the release of murderers and joy over the return of hostages,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a recorded statement broadcast on Sunday evening. On both sides, there was relief mixed with elation after two devastating years of war. Adding to the hope: The open-ended truce between Israel and Hamas, which was brokered by the United States and Arab mediators and began at noon on Friday, appeared to be holding over the weekend. As part of the first phase of the cease-fire deal , Israeli forces have withdrawn to a new defensive line inside Gaza. The war created a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the deal provides a pathway for desperately needed food, medicine and other supplies, which are starting to flow in. On Sunday, efforts appeared to be underway to increase aid deliveries, with dozens of trucks crossing the border from Egypt, according to news footage. The number of trucks entering Gaza is supposed to double under the cease-fire, to about 600 per day. The United Nations World Food Program said on Saturday that it had begun scaling up its operations in Gaza and that in the coming weeks it planned to increase the number of bakeries it supports to 30 from 10. The war in Gaza killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Most of the two million residents of Gaza were displaced multiple times. With the cease-fire signed, thousands of displaced Palestinian residents have headed back to Gaza City in the north of the territory over the past days. President Trump left the United States on Sunday and land in Israel on Monday for a short visit. He is set to meet with the families of hostages and address the Israeli Knesset, or Parliament, in Jerusalem. He then is scheduled to fly to Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea, where he and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt will lead a summit with other Arab partners who supported the deal. World leaders have also been invited to attend. Unveiling the cease-fire plan late last month, Mr. Trump described the occasion as “potentially one of the great days ever in civilization.” His celebratory declarations about bringing peace to the Middle East may be premature, however. Mr. Netanyahu struck a more sober tone in his own statement on Sunday, speaking in Hebrew to his domestic audience. “Everywhere we fought, we won,” he said. “But in the same breath, I must tell you: The campaign is not over,” Mr. Netanyahu cautioned. “There are still very great security challenges ahead of us. Some of our enemies are trying to rebuild themselves to attack us again. And as we say, ‘We’re on it.’” Analysts say the Gaza cease-fire deal lacks details and leaves many critical questions unanswered, including whether Hamas will be disarmed and stripped of its power in Gaza and how the territory will be governed after the war. Mr. Trump’s road map for ending the war envisions Hamas laying down its weapons and the demilitarization of Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu has long insisted on those steps as conditions for ending the war in Gaza. But Hamas officials have expressed deep reservations about both steps. It is also unclear which, if any, countries were planning to send troops to join an international stabilization force that Mr. Trump had suggested would handle security in postwar Gaza. Adding to the confusion, Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, issued a statement on Sunday saying that the greatest challenge for his country after the hostages’ release would be “the destruction of all of Hamas’s terror tunnels in Gaza.” Mr. Katz said that mission would be carried out directly by Israeli military forces “and by means of the international mechanism that will be established under the leadership and supervision of the United States.” Destroying the tunnels would be the main expression of the demilitarization of Gaza and the dismantling Hamas’s weapons, Mr. Katz said. He said he had “instructed the Israeli military to prepare to carry out the mission.” But Israeli forces have now withdrawn from Gaza City, where much of the Hamas military infrastructure remains intact, according to Israeli leaders, who only recently described the city as one of the militant group’s last bastions. Israeli forces had been taking over the core of Gaza City in a new phase of their campaign aimed at destroying Hamas’s military and governing abilities when the deal stopped them in their tracks. Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli forces cannot return to areas from which they have withdrawn as long as Hamas is seen as complying with the deal. Asked about Mr. Katz’s statement, an Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under army rules, said there were different ways to deal with the demilitarization of Gaza and disarming Hamas. He said that Israeli forces could still operate east of their new line within Gaza, in areas they control, and that the international mechanism was still to be determined. But one commentator warned Israel may have less freedom to resume fighting this time around. “Israel is mistaken in thinking that it will be able to afford either to return to war or to maintain a Lebanese model of frequent attacks,” Yoav Limor, a commentator on military affairs for Israel Hayom, a right-wing daily, wrote Sunday. He was referring to Israel’s frequent military strikes against targets in Lebanon despite a cease-fire reached almost a year ago that was meant to end its war with Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militia. “That will never be tolerated, and judging by Trump’s recent statements, he, too, is determined to move on and has no interest in getting sucked back into Gaza’s problems,” Mr. Limor said. Hamas set off the war in Gaza by leading an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians. It was the deadliest day in the country’s history. Roughly 250 other people were abducted. Scores of hostages were released during two past, temporary cease-fires, and a handful were rescued in military operations. The Israeli government says that 20 hostages are now expected to be freed, and the remains of 26 who died in captivity are to be returned. The condition of two other captives has not been confirmed.

The Lost Chances to Reach a Hostage Deal, and a Cease-Fire, Months Ago","us politics, israel gaza war, war;armed conflicts, peace process, palestinians, hamas, donald trump, benjamin netanyahu, joe biden, steven witkoff, israel, gaza strip, internal-open-access-from-nl","Why now? Why did it take 736 days? That was the question coursing through the celebrations on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday night, as hundreds of thousands of people poured into Hostage Square. They were anticipating the release early Monday of the 20 hostages believed still alive and the possible end of a brutal war that left Gaza destroyed, and Israel at once stronger and more diplomatically isolated than ever. Holding up photos of the remaining hostages, the crowds cheered on Saturday evening at the mention of President Trump, who many Israelis believe forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize this moment. They listened intently to Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, address the cheering throngs. But overarching the moment was the question of whether this deal could have been done far sooner, when more hostages may have been alive, and before tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed. That argument lay behind the boos that ran through the crowd when Mr. Witkoff mentioned Mr. Netanyahu. Hearing the reaction, Mr. Witkoff tried to defend Mr. Netanyahu, insisting that “I was in the trenches with the prime minister” and saw how he was seeking “a safer, stronger future for the Jewish people.” That was met with more booing. Historians may argue for years whether the Israel-Hamas war could have ended a year ago this week, when Israeli forces tripped upon and killed Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. Or, alternatively, whether Israel and Hamas missed a chance to build on the cease-fire that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his aides left in place before Mr. Trump took over. Despite the fact that Mr. Witkoff was involved in the January deal, it did not stick, and early in Mr. Trump’s term the war resumed, bringing with it more death and suffering. Debates over how wars could have ended sooner, and saved thousands or millions of lives, are hardly new. Historians are still arguing over whether Japan would have surrendered anyway if President Harry S. Truman had decided against dropping two atomic weapons; whether President Richard M. Nixon waited years too long to get out of Vietnam. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump argued for an earlier exit from Afghanistan. “This is a different moment — we didn’t have then what President Trump has now,” Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden’s secretary of state, said in a telephone interview over the weekend. “Hamas is defeated as a military organization, isolated diplomatically, it’s lost its patrons — Iran, Hezbollah and the Houthis — and it has alienated the people of Gaza.” He added: “Israel long ago achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas’s capacity to repeat Oct. 7 and killing the leaders responsible — at great cost to Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire. The Israeli people want the remaining hostages home and the war to end.” Here is a look at some of the explanations for why the hostage release — and perhaps a new start for Gaza — is happening now. Feints, Bluffs and an Election Two years ago this week, after the Oct. 7 attack, Mr. Biden traveled to Israel to show his solidarity. But he also issued a warning — strongly in private, his aides reported later, and more gently in public — that there was a risk to overreaction. “Justice must be done,” Mr. Biden said on his one-day visit on Oct. 18, 2023. “But I caution that, while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.” Mr. Biden was reacting to the fact that Israel had already cut off virtually all food and fuel to Gaza. For a while, the United States kept the pressure off the Israelis, even vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution to keep humanitarian corridors open to allow the flow of food and civilians. Mr. Biden would need time, American officials maintained, to quietly negotiate a deal. But neither side was ready. Hamas spent the summer of 2024 arguing over how far Israeli forces would have to pull back along the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip along the border between Gaza and Egypt. “The blame is on Hamas, because it could have been done all these steps earlier, but they refused to discuss disarmament or relinquishing control,” said Amos Yadlin, a former head of military intelligence for Israel who runs MIND Israel, a strategic consulting company. “But it is also on Netanyahu, because it wasn’t until last summer that he was even willing to lay out demands for ending the war.” Then Mr. Trump won the presidency back, and the Biden administration was determined to get a cease-fire in place by January, before it left office. It drafted a peace plan, much of which was quite similar to the “20 point plan” Mr. Trump recently issued. There was slow progress: More than 130 hostages had been released by the time the January cease-fire took place. “We handed over a cease-fire that silenced the guns, had hostages coming out and aid going in, along with a day-after plan to make it permanent,” Mr. Blinken said. But when the new administration took over, “the moment was squandered,” he added. “Israel and Hamas went back to war for eight months.” Israeli officials tell a different story. Mr. Biden was a lame duck, they noted, and disengaged. Trump was a known entity, less likely to lecture Mr. Netanyahu in private or public. They put their money on a new president, and a new negotiating team. A Changed Battlefield in 2025 Much changed in Israel’s favor in the new year. Mr. Sinwar’s death sent Hamas into a leadership crisis. Israel’s military pressure grew as Hamas’ supply of ammunition was depleted. And “the 12-day war with Iran really moved the needle,” said Brett McGurk, who had negotiated in the region since the Bush administration and was running the talks for Mr. Biden. Suddenly, Hamas realized that the country that had both bankrolled and supplied it could no longer be relied upon. Multiple factors, Palestinian analysts say, pushed Hamas to begin rethinking the value of continuing to hold the hostages. “In the beginning, Hamas thought taking the hostages would deter the Israeli government from waging a big war,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian professor of political science in Egypt, who fled Gaza early in the war., Now, the logic of holding hostages may have flipped: Rather than protect Gaza from attack, several analysts have noted, their existence was giving Mr. Netanyahu an excuse to press ahead. “If Hamas said no, the war would have gone on — the bloodshed, the destruction and the killing would have gone on and on,” Mr. Abusada said. “So Hamas decided: Let’s just accept this offer and believe the guarantees that the war will not return.” The Trump Factor Mr. Trump famously has little time or patience for traditional diplomacy. If the State Department’s approach to cease-fires and peace negotiations is to labor over maps and work through diplomatic channels, defining boundaries and anticipating loopholes, Mr. Trump negotiates the way he struck real estate deals in New York: in broad concepts, leaving the details to others . Administration officials say the result suggests that this should be Mr. Trump’s model for the future. “He pursued a very nontraditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it,” Vice President JD Vance said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “And, of course, the president was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it.” Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Netanyahu largely benefited from a changed tone. Mr. Trump has hosted him at the White House four times, more than any other world leader. He has called for the cancellation of the prime minister’s corruption trial, he has opposed calls for the recognition of a Palestinian state, and he has ordered U.S. forces to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. On Gaza, the president put few, if any, guardrails on Israel’s offensive, bucking international demands for a cease-fire. Moreover, to Israel’s delight, the new president wasted weeks consumed with a bizarre plan to annex Gaza, somehow pushing out the Palestinians and building a glistening beach resort, similar to Miami. (Mr. Trump once held a similar fantasy about North Korea, and even made North Korea’s leader a short film, with mock-ups of water parks and luxury condos.) In the case of Gaza, he circulated an AI-created video of a luxury resort city, with images of him and Mr. Netanyahu sipping coffee. The prime minister humored him, praising his vision even while stepping up military pressure. And Mr. Trump signaled the importance of a deal by bringing Mr. Kushner back into the swirl of diplomacy, hoping that his business connections with Qatar and other players in the region could be leveraged to good advantage. It was Mr. Kushner who negotiated the Abraham Accords in the first term, in which Arab states recognized Israel — a huge step. Of course, those connections fuel Mr. Trump’s critics, who see a blurring of diplomacy and for-profit deals. But the Israeli attempt to kill Hamas negotiators in Qatar, dropping a bomb on their temporary residence, both angered Mr. Trump and awakened him . It gave the United States the opportunity to rally Arab states around the 20-point plan, even if they thought many of the details would not work. And so when Mr. Trump called Mr. Netanyahu to the White House in September, following the opening of the U.N. General Assembly, the prime minister was in no position to resist him. He had to call the prime minister of Qatar and read an apology to him — while White House photographers recorded the moment. The message was clear: Mr. Netanyahu was now in a new world, where he had to heed some American mandates. Then Mr. Trump pressed the Israeli leader to sign on to his 20-point plan, with its cease-fire and the insertion of a “technocratic” temporary government in Gaza backed by an international stability force. While it fell short of Mr. Netanyahu’s maximalist demands, he had to agree to the document. He was both indebted to Mr. Trump and aware that provoking his capricious counterpart could lead to negative consequences for himself and for Israel. He may have also been betting that Hamas would reject the deal, because it required the terrorist group to disarm and leave the territory. Hamas said “yes, but,” agreeing to the first terms — the hostage release in return for a prisoner swap — but insisting on more negotiations on the critical next steps. Mr. Trump ignored the “but,” and simply took the partial yes as full agreement. “Trump succeeded in convincing Prime Minister Netanyahu to do what perhaps should have been done right after Israel’s victory over Iran — or even earlier, during the second phase of the January 2025 deal,” Mr. Yadlin wrote on Sunday in The Jerusalem Post. “He grasped what Netanyahu did not: that the war was inflicting immense diplomatic damage and that ‘total victory’ in Gaza was unattainable without killing the hostages, sacrificing soldiers and harming civilians behind whom Hamas hides. He understood the Israeli public mood far better than the government — an overwhelming 80 percent supported bringing the hostages home even at the cost of ending the war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/us/politics/lost-chances-hostage-deal-gaza-israel.html,World,BBC,By David E.

e0f60775e263,A Test Now for Israel: Can It Repair Its Ties to Americans?,"israel gaza war, polls, judaism, benjamin netanyahu, israel, us","The war in Gaza may finally be ending, after two years of bloodshed and destruction. But among the damage that has been done is a series of devastating blows to Israel’s relationship with the citizens of its most important and most stalwart ally, the United States. Israel’s reputation in the United States is in tatters, and not only on college campuses or among progressives. For the first time since it began asking Americans about their sympathies in 1998, a New York Times poll last month found that slightly more voters sided with the Palestinians than with Israelis. American Jews, long Israel’s strongest domestic backers, have turned sharply critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Gaza conflict. A majority believe Israel has committed war crimes as it has killed tens of thousands of civilians and restricted food aid, and four in 10 believe it is guilty of genocide, a new Washington Post survey found — a charge Israel denies. The shift has created new incentives for even moderate Democrats in Congress to get tough on Israel , including by curtailing U.S. military aid. The damage is also increasingly bipartisan. Despite Republican efforts to identify their party with Israel and to tag Democrats as providing aid and comfort to its enemies, younger evangelical Christians are breaking with their parents on the issue, seeing Israel as an oppressor rather than as a victim. And the breakup extends beyond evangelicals. “Everybody under 30 is against Israel,” the conservative commentator Megyn Kelly offhandedly told Tucker Carlson on his podcast last month. The question is whether those younger Americans will be lost to Israel long-term — and what Israel’s advocates will do to try to reverse that. Shibley Telhami, a pollster and scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the University of Maryland, argues that it’s too late. “We now have a paradigmatic Gaza generation like we had a Vietnam generation and a Pearl Harbor generation,” he said. “There’s this growing sense among people that what they’re witnessing is genocide in real time, amplified by new media, which we didn’t have in Vietnam. It’s a new generation where Israel is seen as a villain. And I don’t think that’s likely to go away.” Yossi Klein Halevi, an American-born Israeli writer, said he was struck on a recent campus tour in the United States not so much by the rhetoric of the anti-Zionist activists he met, but by the degree to which they appeared to be influencing their apolitical peers. “They’re absorbing this toxic idea that there’s something basically illegitimate about a Jewish state,” Mr. Halevi said. “That’s my concern: this general perception that Israel has a bad odor attached to it.” Others argue that an end to the fighting, and to the horrific images from Gaza that have flooded social-media feeds for two years, could allow American boosters of Israel to regain their footing. “I do think there would be a bit of a reset in the way Israel is viewed,” said Halie Soifer, chief executive of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. “There is room for a bounce-back,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an American-born Israeli pollster who is a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “People tend to overestimate how bad the damage has been. Just stopping the slaughter will allow some people to go back to their comfort zone of being supportive.” What undergirds that more sanguine view is a belief that the foundation of the U.S.-Israeli relationship remains solid. That is most persuasive when it comes to shared national interests, like the deep, mutually beneficial collaborations between the two countries’ intelligence communities, militaries and technology sectors — collaborations that may be more visible to government officials than to the public at large. “We’re an asset in the great-power competition against China. We’re at the core of American interests in the Middle East,” said Avner Golov, a former official on Israel’s National Security Council who tracks the Israeli-American relationship for MIND Israel, a Tel Aviv think tank. “When my grandfather came here, he only wanted a safe haven for the Jews,” Mr. Golov added. “He never dreamt that Israeli technology would be able to play a significant role in shaping the world order and preserving U.S. superiority over its adversaries.” It is less clear, however, that the two countries, which long shared similar aspirations — to be a promised land for the persecuted, to be a gleaming city on a hill and an example for other nations — can count on those ideals as a basis for continued close ties. Mr. Halevi, a fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, said such aims were now up for debate in both countries, riven as they are by political polarization. On one side, he said, is the liberal Israeli story of the post-Holocaust creation of a Jewish state that “struggled for liberal values under constant pressure.” That story, “which is my story,” Mr. Halevi said, appeals to Democrats. Then there is the Israeli government’s story, of Israel as America’s “bulwark against the Muslim world,” Mr. Halevi said, “which resonates for the American right.” “It’s hard to base a relationship between the two countries on shared values,” he said, “when neither country can agree within itself on its own values.” Elections in Israel in the coming year could change things, experts say — not only if Mr. Netanyahu is voted out, but also if a new government reflects the country’s broad middle ground. Mr. Golov said that the polls portended a rejection of political extremes. He also suggested that Israel’s democracy had much to commend it, even in comparison with America’s at the moment, given the way that popular protests in Israel had pressured Mr. Netanyahu and encouraged Mr. Trump to end the war. “It’s a success story of an Israeli public that on one hand is sending its children to Gaza, and on the other hand is protesting every week,” he said. “And nobody shot anyone,” he noted pointedly. “If these protests will succeed, and I think they will,” Mr. Golov added, “nobody will be able to say that Israeli society lost its liberal nature. I think it regained it.” However difficult it may be to repair the relationship and to win over Americans who have turned against Israel over the war, experts agree that Israel will have little choice but to try, because of the degree to which Mr. Netanyahu has allowed Israel to become isolated internationally. “Israel has no hedging strategy,” said Ted Sasson, a professor at Middlebury College and a fellow at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. “It absolutely needs the U.S. It has nowhere else to turn. It’s firmly committed to that alliance, and it’s going to have to work harder to persuade Congress and a future American president to provide the kind of support that Biden and Trump have provided.” Eventually, an end to the war should mean an end to the worldwide focus on Israel’s conduct of it, said Ted Deutch, president of the American Jewish Committee. He said he eagerly awaited a point at which “the humanitarian situation gets better and the hostages are released, and Arab countries are investing in the future of Gaza.” Then, he said, “the conversation can be about what’s next, about what the region can look like, what Gaza can look like.” “I’m more hopeful today than I have been for hundreds of days,” said William Daroff, chief executive of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, an umbrella lobbying group. Others are less optimistic. Mort Klein, who leads the right-wing Zionist Organization of America, said he feared that the war had poisoned attitudes toward Israel almost irretrievably. “It’s become Jew-hatred,” he said. “I don’t know how that is resolved.” What seems indisputable is that the stakes for Israel, and for its advocates in the United States, are enormously high. Mr. Telhami, the University of Maryland professor, said that Israel’s dependence on U.S. support had become so glaring over the course of the war — in political, military and economic terms — that Israel would be motivated to treat its possible defeat in the court of American public opinion as an “existential threat.” “The game for maintaining the support for Israel is priority No. 1,” he said, adding, “Because the battle in America for Israel is perceived as part of the battle for Israel itself.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/middleeast/israel-us-polls-support.html,World,BBC,By David M.

Mr. Orban’s strength, reinforced by a sprawling propaganda machine geared to the destruction of his opponents, has seen off would-be rivals on both the left and the right in four consecutive elections. Now for the first time, however, he is struggling to land a knockout blow on his enemies. His most potent current rival, Peter Magyar, a former loyalist who heads a surging opposition movement , has in recent months been savaged by media controlled by Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party as an abusive husband, a traitor, a crook and a sex pest. The nonstop vilification — described by Mr. Magyar as a “tsunami of lies” — has been surprising in only one respect: It has not worked. “Until now, these campaigns are not a success. That is clear,” said Agoston Mraz, a Fidesz supporter whose Nezöpont Institute does polling for the government. Most opinion polls , though not Nezöpont’s, give Mr. Magyar’s upstart party, Tisza, a wide lead over Fidesz before a general election in the spring.

a2a9fb25e728,Overnight Violence Between Afghanistan and Pakistan Threatens a Wider Conflict,"international relations, war;armed conflicts, taliban, pakistani taliban, shehbaz sharif, afghanistan, pakistan, internal-open-access-from-nl","Tensions along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan surged on Sunday after a deadly overnight clash between the countries’ militaries, with both sides exchanging heavy fire in one of the sharpest escalations of violence between the neighbors in years. Afghan officials said on Sunday that their security forces had targeted Pakistani military outposts along the border in what they described as “retaliatory operations,” following what Kabul said were Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan last week. At least 23 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 29 others were injured on Saturday, according to Pakistan’s military. The Taliban government said nine Afghan soldiers had died and at least 16 others had been injured. The overnight fighting raised concerns that the violence could spill into a broader conflict between the two countries, whose governments have gradually grown hostile to each other since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan in 2021. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman, told reporters on Sunday that the fighting had stopped at midnight after Qatar and Saudi Arabia urged restraint. He warned Pakistan that any violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty would prompt retaliation. The Afghan attack overnight included heavy fire and raids within Pakistan, the Pakistani military said in a statement on Sunday. It said it responded with heavy artillery, airstrikes and raids within Afghanistan. Both sides also claimed dozens of victims, but none of their claims could be independently verified because access to the border region remains severely restricted. The Afghan offensive was a response to attacks on Wednesday in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and at a market near the border, which the Taliban government blamed on Pakistan. Pakistan said on Friday that it had conducted “a series of retribution operations” against Pakistani militants, but it did not mention Afghanistan directly. Nor did Pakistan claim responsibility for the explosions on Thursday in Kabul and at the border market. Without addressing the specifics of the most recent violence, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan on Sunday praised his country’s armed forces for what he described as a “strong and effective response” to recent Afghan provocations along the border, saying the military had “destroyed several of their border posts, forcing a retreat.” The militaries of both nations have frequently clashed along their shared border, a nearly 1,600-mile-long line that snakes along mountainous areas. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Taliban government of providing a haven to the banned group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the T.T.P. or Pakistani Taliban , whose attacks have killed hundreds of Pakistani security forces in recent years. It has also accused its archnemesis, India, of supporting the T.T.P. The T.T.P. leadership has received financial support from the Afghan government, and its militants have trained freely in Afghanistan, according to Pakistani military officials and independent and United Nations experts. The Taliban in Afghanistan deny backing the Pakistani group. The Afghan and Pakistani governments have tried to mend the relationship in recent years, despite sporadic clashes and ongoing points of diplomatic tension. The countries’ top diplomats met in August with their Chinese counterpart, but Pakistan has not recognized the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate authority. Still, there are close ties between both nations. Pakistan is Afghanistan’s top export partner, and it hosts millions of Afghans who fled insecurity and unemployment over the past decades. Major border crossings between the two countries have been closed since the overnight clashes, according to Pakistani and Afghan officials. In recent months, tens of thousands of Afghans living in Pakistan have crossed back into Afghanistan amid a wave of expulsions ordered by the Pakistani government. The clash on Saturday only lasted for a few hours, possibly because both countries may be wary of escalating tensions further, said Adam Weinstein, a Afghanistan and Pakistan analyst at the Quincy Institute, a research center in Washington. “Pakistan doesn’t yet want to engage in some kind of regime change, but the Taliban know that they would be outgunned by the Pakistanis if they pushed the fighting further,” Mr. Weinstein said. Pakistan can carry out airstrikes across most of Afghanistan, but the Taliban are more limited to cross-border artillery and the potential use of the T.T.P. militants to add pressure inside Pakistan, he added. On Saturday, the T.T.P. claimed responsibility for a series of attacks across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a Pakistani province bordering Afghanistan, that killed several security personnel and civilians, including in a bombing near a police training facility. Residents in border districts on both sides said in telephone interviews that they witnessed intense overnight clashes that raged for several hours. “The fighting went on for hours without pause,” said Shabbir Khan, a resident of Kurram, a Pakistani border district, describing the sound of heavy weapons echoing through the mountains. Aziz Sayar, a resident of the Sawkai district in Afghanistan’s Kunar Province, near the border of Pakistan, said the gunfire began around 9 p.m. and continued for over three hours. “Our children screamed in fear as bullets echoed through the night,” he said.

As the national teams from Norway and Israel prepared to take the field on Saturday night, Norwegian fans raised a Palestinian tricolor flag and a banner that read “Let Children Live.” Moments later, as Israel’s players lined up and their national anthem played, some in the home crowd booed and whistled. The scene and a pregame protest march by about 1,500 people were examples of how the world’s most popular sport has become a venue for demonstrations against Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza. They are likely to persist even after a cease-fire took hold that mediators hoped would lead to the end of the two-year war. Israeli soccer officials expected more protests at the team’s next World Cup qualifier in Udine, in northern Italy, on Tuesday. “It is our reality today,” Israel’s goalkeeper Daniel Peretz said after conceding all the goals in a chastening 5-0 defeat for his team. From a soccer standpoint, the match was high-profile.

93b95d54ab0c,"Israel and Hamas Were Not Ready for a Comprehensive Peace Deal, Mediator Says","international relations, israel gaza war, us foreign policy, peace process, kidnapping and hostages, arms control, prisoner of war, palestinians, hamas, emmanuel macron, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, gaza strip, israel, qatar, paris france","The mediators who helped reach the Gaza cease-fire deal decided to delay talks on more difficult issues, such as Hamas’s arsenal, because the warring parties were not ready for a comprehensive agreement, Qatar’s prime minister said in an interview. The prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, was one of the central mediators in efforts to end the war in Gaza, and the Qataris have maintained close contacts with Hamas’s leadership for years. He spoke to The New York Times soon after Israel and Hamas agreed to halt hostilities in Gaza and exchange all the remaining hostages in the territory for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The deal left some of the thorniest issues in the conflict for a later stage, including the future of Hamas’s weapons and how Gaza would be governed after the end of the war. “If we went for full-package negotiations, we wouldn’t have reached these results,” Sheikh Mohammed said on Friday in Paris. He spoke after a meeting there with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Arab and European foreign ministers about postwar Gaza. Sheikh Mohammed said Hamas had expressed a willingness to talk about a different kind of relationship with Israel. “Hamas are actually open to have a discussion about how they won’t pose a threat for Israel,” the prime minister said. Hamas officials, the Israeli prime minister’s office and the Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hamas has said in the past that it was willing to agree to a long-term truce with Israel. In March, Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas’s chief negotiator, told American officials in Qatar that the group was open to a five- to 10-year truce, in which the group would lay down its weapons. More recently, Hamas has maintained publicly that it is opposed to disarmament. It has suggested convening a Palestinian national dialogue about the future of Gaza, including on the fate of its arms. Hamas has been significantly weakened by the war with Israel, and there are splits within the group on important questions about its future direction. Some leaders and members want Hamas to refuse to give up its weapons, even if that comes at the price of renewed war and the deaths of more Palestinians. Others say the group needs to be more pragmatic on weapons and other matters. By giving up the remaining hostages in Gaza, Hamas traded away significant leverage with Israel with no certainty that it would achieve all its goals in return. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has consistently said Hamas must be disarmed before the Gaza war can permanently end. Hamas has long regarded that demand as tantamount to surrender and views armed struggle as a legitimate form of resistance against Israeli control over Palestinian lands. Mr. Netanyahu vowed this month that Hamas would be disarmed and Gaza would be demilitarized, either through diplomacy or by force. “Either it will be achieved the easy way, or it will be achieved the hard way,” he said. “But it will be achieved.” Some Arab mediators have said they believe that they can persuade Hamas to partially disarm as long as President Trump guarantees Israel will not restart the war. Sheikh Mohammed said one question that needed to be addressed was who Hamas would hand over its weapons to. He said there was a marked difference between Hamas giving its weapons to a Palestinian authority and the group giving them to another entity. It is still not clear when negotiations about the outstanding disputes between Israel and Hamas will begin. President Trump’s road map for ending the war in Gaza calls for the establishment of a temporary international stabilization force. Sheikh Mohammed said the next step should be to talk about the formation of such a force, which he views as connected to Hamas’s disarmament and further withdrawals of Israeli troops from Gaza. As the force takes control, the Israeli military should withdraw based on agreed-upon “standards, milestones and time frames linked to demilitarization,” the U.S. plan says. The stabilization force should also train Palestinian police officers and help secure border zones, according to the plan.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-peace-deal.html,World,BBC,By Adam Rasgon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12israel-hamas-top-tjqp/12israel-hamas-top-tjqp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T16:15:32+00:00,4e051034e544ef89b65bf57847eceff2cb6c35b6
f317785f7103,Bangladesh Detains Army Officers Accused of Crimes Under Previous Regime,"bangladesh, hasina wazed;sheikh hasina, human rights, military, appointments and executive changes, police brutality;police misconduct;police shootings, internal-open-access-from-nl","Bangladesh’s army said it had taken into custody more than a dozen of its officers accused of serious crimes committed under Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year rule ended last year amid widespread protests . The move, announced by the military on Saturday, is a rare instance of large-scale detentions of military officers since Ms. Hasina’s ouster and flight. The detentions came days after the country’s International Crimes Tribunal, an expedited civilian court set up to prosecute major crimes, issued arrest warrants for 32 people, including Ms. Hasina; her military secretary, Maj. Gen. Kabir Ahmed; and current and former security officers. The charges against them include abduction, torture and enforced disappearances, as well as unleashing brutal force against protesters that left more than 1,400 dead. It is the latest of several arrest warrants issued against Ms. Hasina since she was forced out in August 2024, fleeing the country as angry crowds converged on her residence . But she is unlikely to face trial anytime soon. India, where she is now, has not responded to calls for her extradition. Bangladesh, led by the interim leader Muhammad Yunus , has struggled with its transition from authoritarian rule, as divisive political jockeying heats up ahead of elections scheduled for February 2026. Members of Ms. Hasina’s political party have accused the interim government of political score-settling. The tribunal issuing the warrants, which despite its name is a domestic court, also has a troubled past, having been used by Ms. Hasina to target opponents. Maj. Gen. Md Hakimuzzaman, a spokesman for the military, said at a news conference on Saturday that at least 14 serving officers and one who was starting retirement were in army custody as part of the “legal process.” Many of the others named in the arrest warrants have either fled the country or gone into hiding. Those detained are expected to face hearings at the tribunal on Oct. 22, which will determine whether they are freed on bail or face police arrest. Some analysts interpreted the army’s announcement that the officers were in its “custody” as a way of protecting its turf, or of evading the usual process of arrest by the police. Comments by Mohammad Tajul Islam, the special court’s chief, added to the uncertainty about the detentions. He told reporters on Sunday that the legal process requires a person who is arrested to be produced before a court within 24 hours. “Since no one has officially informed us through documentary procedure that the person has been detained, we are not taking into account what has appeared in the media,” he said. General Hakimuzzaman said the officers with arrest warrants were not on army duty at the time of the crimes they were charged with, but had been dispatched to other forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, which served more directly under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. “Despite this fact, they are now in our custody because they are members of the army,” General Hakimuzzaman said. During Ms. Hasina’s increasingly authoritarian rule, the police and military were accused of killing, torturing and disappearing political opponents and other dissenters. The military intelligence, in which General Ahmed served, and many units of police and counterterrorism forces ran detention centers that became known as Aynaghar, or “the House of Mirrors.” There, hundreds of people were shut out of sight in underground military detention centers, often for years on end. Pushed to the edge of insanity and death, some have spoken out since Ms. Hasina’s ouster to tell of the horrors they endured. “Those who committed the crimes must face trial,” Mr. Islam, the chief of the special court, said on Thursday, when the warrants were issued. “They stood against the law, the Constitution and the uniform while holding the position of responsibility and drawing salaries from the taxpayers’ money.” Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/asia/bangladesh-arrests-hasina-crimes.html,World,BBC,By Saif Hasnat,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12int-bangladesh-arrests-01-mgwk/12int-bangladesh-arrests-01-mgwk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T15:38:40+00:00,ea28ab2704382cbe927251c944b2cebe66ed2ba2

Could Mexico’s Cartels Be Next?,"us foreign policy, mexico, drug cartel, military, drug abuse, claudia sheinbaum, donald trump, marco rubio, caribbean, latin america, venezuela, sinaloa cartel","As President Trump has blown up one boat after another off Venezuela’s coast and declared an “ armed conflict ” against drug cartels, a question with stark consequences has arisen much closer to the United States. Could Mexico, where far more drugs are made by some of the world’s most powerful criminal groups, be next? “I would be honored to go in and do it,” Mr. Trump said in May , about using U.S. forces to hunt cartel members. “The cartels are trying to destroy our country. They’re evil.” Yet three senior Mexican officials said in interviews that, although they are watching the U.S. military action with caution, Mexico is not worried — for now. That is because, they said, the cooperation between the countries has become simply too robust and yielded too many results on migration and drugs for them to imagine the Trump administration jeopardizing it by conducting unilateral military strikes. Their assessments were reinforced by two Trump administration officials who emphasized collaboration between the countries. But perhaps more surprisingly, these views were shared by several members of a top cartel who said they were unafraid of American intervention. They were more focused on an ongoing conflict within their ranks, they said. So far, the U.S. government says it has targeted only boats leaving Venezuela, a country ruled by an autocratic government that Washington has long wanted gone. Mexico, the largest U.S. trading partner, presents a far different case. Any U.S. intervention would have major diplomatic, economic and political consequences, given Mexico’s red line over impeding on its sovereignty. The Mexican officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomacy, have top jobs in areas spanning foreign affairs and security. They said that they have gotten little sense from their U.S. counterparts that Mexico is in the cross hairs. Still, that experts are asking the question at all says much about how far the Trump administration has shifted U.S. relations with Latin America. And many American and Mexican political and security analysts cautioned that Mexico was hardly out of the woods, given Mr. Trump’s approach to the cartels as targets of war and the reality that the biggest and most powerful cartels are just south of the border. One of the Mexican officials stressed that while the government did not see unilateral American strikes inside Mexico as an immediate threat, the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean posed a long-term concern. In Washington, American officials have sounded similar notes about prioritizing collaboration. Two Trump administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said that because of the two nations’ increased cooperation, the United States is focused on working with Mexico rather than making unilateral strikes on criminals. The Trump administration believes its threats against Mexico have caused it to step up against cartels, one official said, eliminating the need for U.S. forces to get involved, at least for now. Another official said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Mexico last month reaffirmed the sense that the countries were aligned on security. Mr. Rubio met with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico on Sept. 3, the day after Mr. Trump first announced that U.S. forces had struck a boat in the Caribbean. In comments to reporters, Mr. Rubio had harsh words about smugglers from Venezuela. “We’re not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise ship,” he said. Stopping boats and seizing cargo does not stop smugglers, he added. “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” But on Mexico, he mostly offered praise. “It is the closest security cooperation we have ever had,” he said. After the meeting, the two nations put out a joint statement about security cooperation , noting it was based on “respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,” as well as “mutual trust.” At the top of the Mexican government, Ms. Sheinbaum has repeatedly drawn a line in the sand over U.S. military intervention. “Under no circumstances will the people of Mexico accept interventions that violate our territory,” she said at a rally in Mexico City on Sunday. “Whether by land, water, sea or air.” Strikingly, Ms. Sheinbaum’s firm public stance against U.S. interventions has reassured one of the very criminal networks she and Mr. Trump have vowed to dismantle: the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the world’s most notorious criminal organizations and potentially a larger supplier of drugs than all Venezuelan smugglers combined. In interviews, five cartel operatives dismissed the idea that the U.S. military could strike within Mexico next. Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, they said their more pressing concern was the relentless fighting among rival criminal factions. Most were only vaguely aware of the recent American attacks in the Caribbean. One cartel member, a 39-year-old midlevel operative who oversees security operations in Culiacán, the group’s stronghold, said that he had little fear of U.S. intervention because he believed Ms. Sheinbaum would not allow it. “It will never happen,” he said. “He can’t do that,” he added of Mr. Trump. Even if the United States did strike their smugglers at sea, he said, disruption would be minimal. “We don’t only have maritime routes, we have land and air as well,” he said. “There is always a way.” In addition to fighting each other, Mexico’s criminal groups are also under heightened pressure from the Mexican government. In Ms. Sheinbaum’s first year in office, which ended Sept. 30, Mexican authorities said they arrested nearly 35,000 people for high-impact crimes and destroyed nearly 1,600 drug labs. Under her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, there were an average of 8,900 such arrests annually and 380 destroyed labs, they said. Mexican authorities also say they have seized 3.8 million fentanyl pills, a statistic not tracked consistently under Mr. López Obrador. As a result, the Mexican government said, homicides have dropped by almost a third, to their lowest level in a decade, and fewer drugs are being seized at the border. The Mexican government has also increased efforts on migration, helping to bring illegal border crossings to their lowest level in years. One of the senior Mexican officials said that there is daily cooperation between U.S. and Mexican authorities on cartels, including regular U.S. surveillance flights over Mexican territory. But U.S. authorities do not — and will not — use force in Mexico, in part because the Mexican Constitution bans it, the official said. There is another, nearly $1 trillion reason why many believe the United States will not strike Mexico: The nations are deeply interdependent, with about $950 billion in goods and services flowing between them each year. Disrupting such trade could potentially cause economic devastation in border states of both countries, and drive migrants to seek work inside the United States. At the same time, analysts warned that Mexico may be placing too much faith in diplomacy with a notoriously mercurial U.S. president. “Sheinbaum acts, delivers and gives, but it’s never enough for the U.S.,” said David Mora, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. “The problem is the volatility and unpredictability of the Trump administration.” On the ground, attitudes are more complex. At least three national surveys this year have found that more than 60 percent of Mexicans opposed the idea of the U.S. conducting military operations in Mexico. One poll also showed that 31 percent of Mexicans welcomed the idea. In parts of Sinaloa, where bloodshed has become part of daily life, some conservative and business groups would embrace U.S. strikes, said Adrián López, editor of El Noroeste, the state’s largest newspaper. Businesses there have suffered enormous losses because of the cartel wars, and many Mexicans perceive the United States as more effective in combating organized crime, he said, making “the logic of U.S. intervention is appealing.” “People here say, ‘If that makes the violence stop,’” he said. “‘Where do I sign?’” “But,” he added, “we should be careful what we wish for.” Annie Correal, Miriam Castillo and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.

22d2fbba49ca,Social Media Restrictions and 2-Day Internet Shutdown Rattle Afghanistan,"social media, communications and media blackouts, women and girls, computers and the internet, tech industry, censorship, taliban, afghanistan","Airports and banks were forced to shut down. Government employees idled aimlessly in the corridors of their ministries. Teenage girls, barred from attending school, lost much of their access to the outside world. In shutting down the internet and cellphone services across Afghanistan last month, the Taliban government turned the clock back decades, in a move reminiscent of their first time in power from 1996 to 2001. Connectivity came back after two days, but this week, the Afghan government blocked certain types of content on social media apps like Instagram and Facebook, signaling that it would only tolerate tightly controlled access to the internet. Over the four years since they returned to power, the Taliban have gradually strengthened their grip on Afghan society, at times prohibiting content creators from posting on YouTube in one province, or forbidding television channels from broadcasting images of living beings in another. But the internet blackout and the suspension of cellphone services hit the entire country at the same time last month, leaving many Afghans worried that it could go on indefinitely, or happen again even after service was restored. “We are always at home, so the internet was our only way to tell other people that we are alive,” said Mahsa, 19, who was in the middle of a math lesson with a U.S.-sponsored online education program when the blackout began. (The New York Times agreed to identify her by only her first name because she feared backlash by the government.) Because the Taliban have banned education for girls after sixth grade, online education has been the only avenue for female students like Mahsa to pursue their studies. Afghan officials have not communicated publicly about the shutdown, and spokesmen from multiple government agencies have not responded to requests for comment. But officials outside the country and analysts have said the internet shutdown was the result of an order by Afghanistan’s leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has sought to restrict internet access to prevent “immoral acts.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Evidence Suggests Otherwise.,"arson, nepal, politics, forensic science, civil unrest, nepali congress party, unified communist party of nepal maoist","Many of Nepal’s trappings of state went up in smoke in a single afternoon. On Sept. 9, coordinated arson attacks across the Himalayan nation destroyed hundreds of government buildings, from a storied palace and top courts to grand ministries and humble ward offices. Hundreds of other properties were targeted, too, including businesses and schools connected to the political elite, as well as homes of current and retired politicians. The widespread arson followed the fatal shootings the day before of 19 anti-corruption protesters by security forces in Kathmandu, the capital. The prevailing narrative is that mobs of young protesters sought retribution, setting fires as their outrage over the killings flared. But a New York Times investigation — based on dozens of interviews with witnesses, participants and arson experts; a review of photos and videos from the havoc; and visits by The Times to the wreckage sites — reveals new details that cast doubt on the idea that such a tightly coordinated nationwide campaign of destruction could have been an entirely spontaneous response to the deaths the day before. A few hours after the shootings on Sept. 8, “ready-to-use lists” began surfacing online with the private details of members of society accused of being part of Nepal’s graft and patronage network. The next afternoon, most of these people’s residences began to burn. Nepal’s executive, legislative and judicial branches were also consumed by fire.

Calls to the Beihai police rang unanswered on Sunday. Ms. Jin said her family had not been able to reach her father but that they had heard from other church members, some of whom were released after their initial detentions, that he was being accused of illegal dissemination of religious information.

8a6748c2c07a,Bolivia Pushes to Reclaim the Coca Leaf From the Stigma of Cocaine,"bolivia, coca, regulation and deregulation, indigenous peoples, agriculture, drug abuse, cocaine and crack, evo morales","For decades, coca has been treated as contraband, the raw material for cocaine. The police rip out plants across the Andes, and Washington has poured billions into eradication campaigns. And yet here in Bolivia, where growing, selling and consuming coca is legal, a government communications officer steadied a tripod in the tiny Andean town of San José de Pery one afternoon, filming a farmer as he prepared the soil for coca. “I’m going to explain how to use this tool called a wallhua,” said the farmer, Jaime Mamani, 64, lifting a three-pronged rake. “There — you’ve just planted the seedling.” To many, coca exists solely as the basis of cocaine, a plant harvested, mixed with chemicals, altered in covert labs and trafficked across the globe. But in its natural form it is something else entirely: a mild stimulant chewed, brewed and revered in Andean communities for millennia. In fact, coca is such an integral part of the small, landlocked South American nation of Bolivia that its government is leading a campaign to press the United Nations to remove the leaf from the world’s list of most dangerous drugs. The U.N. classifies coca alongside fentanyl and heroin as “highly addictive and liable to abuse.” The United States has long opposed any changes, warning it would make it easier to expand cocaine production. In Colombia, the world’s largest cocaine producer, Washington has spent billions on eradication and counternarcotics operations — even as output continues rising. The results of a formal U.N. review are expected by March. Removing the coca leaf from the dangerous-drug list would free countries that have signed a U.N. convention on drugs from their requirement to criminalize coca. (Bolivia has been exempted from that rule.) Downgrading coca to a less restrictive category could still open the way for legal trade, scientific research and industrial development. But it is far from certain the United Nations will make any changes at all. Proponents argue that the leaf itself is not inherently harmful, and that equating it with cocaine criminalizes a cornerstone of Andean Indigenous heritage. A draft report by the World Health Organization, the U.N.’s public health agency, concluded that coca had very low potential for dependence and posed no major health risks. Still, some vendors in Bolivia sell coca leaves mixed with stimulants like caffeine called “reloaded coca,” and local journalists have documented potential health risks of these unregistered products. Bolivia’s efforts to change the coca leaf’s legal status may be affected by the runoff presidential election on Oct. 19. That contest is between two conservative candidates, and it is unclear whether either would champion coca as strongly as the leftist governments that have ruled for two decades. Farmers in designated zones cultivate coca in Bolivia to sell in state-run markets. Cocaine is produced in Bolivia, but its output ranks behind Colombia and Peru; much of the country’s coca is grown for traditional, legal use. And coca is everywhere in Bolivia: slipped into tea bags in upscale hotels, sold from street kiosks in flavors like orange and watermelon, chewed by drivers on long hauls, even placed in bowls on government officials’ desks. That ubiquity is relatively recent. The push to rip up crops that had sustained Indigenous communities for centuries as part of the U.S.-led war on drugs bred resentment and political mobilization, helping to propel the rise of Evo Morales, a coca growers’ union leader who in 2006 became Bolivia’s first Indigenous president. Mr. Morales made the plant central to his agenda. Under the banner of “ Coca Yes, Cocaine No, ” his government promoted traditional and modern uses, including coca tea, flour, toothpaste and other products, while still pledging to combat cocaine trafficking. His government enshrined coca as part of the nation’s cultural heritage in the 2009 Constitution, underscoring Indigenous identity and resistance to foreign drug policies. In 2012, Bolivia withdrew from the United Nations’ agreement on drugs, but it rejoined the following year after the U.N. granted an exemption allowing coca use within Bolivia’s borders. Bolivia passed a law in 2017 regulating cultivation, trade and consumption, formalizing a legal domestic market. “When I was a child, it was very frowned upon,” said Omar Pintones, 36, a coordinator for the government agency that oversees the coca industry. “Coca leaf consumption was for lower-class people. So there was often that element of shame.” Today, he added, “many professionals, lawyers, doctors, people at universities, people in all walks of life,” use coca leaves. In San José de Pery, a five-hour drive from the capital of La Paz, residents are proud of their coca work. Farmers rise as early as 3 a.m., tending plants that take three to four months to mature. Harvested leaves are dried, bundled and sold to distributors who supply retailers across Bolivia. The government sets a limit of roughly 54,000 acres nationwide for the legal cultivation of coca to help keep prices high for local farmers. The industry generates direct and indirect employment for tens of thousands of families. Luis Arce, who succeeded Mr. Morales as president in 2020, has taken Bolivia’s case to remove coca from the list of the most perilous drugs to the World Health Organization. An agency spokesman said its assessment would balance “the harms versus potential benefits” of the coca leaf, while also determining how easily it can be turned into cocaine. The Vice Ministry of Coca and Integral Development, a uniquely Bolivian institution, oversees the country’s coca industry. Bolivians in traditional Indigenous clothing routinely fill its hallways to renew their coca licenses. Mr. Pintones, who works for the ministry, said he and many of its employees come from coca-growing families and pushed to legalize coca. “I have eaten, grown, dressed, studied, and supported my family thanks to the coca leaf,” he said. “I consume coca leaves daily here at work and in my daily life. And I have never gone crazy or lost consciousness.” The ministry is collaborating with companies experimenting with new products — coca soda, ice cream, ointments, syrups and soaps — as well as with universities to study the leaf. Studies suggest coca may help increase alertness and lower blood pressure. Research has also pointed to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that could help fight infection. If the United Nations decides to loosen restrictions on the coca leaf, and other nations move to decriminalize, that could open a market for global trade in coca products. “Coca leaves have generated many jobs in Bolivia,” Mateo Mamani, Bolivia’s vice minister of coca, said in an interview, and being able to export the coca leaf would “generate good income for the state.” Researchers in Bolivia are conducting more studies on coca derivatives and their potential health benefits. “That’s what we want the world to understand,” Mr. Mamani said. “Yes it is used for illicit purposes, but if we look at the coca leaf in a positive light, we can get a lot out of it.” In Colombia and Peru, traditional coca use is also constitutionally protected, but it is not as ubiquitous as in Bolivia. Supporters of removing coca leaf from the U.N.’s list say separating traditional use from cocaine trafficking is feasible because tightly regulated legal markets could be closely monitored. U.S. officials argue that even if the leaf itself is relatively harmless, it is still the raw material for cocaine, and recognizing or legalizing coca internationally could weaken efforts to suppress cultivation and make enforcement harder. The Trump administration has cited cocaine trafficking to justify its attacks on boats officials say leave Venezuela bound for the United States. But even if an international coca market were to open, some critics said they worry that the greatest profits would be reaped by large corporations, and the windfall would not trickle down to Indigenous communities. Sdenka Silva, a Bolivian sociologist who has worked with coca farmers, founded the Museum of Coca, a small building nestled among backpacker hostels in central La Paz that educates visitors about the plant’s 8,000-year history among Indigenous communities. When cocaine was legal in many countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, she said, colonial powers like the Dutch cultivated coca in what is now Indonesia at a lower cost than elsewhere, undercutting the industries in Peru and Bolivia. “I’m afraid that something like that will happen with big companies,” she said. But coca’s champions are hopeful. “This should not be political,” Mr. Arce, the outgoing president, who is not seeking re-election, said in an interview. “The coca leaf is not a narcotic.’’",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/americas/bolivia-coca-plant-leaf-cocaine.html,World,BBC,By Genevieve Glatsky and Sara Wayra,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/world/11int-bolivia-coca-promo/11int-bolivia-coca-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T07:00:20+00:00,ec4a0035fafb7cb789443e02e34502007f25be3c

The men died in a “painful traffic accident” in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Qatar’s embassy in Cairo said in a statement early Sunday morning, without specifying when the crash occurred. The three were staff members in the Qatari royal court and died “while performing their work,” the embassy said. It named the men as Saud bin Thamer Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family; Abdullah Ghanem al-Khiyarain; and Hassan Jaber al-Jaber. Two other men were injured, the embassy added. Qatar has been a key mediator in efforts to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, the militant group in Gaza. Last week, negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh led to a breakthrough , with the two sides agreeing to the first phase of Mr. Trump’s peace proposal to end the two-year-old war in Gaza. On Monday, a summit in support of Mr. Trump’s peace proposal is to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh. Mr. Trump and Mr. el-Sisi will preside over the gathering, according to a statement from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other world leaders also are expected to attend, including President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/middleeast/qatar-egypt-crash-sharm-el-sheikh.html,World,BBC,By Vivian Nereim,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12int-qatar-crash-1-tplw/12int-qatar-crash-1-tplw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:10:23+00:00,9c3fd694122248673edd513b745c5fa4f190da02
0c482d499a3b,China’s High Ambitions for Clean Energy,"tibet, energy industry, renewable energy, wind power, solar energy, electric power, israel, kidnapping and hostages","High energy This summer, I got a good look at China’s clean-energy future, more than 3,000 meters above sea level in Tibet. Solar panels stretch to the horizon and cover an area seven times the size of Manhattan. (They soak up sunlight that is much brighter than at sea level because the air is so thin.) Wind turbines dot nearby ridgelines, capturing night breezes. Hydropower dams sit where rivers spill down long chasms at the edges of the plateau. And high-voltage power lines carry this electricity to businesses and homes more than 1,500 kilometers away. The intention is to harness the region’s bright sunshine, cold temperatures and sky-touching altitude to power the plateau and beyond, including data centers used in China’s A.I. development. While China still burns as much coal as the rest of the world combined, last month President Xi Jinping promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and expand renewable energy by sixfold in the coming years. A big part of that effort is in sparsely inhabited Qinghai, a province in western China in a region known among the Tibetans as Amdo. I came as part of a government-organized media tour of clean-energy sites in Qinghai, which usually bars foreign journalists to hide dissent by its large ethnic Tibetan population. (The Times paid for my travel.) Today, I’ll tell you what I saw. China is not the first country to experiment with high-altitude clean energy. But other places — in Switzerland and Chile, for instance — are mountainous and steep. Qinghai, slightly bigger than France, is mostly flat. That’s perfect for solar panels and the roads needed to bring them in. And the cold air improves the panels’ efficiency. The ones in Qinghai could run every household in Chicago. And China is building more, including panels at 5,000 meters. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Qantas said in a statement that cybercriminals stole 5.7 million of its customer records by targeting a call center that used a third-party customer service platform. Qantas said it was one of a number of companies around the world that were targeted in the attack. Qantas did not say how many of the records had been released. It also did not name the third-party platform or say which other companies had been targeted. The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the stolen records were limited to names, email addresses and frequent-flyer details, Qantas said in the statement. A smaller portion covered customers’ business or home addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, genders or meal preferences. Qantas said no further intrusions had occurred and that it was cooperating with Australian security agencies. The company also said it had obtained a court injunction to prevent the stolen data from being “accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published.” Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert in Australia, said that the leak appeared to be the first stemming from the July attack. The authorities investigating that attack have not disclosed which other firms were affected or how extensive the campaign may have been. Mr. Hunt said the court injunction was unlikely to have much impact, noting similar orders that had been issued and ignored in Australia and Britain. He said such orders essentially just ask criminals not to publish stolen data. “It’s completely useless,” Mr. Hunt said in an interview. Cyberattackers have exposed the personal data of millions of Australians by striking companies in telecommunications, health care and aviation. In 2022, the telecommunications company Optus disclosed a breach that compromised information for nearly 9.8 million customers, including names, birth dates, and identification numbers, the company said at the time. At the time, the breach was the largest in Australian history. The same year, Medibank Private reported that hacker s had accessed data from about 9.7 million policyholders, including medical claim details. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has begun civil penalty proceedings against Medibank. In 2024, the federal government announced that MediSecure, a provider of electronic prescription services, had sustained a cyberattack that affected about 13 million people, according to Australia’s Department of Home Affairs. Businesses and government agencies in Australia reported 1,113 data breaches in 2024, the highest since mandatory reporting began in 2018, according to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. That marked an about 25 percent increase from 893 breaches reported the previous year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/australia/australia-qantas-airlines-cyber-attack.html,World,BBC,By Mark Walker,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13xp-Qantas-1-bcqh/13xp-Qantas-1-bcqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T10:30:02+00:00,32b42acb261f412343eaf5a4f9dae46b49de7400
0b68de7d612f,Will the World’s Oldest President Win Another Term?,"paul biya, cameroon, president of the united states, election, voter fraud;electoral fraud, generation z;gen z, internal-open-access-from-nl","Paul Biya, the world’s oldest president, is seeking to extend his 42-year rule of Cameroon. Voters in Cameroon, in Central Africa, will go to the polls on Sunday. Absent from the ballot is Maurice Kamto, Mr. Biya’s main opponent, who was barred from running by the country’s electoral board. Analysts said the vote would be the most consequential in the country’s recent history. Living conditions have plummeted as the prices of fuel and other basic goods have increased. Mr. Biya, 92, promised that if re-elected, he would fix the economy, take on youth unemployment and address poverty. “I will never resign myself to the current situation,” he said at a rally on Tuesday. “Certainly, much has already been done. But I can assure you that the best is still to come.” But his tight grip on power may be waning. An unexpectedly spirited opposition led by former allies and young voters has taken root in recent months, inspired by a wave of Gen Z uprisings in Africa and around the world. What’s the state of the race? Mr. Kamto was barred from the ballot after the electoral commission controversially delayed a parliamentary election until next year. That decision left Mr. Kamto’s party with no seats, making him ineligible to run for president. He tried to run under a different party, but the commission rejected him. Mr. Biya appeared to be on course for another easy victory until Issa Tchiroma Bakary, his former spokesman and minister of employment, resigned from the government in June and began his own campaign. Mr. Bakary comes from the north, a traditional stronghold for Mr. Biya that represents a huge segment of the electorate. Bello Bouba Maigari, who was in charge of tourism until recently, is also running for president. Mr. Biya is still widely seen as the favorite. His supporters say his age is not an issue, though he would be 99 years old by the end of his next seven-year term. Chuo Walters, a lawyer and professor at the University of Bertoua who favors Mr. Biya, said the president “can think a thousand times faster than a 25- or 30-year-old.” Most analysts say elections in Cameroon are rigged in favor of keeping Mr. Biya in power. “The institutions are designed to ensure he wins,” said Hubert Kinkoh, a political and security analyst. Opponents accuse Mr. Biya of using his authority to intimidate the opposition and to control the courts and electoral commission. The youth vote Critics say Mr. Biya’s age and lack of a clear succession plan have created a leadership vacuum, gutted the economy and galvanized young people into political activism. “Young people here see Gen Z revolutions in countries like Kenya,” said Ngala Desmond Ngala, a Cameroonian youth activist. “They’re looking at what’s happening in these countries and looking at theirs and are saying, ‘Why can’t we even lead something like that in Cameroon?’” Last month, the president’s 27-year-old daughter, Brenda Biya, told young people on social media, “Don’t vote for my dad,” accusing him of making “too many people suffer.” She has since walked back her statement and apologized. “The average Cameroonian sits between the ages of around 17 to almost 40,” Mr. Ngala said. “The president has been in power for 40-plus years. So there’s a generational disconnect between the president and the young people.” “You could feel that, for the first time, change of government is possible through the ballots,” Mr. Kinkoh said, “because there is a whole new generation of voters who are more critical and are not swayed by party affiliations.” What’s at stake? Roughly one in every four Cameroonians is at risk of slipping into extreme poverty in the next 15 months, according to the World Bank. In several parts of the country, attacks by separatists and insurgents are frequent. Cameroon has two official languages, French and English, but the English-speaking western regions along the border with Nigeria have been trapped in a decade-old separatist conflict. When Mr. Bakary held a campaign rally in the town of Bamenda in Cameroon’s northwest region, he promised to release separatist fighters if elected. In the far north, where Mr. Biya had his only political rally during the campaign, violence has also ramped up as Boko Haram, a jihadist group with origins in Nigeria, kills and kidnaps civilians. Election details Polls will open at 8 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 12, and close at 6 p.m. It can take up to 15 days to declare a winner.

723aa09b8df6,Fears of a Coup Rise in Madagascar as Army Unit Joins Protesters,"politics, civil unrest, military, coups d'etat, madagascar, andry rajoelina, internal-open-access-from-nl","A unit in the Madagascar military broke from the government on Saturday and joined protesters who have been calling for the president’s resignation, raising fears of a coup attempt on the island nation off the coast of southern Africa. The developments represented a major escalation in tensions after weeks of chaotic, youth-led demonstrations that have threatened President Andry Rajoelina’s grip on power. After rumors spread that Mr. Rajoelina may have left the country, he sought to quell any suggestion that he would be forced from power. Mr. Rajoelina’s whereabouts is not publicly known, but his office released a statement Saturday night saying that he and the prime minister were “fully in control of the nation’s affairs.” In an address, the prime minister, who was appointed less than a week ago, called for calm and dialogue. “It is unthinkable for the armed forces to shoot at each other,” said the prime minister, Gen. Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, after reports that the breakaway army unit had been fired upon by law enforcement. The protests, which began over the government’s failure to provide reliable electricity and water, have exploded into an uprising over broader grievances, including corruption, bad governance and poor quality of life. Local media and videos circulating on social media showed violent clashes between protesters and security forces in the capital, Antananarivo, on Saturday. Security forces have frequently fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators over the past two weeks. Nearly two dozen people have lost their lives, according to the United Nations, a figure that Madagascar’s government disputes. In response to the demonstrations, Mr. Rajoelina fired his prime minister and entire cabinet, saying that he had heard the suffering of his people and that he would build a better government. But that move did little to pacify the demonstrators, who said that the president was the one who needed to go. Mr. Rajoelina has since said that if he is not able to improve his country’s fortunes in a year, he will resign. Saturday’s unrest began after members of an army administrative unit known as CAPSAT posted an address online, in which they called for all security forces to “refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers, our sisters.” They said that the country’s leaders were using them and other police and army members to inflict violence on citizens in order to protect those in power. They called on all security forces to leave their posts and disobey their superiors. “We, as military personnel, are no longer fulfilling our role,” a member of the unit said in the address, surrounded by his comrades. “We have become bootlickers. We have chosen to submit and execute orders, even illegal ones, instead of protecting the population and their property.” Members of the unit rolled into Antananarivo on Saturday to join the protesters at a symbolically significant square in the middle of town. This same unit was instrumental in helping Mr. Rajoelina come to power when he executed a coup in 2009. Even though he first attained power by overthrowing the government, Mr. Rajoelina is now warning against a similar move, saying the country cannot afford to be destabilized. About three-fourths of the Madagascar’s 32 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank . Extreme weather has strained agricultural production, one of the country’s main economic drivers. And there are fears that President Trump’s tariffs could hurt exports of vanilla and other commodities that the island is heavily reliant on.

The paramilitary group, called the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., has for months tightened its siege of El Fasher, a city in the western region of Darfur that has become one of the worst battlegrounds of a two-year civil war between the R.S.F. and Sudan’s military. About 260,000 civilians are trapped in an ever-smaller space within the city, struggling with hunger, disease and mass displacement. In addition to the dozens killed at the shelter, around 43 were wounded, according to Suleman, a senior doctor at the nearby Al Saudi hospital, who asked to be identified by one name to protect his family from reprisals. He visited the site of the attack early on Saturday. Footage from the scene of the shelter, collected by locals and shared by Suleman, showed bloodied bodies, rubble and buildings with caved-in roofs. The shelter, called the Dar al-Arqam displacement center, is on the grounds of a university campus. It was struck as people were asleep in classrooms that had been converted into temporary shelters, while others were in underground bunkers, Suleman said.

Thank you, Trump!” the crowds filling the Tel Aviv plaza known as Hostages Square chanted in English as Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy, spoke from the podium, flanked by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s daughter and son-in-law. Mr. Witkoff spoke emotionally about the families of the hostages, saying their courage had affected him in ways he had never been before. “I dreamed of this night,” he said, alluding to the cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that he and Mr. Kushner helped negotiate , and that provides for the release of the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners by Monday. “I only wish the president was here,” Mr. Witkoff added in his address, which was broadcast live on Israeli television. “He would love this.” Israelis have rallied in the thousands on Saturday nights for most of the past two years, demanding that all the captives still held in Gaza be brought back “Now!” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

4b790e21f4b3,‘Over the Clouds’: Families of Palestinian Prisoners Await Their Release,"amnesties commutations and pardons, israel gaza war, palestinians, prison, terrorism, kidnapping and hostages, peace process, hamas, gaza strip, west bank, israel","Fuad Kamamji described the moment he saw his son’s name on a list of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel as one of “rare happiness.” “We have been accepting God’s fate in the worst conditions,” Mr. Kamamji said. “We were content with all the difficult things that came our way. But now, we are feeling a joy we haven’t known in a long time.” His son, Eham Kamamji, 39, was arrested in 2006 and has been serving a life sentence since his conviction for the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli settler, Eliyahu Asheri. He has been in solitary confinement since 2021, when he was among six Palestinians who temporarily escaped from Israel’s Gilboa Prison in what Israeli officials said was the largest Palestinian jailbreak in more than two decades . On Friday, Israel released a list of prisoners to be freed as part of the cease-fire deal that it reached with Hamas. Under the agreement, the Palestinian militant group will free the remaining 48 hostages it holds, of which Israel believes 20 are still alive. Israel will release about 250 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom are serving life sentences, and 1,700 Gazans who were detained during the war and were not involved in the attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, according to a government resolution released on Friday. Most of those who are serving life sentences did not deny the accusations when they were convicted, and said they were acting as resistance fighters. While Eham Kamamji was on the list of prisoners set to be freed, it indicated that he would be sent into exile, rather than being permitted to return home to Jenin, in the West Bank. Fuad Kamamji said he was holding off from celebrating because his son had been mentioned in prior swap deals that never materialized. “But what I’m feeling now is a strong sense of relief and peace,” he said. “I believe my son will be out, whether among us or in exile. The important thing is that he’ll be free.” Across the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians with imprisoned relatives have been absorbing the news of who would be released, who would be exiled, and who would remain behind bars — namely, prisoners whose release Israel sees as intolerable. One of those Israel has refused to free is Hassan Salama, 54, a senior Hamas figure. He was sentenced to more than 40 life terms in prison for orchestrating suicide bombings in 1996 that killed dozens of Israelis and wounded hundreds, after Israel’s assassination of the militant group’s well-known bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash. Ghufran Zamel, 42, became engaged to Mr. Salama 16 years ago, when he was already behind bars. Last year, she emigrated to Turkey. Ms. Zamel said she feared that Hamas’s release of all the Israeli hostages, ending any leverage it holds, “would mean a death sentence” to any Palestinian prisoner not on Israel’s release list. For many of the families of the Israeli victims of the attacks, however, the news that the perpetrators would be freed stirred complicated emotions. Renana Meir, whose mother, Dafna, was stabbed to death outside her home in the West Bank settlement of Otniel in 2016, wrote in an Israeli newspaper on Friday that the imminent release of her mother’s killer would pose a threat to Israelis everywhere. Still, she believed that her mother would have been in favor of their release in exchange for the return of Israeli hostages. “I know you would have done this without thinking twice, if it were up to you,” she wrote. More than half of the prisoners to be released by Israel are to be sent into exile, according to the list, but it was unclear where they would be sent. That includes Basem Khandaqji, a Palestinian writer who was sentenced to three life terms for his involvement in the Carmel Market suicide bombing in 2004, which killed three Israelis and wounded dozens more. While in prison, Mr. Khandaqji has published poetry collections and several novels, including the acclaimed “ A Mask, the Color of the Sky,” which won the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2024 . His sister, Amani Khandaqji, said she felt “over the clouds” about his possible release. “He could be deported,” she said, “but at least he will be free.” Sara Salem, a resident of Jericho, in the West Bank, was waiting for the release of her husband, Ahmad Kaabnah, a veteran Fatah member, who has been behind bars for 28 of his 54 years, after being convicted of killing two Israeli settlers. She said she had barely slept since the deal was announced. “I couldn’t even open the TV to see if the cease-fire had come into effect or not because it was all eating me up inside,” she said. Ms. Salem was pregnant with their second child when Mr. Kaabnah was arrested. They had a third later through in vitro fertilization, with sperm smuggled out of prison. Today, Mr. Kaabnah has five grandchildren, with a sixth on the way. He has not been allowed to meet with anyone, including his family, since before the war in Gaza, Ms. Salem said. She said she hoped Mr. Kaabnah “would return to us,” but he, too, is slated for exile once he is freed. Still, his potential release has her racked with tension, Ms. Salem said. “We are sitting like on fire,” she said, “and waiting for the news to tell us our Ahmad will be free.” Johnatan Reiss contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/palestinian-prisoners-release-families.html,World,BBC,By Fatima AbdulKarim,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/world/11int-palestinian-prisoners-01-afif/11int-palestinian-prisoners-01-afif-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T12:30:36+00:00,8d53f7d78cf5171550bc72e0fa72884631d1cb1f

There, they found a computer unconnected to a network — and much harder to access by Israeli operations spying on Hamas communications. The computer held an image of a six-page memo, handwritten in Arabic, that the Israeli intelligence community believes was by his brother Yahya Sinwar, who as the powerful leader of Hamas in Gaza helped plot the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Dated Aug. 24, 2022, it appears to be a directive from Mr. Sinwar with instructions for the assault, according to seven Israeli officials. The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, calls for fighters to target soldiers and civilian communities — as well as to broadcast the violent acts so as to evoke fear in Israelis and destabilize the country. Commanders then issued similar instructions on Oct. 7, according to hours of previously unreported communications between commanders and subordinates intercepted by Israel during the assault and shared with The Times. The Israeli officials say the memo shows that Mr. Sinwar wanted his fighters to target civilians from the outset, contradicting what the group’s leadership has publicly claimed. Although the memo does not explicitly mention plans to kidnap or kill civilians, it lays out orders for fighters to enter residential neighborhoods and set them on fire “with gasoline or diesel from a tanker.” “Two or three operations, in which an entire neighborhood, kibbutz, or something similar will be burned, must be prepared,” the memo said. In an echo to the memo, just before 10 a.m. on Oct. 7, a commander from a Gaza City battalion referred to as Abu Muhammed told subordinates: “Start setting homes on fire.” “Burn, burn,” he said, according to the intercepts. “I want the whole kibbutz to be in flames.” “Set fire to anything,” a commander in the northern Gaza city of Jabaliya referred to as Abu al-Abed said around the same time. The memo and the intercepts broaden the understanding of Hamas’s planning and execution of the Oct. 7 attack, much of which is based on other documents and recordings collected by Israel during the war. Israel and Hamas have now agreed to a cease-fire, with the militant group’s future in Gaza uncertain. Sima Ankona, who formerly served as a document examination expert in the Israeli police, said the handwriting in the memo matches other examples from Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024. Ms. Ankona, at the request of The Times, compared the document with samples that Israeli authorities had collected, including those captured by the military in Gaza, a note Mr. Sinwar wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018, and his signature on a statement to the Israeli police in 1989. (He was convicted later that year of killing four Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.) The Times translated the memo. Several words and phrases in it appear in other Hamas documents previously reviewed by The Times. Izzat al-Rishq, the Qatar-based director of Hamas’s media office, did not respond to a list of detailed questions, including whether Hamas’s leadership outside Gaza was aware of the memo and the orders that commanders gave militants on Oct. 7. Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian analyst close to Hamas, cast doubt on the authenticity of the memo, asserting that most of the acts described in the document did not occur in the Oct. 7 assault, such as the burning of entire neighborhoods. (Many homes were set on fire in the course of the attacks.) He added that the memo did not represent the culture of Hamas’s military wing. The intercepts were collected on the day of the attack by 8200, the Israeli military’s signals intelligence unit, according to three Israeli security officials, who shared them with The Times. The Times reviewed and translated hours of the intercepted recordings, which included communications in Arabic among commanders and eight groups of fighters. The memo and the intercepts, said several Israeli officials, have been studied by Israel to deepen their understanding of Hamas’s attack. The Gazit Institute, a think tank affiliated with the Israeli military intelligence directorate, prepared a confidential report on the materials, saying that the “Hamas leadership planned and carried out an attack that featured acts of ‘extraordinary brutality.’” “Its aim was to cause great turmoil in the country and the military,” said the report, which was reviewed by The Times. The security lapses revealed in the Oct. 7 attack, including Israel’s failure to find such documents ahead of time and its disregard of other warnings, have prompted a broad examination by the Israeli intelligence community. The attack, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, shattered Israeli’s sense of security. The Israeli officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. During the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas and its allies killed some 1,200 people and abducted about 250 others to Gaza. Israel, in response, unleashed its full military might in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of its residents, and reduced cities to rubble. Israel has been condemned internationally for its conduct in the war and faced accusations of war crimes from human rights groups. It has been accused by a United Nations commission of committing genocide, which the Israeli government has denied. In May 2024, Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, accused Yahya Sinwar and two other senior Hamas officials of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including “extermination” and “murder.” The crimes were committed as a part of “a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Israel by Hamas and other armed groups,” Mr. Khan said when he announced the charges. Under international law, armies and armed groups must not deliberately target civilians or inflict disproportionate harm on them to achieve military goals. In particular, killing and taking as hostages those who are uninvolved in hostilities are serious violations of the Geneva Conventions. The handwritten memo and intercepts offer a more granular look at the group’s thinking and its actions in real time. The memo outlined a plan for a surprise attack on Israel, calling for bulldozers to make openings in the fence separating Gaza and Israel, and multiple waves of attackers. It expressed hope that the acts would have high shock value. “Stomp on the heads of soldiers,” it said. It listed “opening fire on soldiers at point-blank range, slaughtering some of them with knives, blowing up tanks.” Commanders echoed similar instructions on the day of the attack, according to the intercepts. “Slit their throats,” a commander from a battalion in northern Gaza told his team. “Slit them as you are trained.” Roughly 300 soldiers were killed in the Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli authorities. The intercepts captured Hamas combatants broadly calling for violence and taking captives. When a militant asked if he should confront people on the road, a commander from a Jabaliya battalion referred to as Abu Muath responded in the affirmative: “Kill everyone on the road,” he said. “Kill everyone you encounter.” “Now we are at the beginning of the kibbutz,” said one combatant. “We have wiped out those in it. There are settlers whom we killed.” “Guys, take a lot of hostages,” said the commander, Abu Muath, according to the intercepts. “Take a lot of hostages.” The group’s actions, the memo said, should be broadcast to the Arab world to mobilize people outside Gaza to join the fight. The plan envisioned that Palestinians in the West Bank, Arabs in Israel and “our nation” — either a reference to Arabs or Muslims or both — would “respond positively to calls for them to join the revolution.” “It needs to be affirmed to the unit commanders to undertake these actions intentionally, film them and broadcast images of them as fast as possible,” the memo said. The minutes of Hamas’s secret meetings in the run-up to the Oct. 7 attack also show how Mr. Sinwar was determined to persuade Hamas’s allies, Iran and Hezbollah, to join in the assault, or commit to a broader fight with Israel. In the Oct. 7 intercepts, Hamas commanders can be heard urging combatants to film their actions to likewise encourage others to join the fight. “Document the scenes of horror, now, and broadcast them on TV channels to the whole world,” a commander from Gaza City called Abu al-Baraa told operatives in the area of Kibbutz Sa’ad. “Slaughter them. End the children of Israel.” Abu Muath, the commander, said, “It is essential that you bring the drone in so it films for the entire Islamic world.” Hamas officials also made public statements on the day of the attack, encouraging people outside Gaza to participate in the battle, though they ultimately failed to incite a popular uprising. The Israeli military “won’t be able to attend to confrontations on other fronts,” Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of Hamas’s political office said in a recorded message broadcast on Al Jazeera on Oct 7. “After today, no one can hold back his rifle, bullet, pistol, knife, car, or Molotov cocktail.” Israel assassinated Mr. al-Arouri in January 2024.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-plans.html,World,BBC,By Ronen Bergman and Adam Rasgon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/09int-sinwar-doc-1-phtb/08int-sinwar-doc-1-phtb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T11:27:08+00:00,ce31256284441793ca9c511d2755cbe6c2205044

But it’s the subtext that I’ll focus on today, using a book coming out next week as a springboard. Since moving to Canada last year, I have been captivated by the intense debate about the nation’s identity, and how it is shaped by Canada’s relationship to the United States. I was born and raised in Greece, where identity is heavily defined by reverence for a glorious past. So one of the things that have struck me about Canada’s identity conversation in the era of President Trump’s “51st state” talk is how much it is focused on the future. “Elbows Up! Canadian Voices of Resilience and Resistance” (McClelland & Stewart, out Oct. 14), tackles the newly urgent question, What is Canada? The book also explores how the country can reassert its independence and step out of the leaden shadow of American cultural hegemony. A collection of 30 essays edited by Elamin Abdelmahmoud, an author and critic who hosts the CBC program “Commotion,” the book includes powerful Indigenous and immigrant Canadian voices, Québécois authors, and sports and culture experts.

2187cc310c9f,"Thousands Return to Northern Gaza, Hopeful, but Faced With Devastation","israel gaza war, peace process, palestinians, humanitarian aid, us foreign policy, un, gaza city, gaza strip, israel, hamas, donald trump","Thousands of people traveled by foot toward Gaza City on Saturday as a cease-fire held overnight, but early accounts described devastation across the area. “The scale of destruction is really staggering,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokeswoman for the United Nations’ humanitarian office, who visited the city this week. “We have a lot of people moving north to Gaza City and arriving to find the ruins where their homes used to be, so there is a lot of conflicted emotion.” Mediators hope the cease-fire, which began at noon Friday, will lead to the end of two years of war as the first phase of a 20-point peace plan presented in September by President Trump. A summit in support of the peace proposal will be held on Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, and chaired by Mr. Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, according to a statement from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain will also attend the summit, according to statements from their respective governments. Mr. Trump was also expected to visit Israel’s Parliament in Jerusalem on Monday, according to a spokesman for the chamber. In Gaza, joy at the pause in fighting has been tempered by the scale of destruction that many face as they return to the north. Hundreds of thousands of people fled Gaza City last month as Israel began a ground offensive there. “We’re back in our city, but it doesn’t feel like it,” said Manal Muftah, 33. “We lost everything.” She said she was a baker before the war and hoped to rebuild her business if the cease-fire turned into lasting peace. But the day when things would return to how they were before the conflict “still feels far away,” she said. “Maybe our grandchildren will see Gaza rebuilt,” Ms. Muftah said. “Whoever lives long enough will see it — the Gaza we remember.” Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defense emergency rescue service, said on Saturday that 63 bodies had been recovered in the streets of Gaza City since the cease-fire began. He said he believed dozens more were probably under the rubble. The director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said the health care system would face “severe shortages” and “immense” challenges as people returned to the city. “We’ve finished one war and entered another,” he said. Gaza is in a deep humanitarian crisis, with widespread hunger, vast destruction of property and most of its two million people displaced repeatedly in two years of war. The territory was impoverished before the war, and food supplies and other aid have been sharply curtailed since the conflict began, making circumstances much worse. The agreement reached on Thursday between Israel and Hamas contains stipulations for an increase of aid into the enclave. Israel will allow the United Nations to deliver larger amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza starting on Sunday, according to a senior U.N. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. The United Nations has said about 170,000 metric tons of food, medicine and other supplies are staged and ready to be transported. The truce reached this week describes an exchange of hostages and prisoners, and says Israeli troops would partly withdraw to new deployment lines inside the territory. But it does not address some of the key stipulations in the plan presented by Mr. Trump in September, including whether Hamas will agree to disarm. Mr. Trump nevertheless told reporters on Friday that he believed there was “consensus on most” of the plan and that the hostages would be released on Monday. “They’re getting them now,” he said. “They’re in some pretty rough places. Only a few people know where they are in some cases.” On Saturday, the Israeli military said its chief of staff had taken U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and former adviser on the region, on a field tour of Gaza. For many of those walking the coastal road from southern to northern Gaza, the pause in fighting offered a chance to return home and to learn what remained of their lives there. For some, the experience was sobering. “Today I feel nothing,” said Maisoun Wadi, 36, as she sat on the side of the road among a heap of bags, household items and a scrap of tarp. “Not sadness, not joy — just emptiness.” She was shocked to see how much the city had changed since she and her family fled weeks ago. “It was already destroyed, but what I see now is worse,” she said. “We have no house. I’ll tie this tarp to any standing wall and hang a blanket for a roof.” The most pressing question for her was how to survive. “I don’t care what’s agreed on in Egypt,” she said. “I care about a tent, about water.” Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/return-gaza-city-ceasefire.html,World,BBC,"By Liam Stack, Bilal Shbair and Saher Alghorra",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-gaza-return-promo-ptvh/11int-gaza-return-promo-ptvh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:43:55+00:00,b6f3b60f22d5d71ff606042c3a576d82850e416e
6e08d7a46c2e,"Did LeBron James Write for a Communist Paper? No, but China Said He Did.","international relations, basketball, newspaper, clippers, stephen curry, lebron james, james harden, adam mendelsohn, daryl morey, adam silver, xi jinping, china, macau, nba, houston rockets, golden state warriors, brooklyn nets, us","Last month, People’s Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, published what looked like a rare opinion column by a foreigner, the basketball star LeBron James. In it, he praised basketball as a cultural bridge between countries. The problem: Mr. James never wrote it. Mr. James had been talking to Chinese reporters while on a trip there, and the newspaper turned those comments into an essay with his name on it. Being depicted as the author of a piece in People’s Daily, the voice of the ruling party, is no small matter; it suggested that Mr. James was endorsing Beijing’s message at a time of deep tensions with Washington. For Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., that crossed a line. “Taking words somebody said and then making it seem as a first-person Op-Ed,” Mr. Silver told The New York Times, in his first comments about the incident, “would not be appropriate .” The backlash in America to what people thought was an opinion piece was swift. Conservative commentators said Mr. James was letting Beijing use his fame to whitewash the image of the authoritarian government. One website said the N.B.A. was “groveling to the communists.” The incident was only the latest reminder of the potential political minefield the league faces as it resumes play in China after a six-year absence. The Brooklyn Nets will play the Phoenix Suns in Macau on Sunday night, the second of two preseason games. The games are the result of a yearslong effort by the league — and by Patrick Dumont, a casino mogul turned team owner — to regain its footing in China, a hugely important market. China has its own reasons for welcoming back the N.B.A. The Chinese government has been struggling to breathe life into an economy where people have been holding back on spending. Beijing wants to use sports and international events to “boost overall consumption,” said Crystal Wang, an expert on Chinese sports with the consultancy Deloitte in Shanghai. “That is from the top.” According to state media, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping has a soft spot for basketball, having played pickup games while working as a local official in Hebei Province. Beijing hopes the league can showcase China as open and welcoming. The government has turned to athletes, scholars and influencers to promote “people to people” ties aimed at countering hostility from both sides of the political aisle in the United States. Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, for instance, cited what he described as Mr. James’s Op-Ed for People’s Daily, saying on X : “It’s heartening to see sports are bringing our people closer.” Basketball is wildly popular in China. That is what makes N.B.A. stars so valuable there — but it also forces the players to walk a razor-thin line between sports and politics. It is a line the league has stumbled over before. In 2019, Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests. That and the league’s refusal to punish Mr. Morey shut the N.B.A. out of China for years, costing the league more than $300 million in revenue. But N.B.A. athletes who have traveled to China after the incident have found a lucrative market. The Los Angeles Clippers star James Harden, who has criticized Mr. Morey, praised China and even hinted at moving there, has been rewarded by Chinese fans. In 2023, he sold 10,000 bottles of wine from his personal label on a Chinese livestream in seconds. When Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors toured western China in August, he was greeted by an enormous drone show, sponsored by a local tourism board, that depicted him high-fiving a panda. Players know to steer clear of politics, said Terry Rhoads, a Shanghai-based sports consultant who helped build a market for the N.B.A. in China while working for Nike. “Every single N.B.A. player that comes out to China is being briefed on, ‘Hey, we’re out there to have fun. We’re out there to get the kids loving basketball.’” Mr. Silver said that China put no conditions on speech ahead of the N.B.A. resuming play. But the stakes of offending China are clear. And they cut both ways: Players also face criticism in the United States if they seem too cozy with Beijing — as the LeBron James episode with People’s Daily showed. Adam Mendelsohn, an adviser to Mr. James, sought to downplay that incident, saying that the media had “incorrectly characterized” the piece as an Op-Ed that he had written. But People’s Daily had described the player as the author of the essay, and promoted it on its official social media account with a post titled: “LeBron James Writes in People’s Daily.” Mr. James had also been accused of pandering to China in 2019 when he criticized Mr. Morey over the tweet. “So many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually,” he said at the time. “Yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.” Joy Dong contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/asia/china-nba-lebron.html,World,BBC,By Mara Hvistendahl and Tania Ganguli,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/00int-china-nba-risks-02-kgqj/00int-china-nba-risks-02-kgqj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:01:41+00:00,b8697503b9456d1d223d5d96d060cda36218ed7f
451456983214,How a Las Vegas Casino Mogul Helped Bring N.B.A. Games Back to China,"basketball, gambling, casino, freedom of speech, nba, xi jinping, daryl morey, lebron james, adam silver, las vegas sands","In 2021, the casino mogul Patrick Dumont approached the N.B.A. commissioner with a brazen idea: Bring American professional basketball back to China. The N.B.A.’s relationship with Beijing had been in tatters for two years, after a team executive’s tweet in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The resulting controversy cost the league hundreds of millions of dollars. Partners pulled their sponsorships. China’s state broadcaster CCTV stopped airing games. Western companies that clash so publicly with Beijing rarely get second chances. But Mr. Dumont, an executive with one of the world’s most profitable casino operators, believed that the National Basketball Association could get back into China through Macau, the semiautonomous city where his company ran several highly lucrative casinos. Mr. Dumont and his family had billions at stake. Las Vegas Sands, which is owned by his mother-in-law, Miriam Adelson, and other family members, was selling its Nevada properties to focus on Asia. The Covid-19 pandemic had devastated profits. And Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, was tightening control of Macau and insisting that casinos diversify beyond gambling. That last demand meant that Sands needed to spend big on outside entertainment or risk its license. The league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, was intrigued by a Sands partnership. What followed was years of diplomacy by Sands, whose owner, Ms. Adelson, is among President Trump’s top donors. Sands executives met repeatedly with Chinese and Macau officials and hosted events celebrating “one country two systems,” Beijing’s term for its governance of Hong Kong and Macau. The Adelson family, with Mr. Dumont at the helm, even bought a majority stake in an N.B.A. team, the Dallas Mavericks. (He said that the purchase had no connection to his efforts to bring the N.B.A. to Macau.) All of it culminates in Macau this weekend in two preseason games between the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns at the Venetian Arena , a Sands property. The games are part of a five-year agreement for the N.B.A. to return to China. “It’s certainly a belief of ours that the two world’s largest economies should have continued dialogue,” said Ron Reese, a Sands spokesman. “It’s in everybody’s best interest.” The story of how the deal came together is an example of how casino profits, connections and quiet diplomacy healed a political wound. It is a win for the N.B.A., which lost more than $300 million in its rift with Beijing. It is also a win for Chinese leaders, who have sought to burnish China’s global image through influencers, sports figures and other celebrities. “Sports exchanges between China and the United States reflect public sentiment and serve both sides’ interests,” the Chinese Embassy in Washington said. The N.B.A. never abandoned its Chinese ambitions. It kept its China offices open. Teams hired experts to put content on Chinese social media. Executives from the Brooklyn Nets, which is owned by Joe Tsai, the chairman of the Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group, met with Chinese officials and diplomats. The league donated to China during the pandemic and installed the son of a former CCTV executive at the helm of N.B.A. China. Mr. Silver said that the league made no promises to China to curtail speech, and that the N.B.A. would defend the rights of players and team officials to speak freely. But league and team officials said they were keenly aware of the consequences of another controversy. “In our job, we have to talk about what’s the most important thing, which is to speak through the game,” Jordi Fernández, the Nets coach, said in Macau this past week. Things have changed since the 2019 controversy. Many players are muting or eliminating their activism, and the N.B.A., like other leagues, now mostly avoids taking political positions. And while human rights groups and politicians criticized the N.B.A. for not taking a tougher stance against Beijing back then, the return to China has sparked little uproar. “We’re not looking to go over and poke anyone in the eye,” Mr. Silver said. “We’re not setting out to create a diplomatic incident.” Chaos in a Crucial Market The October 2019 preseason trip to Shanghai and Shenzhen should have been an easy moneymaker. The N.B.A. sent its marquee franchise, the Los Angeles Lakers, to play the Brooklyn Nets. Two of the stars, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, were to face off in a country that loved American basketball. At peak viewership, more people watched the N.B.A. finals in China than in the United States, according to estimates in the Chinese news media. The trip came amid pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Millions of people were taking to the streets, some of them clashing with the police, in a high-profile challenge to Mr. Xi’s power over the city. Days before the games, Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted an image on Twitter that said, “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” Derek Chang, then the chief executive of N.B.A. China, recalled what happened next: “Everything started to explode.” With Chinese officials irate, the N.B.A. released two statements — the Chinese version much more contrite than the English. That angered just about everyone. Mr. Silver gave interviews defending Mr. Morey’s right to free speech. The broadcaster CCTV announced it would cease airing N.B.A. games. The Lakers and Nets watched from their Shanghai hotel as workers removed ads for the game, peeling their faces off the building across the street. Mr. James, in an interview with The New York Times last year, remembered wondering, “How fast can we get out of here?” Mr. Chang said he spent the next few months “trying to look for the avenue back” to China. He did not see one. A Big Bet on Basketball Macau is the world’s casino capital, with gambling returns dwarfing those of Las Vegas. In 2021, when Mr. Dumont broached the idea of N.B.A. games, Macau accounted for nearly 70 percent of his company’s revenue. A former Portuguese colony, Macau was reclaimed by China a quarter-century ago and declared a special administrative zone. Like Hong Kong, it faces increasing pressure from Beijing as Mr. Xi strips away some of its independence. One pressure point was gambling. Foreign casinos need licenses, called concessions, to operate. And as it negotiated the 2022 renewals, the Macau government was demanding: higher taxes, the right to cancel concessions in the name of national security and, crucially, more spending on events unrelated to gambling. Like sports. High rollers had long used casino junkets to evade China’s restrictions on moving cash internationally. The city had a reputation as a haven for bribery. Las Vegas Sands even paid an S.E.C. fine in 2016 to settle accusations of foreign corruption (the company admitted no wrongdoing). Mr. Xi was cracking down on junkets and corruption. Leaders wanted to rebrand Macau as family friendly — with casinos footing the bill. “It’s like the government of France going to every restaurant in France and saying, ‘We want to be less reliant on the cuisine industry,’” said Andrew W. Scott, the chief executive of Inside Asian Gaming, an industry publication based in Macau. For Sands and the other foreign casino operators, remaining in Macau was essential. “They didn’t have a lot of leverage,” Mr. Scott said. “You never resist the government.” Sands suddenly needed to spend billions on outside entertainment to guarantee its license. The arena at the Venetian had hosted mostly concerts and would need to be modernized. But a big-ticket event like the N.B.A. could help publicize the Venetian on the mainland, where casinos are banned from advertising. “We started thinking about our next phase of investment, which is part of our concession renewal. How can we invest more and innovate in both tourism and hospitality?” Mr. Dumont said. “We felt like the N.B.A. would be a good way to do that. We had the arena. We had the obviously very strong fan base in China.” When other sports leagues have repaired rifts with China, they have done so on Beijing’s terms. The English Premier League team Arsenal distanced itself from one of its players in 2020 after he criticized China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, who have faced human rights abuses . And the Women’s Tennis Association suspended play in China in 2021 and demanded an investigation into a Chinese player’s accusations of sexual assault by a government official. Two years later , the association returned to China, acknowledging it did not expect its demands to be met. Mr. Silver is adamant that the N.B.A. made no concessions. Tiptoeing Toward Reconciliation There were signs that Beijing was open to reconciliation. In February 2020, the N.B.A. sent $2.65 million in medical supplies to Hubei Province, the center of the Covid-19 outbreak, earning it accolades in the Chinese state press. That year, the league named Michael Ma, the son of a well-regarded former CCTV executive, as the new head of its China operations. The network aired two N.B.A. finals games that year and resumed broadcasting a regular slate of N.B.A. games in 2022. That “sent a signal to the rest of the community, other current business partners or potential business partners, that we were no longer being punished,” Mr. Silver said. The following year, Mr. Dumont and his family bought the Mavericks. The N.B.A. had no qualms about being in business with a casino operator. The league hosts a tournament each summer in Las Vegas, where Tilman Fertitta, the Rockets owner, owns the Golden Nugget. Mr. Silver has long supported legalized sports betting. The China deal was not a factor in the N.B.A. approving the Mavericks sale, Mr. Silver said. But it had advantages. As an owner, Mr. Dumont would have a stake in the league’s success in China. Additionally, the Venetian Arena was controlled by a private company, rather than the state. “It reduces the number of variables that could go wrong,” Mr. Silver said. Sands, like other casino companies in Macau, has hosted events in recent years celebrating China’s rubber-stamp legislature and its policy on Macau and Hong Kong. Sands executives also marked Beijing’s National Security Education Day, an annual day of activities to inculcate people with a duty to the state and an awareness of foreign spies. And Sands executives cultivated relationships with officials, a review of Chinese government meetings shows. The Adelson family has long played informal diplomatic roles. In the 2024 election, Ms. Adelson was the third-largest donor to Mr. Trump. She and her husband, Sheldon Adelson , repeatedly spoke with Mr. Trump about foreign policy, including, in Mr. Adelson’s case, trade policy toward China . Just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration this year, Sands’s chief executive met with a Chinese vice minister to discuss trade and “the company’s growth in China,” according to Xinhua, China’s state news agency. Mr. Dumont did not say when the N.B.A. came up in discussions. But he said his pitch to the government focused on making Macau a broader tourism destination, just as Mr. Xi wants. “When we explain the context about using the N.B.A. to come to Macau and have it be a very prominent feature of tourism for the city, everyone was really excited,” he said. Mr. Dumont said that Mr. Tsai, the Nets owner and Alibaba chairman, was “very supportive, and he’s been super helpful.” Nets executives also met with Chinese officials in recent years. The Nets declined to comment, but Sunshine Rogers, the Nets’ vice president of global partnerships, told a Chinese news outlet in May that it was the N.B.A. team that “prioritizes the Chinese market the most.” In December, three years after Mr. Dumont raised the idea, the league announced a deal to play preseason games in Macau. Mr. Silver returned to China in March for the first time since 2019. He said the N.B.A. and the Chinese government would need to be flexible in their renewed relationship. “If this is about ideological purity on either side,” he said in an interview, “it will never be achieved.” Joy Dong contributed reporting from Hong Kong and Macau, Kevin Draper from Lawrence, Kan., and Tariq Panja from London.

The facial gymnastics — known as “gurning” — are the focus of the World Gurning Championships, a reverse beauty pageant of sorts and an ancient tradition in the town of Egremont, in northern England’s Lake District. The rules are simple, if odd. Competitors must make their face through a horse collar, known locally as a “baffin.” They are not allowed to use their hands, artificial aids or excessive makeup. They may, however, heighten the dramatic effect of their gurning “by thrashing around onstage and making wild, animal-like noises,” according to the official rules. Here’s what it looks like: Contestants are judged on “the grotesqueness of the grimace and on the extent to which their facial features change,” according to the rules. The best gurners, competitor say, are creative people, with flexible face muscles and a lack of self-consciousness. The championships, which were held on Sept. 20 this year, take place every fall at the Egremont Crab Fair, which was established in 1267 by King Henry III. According to local lore, gurning dates to the Middle Ages, rooted in the faces people make as they bite into the sour crab apples for which the festival is named. Here are some of the competition’s best gurns, and the stories behind them. The Defending Champion Claire Lister, who works in waste operations at a nuclear site, has been competing since she was a child. But like many local competitors, she took a break during her teen years to avoid looking uncool. “Being a female, it gets to a point where — it’s not quite embarrassing — but as you grow older you don’t want to start competing in a sport like that,” she said. Ms. Lister, now 38, returned to the competition in 2013 after her sister entered her as a joke. She won the women’s event, and has placed first nine times since then, including last year. “I never, ever prepare,” she said. “We have fun, and that’s what we say it’s all about.” The Veteran Mr. Zivelonghi, from Coventry, England, got into gurning more than 20 years ago in an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records. It wasn’t his first choice for a world title; he initially wanted to compete for the world’s longest ear hair . “But when you look at the man who has got the longest ear hair, it’s like, ‘Forget it, I’m not going to walk around like that,’” he said. “So yeah, I went to gurning instead.” Having some teeth missing, as Mr. Zivelonghi does, can be a bonus, he said, by enabling more extreme gurns. Stephanie Nguedia moved to the Lake District two years ago from France and was dragged to this year’s competition by her husband, Barry Morgan. At first, she had no idea what was going on. “I didn’t understand, it was ridiculous for me,” she said. But the 36-year-old health care worker was soon drawn in by the welcoming atmosphere. “The whole thing was fantastic,” she said, breathless and smiling after getting offstage. “I love it. I’m happy.” The Wunderkind Kendall Lister, 11, Ms. Lister’s daughter, is a champion in her own right. She took the top spot in this year’s junior event, adding to several past prizes. The worst part? “It can be scary,” she said. “What if I mess up?” And the best? “Winning,” she said. The Last-Minute Entrant As with many competitors, Robbie Carr’s participation began with a few drinks. “It was quite a spontaneous thing really,” he said. Before getting onstage, the 30-year-old electrical worker from Egremont jokingly asked his wife, “If I get in the top three, is that an ‘ick’?’” Her response? “Just you entering is an ‘ick.’” He said his gurn was inspired by his little sister, who used to make a face when teasing him. Ryan Barton, a junior champion in the late 1990s, got his uncle into gurning. “One night when he was drunk, I said, ‘Go on, do it,’” Mr. Barton said. “And he’d done it, and he won it, and he loved it.” His uncle, Peter Jackman, would become a gurning legend, winning the championship multiple times. Mr. Barton, 42, gave up gurning after he went into the British Army and his uncle died. But he brought his two daughters — Sadie, 7, and Aimee, 9, — to the competition this year. They pushed him to compete, just as he had with his uncle. Mr. Barton took first place among the men, and brought his daughters up onstage with him to pose for photos. “Two happy girls, that’s what it’s about,” he said after winning. “My uncle would love listening to that.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/in-this-pageant-the-ugliest-face-wins.html,World,BBC,By Jonathan Wolfe and Tom Jamieson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/00xp-gurning-promo-wflj/00xp-gurning-promo-wflj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:58+00:00,2bb85fe284afd80e8f6d54be7e637ddcb4ff2704
5a29f1a190c1,She Studies the Russian ‘Red Man’ Whose Bloody War Evokes Soviet Tyranny,"svetlana alexievich, russian invasion of ukraine (2022), books, writer, swedish academy, belarus, soviet union, berlin","While writing the book that helped propel her to the Nobel Prize in Literature, the writer Svetlana Alexievich was certain she was chronicling the swan song of the violent, authoritarian ideologues at the heart of the Soviet system. Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, only two years after her native Belarus, still a Kremlin satellite, brutally crushed its democracy movement. The mind-set she believed was headed toward extinction had been revived, she said in a recent interview in her apartment in Berlin, where she has lived in exile since 2020. “I want to understand how that happened.” Her last book before the Nobel, “Secondhand Time,” was her fifth work about the unraveling of the utopian Communist experiment. Told in the voices of ordinary men and women narrating their experiences, the books address landmark events including the invasion of Afghanistan and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster . Ms. Alexievich used an intensive interviewing technique to write each one and, after “Secondhand Time,” intended to turn to other topics, like love and aging. But after the protests in Belarus and the Ukraine invasion, she shelved those plans. She is now writing a sixth book on the enduring existence of what she calls the “Red man,” who, she said, is stoking a bloody war in the heart of Europe. Examining his motivations, she said, is one way to try to douse the flames. “I don’t know where to find the right words to describe these things, yet we have to find the right words,” she told a news conference in late September at the United Nations in Geneva focused on growing repression in Russia. The global drift toward right-wing populism must also be confronted, she said, otherwise “the world itself and people will become even more terrifying, even more monstrous.” “The people who hold power today are trying to shut us up,” she added. In awarding Ms. Alexievich the literature prize in 2015, the Nobel Committee took the rare step of honoring an author of nonfiction, citing “her polyphonic work — a monument to suffering and courage in our time.” Sara Danius, the Swedish Academy permanent secretary at the time, described her books as “a history of emotions — a history of the soul, if you wish.” Ms. Alexievich, 77, grew up in the Soviet Union, born in western Ukraine but raised in a village in Belarus. Both of her parents were schoolteachers. As a child, she said, she listened spellbound to stories traded among the village women, often widows, about World War II and Stalin’s concentration camps. The overall Soviet death toll from the war and later is estimated at 27 million people. “They spoke about harsh things, very scary things, which of course were never written about in books,” Ms. Alexievich said. She studied journalism at Minsk University, eventually becoming a cultural correspondent for a Belarus newspaper. But the voices of those women never left her. She completed her first book, “The Unwomanly Face of War,” in 1983, after interviewing hundreds of female World War II veterans — pilots and snipers and cooks. The book languished for several years because the government censor said anyone who read it would never volunteer to fight. An unexpurgated English translation emerged in 2017. The author said that when she was first introduced to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, by then the former leader of the Soviet Union, he exclaimed, “You are so small and yet you wrote such a big book!” Ms. Alexievich said she responded, “Well, you are no giant yourself, but you toppled an empire.” The quest for empire feeds the desire of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to seize Ukraine, she said in the interview. He has promulgated a mythic Russian Empire that never really existed, the writer said, but that mythology resonates in Russia, especially outside Moscow and St. Petersburg. Ideology alone is not fueling the war, she said. She described the experience of a journalist friend who was interviewing a woman about her dead son. The woman suddenly clammed up, fearing being denied the death benefits she needed to buy her daughter an apartment. “Putin bought Russia,” Ms. Alexievich said, and has committed a “moral crime” by trying to depict the invasion as a continuation of the fight against Nazi Germany. Ms. Alexievich’s books take up to five years to write. She interviews her subjects repeatedly, using fragments of conversations like a jigsaw puzzle to construct a portrait of events. The repetition from one witness to the next forms a dense, compelling narrative. She lives for the revealing, human detail, she said. She elaborated on her technique in her Nobel lecture , saying that listening to people talk is her greatest passion. “I would say that I am a human ear,” she said. “When I walk down the street and catch words, phrases and exclamations, I always think — how many novels disappear without a trace!” “Voices From Chernobyl,” which recounted the harrowing experiences of those caught up in the nuclear meltdown in 1986, provided the basis for a haunting HBO series . In examining extreme human behavior, Ms. Alexievich said, she has long turned to Dostoyevsky for inspiration about its inexplicable nature. She rarely inserts herself in her books, and offers little information about her subjects beyond what they say. Some critics find the lack of background material disorienting. Her writing also provokes debate about whether it is literature, although she rejects calling it journalism. Given her emphasis on the violence thrumming through Russian society, her books are considered highly relevant amid the current war. “The Soviet soldier is the cheapest soldier there is,” said a prescient combat medic in “Boys in Zinc,” her Afghan war book . “Unequipped and unprotected. Expendable. The same way it was in 1941.” He added, “It’ll still be the same in 50 years.” After the publication of that book, Ms. Alexievich was accused in court of defaming the Soviet Army. She was acquitted, but in 2000, she moved to Europe and lived there for over a decade. In 2020, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the autocrat who has run Belarus since 1994, won another term in an election widely considered fraudulent. Scores of protesters were tortured, and hundreds of opposition activists given lengthy prison terms. Ms. Alexievich was the only member of the Coordination Council, a group created to unite the actions of the opposition, not to be arrested. She was interrogated, though, and after that, European diplomats and human rights activists camped in her apartment to safeguard her. But she decided to leave the country. Her home in a pre-World War II building on a leafy Berlin side street has a bohemian, somewhat temporary air. Nothing hangs on the pale yellow living room walls, the flowery ceiling molding overhead providing the only décor. A companion served Turkish coffee from a long-handled pot. Ms. Alexievich has one adult daughter, adopted from her late sister, and a granddaughter. She sometimes feels guilty that she joined the millions who have left Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Still, a striking number of prominent Russian cultural figures now inhabit Berlin, she noted, much like the intelligentsia who decamped after the 1917 revolution. They can help to preserve Russian culture, she said. During the September news conference in Geneva, she quoted the late, Soviet-born artist Ilya Kabakov: “When communism existed as an ideology, as a country, we knew what to do, we liked ourselves, we looked great in that struggle, and then we won. At the cost of huge losses, we defeated this monster and when we looked back, several years on, we found ourselves living among rats. How do you fight rats?” That is the essence of the current struggle, Ms. Alexievich said. Democracy is in retreat partly because individuals have convinced themselves that they are too small to effect change, to confront evil. “I think that we have to convince ourselves of the contrary,” she said. “Each of us has to find this strength, this ability to resist. ”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/russia-svetlana-alexievich.html,World,BBC,By Neil MacFarquhar and Milana Mazaeva,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09russia-profile-alexievich-01-gklt/09russia-profile-alexievich-01-gklt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:55+00:00,a1701550cb6e2cd65487ce4335aceb427e4b74cd
1d25d54c51dc,"What Things Left Behind Say About a Home’s Past, and the Times We Live In","pennsylvania, archaeology;anthropology, buildings, waste management, ceramics and pottery, plastic","We live in an old log house with big square beams, twisted staircases and a double stone fireplace. The floor boards creak, dust falls through the ceilings and the house is drafty, despite having been built at the bottom of three hills out of the wind. It sits on a county road, now abandoned, and, since 1941, has been occupied by only two families. It is a type of house few live in anymore, built by hardworking women and men who came to this western Pennsylvania outpost in much harder times, many years before we arrived here in 1988. I am grateful they did. But who built this house, and when? We’ve assumed it’s from roughly 1860. But we’ve never been sure, and finding out has not been easy. Our county recorder of deeds got me as far back as 1913. A 1964 tax assessment read, “old, remodeled house.” I’ve spoken to a log house expert, a local historian, and dated our apple trees to the mid-19th century, but still I’ve come up short. Then I found my answer by means I didn’t expect. I invited two archaeologists, Tom and Pat Baker, a husband and wife team, to the barn one night to help me identify the random objects I’ve found scattered across the fields and forests over 37 years: pottery shards, bits of glass, iron tools, farm equipment, shotgun shells, oyster shells, animal bones. And, of course, plastic. I gathered up these artifacts to clean up the land, but also to give me clues about those who came before us: how they lived and farmed, what they ate and drank, the utensils they used, the area’s industrial past. Mine is a commonplace collection; despite living in a town on the Pennsylvania frontier where the French and Indian War was fought, I’ve never found a musket ball or an arrowhead. And while I may use a fancy word and call these items artifacts, the truth is, much of what I have found was probably trash. Settlers in rural America had no garbage collection, so they threw rubbish into pits outside summer kitchens. Or into privies or bottle dumps. They burned trash or tossed it into a pigsty. “People put waste products into a manure spreader and spread it over the fields,” Tom said. Out in the field, I’ve picked up a ceramic smoking pipe, quite likely from 1895, the mangled wood and metal heel of a shoe, and, turning the compost pile, I found a white, opaque piece of milk glass. “I rarely see that,” Pat said. It turned out that a couple of towns over, a manufacturer of milk glass, the Westmoreland Glass Company, was founded in 1889. Last year on a hike, I found a pitted, brown rock in the middle of a path. I thought it might be a meteorite. It turned out to be a piece of slag. Had an iron furnace been on the property, Tom asked? Iron furnaces are abundant in this valley, but not here, at least to my knowledge. I know from an 1876 map that a tannery and a blacksmith shop were close by, but the slag, according to Pat, wouldn’t have originated in either of those places. “That piece of slag is indicative of iron smelting and would have come from nearby coke ovens or an iron furnace,” she said. Nondescript pieces of glass suddenly come alive when archaeologists look at them. A clear shard with raised numbers and letters turned out to be a bottle embossed with a drugstore’s name and address. A seam running along the neck of a pale blue bottle indicated it was handblown into a mold in the mid-to-late 1800s. A piece of brown glass was part of an old Clorox bottle from the 1930s. Brown glass, I learned, kept light from altering the chemicals and indicated that the contents were poisonous. I found an abundance of redware and stoneware, the everyday pottery used in this old house. Most of the stoneware was glazed brown and white, but one piece had a blue sponge pattern, probably from the early 1900s. A fragment of flow-blue refined earthenware, from about 1840 to 1900, had split into three from being burned. Pat put the plate back together like a puzzle. And then came the revelation: Pat was able to date this property according to the pottery we didn’t have. “Your collection is completely missing delftware, creamware and pearlware,” she said, listing pottery types that were common in North America from colonial times until the middle of the 1800s. “This tells me that your property was not occupied until the mid-1850s.” I still don’t know who built the house, but that is the closest I’ve come to accurately dating the place. Wire nails backed up her assertion. I’ve found a lot of metal: half a set of tongs for grabbing hay bales or ice, a double bit ax, what might be an ox shoe, a vise and assorted hooks, screws, nuts, bolts and wire nails. Wire nails were not manufactured until 1857, so that also suggested the house had not been lived in until then. Not all the items I collected were trash, however. Some were lost, misplaced or dropped. “They didn’t see it fall off a saddle if they were on horseback,” Tom said. We, too, are guilty of inadvertently leaving items out in the environment. I’ve dropped plant tags, terra cotta shards and rubber bands. Tools fall off our ATV or out of our pockets. Machinery breaks in the field. I’ve come home from hikes with electric fence insulators, lawn mower wheels, chain from a manure spreader and bungee cords. Sometimes, I get lucky and it’s exactly the piece we were looking for and machinery can be fixed or a horseshoe put back on. But we don’t purposely toss trash into the woods. “Today, people find a ravine and dump it,” Tom said, which is exactly what someone is doing at a deserted corner of the farm. They’re throwing garbage from their car over a guardrail into a ravine. Not only common household trash, but hundreds of beer cans stuffed into red, plastic bags. One now hangs from a maple sapling like a giant red Christmas ornament. Our county has no plastic bag ban and convenience stores, gas stations and grocery stores hand them out for free. I seldom drive that road, but noticed the garbage when biking there, seven miles up steep hills with hairpin turns in the Allegheny Mountains, then down onto the flat by fields of cut hay and a sheep farm, where I often see a leucistic hawk. My ride borders woods where I pick morels and black raspberries and an enormous snapping turtle suns itself by a pond. One day, I collected about a hundred items of trash, including soda, water and liquor bottles, French fry boxes, supersize cups, lottery tickets, straws, plastic tubs, power drink cans and two containers of hypodermic needles. I saw a diaper down a different ravine, but couldn’t reach it. I try to be understanding because this small township still has no municipal trash collection. It costs money to collect garbage. But I feel less kindly toward the appearance of the synthetic innards of an entire couch, packaging from morning-after pills, and, halfway down the ravine, an air purifier. All this, despite dumping being illegal, with hefty fines and possible community service. But why pay someone to haul it away if there are no consequences. I shudder to think of black bears, opossums, raccoons and coyotes drinking from a stream riddled with broken glass and walking steep hillsides covered in rusty, jagged metal. Of birds picking through fast food wrappers and chipmunks nibbling on plastic containers. How the trash contaminates the air, water and soil, and affects the growth of native plants. And all the plastic running downstream. And I can’t help but wonder: Is this the archaeology of the future, the things we are leaving the next generation to study? What will those artifacts tell them about us? About us all?

965f33312862,Wave of Criticism Greets Macron’s Repeat Pick for Prime Minister: ‘Bad Joke’,"sébastien lecornu, emmanuel macron, france, politics, jordan bardella, marine le pen, budget, legislature, national rally;national front, internal-open-access-from-nl","Having led a government that lasted 836 minutes, Sébastien Lecornu has now become prime minister of France for the second time in a week, without it being clear why his chances of success might be greater this time. After delaying the appointment until deep into the evening on Friday, President Emmanuel Macron again asked Mr. Lecornu, a close centrist ally, to form a government, in what appeared to be an admission that he had run out of options. “One has the impression that the more he is alone, the more rigid he grows in his initial position,” Marine Tondelier, the leader of the Green Party, said after she attended a meeting on Friday between Mr. Macron and the leaders of several parties. France, a nuclear power and one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, has a certain idea of itself. It is not that of a country whose last government survived for less than a day. The descent of the nation into tragicomic turmoil has caused widespread alarm and allowed Mr. Macron’s chief rival, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, to deplore a “desperate, pathetic spectacle.” She wasn’t alone in her censure, as a torrent of criticism met Mr. Macron’s choice. Mr. Lecornu will restart his efforts to form a government in a country in a state of severe institutional crisis, tethered to a president who after more than eight years in power has never been so isolated or scorned. “Lecornu II is a bad joke, a democratic ignominy and a humiliation for the French people,” said Jordan Bardella, the popular president of Ms. Le Pen’s anti-immigrant National Rally party. She wants Mr. Macron to dissolve a deadlocked Parliament and call legislative elections in which her party could well gain enough seats to form a government. Mr. Macron’s conduct this year in selecting, from a weak position, three prime ministers from his own centrist or center-right camp — the third of them for a second time on Friday — has appeared increasingly incomprehensible, culminating in calls from exasperated former allies for him to explain his stubbornness or resign. Worried that his economic reforms, including raising the retirement age or cutting the corporate tax rate, might be reversed, Mr. Macron has refused to reach out to the center left, despite the fact that a now frayed alliance of left and far-left parties won more seats than any other group in the 2024 legislative elections. Rather, with fewer votes he has attempted to exercise more power. This stance has been widely viewed as showing contempt for the people’s will, never a comfortable position in France. When Gabriel Attal, once Mr. Macron’s protégé and his choice for prime minister in early 2024 , declared this week, “I no longer understand the decisions of the president,” and said that these choices betrayed a “kind of furious pursuit of the maintenance of his power,” he expressed the dismay of many French people. “We are clinging on perilously between a political crisis and a crisis of the regime, where either we have a government so fragile it could fall any day, or parliamentary elections that will certainly hand victory to Ms. Le Pen,” said Alain Duhamel, a prominent author and political analyst. As president, Mr. Macron has certain powers, including those of selecting a prime minister and dissolving Parliament to call a legislative election. But he does not have a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house. He no longer has a loyal centrist party of his own. His ideology, known as Macronism, a mélange of shifting ideas once intended to overcome a left-right cleavage, has collapsed. A poll by Elabe, published this week in the business daily Les Echos, showed his support collapsing to 14 percent of the electorate, the most unpopular he has been and one of the lowest approval ratings ever for a French president. Yet Mr. Macron’s decisions have offered no concessions or readiness to change methods, as was further illustrated in his decision to reappoint Mr. Lecornu. With the far-right National Rally and far-left France Unbowed parties implacably opposed to him, and the center-left Socialists and conservative Republicans also unhappy with Mr. Macron’s choice, it was unclear how any second Lecornu government could last long. Mr. Macron “needs a parliamentary majority to support him,” Denis Baranger and Olivier Beaud, two professors of public law, wrote on Friday in the daily Le Monde. “Because he has not understood this reality, Mr. Macron is now totally isolated and has thrown the country into an unprecedented institutional impasse.” It appeared to be Mr. Macron’s insistence that Bruno Le Maire, a former finance minister now being blamed for the rise in French debt to $4 trillion, become the defense minister in the ephemeral first government of Sébastien Lecornu that caused it to blow apart in less than a day this week. Mr. Le Maire is close to the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, a relationship that Mr. Macron viewed as important given the need to integrate European military power at a time of war on the continent. But the surprise choice proved intolerable to Bruno Retailleau, the right-wing interior minister, who had been blindsided and promptly sounded the death knell of a government Mr. Lecornu had spent almost a month assembling. It was another example of the repetitive fiascos now afflicting France. These have followed Mr. Macron’s still unexplained decision to call parliamentary elections in June 2024. He was under no obligation to do so. Since then, the National Assembly has been split three ways among the nationalist far right, the left and the far left, and an enfeebled center whose loyalty to Mr. Macron is fading. This Parliament is dysfunctional; that much is proven. But France needs a budget to confront its mounting deficit and debt. In theory, Mr. Lecornu must present the budget next week if it is to be approved by the end of the year. With the current parliamentary configuration, it is difficult to see how he will get the budget passed — or, if he somehow does, how his government will survive much beyond that. Yet Mr. Macron does not want to dissolve Parliament and perhaps finish his presidency with Mr. Bardella as his prime minister. For 80 years, since the end of World War II, France has prided itself on keeping the far right from power after the shame and humiliation of the Vichy Government that collaborated with the Nazis. “This is not going to end well,” Ms. Tondelier, the Green Party leader, said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/france-macron-lecornu-prime-minister.html,World,BBC,By Roger Cohen,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-France-Macron-Analysis-wlbg/11int-France-Macron-Analysis-wlbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T08:49:09+00:00,e75af7a1c2d9d8c3a7c1ffa420854a8c2dd0d224

So Much for the Thaw.,"international relations, us foreign policy, international trade, tariff, us economy, global times, stimson center, hu xijin, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us, internal-open-access-from-nl","As the trade war between the United States and China kicked back into high gear after a period of tentative détente, it was clear just how vast the gulf of misunderstanding between the two superpowers had become. President Trump said that he had been blindsided by China’s new controls on rare earth metals and products made from them, announced earlier in the week , amid what he had called a “very good” relationship in recent months. Chinese commentators insisted that Beijing was only responding to new attacks from the United States, and that Washington was the provocateur, because it had ramped up technological restrictions on China while professing good will. Both sides also seemed convinced that they had the advantage and that the other side had overplayed its hand. The blame game continued on Saturday, as China woke up to Mr. Trump’s announcement that he would impose new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese imports from Nov. 1. The Chinese government on Sunday accused the United States of double standards, saying its rare earth export controls were normal, and that it was America that had long abused such controls and adopted discriminatory practices against China in the name of national security. On the threat of more tariffs, the Commerce Ministry said the two sides should resolve issues through talks, but China would take measures in response if the United States “insists on its own course.” “China’s position on a tariff war is consistent: We do not want one, but we are not afraid of one either,” the ministry said in a statement.

Mr. Kim organized the enormous military parade at the main square of the capital, Pyongyang, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of his ruling Workers’ Party. He used the spectacle to show off his country’s growing geopolitical value as a partner to China and Russia in pushing back against the United States. Joining Mr. Kim on the viewing platform were Premier Li Qiang​, China’s second-highest-ranking official; Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin; and To Lam, Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, according to images carried by North Korean state media on Saturday. The parade was also an opportunity for Mr. Kim to ​highlight the deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers who fought for Russia ​in its war against Ukraine joined the parade on Friday, carrying the flags of both nations. North Korea has provided ​Russia with 15,000 troops, according to South Korean officials, and large shipments of artillery shells, rockets and missiles.​ ​The North Koreans will continue to “fulfill their responsibilities in the joint struggle of the progressive mankind for opposing injustice and hegemony and defending justice and peace,” Mr. Kim said in a speech ​before the military parade, a veiled show of defiance against the American-led West. North Korea has long used military parades for domestic propaganda. They have become more frequent and bigger under Mr. Kim, who has also used them as a venue for brandishing ​new weapons to gain leverage against his enemies, like the United States. The weapons shown off on Friday included military drones, tanks with modern electronic warfare equipment and ​various missiles, including hypersonic ballistic missiles and Hwasong-20s, North Korea’s newest intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The authorities linked the rain to Post-Tropical Cyclone Priscilla , formerly a hurricane, and to Tropical Storm Raymond , both off western Mexico in the Pacific Ocean. Forecasters expect the rain to continue this weekend. By Saturday, the rainfall and landslides had killed at least 41 people across four states, Mexico’s civil protection agency said in a statement . Sixteen of the deaths were in the state of Hidalgo, north of Mexico City; nine were in the state of Puebla, east of Mexico City; 15 were in the state of Veracruz and one was in Querétaro, the statement said. The authorities were searching for another 27 missing people, it added. Between Monday and Thursday, intense rainfall was recorded across the states, with the highest being recorded in Veracruz, which received over 21 inches, the statement said. President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said on social media that the government was working to “support the population, open roads and restore electricity.” More than 320,000 users were affected by power outages caused by the heavy rains and winds, the Mexican government said. The torrential rains have damaged at least two bridges and affected more than 600 miles of federal highways across five states, Ms. Sheinbaum said. Thousands of soldiers were carrying out rescues and clearing roads on Friday. The Navy, which deployed 3,300 troops, said that it had carried out more than 900 evacuations. The Mexican authorities said that they had activated more than 5,400 troops from the Army, Air Force and National Guard. The Mexican government said in an earlier statement that the greatest impacts had been reported in the states of Veracruz, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Puebla and Hidalgo. It added that municipalities in Veracruz had been hit particularly hard, with 16,000 homes damaged, landslides on roads and flooded streams. Julio Menchaca, the governor of Hidalgo, said on social media on Thursday that all classes had been suspended because of the heavy rains. Mr. Reyna, the state’s interior secretary, said that at least 1,000 homes, 308 schools and 59 hospitals had been damaged. The storm in Hidalgo also cut off power to 17 municipalities and left 90 communities without communication. Hidalgo’s infrastructure officials posted photos of landslides covering roads and workers trying to clear rocks and branches that had fallen. The same storms were expected to bring the risk of heavy rain and flash flooding across desert areas of the American Southwest this weekend.

Meeting on the United States,"international relations, us foreign policy, us military, targeted killings, smuggling, drug cartel, drug abuse, un security council, nicolas maduro, donald trump, venezuela, us","The United Nations Security Council convened a rare meeting focused on the United States on Friday to discuss the Trump administration’s recent military strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, and the risks these actions posed to regional stability. Though the meeting itself was noteworthy — the council seldom holds meetings on the conduct of the United States, a permanent member — the 15 members of the council were hardly unanimous in support for Venezuela’s government or in open condemnation of the United States. Tensions between the United States and Venezuela have escalated in recent months. The Trump administration has conducted at least four strikes on boats off the waters of Venezuela, killing at least 21 people, alleging that they were smuggling drugs. President Trump recently told Congress that his administration had determined the United States is in a war with drug cartels and that, therefore, people crewing boats suspected of drug smuggling are “unlawful combatants.” That idea that has been sharply contested by a range of legal specialists in laws governing the use of military force. Russia and China sharply criticized the United States on Friday, saying its actions violated international law and violated the sovereignty of Venezuela. Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the U.N., said the military actions and killing of civilians without trial reflected a U.S. “cowboy principle of shoot first.” He said the attacks were an example of “American exceptionalism” in which, he said, Washington does what it wants and expects other countries to fall in line.

ec4eab6aa899,"Clark Olofsson, 78, Dies; Bank Robber Helped Inspire ‘Stockholm Syndrome’","clark olofsson, bank robberies, kidnapping and hostages, psychology, mental health, jan-erik olsson, obituary","Nothing about the holdup of a Stockholm bank in 1973 followed any expected story line. Firing shots into the ceiling and shouting in English, “The party starts!,” an ex-convict named Jan-Erik Olsson seized three bank employees, all women, as hostages. The police swarmed in and the media descended, broadcasting the standoff live. Mr. Olsson hadn’t come just to rob the bank; he was demanding that a former cellmate of his, Clark Olofsson, be sprung from prison and brought to join him. Sweden’s minister of justice went along. Even more unexpected, over six days of captivity, the hostages — the women were joined by a man found hiding in the bank’s vault — began defending their captors and turning hostile toward their would-be police rescuers. One hostage, Kristin Enmark, 23, speaking by phone to Sweden’s prime minister, Olof Palme , begged to be allowed to leave the bank in a getaway car with her abductors. “I fully trust Clark and the robber,” she told Mr. Palme. “They haven’t done a thing to us.” She added, “Believe it or not, but we’ve had a really nice time here.” The police finally broke through the roof and subdued the robbers with tear gas. At trial, the hostages refused to testify against their captors. Their ordeal gave rise to a new term in pop psychology, Stockholm syndrome, to explain how victims supposedly identify and empathize with their captors rather than the authorities trying to help them. Mr. Olofsson, who in Swedish media and in popular culture was portrayed as a charismatic figure, and whose lifetime of escapades on the wrong side of the law made him one of his country’s most famous criminals, died on June 24 at 78. His death, at a hospital in Arvika, Sweden, west of Stockholm, was not widely reported at the time. The Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC reported that Mr. Olofsson’s family confirmed the death without specifying the cause, saying only that he had been treated for “a long illness.” He had spent more than half his life behind bars for robberies, prison breaks and drug smuggling. He was set free for the final time in 2018. Whether Stockholm syndrome is a veritable psychological phenomenon has been debated since its namesake drama, which took place at Kreditbanken in Stockholm’s Norrmalmstorg Square in August 1973. (It was first called Norrmalmstorg syndrome.) The term was coined by a Swedish police psychologist, Nils Bejerot , after he was asked to assess the hostages’ curious behavior during the robbery. But Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the handbook of mental illness in the United States. Some psychologists have explained the behavior as a coping mechanism, seen in victims of kidnappings and among hostages seized by Middle East terrorists, and in victims of domestic abuse. The captives, psychologists say, find a way to self-preservation by siding with their all-powerful captors. The term gained popular currency after the kidnapping of the heiress Patty Hearst by radical leftists in 1974, when Ms. Hearst, after months in captivity, denounced her rich family and participated in a bank robbery with her abductors, self-styled revolutionaries calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army. (A year later, the phenomenon was highlighted in Sidney Lumet’s movie “Dog Day Afternoon,” starring Al Pacino, in which hostages during a bank holdup develop a bond with their captors — an event inspired by a real-life attempted heist in Brooklyn.) Ms. Enmark, the Stockholm hostage, spent years denying that she had ever empathized with Mr. Olsson and Mr. Olofsson. She accused the police who laid siege to the bank of incompetency. She called Stockholm syndrome a myth, saying she had done what was necessary to stay alive. “It’s a way of blaming the victim,” she told a BBC podcast in 2021. “I did what I could to survive.” Clark Oderth Olofsson was born on Feb. 1, 1947, in Trollhattan, Sweden. His parents had a chaotic relationship, and he was placed in foster care at 8 years old, according to accounts in the Swedish media . He grew up to become a repeat offender. At the time of the 1973 hostage drama, he was serving a sentence on robbery and weapons charges. Convicted for his role in the botched robbery of Kreditbanken, Mr. Olofsson was handed another sentence of six and a half years, but the conviction was overturned on appeal: Mr. Olofsson had argued that he had acted to protect the hostages. In 1975, while serving out his prior sentence, he escaped from prison in Norrkoping, Sweden. During a year on the lam, he sailed the Mediterranean Sea, met a teenager on a train whom he would later marry, and robbed a bank in Gothenburg, Sweden, before being caught the same day. The 930,000 kronor (about $230,000) reportedly stolen was never recovered, and it set off a treasure hunt by both the police and civilians. Sentenced to nine years for that robbery, Mr. Olofsson studied journalism behind bars and was released in 1983. The next year, he was convicted on drug charges and sent back to prison until 1991. He cycled in and out of prisons in Sweden and Denmark on drug smuggling convictions for decades, with many of his cases covered in the tabloid media. He married the young woman he had met on the train, Marijke Demuynck, in 1976 and had three sons with her. Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Olofsson’s history of bank robberies, prison escapes and shootouts with the authorities was fodder for a 2003 Swedish television film, “Norrmalmstorg,” and a 2022 Netflix series, “Clark,” with Mr. Oloffson played by Bill Skarsgard. Although mental health experts have theorized about Stockholm syndrome for half a century, almost none thought to speak to Ms. Enmark, the bank employee central to the drama and the diagnosis. One psychologist who did was Allan Wade, a Canadian therapist specializing in interpersonal violence, who, after meeting Ms. Enmark, called Stockholm syndrome a made-up concept meant to shift focus from the stumbles of the Swedish police. “The whole notion was an accusation,” he told the BBC in 2021. “It was a way to dismiss what an incredibly heroic woman had been doing for six and a half days to resist, preserve her dignity and look after the other hostages.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/europe/clark-olofsson-dead.html,World,BBC,By Trip Gabriel,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Olofsson--fctj/10Olofsson--fctj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T23:11:42+00:00,dc55ab413285ddd7db626228875297fb7e870ac0
2c75b48bbb3f,Macron Reappoints Lecornu as France’s Prime Minister,"france, emmanuel macron, sébastien lecornu, appointments and executive changes, politics, legislature","President Emmanuel Macron of France reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as the country’s prime minister on Friday, less than a week after Mr. Lecornu resigned — a risky, whiplash-inducing move that could backfire as Mr. Macron tries to steady a roiling political crisis . The president’s office said in a statement that Mr. Lecornu, a centrist and a close ally of Mr. Macron, had been tasked with forming a government, just days after his previous cabinet of centrists and conservatives imploded . A new government formed by Mr. Lecornu would be France’s fourth in less than a year, a degree of governmental instability not seen since the founding of the country’s Fifth Republic in 1958. And it was far from clear that Mr. Lecornu’s reappointment would do much to help the situation. Political opponents — outraged that Mr. Macron had once again appointed an ally — were already vowing on Friday to topple Mr. Lecornu with a no-confidence motion in the lower house of Parliament, known as the National Assembly. Several left-wing parties and a far-right party declared immediately after the appointment was announced that they would support such a motion, bringing Mr. Lecornu dangerously close to the number of votes required to oust him. Even some of the president’s allies had said that reverting back to Mr. Lecornu was a mistake that did not address the French people’s intense frustration with Mr. Macron, whose approval rating has reached new lows . France has endured months of partisan gridlock in the National Assembly, leaving the country without stable governance, rattling financial markets, unsettling consumers and businesses, and jeopardizing the country’s ability to pass a budget by the end of the year, even as it faces a looming financial crisis . “I accept — out of a sense of duty — the mission entrusted to me by the President of the Republic to do everything possible to give France a budget by the end of the year and to respond to the everyday problems faced by our fellow citizens,” Mr. Lecornu said on X . He added: “We must put an end to this political crisis, which is exasperating the French people, and to this instability, which is damaging to France’s image and interests.” Legally, nothing prevents Mr. Macron from reappointing Mr. Lecornu, who has been a member of every government since Mr. Macron was first elected in 2017. Politically, however, the decision infuriated many of Mr. Macron’s opponents, who blame him for repeatedly refusing to appoint an opposition prime minister, even though his centrist alliance lost badly in snap elections over a year ago. Since those elections, the National Assembly has been deadlocked among three main political blocs, none of which has a majority: a collection of left-wing parties; a mix of conservatives and centrists; and a nationalist, anti-immigrant far right led by the National Rally party. Mr. Macron, who met with party leaders on Friday, has relied on a succession of unstable center-right minority governments, not heeding calls from left-wing parties who say they should have their chance at governing. Jordan Bardella, the head of the far-right National Rally party, said on X that Mr. Macron was “more isolated and disconnected than ever.” “The National Rally will, of course, immediately censure this futile alliance, whose sole raison d’être is fear of dissolution, i.e., of the people,” he added, referring to Mr. Macron’s ability to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections. Mr. Lecornu’s departure, on Monday, had immediately increased the pressure on Mr. Macron. Some of his opponents argued that the only way to break the deadlock was to call new parliamentary elections — or even for Mr. Macron to resign. But Mr. Macron quickly ruled out those options. Mr. Lecornu, after holding last-ditch talks with political parties at the president’s request, said on Wednesday that a majority of parties in the lower house did not want new elections and wanted to pass a budget before year’s end. Mr. Macron appeared to be gambling that most parties, even those who said Mr. Lecornu’s appointment was a provocation, would compromise on a budget bill because they were too afraid of new elections, which polls predict would be dominated by the far right. But that is a risky bet, and there remain major budget disagreements on what spending to cut and what taxes to raise. Mr. Macron’s 2023 pension overhaul, which raised the legal age of retirement to 64 from 62 and is still widely unpopular, is one of the biggest sticking points. Left-wing parties were hoping that Mr. Macron would be open to suspending the measure, despite his extreme reluctance to see any part of his pro-business agenda rolled back. But the parties said after their meeting with Mr. Macron that he had suggested only that the overhaul’s full implementation could be delayed until after 2027, when France’s next presidential election will be held. Mr. Lecornu said on Friday that “all the issues raised during the consultations held in recent days will be open to parliamentary debate,” although he did not specifically mention the pension overhaul.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/europe/france-prime-minister-lecornu-macron.html,World,BBC,By Aurelien Breeden,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10int-france-prime-minister-jphg/10int-france-prime-minister-jphg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T20:16:08+00:00,4b60c61b09527ea160ba2dce1b930a16a6a8ef42

A conservative former member of the national assembly, Ms. Machado has been a driving force in opposing a quarter century of socialist rule that has grown increasingly repressive under President Nicolás Maduro. She has been living in hiding since last year, when Mr. Maduro cracked down on the opposition after claiming victory in an election that was widely seen by independent analysts as fraudulent. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Ms. Machado for her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Ms. Machado has largely avoided commenting on whether Mr. Maduro’s removal should involve U.S. military intervention in Venezuela. But she has been a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, where American forces have destroyed several suspected drug boats in international waters, killing at least 21 people. “I totally support the international deployment and coalition that’s working in the Caribbean to stop the flow of illegal drug income to the regime,” Ms. Machado told the BBC last week. The Norwegian Nobel Institute was able to reach Ms. Machado by telephone a few moments before the prize was announced to tell her she had been selected. “Oh my God,” she said in a video posted by the committee on social media. “Well, I have no words.” In her campaigns opposing the Venezuelan government, she has spent more than two decades building relationships in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans alike. In 2005, she was received in the White House by President George W. Bush, and she has been praised extensively by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and former Florida senator. She argues, like Mr. Trump, that Mr. Maduro poses an enormous security threat to the region. “This is about saving lives,” she told Fox News last month, “not only Venezuelan lives, but also lives of American people, because as you have said, and we have heard, Maduro is the head of a narco-terrorist structure of cooperation.” Yet the announcement of Ms. Machado’s selection for the peace prize seemed to have been greeted with disappointment by the White House, after President Trump talked openly for months about his desire for the prize himself. The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, said the Nobel committee had “proved they place politics over peace.” At an Oval Office news conference on Friday evening, Mr. Trump said: “The person who actually got the Nobel Prize actually called today, called me and said ‘I’m accepting this in honor of you because you really deserved it.’ A very nice thing to do. I didn’t say ‘Then give it to me’ though. I think she might have. She was very nice. I’ve been helping her along the way.” A mother of three adult children, all of whom live abroad, Ms. Machado, 58, hails from a wealthy and staunchly Catholic family. She attended an elite Catholic girls’ school in Caracas and a boarding school in Wellesley, Mass. She studied engineering at Andrés Bello Catholic University, and then took a position in her family’s steel business, Sivensa, parts of which were expropriated in 2010 by President Hugo Chávez, who sent soldiers to take over seven of the company’s plants as part of his socialist nationalization program. Ms. Machado had already become a political activist by then, running a voter rights group, Súmate, that led a failed effort to recall Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. An emblematic moment came in 2012, when Ms. Machado was a legislator and she clashed with Mr. Chávez in a televised debate, accusing him of robbing everyday Venezuelans through expropriation. Mr. Chávez mocked her as being beneath his concern. “Eagles don’t hunt flies,” he told her. Venezuela’s opposition struggled through years of repression and division under Mr. Chávez and then his ally and successor, Mr. Maduro, when the government crushed protests and arrested dissidents, and the economy collapsed, all contributing to an enormous exodus from the country. But last year, Ms. Machado corralled the fractious opposition, playing a galvanizing role in the campaign for the July presidential election. After a court ruled in January 2024 that she was barred from the ballot, she campaigned behind a little-known diplomat named Edmundo González . With rosaries swinging from her neck, Ms. Machado was greeted by adoring crowds as she traveled across the country, visiting small towns and slums that had once provided the core of support for the country’s socialist takeover. In the city of Guanare, in western Venezuela, one voter said she believed that this time around “the fly is going to trap the eagle.” Ms. Machado has championed free markets and vowed to “bury socialism forever.” And she has said that the politician she most admired was Margaret Thatcher. But on the campaign trail last year, she mostly tempered partisan economic talk and focused on what united most Venezuelans: the pain of family separations and the loss of political freedoms. Ms. Machado and her allies sought to show the election had been fraudulent by gathering a physical printout of the voting tally from the majority of voting machines after the polls closed. By the opposition’s count, Mr. González defeated Mr. Maduro by more than 2 to 1 . Unable to celebrate her Nobel win openly, Ms. Machado’s supporters greeted her winning the peace prize with private joy and hope on Friday. A brutal crackdown instituted by Mr. Maduro last year to remain in power forced many in the opposition into hiding. Hundreds of her supporters remain in jail. Top Trump administration officials have in recent weeks stepped up efforts to remove Mr. Maduro from power, with officials discussing a broad campaign that would escalate military pressure to try to force him out. The efforts are being led by Mr. Rubio , who in addition to his role as secretary of state is national security adviser. Mr. Rubio has argued that Mr. Maduro is an illegitimate leader who oversees the export of drugs to the United States, which he says poses an “ imminent threat .” An adviser to Ms. Machado told The New York Times last month that leaders of the Venezuela opposition have been speaking to the Trump administration about how to counter Mr. Maduro. Pedro Urruchurtu, the adviser, said that the opposition had developed a plan for the first 100 hours after Mr. Maduro’s ouster that would involve a transfer of power to Mr. González. “What we’re talking about is an operation to dismantle a criminal structure,” Mr. Urruchurtu said. Along with diplomatic, financial and other tools, he said, “it has to be done with the use of force, because otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to defeat a regime like the one we’re facing.” Reporting was contributed by Anatoly Kurmanaev, Edward Wong and Erin Mendell.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize.html,World,BBC,"By Julie Turkewitz, Jonathan Wolfe and Thomas Fuller",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10nobel-leadall-cwjq/10nobel-leadall-cwjq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T20:05:31+00:00,51d73281cb647059d8e161bc2c66efcf79b8ad80
c7dc5cfd6eb4,Nobel Organizers Look Into Surge of Bets for Winner Ahead of Announcement,"maria corina machado, donald trump, us, polymarket, norwegian nobel committee, nobel prize","The committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize was looking into online bets that suggested advance knowledge that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado had won — and perhaps efforts to profit off the information. The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Ms. Machado had won at about 10 a.m. local time on Friday. But starting late Thursday, wagers that she was the winner began appearing on Polymarket , the popular online prediction market. The bets pushed up the odds on Ms. Machado to more than 73 percent shortly after midnight. Then they fell for about 45 minutes as the odds of a win by Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, rose somewhat, but increased again after 3 a.m. and stayed elevated until the award was officially announced. “Espionage directed against the Norwegian Nobel Committee is unfortunately well known — both politically and economically motivated,” Erik Aasheim, a spokesman for the Norwegian Nobel Institute, said in a statement, adding, “Ahead of this year’s announcement, we have noticed that some have made significant financial gains by placing bets on this year’s prize. We will investigate whether this indicates that someone has unlawfully obtained information from us.” Prediction markets like Polymarket shot to prominence during the United States presidential campaign last year, particularly after bets on the election’s outcome appeared to correctly forecast President Trump’s victory. Proponents of such platforms say that the collective wisdom of speculators who back their predictions with money — and their ability to quickly incorporate a vast array of information — makes the predictions highly accurate. Polymarket drew extra attention after one pseudonymous trader , based in France, was identified as having bet heavily on a Trump victory, though the company said that the wagers did not appear to be an attempt to manipulate its market. A representative for Polymarket was not immediately available.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/nobel-prize-bets-machado-investigation.html,World,BBC,By Michael J. de la Merced,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Nobel-vwpk/10Nobel-vwpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T18:16:10+00:00,8e8ec5ee356cfdd8f910460dab79a35da50ca890

b056c9bc3801,"Holding Back Tears, Prince William Shows a New Side of a Future King","william, prince of wales, eugene levy, king charles iii, britain, london, apple tv","At a time when the British royal family has been convulsed by drama, infighting and a tendency by some royals to over-share, Prince William has remained largely aloof — loath to reveal the kinds of details found in “Spare,” the memoir by his estranged brother, Prince Harry. Yet William, too, has lifted the veil in recent weeks, in his own carefully managed way. Appearing with the Canadian comic actor Eugene Levy on an episode of his travel series, and later with a woman who lost her husband to suicide, William has shown a more personal side, speaking about his desire to change the monarchy after he becomes king and tearing up over another family’s tragedy. The two glimpses of William, 43, have hardly remade the public image of the eldest son of King Charles III. But they have filled in some blanks in the portrait of a man who has carefully cultivated the profile of a middle-aged husband and father, determined to shield himself and his family from undue scrutiny. The exercise in image making has taken on more urgency since his father was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. While Buckingham Palace insists that Charles, 76, is on the mend, the prospect of William having to step up to the throne no longer seems so distant. “He’s on fast forward,” said Tina Brown, the British American journalist who has written two books about the royal family. “His father had 50 years to tell the world who he was before becoming king. It’s essential for William to show the human side of himself before his image gets set in stone as the stoic foil to Harry.” In a video released Friday to coincide with World Mental Health Day, William met with Rhian Mannings, who lost a baby to illness and her husband to suicide. As the two sat at Ms. Mannings’s kitchen table in Cardiff, Wales, William asked her what she would say to her husband, if she could. “I would just like to sit him down like this and say, ‘Why didn’t you come to me?’” she replied. “Because he’s missed out on just so much joy.” William looked away, his eyes brimming with tears. “Are you OK?” Ms. Mannings asked. Struggling to compose himself, William said, “I’m sorry; it’s hard to ask you the questions.” It was a startling display of emotion — not least in contrast to the stiff-upper-lip stoicism of older-generation royals like Queen Elizabeth II — though it recalled the emotional encounters his mother, Princess Diana, had with people with AIDS in the 1990s. William’s focus on suicide prevention echoed his mother’s desire to destigmatize AIDS. In the appearance with Mr. Levy on his Apple TV+ series, “The Reluctant Traveler,” William offered a tour of Windsor Castle and offered some intriguing hints about how he might shake up the monarchy. “It’s safe to say that change is on my agenda,” William said to Mr. Levy, as the two sat over pints at a pub in Windsor. “Not overly radical change,” he added, “but changes that I think need to happen.” William arrived for the meeting on a motorized scooter. He hopped off and greeted Mr. Levy by telling him he loved “ American Pie,” the 1999 sex comedy in which Mr. Levy played a befuddled dad. That drew an obliging laugh from Mr. Levy, an actor whose deadpan delivery has spiced up movies like “Best in Show” and the TV series “Schitt’s Creek.” He told the prince that spending a day with him was a “bucket list” item, as the two set off on a walk around Windsor’s sprawling grounds. “Was getting drunk with Prince William on your bucket list?” the prince said with a mischievous smile (the two appeared to nurse their drinks — a Guinness for Mr. Levy, a cider for William). For Britain’s royals-obsessed press, William’s encounter with Mr. Levy was both tantalizing and threatening. By working with an American streaming service, William served notice that he could shape his narrative while bypassing the tabloids, which have long wielded power in shaping the image of the royals. When William’s wife, Catherine, announced that she had completed her chemotherapy in September 2024, she did so in a gauzy, three-minute video made by Will Warr, a London videographer who specializes in wedding videos. She and William have also posted videos of themselves with their three children on Instagram. The London papers noted, somewhat sniffily, that Mr. Levy did not broach a sensitive issue: William’s feud with Harry. Mr. Levy said he was not instructed by the prince’s staff to avoid it. But he told ITV News, “I had no interest in asking him about that, because it was, you know, a very delicate issue and certainly not up to me to get into it.” Pub visits aside, William left no doubt that he intended to preserve a zone of privacy around his family. “Those who overstep it, I’ll fight against,” he said to Mr. Levy. “It’s about knowing where the line is.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.

87ebeb23d31e,María Corina Machado of Venezuela Is Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,,"María Corina Machado, the winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has emerged as a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, arguing, like Mr. Trump, that Venezuela’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, poses an enormous security threat to the region. Ms. Machado, in statements to the press in recent weeks, has said that, should Mr. Maduro fall, her movement was prepared to take territorial and administrative control of Venezuela, and that they have a plan for the first 100 hours and the first 100 days of a transition. She has also touted an economic plan to American and other investors, saying that a democratic Venezuela under her movement's control has the potential to generate $1.7 trillion in wealth in 15 years. Since September, the Trump administration has been targeting what it calls drug boats in the Caribbean. But the size of the military buildup in the region, and Mr. Trump’s increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro, have led many people in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal — possibly by force. Ms. Machado has largely avoided commenting on whether Mr. Maduro’s removal should involve U.S. military intervention inside Venezuela. In an interview last month, her adviser for international affairs, Pedro Urruchurtu, said that her team was communicating with the Trump administration about plans for Mr. Maduro’s removal. The opposition’s strategy, he said, includes persuading other governments, including the United States, to take diplomatic, financial, intelligence and law enforcement actions against Mr. Maduro. But, he added: “It has to be done with the use of force, because otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to defeat a regime like the one we’re facing.” Ms. Machado’s party, Vente Venezuela, has been sharing online the threats made by Trump officials against alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers. “If you’re in the Caribbean, if you’re north of Venezuela,” the party wrote on X, echoing a statement from the U.S. Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, “and you’re trying to traffic drugs to the US, you’re a legitimate target for the US.” Over the last decade, as Venezuela’s economy crumbled, Mr. Maduro’s security forces hunted political enemies and the opposition weakened. Many in the country lost hope for any kind of political change. Then came Ms. Machado, who managed to unite voters around the common goals of restoring democracy and reuniting families torn apart by migration. A conservative former lawmaker who had been a political foil to the socialist ruling party, on the campaign trail Ms. Machado mostly tempered any partisan economic talk and focused on what united most Venezuelans: the pain of family separations and the loss of political freedoms. When the government banned her from running in the July 2024 election, she managed got a surrogate, Edmundo González , on the ballot. Despite constant harassment on the campaign trail, and the detention of many supporters, Ms. Machado crisscrossed her nation and inspired millions to come out on Election Day. Then, after Mr. Maduro declared victory, her movement collected and counted thousands of paper vote tallies from polling stations, uploading them online. Her movement said the tallies showed the opposition had won overwhelmingly. An independent vote monitor, the Carter Center, found that count to be accurate . It was the most resounding rejection of the regime created by Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, in its 25-year existence. But Ms. Machado had no way to enforce the results. The military stood by Mr. Maduro. Thousands of her supporters took to the streets. A government crackdown led to at least two dozen deaths and the capture of more than 2,000 political prisoners, ending the protests quickly. Ms. Machado went into hiding in Venezuela, and Mr. González fled to Spain. The election of Mr. Trump, who had tried to oust Mr. Maduro in his first term, was a turning point. As soon as his win was announced last year, Ms. Machado began trying to convince his allies that the U.S. president could successfully remove Mr. Maduro this time around. In a series of interviews with The New York Times late last year, Ms. Machado said that for Mr. Trump, Venezuela offered “an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.” Mr. Maduro was very weak, she claimed, and through a pressure campaign, Mr. Trump could force him to recognize the result of the 2024 Venezuelan vote — and leave. Ms. Machado has ties in Washington that go back more than 20 years. The U.S. government provided financial aid to a voters’ rights group she founded in the early 2000s, and she met President George W. Bush at the White House in 2005. She has known Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, for more than a decade, she said. But for a time, it was unclear if Mr. Trump would pay attention to Venezuela, or Ms. Machado’s call for help. In the early months of his administration, it seemed the United States was headed toward a semi-normalization of the relationship with Mr. Maduro’s government. A special envoy appointed by Mr. Trump, Richard Grenell, made an uncommon visit to Caracas, shaking hands with the autocrat, and began to negotiate economic and diplomatic deals. But something changed in August. The Trump administration began sending warships into the Caribbean, declared Mr. Maduro the head of terrorist organization flooding the United States with drugs — though only about 8 percent of the cocaine reaching the United States, and virtually none of the fentanyl, passes through Venezuela. Mr. Trump ordered the attacks on boats in the Caribbean, and directed Mr. Grenell to cut off diplomatic talks with Venezuela. On Fox News just after the U.S. began bombing boats near Venezuela, Ms. Machado said that Mr. Maduro “is understanding finally that the time of impunity is over and it is in his best interest to accept the will of the people that voted against him. It’s time to go .”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/10/world/nobel-peace-prize,World,BBC,By Pranav Baskar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/blogs/10NobelPromo/mosaic-2022-06-23t135435z2066240319rc2pxu9m2s1wrtrmadp3advertising-cannes02-787-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:25:03+00:00,e99d68ea8d106d5ede13521e82baa68e3a672e34
a45652b36219,Mount Everest Just Recorded Some of Its Most Intense Snowfall Ever,"weather, snow snowstorms, cold spells;polar vortex, mountain, himalayas, mount everest","The storm that came spinning out of the Bay of Bengal in the north of the Indian Ocean last weekend was already notable. It pounded the Himalayas — the tallest mountains in the world — and unleashed a torrent of snow that closed roads, buried tents and stranded hundreds of people on Mount Everest. Now, data from a weather station at an Everest base camp suggests that the rate at which the snow fell during part of the storm may have broken records or, at the very least, was one of the most significant ever recorded. Baker Perry, an expert in high mountain extremes and a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, called one measurement of the snow that fell “off the charts.” “No wonder tents were collapsing,” he said. The Record at Stake It wasn’t that long ago that a team of ambitious meteorologists trekked to Mount Everest, not to summit the mountain but to install weather stations at the highest points on Earth. They wanted to better understand the atmosphere and how it affects the water that is stored in the world’s highest mountain chains. The weather stations transmit real-time information about temperature, humidity and precipitation from five locations around the mountain. Three of the stations transmit information in real time . Two others are offline, including one — the highest weather station in the world — near Everest’s summit. The other, down the mountain at a place called South Col, has data about last weekend’s snowstorm that Dr. Perry is eager to collect in person. Based on what he had seen so far, though, Dr. Perry called last weekend’s storm “far and away the biggest” he had observed since he helped install the stations in 2019. It all has to do with what meteorologists call “water equivalent precipitation,” or the amount of water that is left when a pile of snow is melted. Water equivalent measurements are especially useful in comparing places that experience intense periods of precipitation, as with lake-effect snow around the Great Lakes or atmospheric rivers in the Pacific Northwest. It’s a scientific way to answer the question of how much rain or snow actually fell, and is often measured in 12-hour and 24-hour increments. One of the highest water equivalent measurements ever recorded occurred in 1921 during a snowstorm in Silver Lake, Colo., when 142 millimeters, or about 5.6 inches, of precipitation fell as snow over 27 and a half hours. That amount has stood as the U.S. record and, though it is disputed, is considered by some to be a world record for snowfall. On Everest, the highest measurements recorded before this storm were 38 millimeters in a 24-hour period in July 2021 and just over 26 millimeters in a 12-hour period in October that same year. On Saturday, Dr. Perry said, the Everest base camp reported 122 millimeters in 24 hours, 92 millimeters of which came in just 12 hours. Both are more than three times as high as the totals from the 2021 storms. This week, Dr. Perry has been feverishly checking with other scientists across the world to compare data. For now, he said, “I am certainly not comfortable claiming that this is a world record, but I can say that the 12-hour and 24-hour liquid equivalent totals are amongst the highest ever recorded.” The Scientific Debate As the storm swept into the region, it brought along with it water vapor from the Bay of Bengal, said Jay Cordeira, an assistant director for precipitation science at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. He compared it to what happened last year when Hurricane Helene’s circulation passed from the Gulf of Mexico through the Southern Appalachians: The mountains caused the clouds to be squeezed and wrung dry, creating flooding as all that rain fell to the ground. Because of the higher elevation of the Himalayas, the precipitation fell as snow. There’s disagreement over how significant the snowfall was. Dinkar Kayastha, with the Nepal Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, said it was “part of the regular monsoon process and not considered unusual or extreme.” The region’s annual monsoon season is caused by the changing of winds and frequently features heavy rainfall. But Arbindra Khadka, an expert in meteorology at Tribhuvan University in Nepal, said the “large-scale continuous precipitation and snowfall” set this storm apart, as did the amount of snow that fell over such a short period of time on Everest. He called it “a rare event in October,” the kind of snowstorm that happens only every 25 to 50 years. This is where the water equivalent becomes more important than the snow depth. Snow depth, which is how most records are kept in the United States, is not an apples-to-apples comparison, Dr. Baker said, because the air can change the density of snow. So, scientifically, the only way to compare snow amounts is to melt it down and get the water equivalent. Several factors can influence a record, including the fact that someone from Dr. Perry’s team has to get back to base camp to retrieve the physical log of the data and calibrate it. That involves accounting for powerful wind speeds that can make it difficult for snow to fall into the bucket that collects the measurement. These wind readings can allow scientists to make adjustments that can add up to an accurate water equivalent reading. Dr. Baker noted that accurate readings of precipitation from extreme locations like Everest have become possible only in recent years and that there are many remote places where very little data has been collected. “These types of events may be more common under the right circumstances, especially in high mountain Asia, than we know,” he said. “We just happen to have these gauges at Everest base camp, and we’re seeing this.” Just as snow in the Sierra Nevada in the United States is beneficial for the water supply in California, the snow in this region is valuable for Nepal and India. As the planet heats up, the mountains in the region have grown warmer in recent years. That can be a problem, as more of the precipitation that once fell as snow falls instead as rain. Dr. Perry said the change could have “huge hydrological implications” and could cause more of the moisture to run off at once, potentially setting off floods as the landscape is unable to absorb so much moisture at one time.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/weather/mount-everest-record-snow.html,World,BBC,By Judson Jones,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06int-china-everest-vjzb/06int-china-everest-vjzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:20:27+00:00,e5b7d01b0da8d5d9c215b8c27a26b3ca63827259
7c4efe71a4c1,"In Retaliatory Move, Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on Chinese Goods","us politics, us foreign policy, international trade, tariff, rare earths, regulation and deregulation, donald trump, xi jinping, china","President Trump on Friday said he would impose a 100 percent tariff on all products from China in response to curbs Beijing announced this week on rare-earth minerals, a rapid escalation of tensions between the world's largest economies. On Truth Social, Mr. Trump wrote that the tariffs would take effect on Nov. 1 and be imposed “over and above” other tariffs on Chinese exports, which are already 30 percent and in some cases much higher. The United States would also put export controls on critical software, he said. In an earlier post on Friday, the president threatened to retaliate and cancel a planned meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump called the curbs that China put out this week on its exports of rare-earth minerals “sinister and hostile” and said they would “make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World.” He added that he had planned to meet Mr. Xi in two weeks at an international economic conference in South Korea, “but now there seems to be no reason to do so.” “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” he wrote. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” Markets shuddered at the developments — the S&P 500 index sliding more than 2 percent on Friday. Speaking Friday evening, the president suggested that the tariffs could be walked back before the Nov. 1 deadline and that he would not necessarily cancel his planned meeting with Mr. Xi. “We’ll see what happens,” Mr. Trump said. He called China’s move “very, very bad.” Rare-earth minerals, which are vital for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets, have been at the center of tensions between the United States and China this year. Mr. Trump has also placed extreme tariffs on Chinese exports before, only to walk them back after they restricted trade and hurt companies in both countries. In April, the Chinese government responded to the stiff tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese goods by clamping down on mineral exports destined for U.S. automakers and defense manufacturers. The Trump administration tried to encourage China to back down by imposing its own restrictions on exports of chip design software, airplane engines and other products. U.S. tariffs on Chinese products rose to a minimum of 145 percent, bringing much trade between the countries to a halt and raising concerns about empty American store shelves. China’s mineral curbs threatened to close U.S. factories and forced the United States, which depends on Chinese supplies, to pull back . Ultimately, officials from both countries reached a fragile truce in meetings this spring that led to Mr. Trump’s reducing his tariffs and Beijing’s approving more mineral exports. On Thursday, Beijing again escalated its controls , asserting broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology. The Chinese government said it would require companies anywhere in the world to obtain licenses if they are exporting products containing even a minimal amount of Chinese-produced rare earths, including for chip manufacturing. Those exports would also be controlled if the minerals were produced using Chinese mining, processing or magnet-making technologies. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be denied those licenses, it said. The Chinese government also put new controls on equipment needed to manufacture batteries for electric cars. The global nature of the Chinese restrictions mirror those that the United States has put on semiconductors, which dictate that any company using American chip technology anywhere in the world must follow United States guidelines. China has responded to those restrictions by developing its own framework to regulate industries that it dominates. China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths and performs the chemical processing for roughly 90 percent of the global supply of the minerals. The new restrictions have caused significant anxiety among U.S. companies. Analysts said the new limits could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple. Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent. On Friday, China also announced an antimonopoly investigation into the American chipmaker Qualcomm and new fees for U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports. Analysts had speculated that China’s mineral restrictions could be an effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. If so, it could backfire. In addition to the president’s calls for retaliation, other critics of China said the measures highlighted the need for the United States to reduce its exposure to the Chinese economy. The Chinese government has set out ambitious plans in recent decades to dominate various industries, including steel, shipbuilding, robotics, rare earths and biomedicine. John Moolenaar, the Republican chairman of the House Select Committee on China, called Beijing’s action “an economic declaration of war against the United States and a slap in the face to President Trump amid his efforts to fight for a level playing field.” Mr. Moolenaar said the United States should immediately pass legislation to end preferential trade treatment for China, build the U.S. supply of minerals and “strangle China’s technology sector with export controls instead of selling it advanced chips.” Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the think tank Asia Society Policy Institute, said the president’s statements showed “how fragile the emerging détente between the two countries really is.” “Beijing has become increasingly assertive, believing it has the upper hand in the bilateral relationship,” she said. But Mr. Trump’s counter threats showed that “two can play this game.” With the planned summit between the leaders in just over two weeks, it was unclear whether the two sides would be willing to de-escalate to hold the meeting, Ms. Cutler added. In his social media post, Mr. Trump said that China’s policies “came out of nowhere.” The United States’ relationship with China over the past six months had been a very good one, he said. The president said that although China had a monopoly on rare-earth minerals, the United States had other monopolies that were “stronger and more far reaching.” He added, “I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW!” The White House has been planning for President Trump to travel to Asia later this month, where he would meet Mr. Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea. The plans had generated speculation about whether the meeting could lead to an economic deal between the countries, potentially including Chinese purchases of American products or Chinese investment in the United States. Beijing has also been interested in having the United States roll back the global controls it has put on China’s access to advanced A.I. chips. American farmers have asked the administration to push China to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybean exports that have had a crippling impact this year . Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky soybean farmer who is the president of the American Soybean Association, said that his group was “extremely disappointed” that the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would be canceled. “Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis,” Mr. Ragland said.

247db6628f89,Machado’s Peace Prize Is Latest Nobel for Female Democracy Campaigners,"nobel prize, nobel foundation, aung san suu kyi, narges mohammadi, venezuela, democracy, ellen johnson sirleaf","The Norwegian Nobel Committee’s decision to award the Peace Prize to María Corina Machado is the latest honor given to a female democracy campaigner in recent years. In 2023, Narges Mohammadi of Iran was recognized for her crusade for women’s rights , which the committee said “made her a symbol of freedom and standard-bearer in the struggle against the Iranian theocracy.” In 1991, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar was awarded the prize for “her nonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights.” Ms. Mohammadi, 53, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 80, were in prison when they were honored by the Nobel committee — and they are in prison today. Both are reported to be in ill health. Ms. Mohammadi was a leader at the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an organization that promotes democracy and women’s rights. A founder of the organization, Shirin Ebadi , a human rights lawyer and mentor to Ms. Mohammadi, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. Ms. Mohammadi’s campaigning began at a young age. The Iranian morality police arrested her when she was 19 for having dared to wear an orange coat, according to the speech she wrote to accept the Peace Prize. (As with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, her children accepted the honor in her stead.) After that incident, Ms. Mohammadi was arrested on more than a dozen occasions, and she is now serving a 10-year sentence for “spreading anti-state propaganda.” When she was briefly released from prison to recover from surgery last year, she was recorded on video chanting a slogan that animated a female-led uprising against the Islamic Republic: “Women, life, freedom!” She was not, as required under Iranian law, wearing a hijab. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father was considered modern Myanmar’s founding father, was thrust into the political spotlight in 1988 when the ruling junta brutally suppressed pro-democracy rallies. She became the leader of the National League for Democracy party, which won elections in 1990 that the top brass ignored. She spent most of the next two decades under house arrest before being released in 2010. When a new clutch of generals began to loosen the political reins, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was elected a member of Parliament and later became the nation’s de facto leader. But after her party won another landslide election in 2020, the military staged a coup. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned again, along with hundreds of other pro-democracy politicians. Myanmar is now engulfed by civil war. Other women who have been awarded the Peace Prize for their campaigns for democracy and women’s rights include Tawakkol Karman of Yemen and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia, who were joint honorees in 2011.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/nobel-peace-prize-women-democracy.html,World,BBC,By Hannah Beech,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10nobel-dissidents-hjvt/10nobel-dissidents-hjvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T12:04:16.509000+00:00,3b377af51e5ae3f9bdb28ccaf80c1ac0af114214
3b9adea5fdb4,France’s Domestic Instability Has Weakened Its Diplomatic Clout,"politics, international relations, legislature, european commission, eu, national rally;national front, marine le pen, emmanuel macron, europe, france, russian invasion of ukraine (2022)","No matter how elegant the performance of a country’s leader on the world stage, domestic instability still diminishes its global influence. President Emmanuel Macron of France has shown he is one of Europe’s most decisive and vibrant leaders, but his inability to find a government that can deal with spiraling debt and political division is undercutting his credibility as an international actor of consequence. Mr. Macron, deeply unpopular at home, is seeking to form a sixth government in the past 21 months, still hoping to find a prime minister who can cobble together support in a Parliament split at least three ways, with no faction able to command a stable majority. After a long day of negotiations on Friday with party leaders, Mr. Macron announced that he had asked Sébastian Lecornu , who had resigned on Monday, to try yet again. “Domestic instability undermines credibility even if foreign-policy competence lies with the president,” said Daniela Schwarzer, an expert in Franco-German relations and a member of the executive board of the Bertelsmann Foundation, a nonprofit institute. “Because as soon as it’s about money, it depends on the Parliament and on the budget,” over which Mr. Macron has no direct control, she said. A paralyzed Paris erodes Europe’s strategic weight and ability to make decisions, especially on rearmament. Mr. Macron may promise more money for the military in any new French budget, as he did this summer, but it is France’s Parliament that controls the funds, making his efforts to respond to a newly aggressive Russia seem hollow.

A conservative former lawmaker, Ms. Machado has long been a foil to Venezuela’s socialist ruling party. She has been in hiding since the summer of 2024, when President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory in a vote that was widely seen as rigged . The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize, said that it chose Ms. Machado primarily for her efforts to advance democracy “in the face of ever-expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela.” In its statement , the committee praised Ms. Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Ms. Machado supports President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, which he says is meant to stop drug smuggling to the United States from Latin America. In a series of interviews with The New York Times late last year, Ms. Machado said that, for Mr. Trump, Venezuela offered “an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.” Here’s what to know about Ms. Machado, the movement she leads and what this honor means for Venezuela. Who is María Corina Machado? Ms. Machado, 58, is the eldest daughter of a prominent family in Caracas. She attended an elite Catholic girls’ school in Caracas and a boarding school in Wellesley, Mass. She studied engineering and finance and later worked for the family company, Sivensa, a large steel producer. Parts of the company were expropriated in 2010 by President Hugo Chávez, the founder of the country’s modern socialist movement, who took control of dozens of privately owned companies as part of his nationalization program. In the early 2000s, she became a political activist and a founder of Súmate, a voter rights group that led a failed effort to recall Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. Mr. Maduro has held power since. Ms. Machado joined the National Assembly in 2010, winning a record number of votes. She leads the Vente Venezuela opposition party, and in 2023 she announced a bid for the presidency. But she was blocked from running in the 2024 election over what the government said were financial irregularities when she was a national legislator. She called this a politically motivated maneuver meant to keep her from power and backed a surrogate, a little-known former diplomat named Edmundo González . Mr. González ran against Mr. Maduro, who claimed victory in the election. The opposition, however, collected evidence that it said showed Mr. González won by a wide margin and alleged that Mr. Maduro had stolen the vote. The Carter Center, an independent vote monitoring organization, has called the opposition’s count accurate . Why was she awarded the Nobel Peace Prize? Jorgen Watne Frydnes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told reporters after the announcement that the judges weighed the security implications of giving the prize to Ms. Machado. “This is the discussion we have every year for all candidates, particularly when the person who receives the prize is, in fact, in hiding because of serious threats to her life,” he said, adding that the committee believed the award would support her cause. Mr. Frydnes said he hoped that she would be able to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in December, but that it would depend on the security situation. The Nobel committee, in giving the prize to Ms. Machado, warned of pressure on democracy across the globe. “Democracy is also in retreat internationally,” the committee wrote. “Democracy — understood as the right to freely express one’s opinion, to cast one’s vote and to be represented in elective government — is the foundation of peace both within countries and between countries.” What does she think about Mr. Trump’s moves toward Venezuela? Ms. Machado has emerged as a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, arguing, like Mr. Trump, that Mr. Maduro poses a national security threat to the region. After the United States began bombing suspected drug boats in the Caribbean last month, she said in an interview to Fox News : “This is about saving lives, not only Venezuelan lives, but also lives of American people, because as you have said, and we have heard, Maduro is the head of a narco-terrorist structure of cooperation.” Ms. Machado, in statements to the press in recent weeks, has said that, should Mr. Maduro fall, her movement was prepared to take territorial and administrative control of Venezuela. She has also promoted an economic plan to U.S. and other investors, saying that a democratic Venezuela under her movement’s control has the potential to generate $1.7 trillion in wealth in 15 years, in part by privatizing the oil industry. Since September, the Trump administration has been targeting what it calls drug boats in the Caribbean. But the size of the military buildup in the region, and Mr. Trump’s increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro, have led many in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-venezuela.html,World,BBC,By Jonathan Wolfe and Julie Turkewitz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/24/multimedia/10nobel-prize-machado-anlakeng/10nobel-prize-machado-anlakeng-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T10:32:21+00:00,ac61931fca80efa334803675daf523dc9e36f0fc

Men carried bags, women carried young children, and older children held hands as they made their way up the dusty seaside road toward the ruins of Gaza City, which they were ordered to flee weeks ago. Some said they were heading north for the first time since the war began. Though the surroundings were bleak, the mood was jubilant. “The crowds are unbelievable,” said Shamekh al-Dibs, who fled south with his family last month. “People are so happy, even if what they’re going back to is destruction.” Israel agreed early Friday morning to a cease-fire deal with Hamas, which the military said came into effect at noon. As part of the agreement, Hamas would release the remaining hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, while Israeli troops would partially withdraw. The deal was based on a proposal presented by President Trump last week. On Friday, a spokesman for Israel’s Parliament said Mr. Trump was expected to visit the chamber in Jerusalem on Monday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-israel-hamas.html,World,BBC,"By Liam Stack, Aaron Boxerman and Bilal Shbair",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10vid-gaza-cease-fire-gjlv/10vid-gaza-cease-fire-gjlv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:46:57+00:00,3b75ab16776e5d549b503c7712971b0f2db4e38a
e6ca81562cac,Venezuela’s Maduro Offered the U.S. His Nation’s Riches to Avoid Conflict,"us foreign policy, embargoes sanctions, oil and gasoline, energy industry, chevron, conocophillips, shell, state department, maria corina machado, marco rubio, donald trump, venezuela, us, international relations","Venezuelan officials, hoping to end their country’s clash with the United States, offered the Trump administration a dominant stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in discussions that lasted for months, according to multiple people close to the talks. The far-reaching offer remained on the table as the Trump administration called the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela a “narco-terror cartel,” amassed warships in the Caribbean and began blowing up boats that American officials say were carrying drugs from Venezuela. Under a deal discussed between a senior U.S. official and Mr. Maduro’s top aides, the Venezuelan strongman offered to open up all existing and future oil and gold projects to American companies, give preferential contracts to American businesses, reverse the flow of Venezuelan oil exports from China to the United States, and slash his country’s energy and mining contracts with Chinese, Iranian and Russian firms. The Trump administration ended up rebuffing Mr. Maduro’s economic concessions and cut off diplomacy with Venezuela last week. The move effectively killed the deal, at least for now, the people close to the discussion said. Though the United States has been targeting what it calls drug boats, the cutoff of diplomacy, the military buildup near Venezuela and the increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro by Trump administration officials have led many in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal . Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state and national security adviser, has been the leading voice in the administration’s push to oust Mr. Maduro. He has called Mr. Maduro an illegitimate leader who is a “fugitive from American justice” and has been skeptical of the diplomatic approach conducted by a special U.S. envoy, Richard Grenell. Proponents of diplomacy acknowledge that Mr. Rubio’s hard line approach has prevailed for now. But they believe their efforts could eventually bear fruit, pointing to Mr. Trump’s sudden reversals on other major foreign policy issues, such as the war in Ukraine , trade with China or Iran’s nuclear program . This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen American and Venezuelan representatives of disparate factions calling for diplomacy with Mr. Maduro. They described their discussions on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Publicly, the Venezuelan government has responded to Mr. Trump’s military escalation with defiance and vows to defend what it calls a socialist revolution started in the 1990s by Mr. Maduro’s late predecessor and mentor Hugo Chávez. At the same time, Mr. Maduro has said he remains open to negotiations and his government continues accepting deportation flights from the United States. Behind the scenes, however, Venezuela’s senior officials, with Mr. Maduro’s blessing, have offered Washington far-reaching concessions that would essentially eliminate the vestiges of resource nationalism at the core of Mr. Chávez’s movement. While Mr. Grenell and Venezuelan officials made progress on economic issues, they failed to agree on Mr. Maduro’s political future, according to the people close to the negotiations. Venezuela’s foreign minister, Yván Gil, said in an interview last month that Mr. Maduro would not negotiate his exit. Mr. Maduro has repeatedly repressed democratic challenges to his rule after assuming the presidency in 2013. He held on to power last year after losing a presidential election by rigging the results and brutally suppressing protests . Mr. Grenell declined to comment for this article. The State Department, the White House and Venezuela’s government did not respond to requests for comment. In Washington, American officials offer differing assessments of the talks. One U.S. official said the reports of negotiations over the lifting of sanctions and access to the Venezuelan market was “not an accurate assessment of what took place.” But other American officials said U.S. and Venezuelan officials held repeated talks over what economic normalization would look like, including access to Venezuelan energy markets by American companies and a lifting of U.S. sanctions. As Mr. Grenell and Mr. Maduro’s envoys negotiated a deal, the leader of Venezuela’s main opposition movement, María Corina Machado, pitched her own economic proposal in New York. She argued that even greater economic wealth — $1.7 trillion in 15 years — awaited U.S. companies in Venezuela if her movement launched a political transition. (Ms. Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for what the Norwegian Nobel Committee described as “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.”) Ms. Machado’s economic adviser, Sary Levy, said the investment deals offered by Mr. Maduro would never materialize without democracy, rule of law and individual freedoms. “What Maduro offers investors is not stability, it's control — control maintained through terror,” said Ms. Levy. “The Trump Administration has shown a clear intention to not fall for these offers of easy solutions.” Venezuela currently produces about one million barrels of oil a day, down from about three million when Mr. Chávez took power. The bulk of Venezuela’s oil exports go to China, except for about 100,000 barrels per day that the U.S. energy giant Chevron sells to the United States. Most experts agree that Venezuela could quickly ramp up oil output with a major injection of foreign capital, though they differ on whether this is achievable under the current government. “Our message to the oil companies is: We want you here, certainly,” Ms. Machado told American corporate representatives in June. “We want you here not producing crumbs of a couple hundred thousand barrels a day. We want you here producing millions of barrels a day.” Ms. Machado declined to comment for this article. In the past, the United States framed its support for a new government in Venezuela as a human rights imperative. In contrast, the economic points discussed by Mr. Maduro’s envoys with Mr. Grenell echoed a mercantilist worldview that Mr. Trump has promoted elsewhere. Mr. Trump has demanded access to Ukrainian minerals as payment for U.S. support for Kyiv’s war effort. He has frequently lamented that the United States did not get Iraqi oil after the 2003 invasion. He agreed to keep U.S. troops in Syria in 2019 on the condition that America would “keep the oil.” The deal discussed between Mr. Grenell and Venezuelan officials was especially sweeping, representing arguably the most ambitious attempt at resource diplomacy during the president’s second term. Normalizing trade and allowing American companies back into Venezuela could be tempting to some U.S. officials because of the country’s oil reserves, the world’s largest, as well as significant deposits of natural gas, gold, iron, bauxite and coltan, a mineral mix used in electric batteries. Mr. Maduro’s economic outreach to the United States has also extended to the private sector, in an attempt to strengthen his hand in Washington. Venezuela’s state oil company has given Chevron, the largest American company working in Venezuela, full control of their joint oil projects and the two entities have discussed giving Chevron a stake in another major oil field. Venezuelan officials have worked to repair relations with another U.S. oil giant, ConocoPhillips, which left Venezuela in 2007 after the government seized its operations. Mr. Maduro’s government and Conoco have been negotiating an oil trading deal as recently as this year, according to two people familiar with the talks. Chevron said its business dealings in Venezuela comply with all applicable Venezuelan and U.S. laws. Conoco did not respond to a request for comment. The outreach by Venezuelan officials and business leaders came closest to achieving a diplomatic breakthrough in May, according to the people briefed on the talks. As a sign of good will, Mr. Grenell that month orchestrated the return of a Venezuelan toddler stranded in the United States after her parents were deported , giving Mr. Maduro a domestic political win. Venezuela’s government reciprocated shortly afterward by releasing a U.S. Air Force veteran jailed in the country and delivering him to Mr. Grenell . Mr. Maduro came to support most of the economic terms in the proposal discussed with Mr. Grenell. A person familiar with the negotiations said Mr. Maduro initially wavered on the American demand to limit Venezuela’s economic ties with China, Russia and Iran. But he eventually saw that loosening those alliances was an inevitable price for avoiding American military intervention, the person said. To maximize income in the face of U.S. pressure, Venezuela has also stopped sending oil to Cuba, worsening acute electricity shortages in the allied nation. Mr. Grenell’s economic negotiations with Mr. Maduro’s envoys faced strong opposition from Mr. Rubio, a Cuban American and former senator who has long viewed Mr. Maduro’s downfall as a crucial step to ending the Communist dictatorship on the island. The proponents of economic engagement with Mr. Maduro have managed to score minor victories. Chevron got its U.S. Treasury license to operate in Venezuela reinstated in July, according to the Venezuelan government . The company succeeded in overturning the ban imposed by Mr. Trump months earlier after a concerted lobbying push in Washington, according to people familiar with the deal. The Treasury Department on Wednesday issued another license that in effect allows Shell, Europe’s largest energy company, to restart work in Venezuela. Under a new permit, Shell could begin producing gas from a massive offshore Venezuelan field as soon as next year, according to a person familiar with the deal. The gas from the field, known as Dragon, will be processed and sold from neighboring Trinidad. Shell directed questions to the license holder, the government of Trinidad & Tobago, whose officials did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Rubio said last month that the United States would ensure that the Dragon project would “not provide significant benefit to the Maduro regime.” Mr. Maduro has signed off on a stipulation that would have Shell invest in social projects in Venezuela instead of paying his government. For the Maduro government, the key benefit is showing that Venezuela remains open for business.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-us-oil.html,World,BBC,"By Anatoly Kurmanaev, Julian E.

2a9e95a0a16c,"Every Artist Has a Favorite Subject. For Some, That’s Math.","mathematics, sculpture, art, design academy eindhoven, henry segerman, eindhoven netherlands","It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that the Dutch sculptor Rinus Roelofs organizes his life around the annual Bridges conference, an international event celebrating synergies between math and art. In July, the conference drew more than 400 artistically minded mathematicians and mathematically minded artists to the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Dr. Roelofs’s main contribution to the program was a half-ton, eight-foot-tall metal sculpture called “Dancing Cubes.” “I do not call my art ‘mathematical art,’” Dr. Roelofs said in a video interview about a week later. “It’s art about mathematics. Every artist has a favorite subject, things you want to talk about. For me, that’s math.” “Dancing Cubes” is a riff on the geometric notion of duality: a relationship by which one form emerges, or can be constructed, from another. “If you have one object, you can make another object, the dual of the first object, and if you put the two together you have a new construction,” Dr. Roelofs said. Duality played a part in Dr. Roelofs’s dual Ph.D. in architecture and mathematics, which he obtained in 2020 at age 66. His artistic practice had always been research-driven, and in 2012, while creating a sculpture with equilateral triangles, he made a number of mathematical discoveries. For instance, he found a new series of uniform polyhedra based on helical rods. “ They look like spiky, twisted cylinders ,” said Doris Schattschneider, a mathematician and professor emerita at Moravian University who was on Dr. Roelofs’s thesis committee. Dr. Schattschneider, an expert on math-art intersections, noted that an elegant example of duality involves the cube and the regular octahedron, a three-dimensional geometric solid with eight faces, each an equilateral triangle. These two polyhedra, she said, “are called geometric duals because both have 12 edges, but the cube has six faces and eight vertexes while the octahedron has eight faces and six vertexes.” “Rinus doesn’t just do this classic display of duality, growing one construction inside the other,” Dr. Schattschneider said. “He rounds the edges and sometimes does a twist, so the end result is an intriguing sculpture.” For “Dancing Cubes,” Dr. Roelofs used a technique of his own devising — called an extrusion transformation — to extend his creation from classical geometry to innovative art. The sculpture is composed of only two elements: a right-angled triangle (30 copies) and a rounded triangular variation (12 copies). “One needs the other to exist,” Dr. Roelofs said. “If you take away one, the sculpture will fall apart.” The artwork earned its name because when it is assembled small cubes emerge along the central axis. “It’s a little surprise,” Dr. Roelofs said. A larger art exhibition of similar wonders is the centerpiece of every Bridges conference. This year, the exhibition drew 184 submissions. “This is the biggest and best Bridges ever,” Dr. Schattschneider said in an email from Eindhoven. Here is a sampling of a few of the other pieces from the exhibition: “Gradient of Grain” was created by Edmund Harriss, a mathematician and artist at the University of Arkansas, using a computer-controlled router. The radial carvings run along the so-called gradient, perpendicular to the tree’s growth rings. The growth rings serve as inputs that direct the carving algorithm. “When using digital manufacturing to render geometry, the mathematics is often imposed on the material,” Dr. Harriss noted in his artist’s statement. “As a material, however, wood talks back, revealing patterning of grain, whatever the geometry does.” Kanata Warisaya, a doctoral student in architecture and engineering at the University of Tokyo, said in an interview that “the fun of geometry” motivated him to create “ Spherical Hinged Tessellation feat. TMK122 .” Nevertheless, he envisioned this squeezable sphere as a stress toy: “I find it relaxing.” He made it in an art-science class led by Tomohiro Tachi, a professor of computational origami at the University of Tokyo, and Asao Tokolo, an artist. “Scissor Tessellation” is by Seri Nishimoto, also a doctoral student at the University of Tokyo. The piece is constructed from a repeating pattern of 48 scissorlike units (four rows by 12 columns), each scissor with an arm-to-length ratio of four centimeters to seven centimeters. “The repetition of the same unit creates an interesting, nontrivial transformation into a curved surface,” Ms. Nishimoto said. Jill Borcherds, a retired secondary school math teacher in Stevenage, England, created a colorful “Fabric Hexaflexagon.” A flexagon is a flat, folded geometric structure; when flexed along the folds, its various faces emerge. “I tried to bring out the connections between art and maths as a way of engaging students,” Ms. Borcherds said. “Those who struggled were motivated when careful measuring, calculating and constructing produced a beautiful design or 3-D object. So often I have witnessed the sense of wonder appearing when the third face of a hexaflexagon appears.” And then the fourth, fifth and sixth. “Doo-dah” is a digital creature discovered by John Winston Garth, a computer scientist in Athens, Ala. His artist’s statement explains: “The term ‘computerrarium’ describes it well. Conway’s Game of Life is just that — an environment with rules that mimic life’s, boiled down to their simplest form: birth, death and survival. This discovery, ‘Doo-dah,’ is an example of a precise combination of cells generated by software tailored for the job. Hidden creatures exist in this environment, finding a balance within the typical randomness.” This video shows two copies of the same gizmo, one white and one green, made by Henry Segerman, a mathematician at Oklahoma State University. Called “Expanding (3, 4, 5) Triangle,” the mechanisms are constructed from expanding racks , a system of circular gears (pinions) meshing with linear gears (racks). The white version is fully-contracted, and the green version is fully expanded. “When any part of the triangle is pulled or pushed, the entire structure gets bigger or smaller,” Dr. Segerman said. Generally, the ultimate dream with expanding mechanisms is to have a solid block of material when the racks are contracted, and then, when the racks are expanded, for all the material to be optimally deployed in a strong and stable structure. David Reimann, a mathematician and computer scientist at Albion College in Michigan, described “Square Root of Two” as a sort of algorithmic topiary. The digits of the square root of two are outlined — in the root system’s negative space — along the diagonal of a square, conveying the relationship between a unit square and the length of its diagonal.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/science/mathematics-art-roelofs.html,World,BBC,By Siobhan Roberts,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/00SCI-MATH-ART1-01-bhcz/00SCI-MATH-ART1-01-bhcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:01:22+00:00,9b524136384cec4df851f96d8c0eca81bfe3d625
465b8dfe4801,Mexico’s President Is Popular. So Is Her Professional Lookalike.,"claudia sheinbaum, tamara henaine, impersonators;impressionists, politics, social media, mexico, mexico city, actor, personal profile;people story","People craned their necks or did double-takes, shocked at the woman walking by. Some asked for selfies, others for government help. One woman offered a blessing, one man burst into song. Everyone had the same question. “Are you the president?” asked Manuel H. Garza, 66, a Mexican retiree, amazed to see her strolling around the streets of Mexico City. It was not President Claudia Sheinbaum , as many thought, but an actress who has tied her fortunes to the country’s first female head of state and who has vaulted into national fame by dint of their uncanny resemblance . Ms. Sheinbaum and the actress, Tamara Henaine, are the same height. They have similarly dark eyes and hair. Even their smiles look alike. (Granted, Ms. Henaine has been practicing.) In Ms. Henaine’s mind, she was born for this role. “I swear it feels like it,” she said, adding, “I believe in destiny.” For now, through Ms. Sheinbaum’s first year in office, destiny has been good for Ms. Henaine’s career. As the real president has delicately managed threats from President Trump and crises at home , Ms. Sheinbaum’s recent approval ratings reached as high as 79 percent . Ms. Henaine, 33, has seen her popularity explode, too. She is frequently mistaken on the street for the president. Millions have watched her social media videos impersonating Ms. Sheinbaum, and she recently launched a theatrical comedy about the president and Mr. Trump. Ms. Henaine calls her character Claudita, or Little Claudia. Describing herself an independent actress, she said she is not trying to provide a political boost to the president, though she said she admires her composure, intelligence and other attributes. Nor has Ms. Sheinbaum’s team or party ever paid her, she said, adding that she has also turned down requests to hawk products or brands as Claudita. Sometimes, people confusing her for the president lodge their civic complaints with Ms. Henaine, airing grievances about broken sidewalks or government funding. To differentiate herself from Ms. Sheinbaum in her private life, Ms. Henaine sometimes dyes her hair a little blond. Ms. Henaine also worries that, after so many years playing one person, she will be pigeonholed as an actress. Even though she was confident in her skills, she has been studying psychology as a backup career. “Also it’s part of the process of playing such a powerful, strong character, people blend you into the character,” she said. Ms. Henaine is much younger than Ms. Sheinbaum, 63, and the two aren’t related. But she looks so much like the president that she has teased her own mother about it. “I’m going to take a DNA test,” she said, “or I’m going to send Claudia my adoption letter.” Ms. Henaine’s career has progressed alongside that of Ms. Sheinbaum, who was a climate scientist before entering politics. Ms. Sheinbaum’s initial stint in government was as the environment minister of Mexico City, a role she was named to after her mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, became mayor in 2000. When he became president in 2018, she ran for election as Mexico City’s mayor and won. Ms. Henaine had long dreamed of becoming an actress. She attended the acting school of the Mexican television giant Televisa, and mostly performed in telenovelas, melodramas and theater. Until Ms. Sheinbaum’s mayoral campaign. It was then that producers of a well-known TV show, a political satire, spotted her and cast her as the rising politician. Ms. Henaine said it was the first time anyone had told her she bore a resemblance to Ms. Sheinbaum. Back then, Ms. Sheinbaum had curly hair, so Ms. Henaine wore a wig on the show, said Dulce López, one of the producers who tapped Ms. Henaine for the part. But in recent years, Ms. Sheinbaum has worn her hair straight, creating an “identical” resemblance, Ms. López said. Ms. Henaine played Ms. Sheinbaum for two years before the show ended, and it was then she started studying psychology. But the role came calling again in 2024, when Ms. Sheinbaum was running for president and Ms. Henaine was cast in a theater show spoofing the presidential debates. “I have something pending with this character,” she said. “I wanted to humanize her and the character that I created is that side of Claudia that maybe people don’t see.” To promote the show, Ms. Henaine posted comedic videos of herself meeting voters on a mock campaign trail , riding Mexico City’s public transportation and hanging out with an impersonator of Ms. Sheinbaum’s main competitor. Some videos garnered several million views. To sharpen her performance, Ms. Henaine studied countless videos of Ms. Sheinbaum. She said that Ms. Sheinbaum was more relaxed when she spoke as mayor but became more formal as a presidential candidate. She has met Ms. Sheinbaum three times, including during a real campaign event in which the two recited a campaign slogan, smiled and hugged. Video of that encounter has over 24 million views combined between TikTok and Instagram. Other prominent officials have met Ms. Henaine, too, including Mexico’s security minister and the head of Ms. Sheinbaum’s political party, Morena.. Both were surprised by the resemblance and recorded short videos with Claudita for her social media accounts. A spokesman for Ms. Sheinbaum did not respond to requests for comment about her professional look-alike. After Ms. Sheinbaum won the 2024 presidential election and a six-year term in a landslide, Ms. Henaine said she saw years’ ahead of work. Her new show is a riff on the president’s daily morning news conference — it’s called “The Morning Laughter” — and her relationship with Mr. Trump. Ms Henaine said her act is less about taking comedic jabs at Ms. Sheinbaum than an effort to laugh about politics more generally. “She’s the first woman to reach the presidency, and it’s a historic moment,” Ms. Henaine said. “There are going to be failures, there are going to be successes, and the system is what is criticized.” Ms. Sheinbaum has been invited to the show but has not attended. A few federal lawmakers from her political party have. But recently, with a few lines of makeup, her hair in a ponytail and wearing a traditional Mexican blouse, Ms. Henaine looked enough like Ms. Sheinbaum to confuse many during Mexico’s Independence Day celebrations. The main ceremony last month, attended by an announced 280,000 people, was the first led by a woman president in 215 years of Mexican history. Even when Ms. Henaine told people she was not the president, many snapped a photo with her anyway. Diana Puente, 32, had made a six-hour journey from her home state, San Luis Potosí, with her godmother and a friend to see Ms. Sheinbaum that night. She could not manage a photo with Ms. Sheinbaum, who presided over the event from the balcony of the national palace, so Ms. Henaine would have to do for now. “It’s the time for women,” Ms. Puente said. Mostly, Ms. Henaine said, she received positive reactions from Mexicans — a benefit of Ms. Sheinbaum’s popularity, especially when people mistake her identity. Hours before the Independence Day event, a man walked up to Ms. Henaine in the city’s main square and started an impassioned address to her. He lamented the verbal attacks she had received from her political opponents. He urged her to continue standing strong. And before he walked away, he added, “I’ll watch you later.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/mexico-president-sheinbaum-impersonator.html,World,BBC,By James Wagner and Luis Antonio Rojas,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/world/XXint-mexico-claudita-promo/XXint-mexico-claudita-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:00:38+00:00,ad698b9035a524572cd0afa1b2f3b1cdb41d37a9
f7c0434aad3e,Iran Lures Transgender Foreigners for Surgery but Forces Operations on Locals,"transgender, gay and lesbian;lgbt;lgbtq;gay;lesbian, surgery, gender, disesases;health;illness;medicine, islam, ruhollah khomeini, iran, tehran","For 40 years Iran has performed more gender transition surgeries than many other nations, largely a result of pressuring gay and gender-nonconforming citizens to undergo unwanted operations or risk the death penalty. Now, faced with an economy crippled by war and sanctions, the Islamic republic is promoting its expertise to a global audience, hoping to attract transgender foreigners with the promise of inexpensive surgeries packaged with luxury hotel stays and sightseeing tours. Desperate for foreign investment, Iran’s theocratic government has set a goal of generating more than $7 billion from medical tourism annually, according to Iranian state news media , about seven times as much as it earned last year. That objective has resulted in the proliferation of medical tourism companies, marketing not just nose jobs and hair transplants, but vaginoplasties, mastectomies and penis constructions through glossy English-language websites. “We handle everything from start to finish, providing the best medical services to ensure a stress-free experience,” said Farideh Najafi, the manager of two medical tourism companies, MabnaTrip and MedPalTrip. “This includes booking hotels, hospitals, transportation and more,” she said. Iran is one of the few places in the Muslim world that allows transgender people to seek gender-affirming care, and even subsidizes it. For many foreigners traveling to Iran for transition surgery, and indeed for many transgender Iranians, these operations can feel lifesaving. But the country’s reputation as a pioneer in the field belies the abusive history of the operations and the grim reality for most L.G.B.T.Q. people there. In Iran, gay men and lesbians can be punished by public flogging and the death penalty . As a result, the United Nations Human Rights Council found, many gay and lesbian Iranians who are not trans are “pressured into undergoing gender reassignment surgery without their free consent.” Still, the country’s cut-rate prices are drawing transgender individuals from as far away as Australia, the United States, Britain and Europe, according to medical tour operators and surgeons. Many more patients, they say, come from neighboring countries, like Iraq, where such treatments are strictly forbidden. “In the United States, the cost of surgery is around $45,000, and in Thailand, it’s approximately $30,000,” according to the website of one operator, IranMedTour. “However, the cost of gender confirmation surgery in Iran is lower, with prices less than $12,000.” Other companies advertise procedures at government hospitals for as low as $4,500. Sam, 32, a trans man from Orange County, Calif., is currently in Tehran to pursue a hysterectomy and metoidioplasty, a kind of penis-construction surgery. Requesting anonymity to discuss a sensitive medical procedure, he said he was drawn to Iran because he believed the doctors there were “more confident” than those in the United States. “The goal of these medical tours is probably to portray Iran as a paradise for trans people, which it isn’t,” said Saman Arastu, a transgender Iranian man and actor who chose to undergo so-called top and bottom surgeries. “In my opinion, these are nothing but a show. The situation for trans people is dire.” While precise figures are unknown, a report by the Home Office of Britain from 2022 found that roughly 4,000 people underwent transition surgery each year in Iran, a figure higher than the combined annual totals in Britain and France. Experts say a vast majority of patients come from inside Iran. Iran’s experience with transition surgery stems from a fatwa issued in the 1980s by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding supreme leader of the Islamic republic, who declared that transgender individuals could gain legal recognition of the gender with which they identified, but only on the condition that they underwent transition surgery. On the surface that policy inverts what many in the West expect from Iran, where gender norms are so strictly enforced that until recently women were punished for not wearing hijabs in public. But transgender Iranians and experts say the government’s embrace of surgery in no way correlates to advocacy for trans people. Iranians who do not adhere to traditional norms of masculinity and femininity — including trans people who do not want surgery — are subject to violence, extortion or are pressured into operations. “For the Islamic republic, being trans means you have to go through this surgery — from male to female, female to male,” said Zara Saeidzadeh of Orebro University in Sweden, a gender scholar who has spent a decade researching trans identity, with a focus on Iran. “If you identify as trans but don’t want to do any form of body modification, then you’re breaking the rules and you are going to be stigmatized and your life is threatened.” Raha Ajoudani, a 20-year-old trans woman and activist, made the opposite journey that many foreign tourists are making. She fled to Germany from Iran in 2024 to avoid a forced transition surgery and to escape state persecution for her activism. Ms. Ajoudani said that she was detained twice by the authorities in 2022, after an ex-boyfriend collaborated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, to facilitate her arrest. Her family, she added, is routinely hounded to get her to stop her activism. “I never wanted to undergo gender reassignment surgery,” Ms. Ajoudani said. “I’ve defined myself outside of this binary. I didn’t want to live according to the governmental definition of cultural expectations of being a woman or a man, nor did I submit to Khomeini’s fatwa.” Surgery is not a guarantee of acceptance or safety. Transgender people in Iran face murder and other forms of violence and harassment. The tour companies include language to assuage foreigners of those fears in their advertising materials. Amid glossy before-and-after photo illustrations of idealized pectorals and breasts, and copy that promises “budget-friendly” procedures, rapid visa approvals and help achieving “ a strong feeling of happiness and relief ,” the tour companies are also selling patients on what one calls Iran’s “ relatively progressive stance on transgender rights .” Ms. Najafi, the tour manager, conceded that some foreigners feared running afoul of the authorities or the locals, but said that patients traveling with her company had “never had any security issues.” Transition surgeries are complex operations with a questionable record of safety in Iran. Some activists have likened the country’s gender clinics to “ butcher ” shops. Saghi Ghahraman, who led the Iranian Queer Organization, said that while they believed treatment standards had improved, the change had come at a cost, as many gay people felt forced into operations that were like “experiments.” A U.N. report on transition surgeries in Iran from 2015 described botched procedures that led to complications like “severe bleeding, severe infection, scarring, chronic pain and abnormally shaped or located sexual organs.” Adding to the risks are some tour companies’ promises of rapid procedures, which experts said should involve months of planning. Some market stay timelines as short as one week. Dr. Shahryar Cohanzad, a urologist in Tehran who has performed around 300 transition surgeries, said the companies’ aim to perform as many procedures as quickly as possible was unsafe. “From what I know after 35 years of performing surgeries, it’s critical for the surgeon to spend as much time as possible with the patient,” he said. Eric, a 45-year-old trans man living in Canada who requested anonymity to protect himself and his family from reprisals, said he had sought treatment in Iran because it was cheap. But he acknowledged the tension in seeking treatment in a place where others have it forced on them. “I have heard a lot, especially among trans women, that because they are gay, and they cannot be gay in Iran, they try to do the surgery,” said Eric. “I’m really sad that gays and lesbians are not recognized in Iran, but on the other hand I’m happy for trans people because they can do what they’re willing to do.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/middleeast/iran-transgender-surgery.html,World,BBC,By Pranav Baskar and Leily Nikounazar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/world/00int-iran-transgender-surgery-05/00int-iran-transgender-surgery-05-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:00:27+00:00,9803fafa5061572f93640d5e2a3b93c2c08d3ebd
3775edf392d1,Cars to Fighter Jets: China’s New Export Curbs May Level a Heavy Blow Worldwide,"rare earths, ministry of commerce, international trade, cars, manufacturing, magnet, computer chip, china, us, europe","From cars and computer chips to tanks and fighter jets, China’s new export restrictions represent a sweeping effort to control global commerce and have set off a renewed trade fight that pits Beijing against not only the United States but also Europe. The new regulations, which take effect in stages on Nov. 8 and Dec. 1, apply to the entire world, sharply escalating China’s sway over critical manufacturing at a time of increased international fractures over trade. The restrictions led President Trump on Friday to threaten to impose new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese imports starting Nov. 1. The rules go far beyond China’s limits since April on the export of rare earth metals, which are mined and processed mainly in China , as well as magnets made from those metals. In a series of announcements on Thursday, China extended its restrictions to worldwide shipments of electric motors, computer chips and other devices that have become central to modern life and are now manufactured mainly in China. The regulations prohibit exports from China to any country of materials or components for use in military equipment. Among the items banned are the small yet powerful electric motors in missiles and fighter jets and the materials for crucial range finders in tanks and artillery that are used to zero in on distant targets. These rules have drawn particular concern in the West because of their potential to debilitate Europe’s efforts to supply arms to Ukraine and to rebuild Europe’s own militaries to counter Russian aggression. “We’ve entered into a new phase of the economic conflict,” said Jay Truesdale, who worked in the administration of President Barack Obama on critical mineral policies. He is now the chief executive of TD International, a global strategic advisory firm. Beijing’s decision to put a total ban on exports of materials for military use has geopolitical resonance in Europe. Countries there are racing to strengthen their military defenses from an increasingly aggressive Russia. Many armaments require rare earths and commodities from China. Chinese officials have vigorously opposed European Union tariffs on electric vehicles from China, and some experts saw the export controls as a fresh expression of Beijing’s pique. The raft of regulations means that companies not involved in arms manufacturing must obtain export licenses from China’s Ministry of Commerce to move products with Chinese content across any national borders around the world. The rules broaden the use of elaborate procedures requiring exporters to submit technical drawings of every product their customers want to manufacture with Chinese rare earths and describe how these products will move through global supply chains. After arms manufacturers, the global auto industry appears to be the second-most vulnerable sector, rare-earth industry specialists said. The thousands of companies that produce parts were already the hardest hit by China’s requirement in April that many kinds of rare earth magnets cannot leave the country without licenses. A single gasoline-powered car can have more than 40 different rare earth magnets inside electric motors that power the brakes, seats, steering, power windows and other systems. Electric cars have even more rare earth magnets, which are used to turn the wheels. American and European auto parts producers have encountered months of delays in obtaining these export licenses. China has started to issue licenses but the process has been slow and cumbersome, industry officials say. China has modeled its rare earth regulations on American rules for trade in a few of the world’s most powerful computer chips. But rare earths are more widely used. Many parts manufacturers have stopped assembling electric motors outside China with rare earth magnets from China, and now bypass Beijing’s rules by buying entire electric motors from China. But the latest regulations published by China’s Ministry of Commerce could prevent this workaround. The rules encompass almost any product in which rare earths make up 0.1 percent or more of the value. That means they cover not just magnets but also electric motors and even much bigger systems that have electric motors with rare earth magnets inside. The costliest components of car seats, for example, are the motors that adjust them. And the most expensive pieces in these motors are the rare earth magnets. The new rules apply to any shipments across national borders, not just in or out of China. European automakers, in particular, face a daunting task of seeking Chinese export licenses to move car parts within Europe. Many companies have recently tried to limit their dependence on China by buying rare earths and rare earth magnets from the few producers outside China. But Beijing’s latest regulations assert jurisdiction over much of this production as well. The rules also say that any rare earth-related products made outside of China but using Chinese technology are also covered by China’s export control rules. Rare earth refineries and magnet factories all over the world have been buying Chinese equipment for the past 20 years. Many equipment vendors in North America and Europe closed when most of the world’s rare earth mining shifted to China in the late 1990s.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/business/china-rare-earth-export-controls.html,Business,BBC,By Keith Bradsher,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/biz-china-export-controls-vmbg/biz-china-export-controls-vmbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T17:23:38.060000+00:00,02852daf2479b02897065c8c15000890cf04dad7
9cb68d9c730d,Black Unemployment Is Surging Again. This Time Is Different.,"minorities, black people;african american;african-american, income inequality, layoffs;furloughs, us politics, race and ethnicity, center on budget and policy priorities, economic policy institute, federal reserve, jerome powell, donald trump, us economy, financial planner, los angeles black worker center","Joblessness for Black workers is rising again, two years after reaching a record low. It’s a troubling indicator: Joblessness often spikes higher for historically marginalized groups during economic downturns, and takes longer to fall. This time, the Trump administration’s assault on diversity programs and cuts to the federal work force could make it even more difficult for Black workers to recover when conditions improve. The African American unemployment rate has surged over the past four months, from 6 to 7.5 percent, while the rate for white people ticked down slightly to 3.7 percent. On top of a slowing economy , the White House’s actions have disproportionately harmed Black workers , economists said. “I think the speed at which things have changed, in such a dramatic fashion, is out of the ordinary,” said Valerie Wilson, who directs the program on race, ethnicity and the economy at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. “There’s been such a rapid shift in policy, rather than something cyclical or structural about the economy.” At least since the 1970s, when the federal government started tracking unemployment by race, the rate for Black people has run about twice the rate for white people. Because of inferior educational opportunities, the legacy of mass incarceration and discrimination over generations, Black people confront greater challenges in the job market. A strong economy during President Trump’s first term created more jobs for Black workers , but many of them were lost when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in-person employment particularly hard. Generous public subsidies, though, cushioned the blow, and hiring rebounded quickly. “I was hoping that the commitment to investing in America, so that a broader set of Americans were actually receiving benefits in terms of low unemployment and higher wages, would continue,” said Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank focused on issues affecting Black Americans. He said he was particularly disappointed in large businesses that said they would support Black workers in response to protests for racial justice in 2020, only to pull back . Job losses are concentrated among Black women working in professional services such as human resources, according to Ms. Wilson’s analysis of federal data. A hiring freeze and mass layoffs in the federal work force, which have continued during the government shutdown and now exceed 200,000 , have also fallen disproportionately on Black workers. The hiring freeze is an impediment to young workers trying to get their foot in the door, too. “The federal government is one of those places people are able to get an entry-level job,” said Gbenga Ajilore, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which researches the social safety net. “That’s a whole industry that’s closed to new hires.” State and local governments have picked up some of the slack from federal agencies. But competition for those jobs has gotten tougher with more laid-off public-sector workers looking for positions. Sherri Marshall, 26, who graduated from the University of California, Davis, a few years ago with a degree in psychology, has worked in Los Angeles for a rental car company and a homeless shelter. But both let her go, and she is still looking for a position that would put her education to use. “It’s always like high-labor, low-paying jobs, nothing sustainable,” said Ms. Marshall, who works at a farmers’ market on the weekends and is building up a freelance social media marketing portfolio between filling out applications. “It’s harder for me to get more technical and higher-skilled jobs, despite being qualified.” Ms. Marshall recited her qualifications in a 30-second pitch during a job fair with city agencies last week at the Los Angeles Black Worker Center, where she also volunteers. The nonprofit has pushed local governments to hire more Black workers because unionized public-sector jobs have historically provided an on-ramp to stable employment. The federal backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion practices may be making it more difficult for Black workers to get hired in the private sector, too. Some of the strongest evidence for the efficacy of these practices, such as making sure to interview nonwhite candidates or reaching out to Black and Hispanic students, comes from federal contractors. In one of its first actions , the Trump administration ordered that group not to pursue racial equity anymore. Janel Belovette Jenkins, co-executive director of the Los Angeles Black Worker Center, tries to build relationships with employers who say they are swamped with applicants. “A lot of people get their jobs through networking,” Mx. Jenkins said. “Part of our role is to create the programs that will create the network that connects highly skilled, qualified workers to employers who might not have initially seen them.” Lower interest rates could offer some relief. Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote to Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, in early September demanding that the central bank take stronger action to support full employment for Black workers. Fed officials lowered rates later in the month for the first time this year and suggested that more cuts were likely. But Trump administration actions beyond work-force cuts and anti-D.E.I. policies could create additional hurdles for Black workers. The Department of Labor’s proposed rollback of minimum-wage and overtime protections for domestic workers, for example, would hurt their incomes. Home care aides for the elderly are overwhelmingly Black and Hispanic women. And despite Mr. Trump’s claim on the campaign trail that immigrants take jobs from Black people, rising joblessness among Black workers suggests that mass deportations of migrants haven’t arrested the trend. Brittany Alston, director of the Philly Black Worker Project, said expelling immigrants harmed the local economy in ways that hurt Black workers, too. “We know that an injury to one deeply is an injury to all,” Ms. Alston said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/business/economy/black-unemployment-federal-layoffs-diversity-initiatives.html,Business,BBC,By Lydia DePillis,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/00biz-black-unemployment-01-fkhv/00biz-black-unemployment-01-fkhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:01:00+00:00,dd474c72d5fd6060becb11fcd8f9579d4d2306f4
90d89ec422d5,What’s the Deal With All Those FanDuel Ads?,"gambling, advertising;marketing, personal profile;people story, regulation and deregulation, sports, management, consumer behaviour, computers and the internet, tech industry, customer service, black market, fanduel.com, flutter entertainment","It’s football season. Even if you don’t watch any of the games, you are probably aware because of all the sports betting ads blanketing television, podcasts, billboards and other aspects of daily life. Since sports betting became legal in America on a state-by-state basis in 2018, a crop of online sportsbooks have fought aggressively for attention. FanDuel, whose parent company is Flutter Entertainment, is the largest, with more than 40 percent of the market. Flutter, named after British slang for a small bet, is also the biggest online gambling company in the world, with brands like Britain’s Betfair, Ireland’s Paddy Power and Australia’s Sportsbet. It recorded 16 million average monthly users in its latest quarter. Last year, Flutter brought in $14 billion in revenue, a 19 percent jump from 2023. It expects double-digit growth to continue this year. Peter Jackson, Flutter’s chief executive since 2018, still sees room to grow in America, where big states like California and Texas bar online gambling. As more people become aware of the ease of betting on their phones, on any number of moments within games , there is a push by regulators and public health officials to rein in the industry. “People have and will always gamble,” Mr. Jackson, 49, said. “What we do is we offer a safe environment for people to do it.” And as for all those ads? They are not letting up, he said. This interview has been edited and condensed. How important is the N.F.L. season to FanDuel? The whole of September through to the end of the year is really big for us. It’s not just here in the U.S. where football starts. We get the N.B.A. tipoff in the middle of October as well. In our European businesses, you’ve got the soccer season going. Then in Australia, you’ve also got the big horse-racing festivals. People are seeing a lot of ads about sports betting. What differentiates FanDuel from the rest? With the FanDuel brand, we spend a billion dollars on advertising and promotions. Historically, a lot was focused on bringing to life the sports betting concept into the U.S., because it was relatively new. We’re not that many years into people being able to legally bet on sports, and still only half of Americans can do it today. But this year, we’ve slightly changed our tone. It’s really important that we start to distinguish our brand so people recognize how much better we are, and do a little bit less heavy lifting for the category and get a little more selfish. How many FanDuel commercials is too many Fan Duel commercials? This is the conundrum that we have around the world. At least we’re not advertising auto insurance. But those ads can be fun, with the skits. Our ads are fun. When we started out in the U.S., we were quite careful working with the leagues to try and make sure that we limited the amount of advertising slots for gaming businesses. There are some markets where you don’t have those constraints and it can be literally wall-to-wall gambling advertising. I don’t think that’s healthy. The equilibrium we’ve got here in the U.S. works well. Until more states open up to gambling, how else are you trying to grow? Remember that the state that we’ve been operating in the longest, New Jersey, started in 2018. There are many states that we have only been in for a year or two. In comparison with the U.K. or Australia, where we’ve been doing this for 20 years, the penetration rates are very low in America. Is it just a matter of time, or do you need to be proactive? People who are turning 25 this year and betting for the first time, or turning 21, depending on what the rules are in different places, are a whole new cohort that will become available to us. They’re more likely to have their phone in their hand while watching TV. You’ve got that natural tailwind of people who are digital-first consumers that will see natural growth. Tell me about the technology that sets odds, which I imagine you spend a lot of time thinking about. We have to get it right because, otherwise, people spot our weaknesses and they bet and it will cost us a lot of money. We have 650 people around the world who are proper, supersmart data scientists who build these models for us. We’ve got millions and millions of bets coming into the system, which we then are tracking and monitoring to help us determine whether our prices are accurate or not. We’re really a complex data business. Do you see more restrictions or regulations on betting on the horizon? We have to make sure that we work with regulators to improve the quality of regulation so it achieves the right outcomes, which is that people are safe and having enjoyment on the platform. One of the real challenges for us is how to deal with the black market. How do you stop people being two clicks away from the Wild West where no one cares how much they’re spending, how much time they’re on the platform? There is a growing body of research showing the harms of legal gambling, especially among young men. New Jersey recently moved to ban sports betting partnerships on college campuses. I can see how lawmakers will try and prevent that, because if you’ve got an unscrupulous business doing it, it causes problems for all of us . That’s why it is important we can advertise through digital channels and on TV, because I think that’s fair game. I don’t think people should be going to college campuses to sign up people. FanDuel recently announced a partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a prediction market platform . What’s the thinking there? The opportunity is to let our customers think about prediction markets in gold and what the S&P is going to do, or what the weather will be like in New York tomorrow. In other markets around the world, people will have a bet on who’s going to win “Survivor” or “The Masked Singer.” Lots of crazy things. Do you ever feel conflicted about being in a business that is associated with addiction? I’m really comfortable with what we do. We spend a lot of time and money making sure that our customers are betting for fun. We switch customers off our platform. We restrict the amount we let them deposit. We encourage them to have tools that manage their behavior. There are very, very few other categories that do any of those things. I’ve never seen a social media platform limit the amount of time I can spend on it. You’ve said that the market for sports betting in Britain is 20 years ahead of the United States. In Britain, more regulations have been introduced as awareness of gambling addiction has increased. Would you want to apply the same standards in the U.S.? You’ve got to remember the context of the country. There’d be uproar in America, the land of the free, if you brought in some of the “nanny state” rules and regulations that people in the U.K. have to put up with. Speaking of the U.K, you grew up in Yorkshire. Tell me about your upbringing. My dad was a car salesman, and my mom looked after my sister and I. How did your childhood shape your career path? If you sell cars to people, you have work on a Saturday. My dad was always very customer-focused because if you’re not you’re never going to sell a car. That’s definitely had a bearing on how I think about business. Looking back at that time, what else might relate to what you do now? My dad had a successful business selling cars, but he struggled to grow his business to multiple locations. He didn’t know how to leverage or change his management style, and he couldn’t ever let go. Let go in what way? When he opened a site down the road, it felt like he spent his entire time driving from one to the other because he had a fear of missing out on what was going on elsewhere. After graduation, you worked as a consultant. What was a pivotal moment during that time? One of the real “Sliding Doors” moments came when I met a guy called Adam Morgan, who wrote a book called “Eating the Big Fish.” Adam has a thesis about challenger brands, which are focused on delivering what customers want and will often attack the soft underbelly of incumbents who have forgotten what made them successful. It struck me when Adam was talking that I’d never want to work in an incumbent. OK, it’s time for the lightning round. What was the last bet you made? The last bet I made was for Grimsby Town, a team that is in the lowest league of soccer, who played Manchester United, one of the biggest teams in the world, to win, which was a huge upset. They won. Congrats. What tips do you have for this N.F.L. season? I’d like to tell people to bet against the Lions. Detroit won’t be happy about that. They cost us some money last season. Tell me about your “as good as it gets” moment in business. Ringing the New York Stock Exchange bell was pretty cool. It’s actually not a bell. It’s a buzzer, like a little doorbell. What’s your biggest pet peeve as a C.E.O.? I don’t like bureaucracy. How many direct reports is too many? I’ve probably got about eight. That’s a good number. How many hours do you sleep, and which hours do you sleep? I probably sleep six or seven hours a night. Get to bed at 11. Sleep till 5 or 6. How do you sign off to your emails? If I tell you this, then everyone will be able to copy me. Do you think they’re going to be phishing you? Yeah, people will phish. I normally just write “P.” I don’t think anyone’s going to phish you, or I hope no one phishes you. Well, they do try a lot. Really? My voice is in the public domain. People leave voice mails using an A.I. version of me. You and Taylor Swift are both dealing with deepfakes.

In recent weeks, the president has attacked the N.F.L. for choosing Bad Bunny , a rapper critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as its headlining performer at the Super Bowl in February, and criticized changes to the kickoff rules designed to reduce injuries. This summer, he threatened to delay a stadium deal for the Washington Commanders if they didn’t revert to their former name, which was considered offensive to many Native Americans. While no sports league wants to be caught in the president’s cross hairs, the league has learned from its past run-ins with Mr. Trump, like when he urged the owners to fire players who protested during the national anthem in 2017. This time around, the N.F.L. has tried as best it can to insulate itself from his attacks. In February, the Saints owner Gayle Benson invited the president to the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where he schmoozed with Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Commanders owner Josh Harris joined Mr. Goodell in the Oval Office, where they announced that the 2027 draft would be held in Washington, D.C. (Mr. Harris gave the president a team jersey, saying he was “the ultimate Commander. ”) Management of the president, in other words, has become one of their headaches. More than most sports leagues, the N.F.L. is a business driven by its owners, a group of almost entirely older white men, many of whom made billions in finance, oil and gas, and real estate before buying their teams and agreeing to share the league’s revenue as if they were members of a socialist commune. As a collective, they have a hand in most major decisions of consequence, decisions that are often made at the league’s quarterly meetings, which are held at exclusive hotels around the country like the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., or the Biltmore in Phoenix. Though the president won’t be on any official agenda when they gather at InterContinental Hotel in Midtown Manhattan a few blocks from the league’s headquarters, the owners may be briefed on the Super Bowl halftime show and other issues that involve the Trump administration, including the expansive alliance the league entered into with ESPN that requires regulatory approval. In any season, the league meetings reveal how the N.F.L. has become the country’s pre-eminent sports league: No matter how big the crisis, the league and its owners try to minimize distractions and keep the focus on the games that help the N.F.L. rake in more than $23 billion a year from media companies, sponsors and fans eager to be associated with it. And yet, for all the business imperatives, when they make their decisions inside their meetings, those owners are driven in part by their own highly personal alliances, friendships and beliefs about the league’s mission. This account is based on conversations with dozens of owners, team executives and N.F.L. officials, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal league business. The High School Cafeteria Many of the owners are creatures of habit and like to sit in the same place each time they meet. “The league meetings in the room were very much like a high school cafeteria,” said a former league lawyer, Frank Hawkins. The seating chart in effect serves as a proxy for their status and their beefs. Putting a small plaque with each owner’s name at their seats would have been simple. But until about a decade ago, no one did. So underlings raced to meeting rooms hours in advance to make sure their boss had his or her regular spot. Amy Trask was hired by the Los Angeles Raiders as a lawyer in 1987 — “a man’s job” in a man’s league — and she had her hands full dealing with the lawsuits her boss, the Raiders’ colorful owner, Al Davis, was involved in. But one task that she sweated more than most was ensuring that he got his favorite spot at owners meetings: the last seat at the table to the commissioner’s right so he could swing his chair around to the head of the table and get a full view of the meeting in front of him. It also made it easier to grab a cup of coffee. “I would get there at 5 in the morning and sneak through the kitchen to put our names on chairs,” Ms. Trask said. These days, John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers — two third-generation owners whose families are close — sit near each other. For years, Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys sat next to his close ally, Dan Snyder, until Mr. Snyder sold the Washington Commanders in 2023. They led the bloc of owners that pushed for faster revenue growth. The owners who inherited their franchises — the Rooneys in Pittsburgh, the Maras in New York, among others — tend to view their job as that of a trustee. Newer, wealthier owners — Stephen Ross of the Miami Dolphins (a real estate fortune), David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers (hedge fund money) — are often focused more on maximizing their investments. The newer owners are often methodical in their decisions, made after significant research by the league staff and internal deliberation. In years past, the league had more maverick owners, like Mr. Davis or Hugh Culverhouse of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were far less wealthy and took more outlandish positions. Several newer owners who paid billions, not millions, for their clubs pushed the league to loosen its rules to allow private equity firms to buy minority stakes in N.F.L. teams. They have been eager to reopen negotiations with the league’s network partners to secure even more lucrative rights deals that could also drive up the cost for fans wanting to watch N.F.L. games. When new owners join the league, where they will sit — literally and metaphorically — is a matter of importance. Mr. Snyder approached Shahid Khan soon after Mr. Khan used the fortune he had made in the car bumper and headlight business to buy the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011. Mr. Snyder, who had visited Mr. Khan’s yacht in the South of France years before, wanted Mr. Khan to sit with him and Mr. Jones. “You need to hang with us or otherwise they’re going to screw you,” Mr. Snyder said, without specifying how Mr. Khan might get screwed. Mr. Khan instead followed the only advice Wayne Weaver, the Jaguars’ previous owner, gave him: Continue to sit in the front row of the middle table. Mr. Weaver didn’t say why, but Mr. Khan learned over time that the seat was near the New England Patriots and Cowboys, which gave him access to the two most powerful owners in the room. The Power Centers Robert Kraft of the Patriots is among the most connected owners in the league, leading the powerful media committee, which helps negotiate broadcasting rights deals, the N.F.L.’s largest source of revenue. He has a chameleon-like ability to work with all sides. He talks with Mr. Goodell so frequently that he has been dubbed the “shadow commissioner,” and has known Mr. Trump for decades. In March, he contacted the president to help Brad Karp, chairman of the law firm Paul Weiss, reach a settlement with the White House after the president targeted high-profile firms with punitive executive orders. These days, Mr. Kraft goes in and out of the meetings, mostly attending discussions of topics he cares about. Jonathan Kraft, the oldest of Mr. Kraft’s four sons, often represents the team. When the elder Mr. Kraft is there, he plucks away at his iPad, surfing the web, but “there’s no question who’s No. 1 — it’s Robert,” Mr. Khan said. Mr. Jones speaks — and sometimes shouts — more than anyone else. Though he can take time making his point, as the ultimate alpha male with the most valuable team, he is given a wide berth. “Where he’s going to go and how long he is going to ramble, no one knows,” Mr. Khan said. “I mean, he definitely has a hall pass.” Mr. Jones, though, has also pushed his fellow owners to the limit. On one conference call with the six owners on the compensation committee who were trying to give Mr. Goodell a big pay raise, Mr. Jones said he had hired David Boies , the famous antitrust lawyer, because he was thinking of suing everyone on the committee. According to an owner on the call, within an instant, the only sound on the line was the click-click-click of the other owners hanging up. The Los Angeles Move Meetings can get intense. The 2016 special meeting to vote on whether the St. Louis Rams or the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers would be allowed to move to Los Angeles was so critical that the Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who was rarely seen in N.F.L. circles, attended. Initially, there appeared to be more votes in favor of the Chargers-Raiders bid, but not the 24 needed to pass. However, the Rams’ presentation, made by the team’s top executive, Kevin Demoff, with lobbying by Mr. Jones, persuaded some owners to switch their votes. Mr. Allen, who had an oracle-like reputation, also backed the Rams proposal. But the Rams didn’t have 24, either, so Mr. Jones persuaded the commissioner to switch to secret ballots so owners could set aside their loyalties and vote more freely. (He also asked for a drinks cart to help lubricate the discussion.) The gambit worked. Not long after, the owners voted 30 to 2 to grant the Rams the right to move to Los Angeles. The choice was seismic. The Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, who led the stadium committee and favored the Chargers-Raiders stadium proposal, felt betrayed by his friends and stopped going to league meetings. He sold his team two years later. The Chargers owner Dean Spanos limped back to San Diego to beg for taxpayer funding, but since he had shown a willingness to leave once, voters rejected a ballot measure to pay for a new stadium. He exercised his option to move in with the Rams in Los Angeles, where the Chargers are overshadowed by many other teams. The owners abandoned longtime fans in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego, where lawmakers had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on stadiums and improvements for the teams. The City and County of St. Louis sued the N.F.L., claiming it had abandoned its own relocation guidelines to help the Rams owner E. Stanley Kroenke move to Los Angeles. They won a $790 million settlement . But the owners got what they wanted: a return to Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest media market, where the Rams built a $5 billion stadium that could host Super Bowls. (And did, in 2022.) Exit Snyder Sometimes, the owners make news just before they enter the room. In 2022, they were wrestling with how to get Mr. Snyder to sell his scandal-plagued Commanders. Mr. Goodell had fined the team $10 million after an investigation uncovered sexual harassment in the front office. During his more than two decades in the league, Mr. Snyder was abrasive and his teams performed poorly. But the owners were wary of forcing him to sell, because that might trigger lawsuits and set a precedent for other owners. The Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay wasn’t intimidated. In October that year, he arrived 45 minutes late to the meeting in New York. He stopped at the rope where reporters were standing. With little prompting, he launched into a speech on why Mr. Snyder should be out of the league, a sentiment the owners shared but would not say on the record. The other owners read Mr. Irsay’s comments on Twitter while they were in the meeting. This was the beginning of the end for Mr. Snyder. Two weeks later, he announced he had hired bankers to find a potential buyer. Less than a year later, Mr. Snyder sold his team for a record $6 billion to a group led by Mr. Harris, a private equity billionaire, who now sits near Mr. Jones at the quarterly meetings.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/business/nfl-owners-trump.html,Business,BBC,By Ken Belson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/business/05NFL-excerpt-illo/05NFL-excerpt-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:10.572000+00:00,fe3268e92c6ba6e6c3957355589137134965294b
d7b2bccc689e,Searching for Meaning in the Gold Rally,"stocks;bonds, gold","Gold prices are behaving like we’re on the brink of a financial crisis. The safe haven asset hit $4,000 an ounce for the first time this week, recording its largest rally since the late 1970s. Investors from retail to pension funds spent $9.3 billion on exchange traded funds linked to gold last month, according to Morningstar Direct. But the investor anxiety that often fuels a gold rush seems to be missing from the rest of the market. Often when gold soars, stocks drop. For example, as the price of gold soared more than 600 percent from 1970 to 1979, when adjusted for inflation, the S&P 500 sank 11 percent. A similar pattern appeared during the Great Recession, when gold rose 37 percent from January 2008 to December 2009 while the S&P 500 nose-dived 23 percent. By contrast, as gold was taking off this week, the S&P 500 recorded a high on Wednesday. Signs of crisis were also absent from bond markets and the U.S. dollar: Long-term U.S. bond yields have been relatively flat and the dollar’s value has been stable the past few months after a dip following President Trump’s tariffs announcement in April. Joe Davis, the global chief economist of Vanguard, told DealBook the discrepancy between the stock market and gold is “almost unprecedented.” So what’s going on? Davis said investors seem to be reading the economy in “dramatically different” ways. The pessimists For a big bet on gold to pay off, Davis said, more than one big thing would have to go very wrong: A.I., which has fueled the stock market’s growth, would prove a dud; the equity markets wouldn’t find other growth avenues to offset that A.I. dip; there would be a flight from U.S. Treasury assets, creating pressure on the dollar; and the Federal Reserve would abandon its fight against inflation, perhaps because of a loss of independence. Holding gold can be expensive, as Warren Buffett once warned , because it doesn’t produce any income. (“If you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end,” is how he put it.) Some mainstream investors are betting on the asset nonetheless. Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, said at a conference on Tuesday that gold is safer than the U.S. dollar. He recommended that investors allocate up to 15 percent of their financial portfolios to gold (a significant change from the 60/40 stock and bond portfolio split traditional financial advisers provide). Morgan Stanley recently suggested a 60/20/20 portfolio split, with bonds and gold equally weighted. “Gold is now the anti-fragile asset to own rather than Treasuries,” Mike Wilson, chief investment officer at the bank, said at the Reuters Global Markets Forum. Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel Securities, summed up the pessimistic view at another conference on Monday : He said many gold buyers think, “I now view gold as a safe harbor asset in a way that the dollar used to be viewed.” The optimists Another investor perspective is that, despite economic risks like the ballooning debt of the U.S. and E.U., advances in A.I. will keep the economy hot, offsetting any threats. “A lot of people, including a lot of big money, are confident in that more optimistic scenario,” said Ryan Chahrour, an economics professor at Cornell. Also, Fear of Missing Out “Financial markets are like fashion,” said Robin Brooks, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It’s like bell-bottom jeans are back.” Whether investors and money managers are primarily pessimistic, optimistic or just afraid of missing out, it’s hard to tell how much of the gold rally is about their sentiment at all: Central banks around the world have been stocking up on bullion for years to protect themselves against the possibility of Western sanctions and political uncertainty. For now, economists and investors alike are in a game of wait and see. “Somebody’s going to be right eventually,” said Chahrour. “So either the financial markets are slow to adapt to the new circumstances, or the run-up in gold will be temporary.” IN CASE YOU MISSED IT The White House said layoffs of federal workers have begun. After weeks of threats to cull the federal work force during the government shutdown, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that the “RIFs have begun.” As of Friday, Republicans and Democrats did not appear to be closer to a resolution that could reopen the government. Unions representing federal workers pre-emptively challenged the legality of mass firings during a shutdown. Trump threatened a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports. Stocks sank on Friday after Trump threatened to cancel a meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and to raise levies in retaliation for new export restrictions China put on its rare earth minerals this week. The Trump administration moved forward with its bailout of Argentina. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that the U.S. had directly bought Argentine pesos and completed the terms of a $20 billion lifeline . The move came as a big relief for investors and money managers who have made big bets on the country, like BlackRock, but drew political blowback for the Trump administration. María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader , who built a movement to challenge the country’s authoritarian president, has been in hiding since last year. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” The founder with $0 of venture capital — and $1 billion in annual revenue A.I. giants are spending billions to build and deploy their large language models, and a significant portion of that cash is going to companies that help train them by annotating data and providing human feedback. Meta valued one of those services, Scale AI, at $29 billion when it made a deal to acquire a 49 percent stake in June, according to the start-up. Surge AI, a competitor, has kept a quieter profile. The company says it’s generating more than a billion dollars of annual revenue — before taking any outside capital. DealBook’s Niko Gallogly talked with the founder of Surge AI, Edwin Chen, about the role humans play in building artificial intelligence and staying lean in Silicon Valley. The interview was edited and condensed for clarity. You hire people to help train A.I. models. What are they doing on a typical day? One of the newer paradigms for training A.I. is what we call reinforcement learning environments. Think of it like a Sims game, where you have a simulation of the real world. Let’s say you are a doctor whom we’ve hired to help train A.I. models. In the Sims game, there might be a patient with a history of complications who needs a diagnosis. The A.I. “doctor” simulates all the tools needed to find a diagnosis, and then the real world doctor is basically measuring whether the A.I. model is right or not. If it gets it right, there’s nothing for the A.I. to learn. If it gets it wrong, the real world doctor is going to teach the A.I. the right answer. We are seeing start-ups like Surge driving high revenue with few employees, in part by outsourcing work to A.I. You have around 100 full-time employees, although you also rely on a large pool of independent contractors. Sam Altman predicted that we’ll soon see a company make $1 billion in revenue with just a founder. Do you believe that? Yeah, absolutely. I just see how much the A.I. models are getting better and better, and we play a very critical role in that. Some of the work that we are doing involves training an A.I. model to basically be a C.E.O., to be a lead software engineer who not just takes tasks and completes them but is correctly coming up with the right problems to solve. In a very real sense, it’s something that we are helping produce. How will that affect venture capital? Will start-ups rely less on venture funding? Even today, companies raise way more venture capital than they should. There’s a Silicon Valley mind-set where it becomes the default. People will see more and more companies like us, which can succeed over other V.C.-backed companies that have raised billions of dollars Do you expect more companies will wait to raise at a later stage through private financing or debt? I think it will be a much more serious consideration whether it’s even worth spending all this time raising at all. A lot of founders say, “My entire job is fund-raising.” In what world does that make sense? Your job as a founder should be using your actual product, seeing if you actually like it, seeing if it’s good or bad, talking to your user to see how you could improve it. Surge’s mission is to build A.G.I., or artificial general intelligence. How are you thinking about mitigating the risks ? We really care about making sure that A.I. is aligned with human values and making sure that A.I. is trained with the right objectives. A.I. models today, they’re really smart. But we want to make sure they have street smarts. The way you get that is by training your models on the right objectives. You’re not spending all your time optimizing for leader boards and hacking benchmarks. Instead, you’re optimizing for the messiness of the real world. Quiz: The sales of a showgirl Taylor Swift’s 12th album of new material, “The Life of a Showgirl,” set a record this week for opening week sales numbers, surpassing the equivalent of 3.5 million copies sold in just five days, according to the tracking firm Luminate. Ben Sisario, who reports on the music industry for The Times, wrote that the album’s huge commercial success “shows how physical media formats like CDs and vinyl LPs remain key to the success of top albums even now, when streaming accounts for about 82 percent of revenues from recorded music sales in the United States.” About 1.2 million copies of Swift’s album were sold on vinyl. Physical copies were sold in at least 27 configurations that included vinyl, CDs, cassettes — and in one case, a sweater. The album release began with a “release party” with the premiere of a music video and other behind-the-scenes segments in movie theaters and drew $33 million in box office sales. Which album previously held the record for opening week sales? A. Whitney Houston’s “The Bodyguard” (1992) B. ‘N Sync’s “No Strings Attached” (2000) C. Adelle’s “25” (2015) D.

Matthew Palm’s side hustle is signing up for credit cards. Every few months, Mr. Palm, a 57-year-old freelance television producer who lives in Illinois, goes online and applies for a new credit card. He opens only cards that come with a sign-up bonus: a reward of a few hundred dollars in points for new customers who reach a modest spending target. “The highest point of anxiety is when you click the submit button for your latest card application,” he said. “And then, as soon as it’s approved, there’s that adrenaline hit.” Each sign-up bonus is small, so to make a decent income, Mr. Palm keeps applying. During the seven years he has been into this side hustle, he estimates, he and his wife have opened more than 50 cards. The promotional bonuses have netted his family more than $40,000, he said. Mr. Palm is a member of what is known as the churning community — people who regularly open credit cards to harvest lucrative promotional rewards. The churning logic is simple: Hundreds of credit cards come with sign-up bonuses. So why not apply for as many cards as possible? Mr. Palm doesn’t consider himself an extreme churner. While he has opened more than 50 cards over seven years, he knows of others who open 20 cards annually. Some people have been at it for decades. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

In Macau, New York Times business reporter Tania Ganguli reveals the behind-the-scenes stakeholders who orchestrated the league’s return. I’m in Macau, the gambling capital of the world. I’m here for the NBA’s return to China for the last six years, there haven’t been any NBA games here. looking at these big banners that are draped over buildings. Reminds me of being back here in 2019. the players were sitting in their hotel and they could see workers tearing those same types of banners down, peeling their faces off the building. A few days before, the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, had sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong. Well, this made the Chinese government very upset. The NBA backed him. We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression. And then chaos enveloped. That whole week. Sponsors pulled out. And a lot of the players were worried about if they would even be allowed to go home if things got worse. It was it was that surreal. they lost about $400 million. Just from that one situation The Chinese market is huge for the NBA. There are a lot of basketball fans here…. and the league has been working on cultivating them for decades. And so coming here to Macao and playing a game in China again is a very big deal for the league. when you ask anybody with the league how did these games come together? The name that they mentioned is Patrick Dumont. He’s a top executive with the Sands Casino. And owner of the Dallas Mavericks. in 2021, the Chinese government was renegotiating what’s called concessions with the casinos here in Macau. In those concession agreements, the government required that the casinos spend a certain amount on non-gaming activities like entertainment, like sports. And Sands had this arena at the Venetian, so Dumont saw bringing the NBA here as an opportunity to satisfy that requirement. One of the other main players here was Joe Sy, the owner of the Brooklyn Nets. Joe tsai is the chairman of Alibaba Group, which is a Chinese tech giant. he has a lot of deep ties to the Chinese government, the nets, and spent a lot of time over the last few years meeting with Chinese officials, having events that celebrate Chinese culture. they have spoken to Chinese media outlets and said, this market is so important to us. We care about this market more than any other NBA team. They even launched a reality show. That’s a dance team competition to choose dancers for their games here in Macao Sound up: “The brooklyn nets will find the best dancers in china” There’s a tremendous amount at stake for these teams because. The league saw what happened when something went wrong and they lost this market even briefly. there is a feeling that this has to go right, and that this is a big opportunity to get back something that they lost.

c03b461e2023,How China Powers Its Electric Cars and High-Speed Trains,"china, national energy administration, electric power, solar energy, wind power, renewable energy, electric cars and hybrids, climate change;global warming, guquan","Power ⚡︎ Moves How China Powers Its Electric Cars and High-Speed Trains By Keith Bradsher Photographs by Gilles Sabrié Reporting from Guquan, China 阅读简体中文版 閱讀繁體中文版 In China, the longest ultrahigh-voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City. The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui Province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers. That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines cause small electric shocks that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole. “As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air-conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a six-inch fish he had just caught. China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about. But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions , far from most of its people and factories. More than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid. Beijing’s central planners, having underestimated the country’s swift adoption of solar and wind energy, are building the world’s first nationwide grid of ultrahigh-voltage power transmission lines. Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Trump’s “ Drill, baby, drill ” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy. In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers. Even before Mr. Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles. Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries. China’s more efficient power lines have broad consequences for the global race against climate change. They will help determine how quickly China can reduce its world-leading use of coal, a stain on the country’s clean energy track record. China uses as much coal as the entire rest of the world, and emits more greenhouse gases than the United States and the European Union combined. The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule. The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared. “State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai. In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated. “To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year. China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes. The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than seven million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households. To put the scale of China’s power grid build out in perspective, consider that the United States has a handful of 765-kilovolt lines and a few running at 500 kilovolts or less, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research group. The 765-kilovolt lines together total about 2,000 miles — the length of a single line across China. The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades. The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time. In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas. Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41 percent since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy. Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away. China’s ultrahigh-voltage network has helped the country limit its dependence on imported oil and natural gas, but it has also created new vulnerabilities. Much of northwestern China, where many of the lines are being built, is mountainous. As a result, lines had to be closely bunched as they hug a single, flood-prone tributary of the Yellow River that passes between earthquake-prone mountain ranges from Dunhuang to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines. China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information and intolerance for public dissent. Some villagers in Anhui Province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction. The line carries mostly solar and wind energy, as well as some coal-fired power, from the Gurbantünggüt Desert in Xinjiang. It helps supply electricity to big eastern Chinese cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing. Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, expressed concern. “When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.” The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Mr. Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by. Mr. Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.” Li You contributed research.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/business/china-electric-grid.html,Business,BBC,By Keith Bradsher and Gilles Sabrié,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index-facebookJumbo-v6.jpg,2025-10-11T04:00:08+00:00,0b1cfe8fc945c7f8fa799a62ab6cea8405a9952d
4c625aae47cd,Stocks Fall Sharply on Trump’s Renewed Threat of China Tariffs,"sp 500, stocks;bonds, tariff, international trade, donald trump, china","The stock market slumped to its worst one-day showing since tariffs roiled markets in April, as the specter of the trade war returned between Beijing and Washington. The S&P 500 dipped 2.7 percent for the first time in six months, and the Nasdaq Composite also fell by the most it has since April, when President Trump’s tariff plans for dozens of countries spooked markets. Mr. Trump on Friday threatened to impose more tariffs on Chinese imports after its government put curbs on the export of rare earth materials, vital to a host of industries, including the production of valuable chips used in artificial intelligence. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” Friday’s decline was the first time in two months that the S&P 500 had fallen more than one percent. Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent. U.S. oil prices fell more than 4 percent on Friday to less than $59 a barrel, their lowest level since May. Drilling activity could slow further if prices remain at that level for long because most domestic producers need oil prices to be above $60 a barrel to drill new wells profitably. The stock market was already on edge this month, after five straight months of gains had lifted prices to record levels, prompting some investors to warn of the potential for a pullback. The drop on Friday remained fairly modest, with the S&P 500 still less than 3 percent from its record high. After trading had ended for the day, Mr. Trump ratcheted up tensions further, threatening a 100 percent tariff on all goods from China. “Is this the start of a Liberation Day Two?” asked Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, in an emailed note to clients on Friday afternoon.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/stock-market-trump-tariffs.html,Business,BBC,By Joe Rennison and Rebecca F.

d85c596bf5d8,Student Loan Cancellation Is Restarting for Some Federal Borrowers,"personal finance, student loan, us department of education, donald trump","Thousands of federal student loan borrowers have received some welcome news: Now that they’ve made payments for at least 20 years, their remaining balances will be erased. After a halt this year, the Trump administration has resumed loan forgiveness for borrowers enrolled in a program known as Income-Based Repayment , an income-driven repayment plan that ties borrowers’ monthly payment amount to their income and household size. After they make payments for 20 to 25 years, any remaining balances are forgiven. “This is really significant because for months they have not canceled any loans under any income-driven repayment plan,” said Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group. Borrowers who have reached the payment threshold don’t have to do anything, but should receive a notice with more information about when the loan discharge will be processed. (They can opt out before Oct. 21, though it’s unlikely many will.) In one recent email notice, the Education Department said that it would notify servicers after Oct. 21 about the borrowers’ status and that most remaining balances would disappear within two weeks, though processing could take longer for others. Many borrowers had been anxiously hoping to hear something before the end of the year. This is because canceled student debt is usually taxed as income, but a temporary tax break made loan discharges from 2021 to 2025 exempt from federal taxation (though some states may apply their own taxes). Still, loan experts have said they would expect borrowers who have reached the number of qualifying payments in 2025 to be eligible for the tax break, even if the cancellation was processed later. If a borrower hasn’t yet received a notification, it may still be coming. The discharge notices are expected to roll out in batches, though it’s unclear how many have already gone out, or how long it will take for all qualifying borrowers to be notified. The Education Department did not respond to requests seeking comment given the government shutdown. I.B.R., which first became available in July 2009, has more than two million borrowers enrolled, according to recent data from the Federal Student Aid office, but not all of them will have crossed the payment count threshold. Enrolled borrowers with loans made after July 1, 2014, must make 240 payments, while those with loans taken before that must make 300 payments. “If you’ve hit 300 and haven’t heard anything yet, that doesn’t mean you’ve been skipped — just that you’re not in the first wave,” Stanley Tate, a consumer lawyer who specializes in student loans, said in a newsletter to borrowers. The Student Loan Servicing Alliance, the trade group for the companies that administer the loans and collect payments, confirmed the effort was underway. It was unclear if the temporary shutdown of the federal government would cause delays. While the loan servicers are still working, they can process discharges only after they receive instructions from the Education Department. Millions of other borrowers enrolled in other income-driven plans are still blocked from cancellation, a development that can be traced back to Republican-led legal challenges filed last year against the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment program. A related court ruling this year temporarily barred forgiveness in the SAVE program, which the Education Department has interpreted to also block loan discharges in other longstanding income-driven plans that are based on the same legal authority, including Income Contingent Repayment (I.C.R.) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE). I.B.R. wasn’t subject to the same treatment because it was created by Congress. But I.B.R. loan cancellation had been temporarily halted while the Education Department updated its systems to accurately count payments not affected by the court’s order, the department said. Last month , the American Federation for Teachers asked the courts to compel the Education Department to process loan discharges for borrowers who had made enough qualifying requirements. Individuals in blocked plans — SAVE, PAYE and I.C.R. — who have made the requisite payments under I.B.R. rules (240 or 300, depending on which version of I.B.R. they are eligible for) may want to consider transferring to that plan soon. That may help them avoid the so-called tax-bomb that’s coming back next year. But some borrowers may hit yet another obstacle. “While Congress made all borrowers eligible for I.B.R. this summer, the Education Department has not yet implemented this legal change, meaning at least some borrowers who should be eligible for I.B.R. now are being denied when they try to switch in,” said Abby Shafroth, the director of Student Loan Borrower Assistance at the National Consumer Law Center. If you are still receiving monthly bills even though you believe you have made enough payments to receive a loan discharge, it’s probably wise to continue making them for now — the Education Department had said it would reimburse those who overpaid. But if the monthly payments are causing financial distress, borrowers can call their loan servicer and ask for a forbearance, which will pause payments but keep your account in good standing while you wait for your discharge notice.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/student-loan-forgiveness-ibr.html,Business,BBC,By Tara Siegel Bernard,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Biz-IBR-Forgiveness-zgtq/10Biz-IBR-Forgiveness-zgtq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T18:49:57+00:00,78f8d39ebdd9a9d2c0c524c24900d56d59dbab0f
e578c050f959,Trump Announces a Deal on Drug Prices With AstraZeneca,"price, pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, us politics, health insurance, medicaid, tariff, international trade, us foreign policy, astrazeneca, pfizer, donald trump, pascal soriot, britain, eu","President Trump on Friday announced a deal with the British drugmaker AstraZeneca to lower drug prices, his second pact with a major pharmaceutical company in an effort to make prescription drugs more affordable. Under the deal, AstraZeneca agreed to sell its drugs to Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income Americans, at about the same prices that it offers to wealthy countries in Europe. The agreement, along with one with Pfizer last week , is the product of a Trumpian brand of horse-trading. For months, the president has threatened to impose tariffs on imported medicines , demanding that drug companies lower prices and bring manufacturing back to the United States. Drugmakers have been eager to find ways to dodge much more aggressive action that could cut deeply into their profits. The nation’s top health officials publicly acknowledged on Friday that Mr. Trump’s tariff threats were the leverage needed to persuade powerful drug companies to expand and build new U.S. plants as well. “Now, I’m not sure that Pascal would like to say — but behind the scenes, he did say, tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Mr. Trump said, referring to AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, who stood beside him at Friday’s announcement in the Oval Office. AstraZeneca and Pfizer both revealed that their new pricing arrangements with the White House guaranteed them a three-year reprieve from any tariffs the Trump administration would impose on the products they produced overseas. The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent on brand-name drugs from the European Union and 100 percent from other parts of the world, but it has delayed those from a deadline of Oct. 1. Still, it is unclear whether Mr. Trump’s deals would significantly lower Medicaid’s drug prices. In many cases, the prices that Medicaid pays are already similar to those in Europe, experts said. And the AstraZeneca agreement involves only a small share of the company’s U.S. sales. At his Oval Office news briefing, Mr. Trump promised, without evidence, “We’re going to bring drug prices down at numbers that nobody ever thought possible.” He spoke of delivering seemingly impossible price reductions, such as a “654 percent discount” on Bevespi Aerosphere, an AstraZeneca inhaler for patients with respiratory problems. “For too long, America has shouldered a disproportionate portion of the world’s R.&D. costs,” Mr. Soriot said, referring to research and development. “That imbalance is not sustainable. It had to change.” The two deals so far do not affect the bulk of prescription drug coverage. AstraZeneca made no commitment to lower prices for drugs it currently sells for U.S. employers, insurers and other government programs like Medicare, which shoulder most of the costs of drugs in the United States. Brand-name drug prices in the United States are three times as high , on average, as those in peer nations. But the disparities vary across types of insurance. Drugmakers already give Medicaid lower prices than other payers in the United States because of discounts that are required under federal law. People on Medicaid already pay almost nothing in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes. In some states, people with Medicaid have no out-of-pocket costs. The voluntary approach stands in contrast with Mr. Trump’s first term, when he tried to mandate lower drug prices through regulation and other forms of formal public policy. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. secured legislation to regulate drug prices in Medicare. The new deals are occurring while Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have been wrangling with Democrats over whether to extend Obamacare subsidies that help cover the costs of health insurance for more than 20 million Americans. Democrats have seized on the issue as a way of criticizing the Trump administration for raising Americans’ health care costs. Mr. Trump has argued that his deals over drug prices will help more consumers. At Friday’s event, officials touted a website, TrumpRx.gov , which would help patients use their own money to buy drugs, sidestepping insurance. The online drugstore would act as a landing page to send American patients to direct-sales websites offered by various drugmakers. Officials put up a promotional version of the website on Friday and said it would be up and running next year. Mr. Trump said the TrumpRx name had not been his idea. AstraZeneca recently set up a website that will be part of TrumpRx where patients can use their own money to buy several of the company’s drugs. It include Farxiga, for diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure; Airsupra, an asthma inhaler; and FluMist, a nasal flu vaccine recently authorized for home use . The company plans to expand the website to include other primary care drugs. That website may be helpful in certain circumstances , but most insured patients pay less in out-of-pocket costs than they would pay for the drugs directly. For example, some patients can buy a month’s supply of Farxiga for $182 on AstraZeneca’s site, while their co-payment may be only $25 if they use insurance. In both the United States and Europe, drug prices are determined through negotiations. The talks between drug companies and representatives for payers result in confidential discounts that lower the final price that European countries and American employers and government programs pay for a medicine. Administration officials have been floating the idea that for newly introduced drugs, drugmakers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca would match their U.S. and European prices even after those confidential discounts were taken into account. The Trump administration did not explain how that would work. As a practical matter, it is nearly impossible for a drugmaker to commit to doing that. A key reason that European governments receive bigger discounts is that they are more willing to walk away from negotiations if a price is too high, denying their citizens coverage of that medication. In July, Mr. Trump sent letters to 17 of the largest drugmakers , including AstraZeneca, asking them to lower some of their prices. Like other large multinational drugmakers, AstraZeneca has long had a presence in the United States, its most important market . The company has moved recently to strengthen those ties. AstraZeneca already makes most of the products it sells in the American market in the United States. In July, AstraZeneca said it planned to spend $50 billion over the next five years building and expanding factories and research facilities in the United States. On Thursday, the company held a groundbreaking ceremony for one of those manufacturing investments, at a site in Virginia that it said would help manufacture drugs for cancer, weight loss and blood pressure. AstraZeneca said last week that it planned to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange next year, though it will remain headquartered in Britain and listed in London and Stockholm. Legislation passed during the Biden administration has allowed Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over the prices of a small number of prescription drugs each year. The companies challenged the law in court, but lost, and the first round of discounts will go into effect next year. In the Oval Office event, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the health secretary, said the savings from the program had been disappointing. In an event on Monday at the Aspen Institute, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he expected a series of similar announcements from drug companies in the coming weeks. He praised the voluntary nature of these deals over more official forms of policymaking that would have most likely prompted legal challenges from the industry. “All these are opportunities for us to re-envision the way the government normally works, not based on litigation, slowing everything down, but by leapfrogging litigation, if possible, to get people to do what they probably want to do,” he said. At the event, he also suggested that the TrumpRx website may be useful to Americans who become uninsured under work requirements for Medicaid that were passed into law this summer. “We should have some mechanism to give you access to pharmaceuticals at the best prices possible,” he said of that group. “TrumpRx and other tools may be helpful.” The Trump administration may not have foreclosed the possibility of more aggressive regulatory approaches to lowering drug prices, too. Two notices have recently appeared on government websites indicating that rules linking U.S. drug prices to overseas targets may be forthcoming.

de71403c9ad9,Shein Chose Paris for Its First Boutique. Paris Isn’t Pleased.,"retail, fashion, civil unrest, e commerce, shein, anne hidalgo, paris france","The sixth floor of Paris’s iconic BHV Marais department store, with its sweeping rooftop views toward the Eiffel Tower, is one of the most coveted retail spots in the city. It is also now the focus of an uproar over the Chinese e-commerce giant Shein, which is setting up its first physical boutique atop the fashion capital of the world. The news that Shein’s ultracheap knockoffs, from pink miniskirts to black berets, would be moving beyond online retail and into brick-and-mortar stores has unified politicians and fashionistas in anger and given steam to an effort by French lawmakers to halt its continued online expansion as well. The Paris boutique is set to open on Nov. 1, and Shein is planning to open stores in five other French cities, a move that it promotes as an “homage” to France and its role in fashion. But the company’s charm offensive has worn thin. On Friday, employees at BHV Marais quit their cash registers for a few hours and gathered outside to protest the opening of a 1,000-square-meter space for Shein. Many denounced what they said was the incursion into France of a low-cost Chinese competitor that used cheap labor and violated environmental and human rights standards in making its clothes. “Shein goes against our beliefs,” said one employee, who, like others in the crowd, declined to give her name, citing privacy concerns. “We have always been a beautiful store with beautiful brands, and we try to promote corporate social responsibility.” Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, did not hold back. “Paris denounces the establishment of Shein, a symbol of fast fashion, at BHV Marais,” she declared in a LinkedIn post this week. The historic department store, known as the Bazar de l’Hôtel de Ville, was built as a bustling market hall in 1856. An online petition calling for Shein to be barred from opening at BHV Marais gained nearly 100,000 signatures in a week. Shein did not respond to requests for comment. In France, as elsewhere, Shein has seduced consumers by offering a head-spinning variety of cheap-chic clothing with free shipping direct from factories in China. At a time when France is facing economic austerity , political upheaval and stubborn inflation, the label has positioned itself as an affordable alternative to expensive French brands. But as Shein has grown, so have questions about its practices . The company has been accused of working with suppliers that violate labor laws and of failing to make full disclosures about factory conditions. Shein has repeatedly said that it conducts regular internal audits and that it has a strict compliance code for its suppliers. The Trump administration recently cracked down on Shein’s mail-in model in the United States by closing a loophole that allowed low-value goods to be shipped duty-free. European capitals are also moving to charge Shein and Temu, another Chinese fast-fashion retailer, for small packages until aEuropean Union-wide tax goes into effect in a year. France, home to Chanel, Dior and other high-fashion brands, has gone further. Just before Paris Fashion Week opened in September, the French Senate passed a so-called anti-Shein measure that would add taxes of up to 10 euros per garment purchased from Chinese online platforms like Temu and Shein and require the companies to report the environmental effect of their clothing. The legislation, which still needs final approval, would also ban the companies’ ads in France and penalize influencers who promoted them. France’s antitrust watchdog fined Shein €40 million for “unfair commercial practices” in July, accusing it after a yearlong investigation of promoting misleading advertising discounts. Shein has been pushing back. To stoke visibility, Shein opened its first pop-up store in the Marais district of central Paris during Fashion Week, drawing throngs. A French influencer, Magali Berdah, collaborated with Shein on a series of TikTok videos in which she interviewed young French shoppers gushing over Shein’s affordable fashion, while warning that new fees would put such goodies out of reach. “This tax will not make fashion more responsible,” Ms. Berdah says in one video, referring to the Senate bill. “It will simply make it less accessible.” “By choosing France as the place to trial physical retail, we are honoring its position as a key fashion capital and embracing its spirit of creativity and excellence,” Donald Tang, the executive chairman of Shein, said in a statement. French bureaucrats, bankers and fashion brands are maintaining a united front. This week they continued to move with startling swiftness to curb the incursion, which French officials say has been made possible by a wealthy French family-owned real estate empire, the Société des Grands Magasins, or SGM. That group operates BHV Marais and Galeries Lafayette, an iconic French department store with locations in numerous French cities. Recently, it struck a deal allowing Shein to operate out of stores bearing the Galeries Lafayette name in Paris, Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges. SGM has been trying to buy the BHV Marais building outright. But this week, France’s state-owned bank, which had been negotiating with SGM to finance a joint purchase of the property, pulled out over the Shein partnership. A spokesman for SGM said Shein was “committed to complying with all European standards, just like any other supplier.” “Shein wants to take advantage of this transaction to adapt its current production model to European requirements,” he added. Inside BHV Marais, French specialty brands are leaving the department store in protest, including the Aime and Talm organic skin care lines, Culture Vintage and Le Slip Francais, a lingerie brand. “Our collective choices are building the future of our industry,” Mathilde Lacombe, the president of Aime, said on LinkedIn . “Who is joining us?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/shein-retail-store-paris-backlash.html,Business,BBC,By Liz Alderman and Ségolène Le Stradic,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10biz-paris-shein-vlgw/10biz-paris-shein-vlgw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T18:06:58+00:00,fe610591d3371558c95b88eb6921d22fb49f9935
b08ab21033b0,An Immense Solar Project Just Got Canceled Under Trump,"nextera energy, solar energy, climate change;global warming, land use, blm, interior department, invenergy, nevada","An enormous solar power project in the Nevada desert that would have been one of the world’s largest has been canceled, according to the Interior Department. The reason for the cancellation was not immediately clear. But the project appeared to be the latest casualty of the Trump administration’s efforts to thwart the construction of solar and wind energy projects on millions of acres of public lands, predominantly in the American West. The project, known as Esmeralda 7, would have comprised a sprawling network of solar panels and batteries across 118,000 acres of federally owned land in the Nevada desert northwest of Las Vegas. It was expected to produce up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power nearly two million homes. The developers of the project included NextEra Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, and Invenergy, a company that builds solar and wind farms as well as natural gas plants and battery storage systems. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management quietly updated its webpage on the project’s permitting process late Thursday to reflect the cancellation. The webpage did not provide additional information. Alyse Sharpe, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in a Friday email that Esmeralda 7 consisted of seven separate solar projects and that the developers could still seek permits for each individual project. But restarting the permitting process, which was already in its late stages, could lead to significant delays. Neil Nissan, a spokesman for NextEra, said in an email that the utility was “committed” to its portion of the project and would work with the Interior Department. The cancellation caused concern on Capitol Hill, where Nevada lawmakers and clean energy lobbyists said they were scrambling to find out details. “The Trump Administration’s lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement, adding that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum should “clarify the administration’s actions soon.” The move comes as the Trump administration has taken a rapid-fire series of steps to slow or stop the construction of renewable energy projects on public and private lands across the country. The Interior Department is now requiring dozens of formerly routine approvals for wind and solar projects to undergo new layers of political review by the interior secretary’s office, a policy that is causing significant permitting delays. The agency is also opening investigations into bird deaths caused by wind farms and withdrawing millions of acres of federal waters previously available for leasing by offshore wind companies. In addition, the Interior Department has ordered work to stop on several wind farms off the coast of New England. Last month, however, a federal judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could restart work on one of these projects, a $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is 80 percent complete. At the same time, the Trump administration has continued to approve permits for new oil and gas drilling and to encourage coal mining. The burning of fossil fuels is a main driver of climate change. During the ongoing government shutdown, the Interior Department has designated employees who process oil drilling permits as essential, enabling them to keep working while other workers are furloughed. Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada, a Republican, sent a letter to Mr. Burgum in August expressing concern about the new layers of political review for solar and wind projects. He wrote that the additional scrutiny could “prevent or unnecessarily delay energy development in the state that is poised to help meet the growing energy demands of the mining industry and data centers.” Representatives for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Esmeralda 7 had advanced through the permitting process under the Biden administration, which prioritized clean energy development as part of its ambitious climate agenda. But after President Trump took office, the Bureau of Land Management declined to release a final environmental impact statement, the next step in the process to approve the project. NextEra was among the companies that donated at least $5 million to fund the construction of Mr. Trump’s $200 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, CBS News reported . Another one of the utility’s large solar projects in Nevada, known as Dodge Flat II, was still listed as “in progress” on the Bureau of Land Management website on Friday. Rebecca F.

fd9dce4e6989,Trump Says Federal Layoffs Have Begun During Government Shutdown,"layoffs;furloughs, civil service, closings, federal budget, us politics, donald trump, russell t. vought","President Trump said on Friday that his administration had started a new round of federal layoffs, as he seized on the government shutdown to cull the civil work force and pressure Democrats into accepting his fiscal demands. The layoffs appeared to target more than 4,000 employees across seven major federal departments, according to the administration, which revealed its plans in a filing to a federal court that is considering the legality of the cuts. That filing also hinted at the possibility of additional dismissals if the closure in Washington continues. The Trump administration said it had targeted more than 1,400 employees at the Treasury Department, and nearly 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, where notices started to reach some workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by late Friday. The administration also proceeded with layoffs at the Commerce Department, the Education Department, the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the court filing, which indicated that the cuts at many of those agencies would range into the hundreds. By seeking to oust civil servants during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Speaking in the Oval Office on Friday, the president blamed Democrats, as he estimated that “a lot” of workers would be affected and asserted the layoffs would be “Democrat-oriented.” The comments illustrated anew the ways in which Mr. Trump has come to embrace the shutdown as a political opportunity, one that may allow him to rearrange the federal budget and exact revenge on his enemies. He has also halted tens of billions of dollars in federal aid to cities and states run by Democrats, while party leaders in Washington refuse to fund the government absent a deal to extend a set of expiring health insurance subsidies. Unions representing federal workers quickly denounced the attempted firings as illegal and blasted the Trump administration for trying to use the government’s work force as a bargaining chip in a political feud. The labor groups, which had sued to block the layoffs before the shutdown began, urged a federal judge on Friday to render a decision swiftly. “It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions suing the administration. Under its published guidelines , the government typically must give workers 60 days’ notice before a layoff, though the timeline may be reduced to 30 days in certain exceptions. In some cases, though, it was not clear whether federal agencies had sent layoff notices on Friday to specific employees, or whether they had rather identified programs and offices that they would look to cut soon. Many Democrats and even one Republican — Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chamber’s lead appropriator — condemned the administration for the timing and scope of its attempted firings. In a statement, Ms. Collins blamed Democrats for the shutdown but said that laying off federal workers could “cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.” “Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,” she said. The administration’s renewed threats capped a day of confusion and fear for many federal workers, hundreds of thousands of whom are already furloughed and still others who must continue to work without pay. Mr. Trump’s planned layoffs could further decimate that civilian work force, which is already expected to employ 300,000 fewer people by the end of December compared with January, officials have said. The staggering decline is a direct result of Mr. Trump, who has presided over an aggressive and legally contested effort to shrink the bureaucracy, including through mass layoffs and induced retirements. Throughout the day, the White House repeatedly declined to answer questions about the strategy, scope and timing of any planned cuts. Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said only in a social media post that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to the reduction-in-force notices to federal employees about pending dismissals. That left federal workers to piece together the fate of their own jobs when many may not even have access to their government email. At the Environmental Protection Agency, employees received notice that a round of layoffs would soon arrive. A message reviewed by The New York Times from Steven Cook, the principal deputy assistant administrator of the E.P.A.’s Office of Land and Emergency Management, said employees there and in two other offices would learn within 60 days whether they would lose their jobs. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that terminations would fall on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which helps protect against threats to the country’s election system, power grids and water utilities. And the Education Department — a major target of Mr. Trump’s cuts to date — appeared poised to shed workers at its Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, according to union leaders. The planned layoffs there, like many on Friday, appeared to mirror the sort of changes that Mr. Trump had envisioned as part of his 2026 budget submission to Congress. The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began on Oct. 1. In a memo last month, the president’s budget aides essentially argued that a lapse in funding would mean that the government no longer needed to retain some of its workers. The Trump administration even appeared to issue guidance that allowed officials producing termination notices to work throughout the federal stoppage, a status typically reserved for the most vital employees, including military service members. Union officials later contested those actions in federal court, arguing they were a violation of federal law, which restricts the government during a shutdown to select activities meant to protect life and national security. This week, a judge in that case ordered the Trump administration to respond by Friday evening, at which point the government unfurled the additional details about its layoff plans. An initial hearing is scheduled on Wednesday. In their reply, lawyers for the Trump administration defended the president’s power to conduct the mass federal terminations. But they also issued a veiled threat, noting that these and other agencies are “considering whether to conduct” additional layoffs in the coming days. Unions responded hours later, telling the court that they had evidence to believe that the Trump administration had misled the court over the timing and scope of its layoffs. Labor groups said they had evidence showing that the Department of Health and Human Services, in particular, “is requiring its employees to work over the weekend” to send layoff notices at the C.D.C. Mr. Trump’s pursuit of mass layoffs seemed only to widen the political chasm between the White House and congressional Democrats, possibly prolonging a shutdown with lawmakers having left Washington for the weekend. “Let’s be blunt: Nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a statement. “They don’t have to do it; they want to. They’re callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.” Democrats continue to reject a Republican plan to reopen federal agencies into next month as they seek to extend a set of expiring subsidies that help millions of Americans afford health insurance. Many Democrats have also expressed fear that Mr. Trump would not honor any spending deal that they struck, given the myriad ways that the president has tried to circumvent Congress to rearrange the budget. “I think to their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, told reporters earlier on Friday. But, he added, that could soon change. “That’s what a shutdown does,” Mr. Thune said. “You put the administration and this presidency in a position where you have to make some hard decisions.” Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Madeleine Ngo, Sarah Mervosh, Eileen Sullivan, Lisa Friedman and Alan Rappeport.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/federal-layoffs-government-shutdown.html,Business,BBC,By Tony Romm,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10dc-layoffs-tfpb/10dc-layoffs-tfpb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:49:19+00:00,c24dd5d63aeb6a41e67882a97c95ab8b8a347400
7bba591af947,Billions of Dollars ‘Vanished’: Low-Profile Bankruptcy Rings Alarms on Wall Street,"debt, bankruptcy, banking and finance, private equity, cars, first brands, blackrock, jefferies group, ubs","When First Brands, an auto-parts maker, filed for bankruptcy late last month, it was not the sort of event that would typically draw attention in the world’s financial capitals. A midsize manufacturer of pumps, filters and other under-the-hood products sold at retailers like AutoZone and Walmart, the company had expanded in recent years and had, it would appear, simply grown too quickly. But now, the company is at the center of swirling milieu on Wall Street and beyond over the loans that fueled its rise and the questionable accounting, some of its creditors say, that preceded the fall. Some well-known firms in international finance have been swept up in the fallout from company’s collapse, in some combination of losses, finger-pointing and embarrassment at having missed the signs of danger. That group includes Jefferies, the New York investment bank that arranged much of First Brands’ financing; UBS, the Swiss bank that provided a big chunk of the money; and BlackRock, which funneled money to an intermediary that lent it to the company. The total losses are expected to tally into the billions of dollars, according to Texas bankruptcy court filings and people involved in the negotiations over what comes next. This week, a representative of one of the company’s creditors said in a court filing that as much as $2.3 billion of assets had “simply vanished.” But it is not solely the sum of the potential losses that has so many financiers on edge. Many of the loans to First Brands originated from the booming, loosely regulated world of “ private credit .” Unlike traditional banks, private credit lenders say, they have the ability to lend quickly because they understand complicated, risky businesses and do not need to worry about repaying ordinary depositors or reporting public earnings. Trillions of dollars have been plowed into private credit over the past decade, principally from pension funds, endowments and other groups that rely on such investments to fulfill obligations to retirees and the like. The Trump administration made moves this summer to allow 401(k) plans to invest savings into the private equity funds that extend private credit to companies, raising the stakes even further. The First Brands bankruptcy could amount to something of an I-told-you-so moment for the traditional bankers and private-credit skeptics who have long maintained that these upstart lenders deserve more scrutiny. Before its unraveling, First Brands was seen as a success story. Founded by Patrick James, a Malaysian-born businessman, the Cleveland company expanded rapidly over the past decade by buying 15 competitors, including brands such as FRAM (air and oil filters) and Autolite (spark plugs). First Brands sells most of its products directly to the public on five continents and the rest to carmakers, which sell them under their own names. It says that it employs 26,000 people and that its sales totaled $5 billion last year. A First Brands spokesman wouldn’t name the cars that include its components, but one hint in its bankruptcy filing is that the credit arms of Ford Motor and General Motors are among the companies it owes money. A General Motors spokeswoman said the company was monitoring the situation but did not anticipate any “material interruption to our operations.” To pay for its acquisitions and inventory, First Brands borrowed heavily. It did so both in the open and in harder-to-trace ways, filings show, or both “on” and “off” its balance sheet of financial accounting. On First Brands’ balance sheet was $6 billion of junk-rated debt, or loans the company took out at high interest rates in traditional fashion. This is neither unusual nor noteworthy on Wall Street. Nor did it raise many immediate concerns when the company this summer hired Jefferies, the investment bank, to help it renegotiate the debt’s terms for more time to pay back the loans. During that process, however, First Brands’ lenders began asking for more information on the company’s finances — and discovered that the auto-parts maker had a few billion dollars in “off balance sheet” debt. The lenders now say in court filings that those hadn’t been fully disclosed and involved a complicated loop of legal entities and overlapping promises of repayment to various private-credit firms, including several part-owned by Jefferies itself. Already, creditors say, they have uncovered trouble with First Brands’ use of invoices to borrow money. In this form of financing, which is not uncommon, lenders provide money that is meant to be repaid when specific retailers send in checks for First Brand products. The idea is that this is a short-term, relatively low-risk arrangement so long as the retailer pays the invoice in a timely fashion. The problem was that First Brands had pledged money from the same invoices to multiple lenders, essentially double or triple counting what it expected its customers to be paying, according to the bankruptcy filings. Because these arrangements were held off the company’s balance sheet, creditors say they were not aware that the same invoices were pledged more than once. Last month, with questions mounting, First Brands’ efforts to refinance its debt fell apart, and the company filed for bankruptcy not long after. The company said that it had less than $30 million left in its coffers and that there was nothing left in the accounts that were supposed to hold the collateral for the off balance sheet loans. “There’s just a lot that we don’t know, to put it bluntly,” a lawyer for some of the firm’s creditors told the bankruptcy court this month. The same lawyer called First Brands’ financial structure a “black box.” The interest in the company’s issues, which were earlier reported by The Financial Times, has been intense. During the first bankruptcy hearing, held remotely from Houston, the judge said there were 500 people listening in and asked that callers combine into single lines so that the court’s software could fit them all in. During that hearing, a lawyer for the company and Mr. James blamed, among other factors, President Trump’s tariffs for First Brands’ woes, saying they “caused additional landing costs for goods.” The lawyer said her clients generally denied any wrongdoing and attributed the company’s demise to “macroeconomic factors and headwinds that were outside of management’s control.” Dozens of private credit lenders and hedge funds say they are out money. Private funds run by UBS say they are owed more than $500 million. BlackRock is also owed a sum that it hasn’t yet specified. Other lesser-known investors in private credit such as CarVal and Ellington Management Group are also in the queue. Hardest hit for now is Jefferies. One of its asset management subsidiaries, Point Bonita Capital, had lent $715 million to First Brands to supply inventory to retailers like Walmart and Advance Auto Parts. The bank said in a statement that it hadn’t been paid for those loans since Sept. 15, and First Brands’ representatives have told the bankruptcy court that they are investigating whether that money was already sent to a different lender to satisfy another loan. Jefferies’ stock has dropped 17 percent this week. A spokesman, Joseph Ziemer, said the bank’s potential exposure had been “dramatically overstated by many.” Questions now turn to whether other auto-parts companies may also face troubles. First Brands’ trouble “leads me to believe there are other suppliers that may also be at risk,” Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, said Friday.

8537361f7aaa,The Fiscal Gambit at the Center of the Shutdown,"federal budget, closings, tax cuts and jobs act, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, obamacare;affordable care act;aca, health insurance, us economy, us politics, democrats, republicans, house of representatives, congress, senate, congress","A political party with total control of Washington wants to put more money back in the pockets of Americans. Doing so is expensive, and so the lawmakers vote to put a new policy in place for only a few years to hold down the cost. The hope is that once it is actually set to end, even lawmakers who initially opposed the policy will want it to continue, fearful of taking a benefit away from voters. Sound familiar? This is the strategy at the heart of the government shutdown. Democrats used it when they passed expanded health insurance subsidies three years ago, scheduling the benefits to expire this year so they had to pay for them only temporarily. Now they want the subsidies continued as part of a deal to reopen the government. It is a tactic with a long history. Republicans have repeatedly used it to transform what were initially temporary tax cuts into permanent reductions in government revenue. Indeed, much of the nation’s current fiscal predicament is a result of lawmakers’ hesitation to let policies expire as scheduled. “This has been going on steadily,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a former Republican budget aide. “You back the expiration up against an election, and if you’re not in power, you force the other party to deal with it or suffer negative consequences.” “This is designed for games of chicken and a standoff,” he added, “and we’re living through that now.” Republicans pioneered the modern approach under President George W. Bush, when the party passed sweeping tax cuts and scheduled them to expire a few years later. When the tax cuts were set to end during the Obama administration, Democrats, nervous about letting taxes go up, struck a deal to permanently continue them. The next time Republicans had full control of Washington, in 2017, they again cut taxes only temporarily so that the cost estimates at the time would be lower. Taxes for many Americans would have returned to higher rates at the end of this year if Republicans had not passed a sweeping law this summer making many of the 2017 cuts permanent. “As a tactic, it’s been immensely successful,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that seeks lower deficits. “This game of limping along and pretending in fake expirations with the expectation that they will get extended anyway has been utilized in numerous ways.” With the health insurance subsidies now at issue, Democrats are trying to put the tactic toward their own purposes. The subsidies — an expansion of tax credits available to people who buy their own health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act — were enacted in 2021. At the time, Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, and the party approved the subsidies for only one year at first before extending them through 2025. Many Democrats would have supported passing the health insurance subsidies for the longer term, but the party was also trying to reduce the recorded cost of the overall piece of legislation. So the 2022 law, the Inflation Reduction Act, created the cliff that lawmakers are now facing, which threatens to raise insurance premiums by more than 100 percent for the average consumer in the Affordable Care Act market. “What the Democrats did on the Affordable Care Act subsidies is a smaller-scale version of what Republicans have done both in 2017 and 2001, 2003,” said Aviva Aron-Dine, who worked on tax policy for the Biden administration. Republicans have blasted Democrats for insisting that they will support government funding only if it includes extending the health care subsidies. Yet some G.O.P. lawmakers also seem wary of letting health care costs skyrocket in a midterm election year. Republicans in the House and Senate have signaled support for extending the insurance subsidies. But it is not inevitable that lawmakers will extend an expiring policy, even if failing to do so raises costs or claws back a benefit for many Americans. Under the Biden administration, for example, Democrats had also approved a temporary, one-year expansion of the child tax credit . The policy sent monthly checks to many American families with children, helping to significantly reduce child poverty in the United States. But continuing the larger child tax credit was expensive, and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a pivotal vote, opposed continuing such a huge outlay. The benefit ended after one year without any visible political backlash. Given that history, Ms. Aron-Dine said it was still unclear whether the current attempt on health care would pan out. “If the theory was that you could run this play on policies targeting health care for moderate and middle-income people, the jury is still out on whether it’s going to work,” she said. It is this risk that prompted Republicans to make many of the 2017 tax cuts permanent this year, rather than extending them only temporarily. Achieving that meant bypassing a decades-old rule in Washington that barred lawmakers from increasing the deficit over the long term without bipartisan support. To do so, Republicans argued that extending the existing tax cuts should not be counted as a new cost to the budget, even if the tax cuts had been scheduled to end. Republicans used this accounting gimmick to wipe away the $3.8 trillion cost of keeping the tax cuts over 10 years, roughly 10 times the $350 billion cost of extending the health insurance subsidies over a decade. At the same time, they also piled on a set of new tax cuts, including Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime. But the new cuts are temporary, with several of them set to end in 2028, setting up another political fight over expiring policies that could raise costs for many Americans in just a few more years. “This is a damaging way to make policy,” said Doug Elmendorf, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the former dean of the Harvard Kennedy School. “It makes the true costs somewhat hidden when policies are being discussed, and it makes projections of the federal budget misleading in important ways. And so we would be better off if our elected leaders would honestly face and discuss the cost of the policies they are proposing.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/politics/shutdown-government-funding-health-insurance.html,Business,BBC,By Andrew Duehren,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10dc-fiscalgame-01-tjbl/10dc-fiscalgame-01-tjbl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T14:01:16+00:00,fc0be988ab330f892c7129bbc27689f1fad7f095
2f449b79a498,Fintech Start-Ups and Investment Firms Are Battling Over Your 401(k),"pensions and retirement plans, asset allocation, 401k, financial planner, service content, retirement, personal finance, consumer protection, fidelity investments","For years, employees with workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s were largely expected to choose investments from a menu provided by the investment companies hired by their employer and then manage the investments on their own. But now, upstart financial technology firms are connecting outside financial advisers to employer-sponsored plans, allowing the advisers to take steps like rebalancing accounts on behalf of their clients. At least one investment company is resisting the financial tech firms’ moves. And both employees and the outside advisers are finding themselves caught in a tug of war over who can manage these retirement accounts and how they do it. Fidelity Investments, the country’s biggest 401(k) administrator, has been warning investors in these plans that they may lose online access to their accounts, and that it could even void certain customer protections, if they share their online credentials with firms offering such tools. One investor who was temporarily locked out of his account at Fidelity was Kelly Havins, 63, a grocery brand consultant in Phoenix. Mr. Havins said he had hired a financial adviser who offers 401(k) management through a service provided by a technology firm called Pontera. “I don’t have the time or the understanding” to manage investments, he said. In late August, Mr. Havins received a letter from Fidelity, saying that because he had shared his login with an outside provider, he had to contact the company to reset his credentials — or risk being barred from online access to his 401(k). “I was surprised,” Mr. Havins said. “I thought it was a scam.” On Sept. 4, with a deadline for losing access approaching, he called Fidelity. “They said, ‘We have to make sure it’s you,’” he recalled, and asked him to email a copy of his driver’s license. He declined. “I said: ‘I’m not comfortable with that. You know who I am,’” Mr. Havins said. “And they said, ‘Consider yourself locked out.’” The next day, he said, he was unable to log into his account. He was eventually able to reset his credentials and regain access with the help of his financial adviser. But his account could be flagged again. Many affected plan participants who contacted Fidelity to reset their credentials said they were unaware they had shared them, Fidelity said. What’s different about the new 401(k) digital access tools? Some earlier digital tools, like Fidelity’s eMoney financial planning software, gave advisers “read only” access to workplace plans, allowing them to simply view data. Pontera and a handful of competitors go further, providing digital tools that allow advisers to take action within the 401(k), like rebalancing accounts to make sure investments reflect the client’s goals and comfort with risk. Investment advisers say the access is significant because it allows them to better coordinate holdings in workplace plans with a client’s other investments when deciding how to allocate funds. That helps make sure the client does not have too much invested in stocks, for instance. Pontera promotes its service to advisers, who invite their clients to connect their accounts to Pontera’s platform via a screen at the office or an email. The advisers can’t see or gain access to the credentials, which are held by Pontera; its system taps into Fidelity to carry out the adviser’s instructions. Pontera charges the advisers a fee on the assets managed through its platform “Pontera has been a game changer,” said Carl Szasz, founder of Verde Capital Management in Clarkston, Mich. Because he is a fiduciary — meaning he must act in his clients’ best interests — he wants to include his clients’ workplace accounts in their financial management plan, he said. “I want to be able to act and do my job.” The employer-based retirement market is vast. Americans held $13 trillion in all employer-based plans, including $9.3 trillion in 401(k) plans, according to midyear data from the Investment Company Institute. What do workplace retirement plan administrators think of the tools? Fidelity, with more than 24 million plan participants in some 25,000 corporate plans, is wary of some of the new tools. The retirement giant had been warning for nearly a year that it would move to bar certain fintech firms from its employer-sponsored accounts because the firms tap into the accounts with user names and passwords shared with them by investors working with their clients. “Credential sharing presents security risks to our customers,” Fidelity said in September 2024, “particularly when it enables third parties to take high-risk actions, such as executing trades within the account.” Fidelity recently began making good on that warning, cutting off online access to savers if they shared their credentials with digital tools that gave their advisers access to their accounts. Mr. Szasz said about 190 of his firm’s clients with accounts at Fidelity were disconnected. Some have been able to reconnect, but others have not. “They’re stopping people from accessing their own accounts,” he said. “We’re stuck in the middle.” He noted that Fidelity offered financial advisement through its own network, so it might have an incentive to limit access by outside advisers. Fidelity said in an email that its efforts to require participants to update their credentials weren’t focusing on whether third-party advisers should have access to a participant’s account. “We are focused on how some advisers are gaining such access by using customer credentials,” it said. Other 401(k) administrators seem comfortable with Pontera. The firm, for instance, recently announced a “collaboration” with Manulife John Hancock Retirement. “We’ve done our due diligence,” said Wayne Park, the retirement firm’s chief executive, adding that “their security is up to our standards.” Having a secure digital connection, he said, is superior to old-school alternatives, like having clients deliver stacks of paper statements to their advisers. Do the new tools comply with financial regulations? Pontera says its model, in which investors authorize it to act as their agent, fits into various regulatory frameworks, including Securities and Exchange Commission guidance on how financial advisers may gain access to workplace accounts. Advisers working with Pontera don’t have access to a client’s login credentials — that is managed by Pontera — and they can’t withdraw or transfer funds or change beneficiaries, steps that would signal they had taken “custody” of the account. “Consumers have rights to ask that an agent perform an action for them,” Zachary Pardes, a Pontera spokesman, said in an email. “This is not a gray area.” Yoav Zurel, Pontera’s chief executive, said, “This is what customers want, and it’s their money.” Asked for comment, the S.E.C. press office sent an email on Wednesday saying it was unable to respond because of the government shutdown. Competing firms provide similar services but operate differently. Absolute Capital of Pittsburgh also helps financial advisers manage their clients’ workplace retirement plans. But it has formal agreements with retirement plan custodians so when it taps into a customer’s 401(k), the plan knows it is Absolute Capital. (With Pontera’s model, the firm is logging in as the client.) “We come in through the front door,” said Brenden Gebben, the company’s chief executive. “We’re recognized as the authorized agent.” Some state regulators, who generally oversee smaller advisory firms, have raised concerns, including those in Colorado . Some other states, like Rhode Island, have said using the tools is acceptable as long as advisers discuss them with clients and act in keeping with their fiduciary duties. Pontera acknowledged that it did not have a formal data-sharing agreement with Fidelity, but maintained that it wasn’t required to have one, in part because plan participants grant the firm access to their information. Pontera says client credentials are stored in a digital “vault” and protected by multiple layers of encryption. Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said Fidelity’s concerns about cybersecurity were “legitimate” because Pontera had access to its accounts without a software gateway, known as an API connection. So it’s possible Pontera could gain access to information beyond what the client intends. Pontera said that a year ago, it offered to create an API and customize its access to Fidelity accounts, but that Fidelity had not responded to its request. Why would someone want an outside adviser to manage a 401(k)? Traditionally, 401(k) and similar defined contribution plans were largely off limits to financial advisers until the employee left the company or retired. The plans first became widely available in the 1980s, and early versions generally offered a limited menu of mutual funds. The addition of target-date funds, intended to automatically become less risky as an investor’s retirement approaches, further simplified options. But in recent years, 401(k) plan offerings have become more complex, and some investors need more help to stay on track for retirement, advisers argue. Some plans now offer the option to invest in riskier alternative investments , like cryptocurrency and gold. And menus have expanded. Some plans offer brokerage windows, which let more savvy investors place trades themselves in a much broader selection of investments. Could advisers get access to workplace plans in the past? If people with an employer-based retirement account wanted professional advice from an independent adviser, they would typically send account statements to their advisers. Or they could visit the adviser’s office, log into the accounts in person and view the investments together. (Fidelity says it supports that approach.) Advisers would make recommendations to their clients, who would then have to enact the changes themselves. The problem is that clients often fail to enact the changes, said Kyle Louvar, chief executive of Guided Capital Wealth Management in Houston, where Mr. Havins is a client. “We’d agree on a plan, but they would oftentimes forget,” he said. What should savers know about having an adviser manage a 401(k)? Having your adviser manage your 401(k) directly may be more expensive than doing it yourself. Pontera charges advisers fees of 20 to 30 basis points — 0.2 to 0.3 percent — on assets managed through its platform. Mr. Frayer said firms probably passed those costs on to their clients. Mr. Frayer said clients should consider whether it was realistic to expect that their adviser would help them beat the market, if they were also paying higher fees. Even if cybersecurity concerns are resolved, he said, “I see the fees passed on as a core issue.” Some retirement plans offer automatic rebalancing, said Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner who writes for Kitces.com , and savers invested in target-date funds don’t generally need to rebalance because the funds’ investment mix adjusts as they age.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/your-money/401-k-fintech-advisers-fidelity.html,Business,BBC,By Ann Carrns,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/pageoneplus/10biz-adviser/10biz-adviser-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-10T13:00:12.621000+00:00,b3fc819fc3c186b3777cc991b391a57c11886fe4

That’s Not Always a Good Thing.,"basketball, discrimination, cyberharassment;online harassment;cyberbullies;online trolls, social media, rumors and misinformation, right-wing extremism and alt-right, artificial intelligence, race and ethnicity, women and girls, wnba, caitlin clark, cathy engelbert, angel reese","About a week and a half after the first cryptocurrency tout threw a bright green sex toy onto the Atlanta Dream’s court midgame, and was arrested a few days later because of the prank, a well-known basketball satire account chimed in. On Aug. 9, the basketball parody account TheNBACentel posted a joke to social media: “All 13 WNBA teams are now required to install safety nets to protect against dildo-throwing incidents, per league officials.” It included an obviously doctored photo that showed a large net surrounding the court as players warmed up. The British media personality Piers Morgan missed the joke and credulously shared the post with his nearly nine million followers. When he realized it was a prank, Mr. Morgan corrected the record, but by then it was too late: The misinformation machine was already churning. Soon, a string of unconnected Facebook accounts that focus on sports, pop culture and politics began parroting TheNBACentel’s post, according to McKenzie Sadeghi, a researcher for NewsGuard, a company that analyzes the reliability of information online. With each iteration, the posts picked up more steam, with thousands of people sharing them. Many commenters took the posts as fact, accusing the Women’s National Basketball Association of being humorless. Others took it further, adding sexism, racism and anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment to the mix. Some of the content, which quickly spread across all major social media platforms, echoed talking points about the league that are popular with right-leaning pundits, like the idea that the players don’t deserve to be paid more or mocking the quality of the game. “I think we should begin throwing green Dildos at everything useless in America,” the right-wing commenter Kevin Smith wrote on X in a post that racked up nearly 350,000 views. It was a case study in the kind of discourse that has plagued the W.N.B.A. of late. As the league continues to grow in popularity, netting record attendance over the past two years thanks in significant part to the arrival of superstars like Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever and Angel Reese of the Chicago Sky, what had been an occasional issue with targeted abuse has spiraled into a pervasive, leaguewide problem. Hate speech and misinformation, much of it boosted by right-wing media and perpetuated by profit-driven content farms, have joined forces to spin demeaning or harmful narratives about players. And while all professional sports leagues receive some degree of hostile attention from passionate fans, the W.N.B.A.’s demographics mean attacks can be particularly nasty and very difficult to quell. “The W.N.B.A. is a soft target because there’s been so many conversations along racial and gender lines about the league,” said Jemele Hill, a former ESPN pundit who now has a podcast blending sports and politics. She added, “When you have a league that is 70 percent Black, where a third of the women are queer and when you have all these combustible elements, then it makes it really easy for people to use that and weaponize that.” Bethany Donaphin, a former player and the head of W.N.B.A. operations, said in an interview that the league began noticing “an uptick in vitriolic language and activity” on social media last year, coinciding with the arrival of Ms. Clark and Ms. Reese. In response, the W.N.B.A. this season started a campaign it calls “No Space for Hate,” aimed at reducing noxious language. Now, before games, spectators see a message from Commissioner Cathy Engelbert asking for civility and respect. The league also improved its mental health offerings. And before the 2025 season started, it offered players, their families and league personnel access to a tool called Social Protect, which uses artificial intelligence to delete hateful or abusive comments on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms. The app, which can be installed on mobile phones, is also used by the sporting body governing rugby in Australia. In interviews, players said that, if anything, toxic and abusive content — not to mention impersonations using A.I. and even death threats — had only increased this year despite the league’s anti-hate campaign. “I don’t think the league has done enough,” said Sami Whitcomb, a veteran guard for the Phoenix Mercury, who face elimination from the W.N.B.A. finals on Friday night in their game against the Las Vegas Aces. She said she had elected not to use Social Protect, claiming she had heard from teammates that it wasn’t as effective as they had hoped. Ms. Donaphin acknowledged that many players had not taken advantage of the A.I. tool, but declined to state how many. “There’s a lot more we have to learn,” she said. According to Shane Britten, the founder and chief executive of Social Protect, the company has deleted more than 350,000 comments from social media accounts belonging to the league, its teams and players this season. “When you look at the level of hatred and personal attacks and everything that’s contained in that, it’s really staggering,” said Mr. Britten, noting that 11 of 13 teams in the W.N.B.A. used the app for their official accounts this year and he expects far more players to try out the technology next season. (Ninety percent of the league’s rookies used the service this year, according to Mr. Britten.) DeWanna Bonner, a teammate of Ms. Whitcomb, said her inbox and direct messages were often filled with “awful, awful things.” “We’re here to play basketball,” she said. “And it sucks that it gets taken away by all these narratives that have been created.” Kate Starbird, who played two seasons in the league before getting a doctorate, now studies misinformation at the University of Washington. She said many of those narratives were promulgated — if not created — through profit-driven content factories. She hasn’t studied W.N.B.A. content specifically, but what she has seen on her own social media platforms fits a familiar pattern. “They are trying to take advantage of this attention that they can gain from this moment the W.N.B.A. is having,” she said. “Some people care about it for the politics of it. Some people care about it because they know that political angle gets more attention and can be leveraged for more clickbait.” Much of the content has revolved around Ms. Reese and Ms. Clark, whose on-court battles in college helped drive the 2024 women’s N.C.A.A. tournament to higher ratings than the men’s tourney for the first time. When they got to the W.N.B.A., the league seized this built-in story for marketing purposes, but the narrative quickly got out of hand, with fans directing racist remarks toward Ms. Reese and other Black players who were perceived as bullying or targeting Ms. Clark. (Ms. Reese and Ms. Clark did not respond to requests for comment.) Yet when asked about the simmering issue in a cable television interview late last season, Ms. Engelbert, the league’s commissioner, appeared to double down, stating that “you need rivalry, that’s what makes people watch,” and celebrating the fact that “there’s no more apathy” in the W.N.B.A. Her comments, which she later apologized for, led some to believe that she thought the hateful remarks directed at many players were a minor price to pay for the league’s increased visibility. Marisa Parham, a professor of digital studies at the University of Maryland, noticed the rise in toxic content after attending a Los Angeles Sparks game last season. Her Facebook feed was flooded with what appeared to be A.I.-generated fake news about the W.N.B.A., often originating in foreign countries. Much of the content revolved around the two rising stars. “The primary thing that was most noticeable was sort of this notion of Clark having been wronged,” Ms. Parham said. “That whenever she was not in the spotlight, this was evidence of wokeness, it was evidence of bias .” Much of that content appeared to springboard off viewpoints that had been steadily gaining traction in right-wing circles. Over the past two seasons, the W.N.B.A. — long ignored by right-leaning pundits except when they took time to ridicule women’s sports entirely — has become a favorite topic of discussion. And even though both Ms. Clark and Ms. Reese missed large portions of the current season because of injuries, podcasters and pundits including Matt Walsh, Ben Shapiro and Dave Portnoy continue to talk about them, framing many discussions around race, either subtly or much less so. “The WNBA investigates anti-black racism even as some of its players engage in anti-white racism against Caitlin Clark,” Mr. Shapiro posted in May, referring to a league investigation into racist comments that Ms. Reese said had been directed at her during a game in Indiana. The league could not substantiate her allegation. Ms. Clark has tried to downplay the dynamic, stating last season that “people should not be using my name to push those agendas.” “It’s disappointing,” she added. “It’s not acceptable.” Ms. Reese has, in interviews, blamed the discourse on racism and described being targeted with death threats, strangers coming to her home and family members receiving A.I.-generated nude photos of her. Clay Travis, the Trump-supporting founder and host of “OutKick,” a right-leaning daily podcast that mixes sports and politics, said the league had created some of its problems by trying too hard to satisfy its longtime, mostly female fan base and ignoring the much broader audience watching the game today. Mr. Travis and others point to the league’s pro-L.G.B.T.Q. stance, its strong support for the Black Lives Matter movement and the players’ union’s strong support of undocumented immigrants during recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles as proof that the W.N.B.A. is hostile to conservatives. “I think the W.N.B.A. is without a doubt the most political of the sports leagues right now, and I think that’s by design,” Mr. Travis said. “I’ve joked that the only place Trump would get booed at is the W.N.B.A. all-star game.” Click farmers are generally agnostic to politics, but their drive for profits often pushes their content into rage-bait and other divisive posts, Dr. Starbird said. Rather than originating new topics, they often try to piggyback off themes that are already resonating online, amplifying them considerably as they chase monetizable engagement. For instance, two days before the first fake post about dildo-proof nets, Donald Trump Jr. shared a meme showing President Trump throwing a sex toy from the White House onto a W.N.B.A. court. Ms. Sadeghi’s analysis of the flurry of posts around the dildo-proof nets indicated that they had originated from many unrelated accounts. “They posted the claim at different times, are run from different countries, have distinct followings and cover varied topics,” she said in an email. “It’s likely that many of them picked up the post organically by monitoring similar pages, a dynamic we frequently observe among pages that track and mimic trending content.” Brittney Griner is another case in point. When the star center was released in a prisoner swap after a 10-month detention in Russia in 2022, she dominated the political news cycle for days. But amid the legitimate coverage, NewsGuard found 40 accounts publishing false claims and other misinformation about Ms. Griner’s newfound freedom. Much of it incorporated A.I. right-wing voices, claiming that the government had negotiated her release only because she is Black and gay, while leaving other, white, Americans in Russian prison. That swirl of conversation helped generate more insidious content about Ms. Griner that attacked her sexuality and appearance using homophobic tropes as well as fabricated content claiming she is transgender. The unwieldy world of fake news is something the league office has yet to tackle. “It’s an important issue that I think it takes more than just one technology solution to address,” Ms. Donaphin said. Jackie Young, an all-star guard for the Aces, said that she increasingly tried to stay off social media to avoid the onslaught of negativity, which she characterized as a distraction from playing as well as she can. “At the end of the day, we’re human beings,” she said. “It’s crazy the things that people say behind the phone.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/wnba-misinformation-hate-speech.html,Business,BBC,By Tania Ganguli and Ken Bensinger,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10BIZ-wnba-online-lede-fzlp/10BIZ-wnba-online-lede-fzlp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T13:00:09+00:00,9bbb25036b5fd727168f8318785507e90241853f

Until Now, the Markets Said All Was Well.","sp 500, stocks;bonds, etf, asset allocation, mutual fund, personal finance, service content, financial planner","For example, in the three months through September, the S&P 500 stock index returned 8.1 percent and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller stocks, returned 12.4 percent, including dividends, according to FactSet. The Vanguard Total Stock Market E.T.F., which tracks a broad index but is heavily weighted toward the S&P 500, rose 8.3 percent for the quarter. These plain index returns beat the average stock fund in relevant categories. Over 12 months, the index fund outperformance also held. In that period, the S&P 500 gained 17.6 percent and the Russell 2000 gained 10.8 percent, including reinvested dividends, according to FactSet. The Vanguard fund rose 17.4 percent, again much better than the average general domestic stock fund. And the Vanguard Total International Stock Market E.T.F., which is a simple index tracker, rose 6.9 percent for the quarter and 17.2 percent over 12 months, beating the average international fund. Bond fund returns were positive but unexceptional. The average taxable fund returned 2.2 percent for the quarter and 5 percent over 12 months, Morningstar said. For municipal bond funds, the parallel returns were 2.7 percent and 1.2 percent. The Highlights Here is a sampling of how stock funds available in the United States fared in various domestic and international categories over three months and 12 months through September, according to Morningstar: Technology stock funds: 13.2 percent for the quarter and 30.6 percent for 12 months. Balanced funds with 50 to 70 percent stock and the rest bonds: 4.9 percent for the quarter and 10.5 percent for 12 months. Target-date 2030 funds, which contain a mix of stocks and bonds and are aimed at people who plan to retire in five years: 4.6 percent for the quarter and 11.3 percent for the year. China region funds: 22.2 percent for the quarter and 29.7 percent for 12 months. India funds: -7 percent for the quarter and -11.2 percent for the year. The tariff feud between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India hurt the Indian stock market more than many others. Precious metal stock funds, which have been buoyed by the soaring price of gold : 41 percent for the quarter and 92.6 percent for 12 months. Some individual funds beat the category averages. (Some funds always do, though vanishingly few do so consistently.) The steep increase in gold prices was responsible for the performance of three top funds this time: Profunds Precious Metals UltraSector, which tracks the Dow Jones Precious Metals gold-mining stock index and magnifies it with leverage, which is essentially borrowed money: 75 percent for the quarter and 150 percent for 12 months. U.S. Global Investors Gold & Precious Metals, which invests mainly in mining and gold-producing stocks: 46.3 percent for the quarter and 96 percent for 12 months. Franklin Gold and Precious Metals , which also invests in mining and gold-producing stocks: 45.7 percent for the quarter and 111.9 percent for 12 months. Funds that track the prices of cryptocurrency, mainly Bitcoin, had a great run, too. The biggest of them, the iShares Bitcoin Trust E.T.F., returned just 6.2 percent for the quarter but 80 percent for 12 months, according to FactSet.

5deb8f2c7117,Who Gained From U.S. Aid to Argentina?,"internal tag to designate no storyline, foreign aid, us politics, scott bessent, argentina, javier milei, robert citrone, stanley f druckenmiller, fidelity investments","Andrew here. Keep your eyes on a corner of the market that hasn’t gotten enough attention: private credit. The bankruptcy of the auto parts maker First Brands Group is now hitting firms like Jefferies and UBS, which were among those that had lent money to the company. We’ve got more details about the dominoes that are now falling. We’re also taking a look at the U.S. government’s multibillion-dollar bailout of Argentina — and questions it is raising. Pushback against a U.S. lifeline for Buenos Aires America has finally come to Argentina’s rescue , as the Trump administration aims to stabilize the embattled South American country’s economy and help out Javier Milei, the Argentine leader and an ally of President Trump. But critics of the move note ties between investors in Argentinian assets and Trump officials, and they have raised concerns that the administration is extending the aid during the U.S. government shutdown. The details: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the U.S. directly purchased Argentine pesos amid a run on the currency that forced Buenos Aires to spend billions of dollars to counteract it. Bessent added that the U.S. had also “finalized a $20 billion currency swap framework” with the Argentine central bank, though more information hasn’t been released. Bessent said that the move was in the U.S.’s strategic interest by creating a strong, stable Argentina to help “anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere.” Others point out that the country has significant supplies of minerals like lithium and copper that are crucial for U.S. and global manufacturing. The package comes as relief for big global investors who have made bets on Argentina, many of whom bought up government debt on the cheap in hopes that it will be repaid or renegotiated, The Times notes. Among them: Funds at money managers including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco . One Fidelity vehicle this summer credited returns from its Argentine bet with helping compensate for losses in other emerging-market countries. Stan Druckenmiller , who mentored Bessent at Soros Fund Management. A government filing in June of this year indicated that the Duquesne family office, which Druckenmiller runs, was the second-largest investor in Argentina’s principal exchange-traded fund, a pool of Argentine stocks. Robert Citrone, who founded Discovery Capital Management and who has claimed credit for persuading George Soros and Bessent to bet against the Japanese yen in 2013, a hugely profitable investment . Citrone had been in touch with Bessent in the lead-up to Bessent’s announcement last month that the U.S. would help Argentina, arguing that a peso crash would hurt Milei politically, The Times reports. The move has drawn political blowback for the Trump administration. While Bessent has argued that the U.S. wouldn’t bail out Argentina, skeptics said the move is exactly that. “It’s a country in crisis, it’s running out of dollars, and the U.S. is giving the country dollars,” Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told The Times. “That’s a bailout by definition.” A group of Democratic senators on Thursday introduced legislation meant to prevent the Treasury Department from using a special fund to help Argentina. (It’s unlikely to pass.) “It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who helped draft the legislation. “Trump promised ‘America First,’ but he’s putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill.” And as we’ve written before, American soybean farmers have grumbled about aid for Argentina, which has sold more than 2.5 metric tons of soybeans to China as Beijing halts its purchases from the U.S. (The Trump administration has said it will offer help to American farmers .) HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Consumer Price Index report for September is coming out — at some point. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has called back some workers to help release the data, despite the government shutdown, The Times reports. The move was tied to the annual process of adjusting Social Security benefits to account for cost-of-living changes; the report’s release date isn’t known but is likely before Fed policymakers meet to vote on interest rate changes at the end of the month. Letitia James is the latest Trump foe to face federal charges. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on accusations of bank fraud and making a false statement, by the same handpicked federal prosecutor who is leading a similar case against James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. Critics of the move said it represented the further weaponization of the Justice Department by President Trump against his adversaries, a list the president has said includes the investors George Soros and Reid Hoffman. Zohran Mamdani maintains a big lead over Andrew Cuomo in the New York mayoral race. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, is ahead of Cuomo by 13 points with a month before the election, according to a new poll by Quinnipiac University. It’s unclear how the findings will affect the plans of the city’s business donors . The fallout from a costly auto supplier’s bankruptcy First Brands Group isn’t exactly a household name. But the auto parts maker’s bankruptcy filing late last month has led to a rapidly widening shock across the global financial community. Lenders and investors are tallying up what now looks like billions in losses, while federal prosecutors are said to be getting involved as well. What happened: First Brands, which makes oil filters and windshield wipers, sought Chapter 11 protection last month after discovering accounting irregularities. What is emerging is a complicated web of off-balance-sheet debt — on top of $6 billion in balance-sheet debt — as the company repledged assets multiple times to different lenders. Raistone, a lender that worked extensively with First Brands and is calling for an independent court examiner, said that as much as $2.3 billion “ simply vanished ” from First Brands’s books. An array of financial firms has been hit. Jefferies disclosed that one of its asset-management units is owed $715 million from customers that bought First Brands products. A UBS fund disclosed to investors that about 30 percent of its portfolio was linked to the bankrupt manufacturer. Raistone said it is owed at least $172 million. (One sign of how complicated this all is: Raistone is partly owned by a UBS fund.) And insurers including Allianz and AIG are preparing for a potential flood of claims related to First Brands, according to The Financial Times. A big question: Does First Brands’s failure underscore just how frothy and complacent the credit markets have become, especially amid the boom in so-called private credit? “I suspect we’re going to see more of these things, like First Brands and others, when the cycle ultimately reverses,” Jim Chanos , the prominent short seller, told The FT. Exclusive: Kalshi’s big new fund-raising round It’s been an eventful week for prediction markets, the digital platforms where users can bet on nearly anything: political elections, N.F.L. games, the next pope and more. The latest news comes from Kalshi, a big player in the field, which will announce on Friday that it has raised more than $300 million in new funding and will open to international bettors, Michael de la Merced is first to report. The new round values Kalshi at $5 billion, up from a $2 billion valuation set in June, according to the data provider PitchBook. The round was led by Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz; other investors included Paradigm, CapitalG, Coinbase Ventures, General Catalyst and Spark Capital. The company and its industry have grown by leaps and bounds since last year, when prediction markets started to gain mainstream popularity after they correctly called the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Kalshi’s growth was supercharged by its allowing of sports bets on its platform — and especially after it began offering the complex wagers known as parlays that had previously been reserved for sports books. (That move battered the stock prices of more traditional gambling sites like DraftKings.) Kalshi has also benefited from a series of deals that allow customers of brokerages like Robinhood and Webull to bet on contracts directly from those sites, just as easily as they can buy stocks. Meanwhile, a chief rival, Polymarket, said this week that it would receive up to $2 billion in investment from the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the N.Y.S.E. Kalshi had more than $1 billion worth of trading volume this week. That puts it on track for $50 billion in volume on an annualized basis — and a huge jump from the roughly $300 million in annualized volume it had last year before it opened its election market. It also overtook Polymarket late last month as the market leader, with a share of more than 60 percent by the end of September, according to the data provider Dune. “We have not expected this level of growth,” Tarek Mansour, a Kalshi co-founder and its C.E.O., told DealBook. Kalshi is growing internationally, too. Until now, the company operated only in the U.S., where it was the first platform to offer election-related contracts after a federal court took its side in a fight with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi will now operate in more than 140 countries, though only via its website and not also through online brokerages. But Kalshi still faces challenges. Among them: Several states have sued the company , arguing that it is essentially skirting their rules around sports gambling (and depriving them of taxes that sports books pay). Fierce competition, both from sports books and other prediction markets. Chart of the day Speaking of prediction markets, the Polymarket betting contract on who would win the Nobel Peace Prize showed a surge of wagers on María Corina Machado, hours before the Venezuelan opposition leader was named the winner. The odds for President Trump winning — something he has campaigned strongly for — were consistently in single digits. A golden debate Gold hit $4,000 for the first time on Tuesday after climbing more than 50 percent this year, setting off speculation about what is driving the rally. Here are some of the latest theories: It’s a debasement trade . “Investors worried about the future of the dollar and other major currencies are piling into gold, bitcoin and other alternative assets,” David Uberti and Jack Pitcher reported in The Wall Street Journal . Gold’s strength isn’t a comment on the dollar, according to Jonathan Levin of Bloomberg Opinion : “The last few months have shown that the dollar continues to be as indispensable as ever. So while gold’s rally is noteworthy in its own right, there’s very little risk that the metal somehow portends a fading of the dollar’s dominance in the world.” The debasement trade hasn’t shown up in bond markets , which remain confident that inflation won’t run out of control, points out James Mackintosh in The Journal. “Gold is booming because central bank reserve managers worry about relying on an unpredictable U.S. in a crisis, plus its natural rise when rates fall, boosted by buyers trying to jump on to rising prices,” he writes.

ff0e1f8205d6,"Kalshi, a Prediction Market, Raises Funds and Expands Overseas","gambling, venture capital, regulation and deregulation, kalshi, andreessen horowitz, sequoia capital","Online prediction markets have jumped into the mainstream, as users flock to sites to bet on politics, sports, the next pope and more. That growth has drawn interest from investors. Kalshi, one of the most prominent prediction markets, plans to announce on Friday that it has raised more than $300 million in a new round of financing at a valuation of $5 billion. The company also plans to disclose that it will start letting customers in more than 140 countries place bets on its website. The fund-raising announcement, in the same week that Polymarket , Kalshi’s chief rival, said the parent of the New York Stock Exchange would invest up to $2 billion , underscores how big a business prediction markets have become. Kalshi is on track for $50 billion in trading volume on an annualized basis, a big jump from the roughly $300 million it recorded last year. Last month, Kalshi overtook Polymarket to become the biggest player in the prediction-market industry, with a global market share of prediction-market activity of more than 60 percent , according to the data provider Dune. “We have not expected this level of growth,” Tarek Mansour, a Kalshi co-founder and its chief executive, said in an interview. That rapid expansion drew the attention of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital — which first backed the company in 2020 — and Andreessen Horowitz, a new investor. Despite closing its previous investment round in June, Kalshi negotiated the new fund-raising effort, which more than doubled its valuation, in August. Other investors in the round include Paradigm, CapitalG and Coinbase Ventures. Kalshi’s recent growth has been powered by sports, especially after it began offering the kind of complex wagers known as parlays. Its push into sports has rattled the traditional sportsbooks, with the shares of DraftKings and the parent of FanDuel falling by double-digit percentages over the past month. Kalshi has also benefited from a series of deals that allow customers of brokerages like Robinhood and Webull to bet on contracts directly from those sites, as easily as they can buy stocks. Until now, Kalshi operated only in the United States. Polymarket, on the other hand, was barred from letting Americans participate on its platform in 2022 and only recently resumed doing business in the country. Donald Trump Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, is an adviser to both companies, joining Kalshi in January and Polymarket in August. In May, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission dropped a legal challenge to Kalshi’s election-related betting business. But the company is now facing pushback from U.S. state regulators over sports betting. Several states have sued the company, arguing that it is essentially skirting their rules around online sports gambling, which remains illegal in 20 states, by offering financial products tied to the outcome of sporting events. “Every time there’s a new type of financial innovation, there’s always a series of questions around regulation,” Mr. Mansour said.

61fadb79a70c,Have You Hugged Your Job Today?,"jobs, us economy, hugging, financial planner","Hugging conjures friendship, intimacy, support. But lately, it has cropped up in a less warm and fuzzy context: to refer to people clinging anxiously to their jobs in a murky market. Workers are quitting at much lower rates than they were a few years ago, and are instead “job hugging.” In August, the consulting firm Korn Ferry used the term in an article to describe the way workers have been “holding on to their jobs for dear life.” A spokesman wrote in an email that the firm might have coined the phrase but that he couldn’t say for sure. Since then, it has popped up in several news articles and even on “ The Daily Show .” The term is striking a nerve partly because it represents a sharp reversal from the “ great resignation ” period of 2021 and 2022, when tens of millions of Americans quit their jobs. At the time, the labor market was hot, after a steep decline in employment at the start of the pandemic. How it’s pronounced /jäb həg-iŋ/ But the market has again cooled significantly. Employers added a measly 22,000 jobs in August, according to the latest federal data . In June, the U.S. economy lost 13,000 jobs, its first dip since December 2020, according to revised data. Hiring is down in many industries. Unemployment, though low overall, is hitting recent college graduates hard. The job market is filled with distressing signals and uncertainty. Tariffs are hobbling companies. Immigration raids are decimating the work forces of some industries and igniting fear in communities. Artificial intelligence is spooking everyone (though Yale researchers found that so far, few workers have been displaced by A.I.). Quits reflect workers’ confidence — and at the moment, they do not seem particularly confident. “Unless you have a better option, quitting a job in risky times is a huge gamble,” Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, said in an email. When they can’t quit, employees may end up feeling stuck in place, which can stunt their career development, said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The situation can also hurt their financial health because job hoppers tend to get higher raises . For the most part, workers leave jobs once they have secured a better opportunity. “Almost nobody quits and then pouts and goes home and then thinks, ‘Gee, what am I going to do next?’” Dr. Cappelli said. But when workers don’t leave, other people can’t fill those roles, stalling movement in the job market. Though worker turnover is expensive for employers, having a team of stressed employees who don’t want to be there isn’t ideal, either. “Churn” is a bad word among bosses, but some amount of it can be healthy. On paper, this job market is more “normal” than the overheated one of the early 2020s. Still, many of the dynamics today — the Trump administration’s immigration offensive, the hyped-up A.I. market, the psychic scars of the early pandemic shutdowns and the years of scarce labor that followed — make for an uneasy time. Stressed-out workers may find comfort in embracing a loved one amid the uncertainty. A job, for all the stability it provides, cannot hug you back.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/job-hugging-labor-market.html,Business,BBC,By Lora Kelley,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/business/12biz-shoptalk-job-hugging-ILLO_01/10biz-shoptalk-job-hugging-ILLO_01-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:02:11.100000+00:00,14c798d8f6fa79df9dd9276337520b1f197a9ea9

What to Know Before You Fly.,"airlines;airplanes, airport security, batteries, travel;tourism;vacations, lithium mental, plane crash, regulation and deregulation, service content, faa, tsa, us","Over the last few months, airlines and security agencies worldwide began rolling out new rules about where electronic devices should be stored on planes, whether it’s in the cargo hold, the overhead bins or in a personal item. The main issue is lithium batteries, which, according to the Federal Aviation Administration , can spontaneously catch fire if they are damaged or short circuit. These batteries are now largely banned from checked baggage in the United States unless they are completely turned off. This can be confusing for travelers who may not know if their device is powered by a lithium battery. A better way to think about it is whether or not that device is rechargeable, said Jeff Marootian, the chief executive of UL Standards & Engagement, a safety standards organization. Those items include, but are not limited to, cellphones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, toothbrushes, portable chargers and vapes. Separately, certain cordless hair dryers and curling irons have been banned from checked luggage because they use butane cartridges for power. Here’s what to know. A Rare But Growing Issue John Cox, a former pilot and airline safety expert, said the issue is something called “thermal runaway,” where a device’s battery overheats, breaks down and can catch fire. Not all of these incidents involve open flame, he noted, but overheated batteries are at risk of explosion. A fire destroyed an Air Busan plane on the tarmac in South Korea in January, and investigators said it was possible a power bank had started the blaze . According to the F.A.A., there have been almost 700 incidents with lithium batteries involving smoke, fire or extreme heat since March 2006. The vast majority of those incidents, according to the agency’s data , involved battery packs, with vapes or e-cigarettes the second leading cause. Last year, there were 89 incidents, compared to 45 in 2019, according to the F.A.A. So far this year, there have been 62 incidents. That comes out to about two per week, Mr. Marootian said. “While they’re increasing, they still remain very isolated, and we want to keep them that way,” he added. The uptick largely has to do with the increasing number of rechargeable devices that passengers are carrying, Mr. Cox said. Understand What You’re Carrying Mr. Marootian said that he finds airport signage regarding batteries to be confusing, as it refers to things like battery type and wattage that a regular traveler might not know. “The average person doesn’t necessarily think about the devices they’re carrying with them in terms of what type of battery,” he said. “But if you were to say ‘rechargeable device,’ that’s more transparent.” Mr. Marootian said that any given traveler was likely to find that they were carrying four rechargeable devices, and possibly even more. “Passenger awareness is really the key,” he said. Keep Your Devices Close Under the F.A.A.’s new rules, anything containing a lithium metal or lithium-ion battery should be kept in carry-on baggage. The devices may be checked, but only if they are “completely turned off, protected from accidental activation and packed so that they won’t get damaged,” the agency has said. Individual carriers may have their own restrictions. Spare lithium batteries, portable chargers, electronic cigarettes and vaping devices need to be with the passenger carrying them in the plane cabin. If a passenger’s bags are gate checked, they should remember to remove the batteries before losing custody of their bag. A lithium battery that has been damaged or recalled is especially prone to overheating and potentially causing fire. For example, Mr. Cox said, if an iPhone or iPad has a cracked screen, the device has experienced a high degree of force that could have damaged its battery, putting it at risk for thermal runaway. “Don’t bring damaged devices on the airplanes,” he said. One of the easiest solutions, Mr. Marootian said, is keeping devices within arm’s reach. Should they smoke or spark, the issue can be dealt with immediately, he said. Think Before You Pack According to UL Standards, 38 percent of travelers admit to packing lithium batteries in their checked luggage and 30 percent who were asked to gate check their carry-ons were not asked to remove lithium-powered devices. Mr. Marootian said his company is working on a public service campaign to better inform passengers of their battery risks and also pushing for increased training for flight staff. Before packing a carry-on, passengers should check devices for signs of battery problems, including swelling, overheating and obvious damage, according to UL Standards. “We see this as a very solvable issue,”Mr. Marootian said. If the T.S.A. finds a lithium battery device in checked luggage, they will likely not remove the device, but they will likely inspect it for damage, Mr. Cox said. Butane-powered devices In-flight fires can also be caused by butane-powered devices, such as cordless hair curlers, according to a social media post by the T.S.A. in August. Only one butane-powered device is permitted onboard per person, the post said, and must be packed in carry-on luggage. If a cordless curling iron with a butane cartridge is discovered by the T.S.A. in checked luggage, the agency said it will turn the device over to the airline. “Having butane in an airplane is not a good idea,” Mr. Cox said, adding that the gas is highly flammable.

f7f429333728,"If an Energy Drink Drank an Energy Drink, You’d Get a Celsius","energy and sports drinks, caffeine, advertising;marketing, celsius, red bull, pepsi, monster beverage","“I think it’s important that Celsius comes in a 12-ounce sleek can that kind of resembles White Claw,” said Sean McGowan, a Managing Director at Roth Capital Partners. “Celsius didn’t just convince Red Bull or Monster drinkers to switch to their brand; they enticed new people into the category. Why had those people been reluctant to get into the category? Maybe because they perceived energy drinks in relation to gaming or partying instead of fitness. Maybe because 16 ounces is a lot of caffeinated liquid.” McGowan’s White Claw comparison is apt. Like Celsius, White Claw laundered an ancient intoxicant into a healthy-seeming choice through visual and sensory cues. The two drinks even have flavors in common. The cans could be siblings. Celsius reads so clean, in fact, that it has become the energy drink of choice for swaths of the sober community. Jack Mintz, a therapist in New York, discovered Celsius in recovery, where it was immensely popular among people wary of what he called the “cultural stigma” around Red Bull and Monster. Mintz, who exercises often and avoids processed sugar, noticed that his gym carried Celsius. “There’s something very powerful about that coding,” he said. “Also, Celsius flavors are really, really good.” It is true that in a blind test, a person might plausibly identify the referents behind Celsius flavors like Fuji Apple Pear and Orange. That’s not the case with Monster, whose flavors include Nitro and Assault, or Red Bull, whose primary formula tastes enigmatically of bubble gum and cough syrup. But striving for realism has risks, too. The pleasure potential of an energy drink flavor tends to be constrained by the bitterness of the ingredients — caffeine, taurine — that make it work. Celsius’ Orange tastes obviously inferior to an actual orange, whereas Monster’s Assault is technically incomparable. Whatever the degree of flavor abstraction, I’ve yet to find an energy drink that doesn’t taste a bit like expertly masked poison. Which is fine. These drinks are not delicacies. As long as they achieve a basic level of palatability, consumers grade them on functionality. Some consumers desire a subtle pick-me-up while others crave full-body electrification. Whatever bonus ingredients an energy drink contains, it is primarily a vehicle for caffeine. And here we stumble upon the secret, or one of them, to the success of Celsius: a 12-ounce can contains 200 milligrams of caffeine. By comparison, a 16-ounce can of Monster has 160 milligrams of caffeine, while the traditional 8.4-ounce can of Red Bull has only 80 milligrams. The brand may position itself as a fitness supplement, but its rise suggests a broader use case. As with Monster and Red Bull before it, many consumers drink Celsius for an extremely non-aspirational reason: to get through the workday. The U.S. military, a longtime advocate of strategic caffeine use, prizes the substance especially when it comes to tedious tasks that require unwavering alertness, like sentry duty. For health-conscious American civilians enduring the equivalent of sentry duty — unbelievably boring jobs that demand (but don’t encourage) sustained attention — Celsius is an effective propellant. Negligible calories, no high-fructose corn syrup, no genetically modified ingredients.

5484c2586034,Inside Hegseth’s Effort to Limit Press Access at the Pentagon,"us military, cnn, pentagon, fox news, pete hegseth, donald trump","As the Senate weighed whether to confirm Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, NBC News dug up information about his past, including an affidavit from his former sister-in-law accusing him of abusive behavior toward his second wife. Courtney Kube, a Pentagon correspondent for the network, assisted with the coverage. The reporting did not upend the confirmation of Mr. Hegseth, a Fox News host before his nomination. But it did leave an impression on him. Shortly after taking office, Mr. Hegseth told his team to bar Ms. Kube from the Pentagon, according to three people with knowledge of his order. The team did not follow through, because Pentagon lawyers said the Defense Department could not single out one news outlet for removal, two of the people said. Mr. Hegseth’s request did, however, foreshadow his adversarial approach to the press while in the job — both toward specific reporters and toward the industry more broadly. Under his leadership, the department has removed national news outlets from a shared media workspace and made it available to conservative outlets instead; has scaled back reporters’ ability to roam Pentagon corridors; and, in the most recent salvo, is imposing a set of restrictions outlining causes for the revocation of correspondents’ press passes. The Defense Department is falling in line with a policy of hostility toward news organizations that spans the Trump administration. President Trump himself has sued ABC and CBS over their coverage, with both lawsuits ending in settlements, and has accused The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times of defamation. (The case against The Times was dismissed, though Mr. Trump has the right to file a new complaint.) The White House ejected The Associated Press from the White House press pool and seized control of coverage assignments formerly administered by the White House Correspondents’ Association.

When David Yaffe-Bellany first learned about the complicated world of cryptocurrency from a tech-savvy high school friend, his reaction was one of polite interest. That changed in 2021, when an editor at The New York Times — where Mr. Yaffe-Bellany had previously worked as a reporting fellow on the Business desk — reached out about a new opportunity to cover cryptocurrency for the paper. “In 10 minutes of research, it immediately became clear that it was a great beat with a colorful cast of characters involved in the crypto world, and risks that had gone underexplored in some of the coverage,” said Mr. Yaffe-Bellany, 28, a technology reporter for The Times who has covered the crypto industry since 2022. Three years and more than 300 bylines later, Mr. Yaffe-Bellany has chronicled the peaks and valleys of the nascent industry, including the collapse of the cryptocurrency founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s company FTX . Last month, he collaborated on a multicountry investigation into two giant crypto and artificial intelligence deals involving President Trump. “I strongly believe the best stories come from being somewhere in person,” said Mr. Yaffe-Bellany, whose reporting has taken him to Singapore, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. “Often, at a crypto conference, you can just walk up and have a conversation with somebody who it might take weeks to get on the phone, because they have three layers of P.R. people around them.” In an interview, Mr. Yaffe-Bellany, who is based in New York, shared how he navigates covering a beat that is constantly evolving and the lessons he has learned in three years of reporting on the industry.

b51981872ffc,Germany’s Top Economist Charts a Path Out of Europe’s Crisis,"international relations, politics, regulation and deregulation, international trade, economics, tariff, economy, interest rate, inflation, joachim nagel, europe, germany","Central bank chiefs are cautious by nature, mindful that their words can move markets and influence politics. But Joachim Nagel, the president of the Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, has recently become more outspoken about the challenges facing Europe’s largest economy, the policies he thinks lawmakers should adopt and the importance of defending institutions like his from criticism. “When you are in a hurricane, you have this quiet in the eye of the storm,” he said in an interview in London with The New York Times. This may describe the European economy today, he added. President Trump’s tariffs and wavering commitment to Ukraine in its war with Russia have shaken Europe’s capitals. They appeared to galvanize leaders to bolster economic ties within the continent and spend more on defense. Some also saw a chance for the euro to establish itself as a haven for investors backed by a market of 350 million people. Even as the European Union and the United States have agreed on the outline of a trade deal , taking the sting out of some of the tariffs, a sense of urgency should be maintained, Mr. Nagel said. Europe faces daunting debts, pressure on government budgets and “uncertain political situations,” he said. The German economy shrank in 2023 and 2024, with exports no longer serving as a reliable growth engine. At the same time, France, the European Union’s second-largest economy, is stuck in a political quagmire , struggling to manage its fragile finances. “Complacency is definitely not the right attitude,” Mr. Nagel said. The answer, for him, is greater European integration, and he warned against underestimating the region’s ability to adapt to its challenges. On Slow Growth and Threats to Democracy As unelected officials, central bankers tend to be very careful about wading into policy debates. Mr. Nagel said he had become more forthright, and the turning point was in early 2024 when he attended a demonstration for the first time. Around that time, pro-democracy demonstrations attracted tens of thousands of people, after news spread that the far-right party Alternative for Germany had held a secret meeting to discuss plans for the mass deportation of immigrants and some German citizens with immigrant backgrounds. “I was really embarrassed during that time,” Mr. Nagel said. Even as an independent central banker who is meant to stay out of politics, he said, he felt a “responsibility” to stand up for democracy, freedom of speech and the institutions that had been developed since the end of the Second World War. In recent speeches, Mr. Nagel has pushed for the policies he says Germany needs to urgently adopt, including cutting red tape , increasing the supply of workers , investing in technology and lowering energy prices . Germany’s government unveiled a plan this summer to borrow more than 100 billion euros ($116 billion) this year to spend, including on the military and infrastructure. The economy ministry said this week that it expected economic growth of just 0.2 percent this year, with government spending helping to spur more growth starting next year. But citizens are impatient for results, and “we have to speed up,” Mr. Nagel said. On Interest Rates and Central Bank Independence It helps that Mr. Nagel’s primary mandate as a central banker — ensuring price stability — appears to have been achieved. Inflation in the eurozone is close to the European Central Bank’s 2 percent target, and many policymakers, including Mr. Nagel, seem relaxed about forecasts that inflation could drift below this target in the next two years. “The bar is rather high,” he said, to alter his assessment that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate. The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 nations that use the euro and is based in Frankfurt, has held its key rate at 2 percent since June. Before that, it cut rates at eight consecutive meetings. Mr. Nagel said he was not concerned about the strength in the euro , which makes imports cheaper and could pull inflation lower. Near recent levels, at $1.17, “I will not say it’s not relevant,” he said. “We have to look at it. But this is not a big issue.” The big issue among central bankers around the world is unfolding in Washington, where the Trump administration has assailed the independence of the Federal Reserve in an attempt to pressure officials into cutting rates. Mr. Nagel credits the Bundesbank’s predecessor, which was created in 1948 by the United States and other Western powers then occupying Germany, with kick-starting the country’s rapid growth and reconstruction after the Second World War. “We are so grateful to the United States that they had this brilliant idea to have an independent central bank,” he said. “This is a reason why we are so nervous when it comes to what we saw over the past 10 months,” he added, describing the recent attacks on the Fed as “unfair.” On China and Trade While Germany’s economy has been hurt by U.S. tariffs, problems for German exporters also stem from China. In recent years, China has become a fierce competitor, selling many of the goods, including cars and high-tech machinery, that countries used to buy from German firms, often at a lower cost. German companies also face a threat closer to home, as the Chinese companies that have been shut out of U.S. markets look for places to redirect their products. Chinese car brands nearly doubled their sales in Europe in the first half of the year, selling almost as many vehicles there as Mercedes-Benz did, according to JATO Dynamics . Intensifying competition with China should be “an eye-opener for all European companies,” Mr. Nagel said. But Europe is in a strong position to negotiate on trade with China because “they need us more than we need China,” he added. “Our most important market is Europe. It’s not China.” Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/nagel-bundesbank-germany-europe-economy.html,Business,BBC,By Eshe Nelson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/00biz-germany-econ-01-gmtj/00biz-germany-econ-01-gmtj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T04:00:33+00:00,81b920c5be31a5d453bb39910a54527af4922283
511e4d9966d3,Why China Built 162 Square Miles of Solar Panels on the World’s Highest Plateau,"tibet, renewable energy, china, solar energy, wind power, electric power, data center, hydroelectric power, internal-open-access-from-nl","Power ⚡︎ Moves Why China Built 162 Square Miles of Solar Panels on the World’s Highest Plateau 阅读简体中文版 閱讀繁體中文版 On the Tibetan Plateau, nearly 10,000 feet high, solar panels stretch to the horizon and cover an area seven times the size of Manhattan. They soak up sunlight that is much brighter than at sea level because the air is so thin. Wind turbines dot nearby ridgelines and stand in long rows across arid, empty plains above the occasional sheep herder with his flock. They capture night breezes, balancing the daytime power from the solar panels. Hydropower dams sit where rivers spill down long chasms at the edges of the plateau. And high-voltage power lines carry all this electricity to businesses and homes more than 1,000 miles away. China is building an enormous network of clean energy industries on the Tibetan Plateau, the world’s highest. The intention is to harness the region’s bright sunshine, cold temperatures and sky-touching altitude to provide low-cost, renewable energy. The result is enough renewable energy to provide the plateau with nearly all of the power it needs, including for data centers used in China’s artificial intelligence development. While China still burns as much coal as the rest of the world combined, last month President Xi Jinping made a stunning pledge. Speaking before the United Nations, he said for the first time that the country would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its economy and would expand renewable energy sixfold in coming years. It was a moment of global significance for the nation that is currently the world’s biggest polluter. China’s clean energy efforts contrast with the ambitions of the United States under the Trump administration, which is using its diplomatic and economic muscle to pressure other countries to buy more American gas, oil and coal. China is investing in cheaper solar and wind technology, along with batteries and electric vehicles, with the aim of becoming the world’s supplier of renewable energy and the products that rely on it. The main group of solar farms, known as the Talatan Solar Park, dwarfs every other cluster of solar farms in the world. It covers 162 square miles in Gonghe County, an alpine desert in sparsely inhabited Qinghai, a province in western China. No other country on the planet is using high altitudes for solar, wind and hydropower on a scale as great as China’s on the Tibetan Plateau. The effort is a case study of how China has come to dominate the future of clean energy. With the help of substantial government-directed investment and planning, electricity companies are weaning the country off imported oil, natural gas and coal — a national priority. Renewable energy helps China power 30,000 miles of high-speed train routes and its growing fleet of electric cars . At the same time, cheap electricity enables China to manufacture even more solar panels, which dominate global markets and power artificial intelligence data centers. Electricity from solar and wind power in Qinghai, which occupies the northern third of the Tibetan Plateau, costs about 40 percent less than coal-fired power. Qinghai encompasses most of a region known among Tibetans as Amdo and includes the birthplace of the current Dalai Lama , now in exile. In July, China’s premier, Li Qiang, oversaw the groundbreaking of five additional dams on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in southern Tibet, a region of China that is tightly restricted by the Communist Party and not open to Western journalists. The Chinese government has released little information about the construction of the dams, but they are expected to take years to complete and would most likely constitute the world’s largest hydropower project. Its construction has alarmed India, which fears that China could use it to cut off water supplies to downstream areas of eastern India. China is not the first country to experiment with high-altitude clean energy. But other places as high as the Tibetan Plateau are mountainous and steep. Qinghai, slightly bigger than Texas, is mostly flat — optimal for solar panels and the roads needed to bring them in. And the cold air improves the efficiency of solar panels. Switzerland has experimented with small solar power installations at the top of cable railways. It opened a solar power farm at an altitude of 5,940 feet, but it can generate only about 0.5 megawatts, enough to power about 80 American households. The state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China completed a 480-megawatt solar project last year at an altitude of 4,000 feet on the plateau of the Atacama Desert in Chile, which is the world’s driest nonpolar desert, but much lower than the Tibetan Plateau. Qinghai’s Talatan solar project dwarfs these. It has a capacity of 16,930 megawatts of power, which could run every household in Chicago. It is still expanding, adding panels with a target of growing to 10 times the area of Manhattan in three years. Another 4,700 megawatts of wind energy and 7,380 megawatts of hydroelectric dams are nearby. China is now building at even higher elevations in mountain valleys on the Tibetan Plateau, although with smaller solar farms. Near Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, a Chinese power company recently installed 150 megawatts of solar panels at 17,000 feet. As an incentive to building solar farms, many western Chinese provinces initially offered free land to companies. The central government has recently ordered the provinces to begin charging nominal annual fees to encourage efficient use of the land. The Talatan solar project is on sandy soil with sparse vegetation used as grazing lands by ethnic Tibetan herders. The first panels installed at the site in 2012 were so low to the ground that sheep had trouble grazing under and around them. Now all panels are installed on higher mountings, said Liu Ta, the project’s manager. Dislocating people for power projects is politically sensitive all over the world. But high-altitude projects affect relatively few people in sparsely populated settlements. China pushed more than one million people out of their homes in west-central China a quarter-century ago and flooded a vast area for the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam. This year, China has been installing enough solar panels every three weeks to match the power generation capacity of that dam. Generating wind power on the plateau is trickier. At high altitudes, the winds blow fast, but the thin air doesn’t push wind turbine blades as effectively as thicker air closer to sea level. Still, the region has many wind turbines. Operators of the electricity grid try to balance the generation of solar power by day with wind power by night to maintain steady voltage and avoid blackouts. Qinghai Province sends excess solar power to Shaanxi Province in west-central China. In exchange, Qinghai tops off the wind power generated locally at night with small amounts of electricity generated by Shaanxi coal plants. In addition, Qinghai is increasingly turning to hydropower to balance the plateau’s solar power, in the hopes of using less coal-fired power. More than a decade ago, eight dams were built on the Yellow River as it drops 3,300 feet, flowing off the eastern side of the plateau and down into eastern China. More are under construction to balance and supplement the solar energy being generated in Qinghai Province. “When photovoltaic power is insufficient, I can use hydropower to make up for it,” said Zhu Yuanqing, power division director of the Qinghai Provincial Energy Bureau. Two additional hydropower projects are being built in high mountain valleys near the Talatan Solar Park. The plan for both, Qinghai officials said, is to use excess solar power generated during the day to pump water up into the projects’ reservoirs several miles up. The water will be allowed to drop down through mountain tubes to the plateau at night, spinning giant turbines to generate immense amounts of electricity. Several electricity-intensive industries are moving to the region to tap its inexpensive power. One is the task of turning quartzite from mines into polysilicon to make solar panels. Data centers for artificial intelligence are also drawn to the area. Qinghai plans to increase its data center capacity more than five times by 2030. The facilities are in Xining, the provincial capital, at an altitude of 7,500 feet, and in Yushu and Guoluo, two chilly towns at an altitude over 12,000 feet. The data centers consume 40 percent less electricity, their main operating cost, than similar ones at sea level because air-conditioning is barely needed, said Zhang Jingang, the executive vice governor of Qinghai. Air warmed by the data centers’ computer servers is circulated through underground pipes to heat other buildings in Yushu and Guoluo, replacing coal-fired boilers. Mr. Zhang spoke at a news conference in Xining as part of a government-organized media tour this summer of clean energy sites in Qinghai, which usually restricts foreign media access to hide dissent by its large ethnic Tibetan population. The New York Times paid for its own travel costs. To connect the data centers’ computing power to many of China’s technology companies, data is transferred from Shanghai to Qinghai on China’s national fiber-optic grid. The artificial intelligence programming of dancing humanoid robots for a televised gala during Lunar New Year in January was done at data centers in Qinghai. But even fiber-optic cables do not provide quick enough communications for one of the fastest-growing computation needs in China: self-driving cars. The data centers for these cars are still in eastern China, where most of the population lives and drives. “That kind of data center must not be placed in Qinghai,” Mr. Zhu said. “An accident may occur if you are not careful.” Li You contributed research from Gonghe County.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/china-solar-tibetan-plateau.html,Business,BBC,By Keith Bradsher,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/09/climate/00cli-china-solar-poster/00cli-china-solar-poster-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T04:00:10+00:00,00ecd44b5f0712a84e5bd53bc8e4183ba847164d
ab5e55d588bf,Los Angeles Times Moves Closer to a Public Stock Offering,"los angeles times, newspaper, ipo, patrick soon-shiong, stocks;bonds","The Los Angeles Times will begin selling shares to certain investors as it moves closer to an initial public offering, its owner, the billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, said on Thursday. The company announced a so-called private placement seeking to raise up to $500 million for the newly created Los Angeles Times Media Group, which includes the newspaper as well as LA Times Studios and two of Dr. Soon-Shiong’s other businesses: the virtual production company NantStudios and the gaming and esports studio NantGames. According to its investor website, the company is offering investors and funds preferred stock at $5,000 a share that would pay a 7 percent annual dividend and a 25 percent discount for conversion to common stock. The company plans to do a public listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the fall of 2026, with the ticker symbol LAT. In an email to staff members on Thursday, which was viewed by The New York Times, Dr. Soon-Shiong said the foundation of The Los Angeles Times would remain “a steadfast commitment to rigorous, independent journalism and to the diversity of voices that reflect and strengthen the communities we serve.” Dr. Soon-Shiong, who bought The Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million, first indicated that he planned to take the newspaper public in a July interview with Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show,” saying an I.P.O. would “democratize” the paper. Under Dr. Soon-Shiong, who has plowed more than $750 million into the paper, The Los Angeles Times has struggled to become profitable and has had multiple rounds of layoffs and buyouts in its newsroom. Dr. Soon-Shiong has also become more involved in the publication’s content. He blocked its editorial pages from endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. He also voiced his concern that its opinion section had become an “ echo chamber and not a trusted source” and needed more conservative writers. Earlier on Thursday, a majority of the Los Angeles Times Guild voted to authorize a strike over protracted contract negotiations. Matt Hamilton, an investigative reporter at the newspaper and chair of the guild, said in a statement, “These negotiations have dragged on for far too long, and today’s vote results show that our members are fed up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/media/la-times-ipo.html,Business,BBC,By Katie Robertson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Biz-LATimes-hkcm/10Biz-LATimes-hkcm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T03:56:54+00:00,06dd7a15530f53fb324cd695e0170b8eaeaf4021
50abffc93495,Inflation Report Will Be Released Despite Shutdown,"us economy, consumer price index, us politics, inflation, closings, social security, bls, labor department, donald trump, william wiatrowski","The Bureau of Labor Statistics is calling back a limited number of workers to help release consumer price data for September, despite the federal government shutdown, according to administration sources familiar with the plan. It isn’t clear when the Consumer Price Index report, originally scheduled for Oct. 15, will be released. But it will almost certainly be in time for the Federal Reserve’s next meeting at the end of the month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has stopped all operations during the lapse in funding, leaving economists and policymakers without key data at a critical moment for the economy. The shutdown already delayed the release of the closely watched monthly jobs report last week. The inflation report was expected to be the next casualty before the statistical agency began calling back some employees back to work to produce the report. The decision to release the data is tied to the annual process of adjusting Social Security benefits to account for changes in the cost of living . Under federal law, the Social Security Administration must publish the planned adjustment by Nov. 1. That adjustment is based on inflation data from the third quarter, however. As a result, a significant delay in the September consumer price data could make it impossible for the Social Security Administration to meet the deadline. An administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the cost-of-living adjustment would be severely affected if the Consumer Price Index data was not collected and released by Nov. 1. The raw price data used in the report has already been collected but must still be processed and analyzed. Employees called back to work include economists and information technology specialists, according to an administration source familiar with the plan. Data collection will remain suspended, which could lead to a delay in the next month’s C.P.I. report. Federal agencies have designated tens of thousands of workers as “essential,” meaning they must continue to work during the shutdown — although they will not be paid until funding is restored. In a contingency plan published last month, the Department of Labor indicated that the Bureau of Labor Statistics would suspend all operations — including regularly scheduled data releases — during the lapse in funding and would not release economic data. Only one bureau employee, the acting commissioner, was initially expected to continue working. Social Security payments continue during the shutdown, however. Publishing the September C.P.I. data is necessary to allow the administration to continue to pay benefits accurately, according to a second administration official. The recalled B.L.S. employees will work only on the September inflation release, the official said. The statistical agency is currently led by William J. Wiatrowski, the deputy commissioner, who took over on an acting basis after President Trump fired its Senate-confirmed commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, in August. Mr. Trump initially selected E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist, to take over the agency, but withdrew the nomination last month after it faced bipartisan criticism.

6cccdab017ff,"Customers May Openly Carry Firearms in Florida’s Publix Stores, Company Says","gun control, decisions and verdicts, supermarkets, legislation, publix super markets, james uthmeier, florida","Floridians buying groceries and other household items will be able to openly carry firearms while walking the aisles at Publix, the largest supermarket chain in the state, the company said on Thursday. The news came about two weeks after a state appeals court ruled that a Florida ban on people openly carrying firearms was unconstitutional. The Sept. 10 decision from the First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee overturned restrictions in effect since 1987. In response to an inquiry about the ruling, Publix said in a statement on Thursday that the company complies with state law, including the open-carry decision that took effect last month . “As of Sept. 25, 2025, Florida law allows the open carry of firearms,” according to the statement. “Publix follows all federal, state and local laws.” “Treating customers with dignity and respect is a founding belief at Publix,” it continued. “In any instance where a customer creates a threatening, erratic or dangerous shopping experience, whether they are openly carrying a firearm or not, we will engage local law enforcement to protect our customers and associates.” A spokeswoman for Publix did not elaborate beyond the statement. In a social media post after the ruling last month, James Uthmeier, the state’s new attorney general, cited the court ruling in saying that open carry was now “the law of the state.” The ruling related to a 2022 case in which a man looking to challenge the ban was in a livestream visibly carrying a holstered pistol and a copy of the U.S. Constitution in downtown Pensacola. The law applies only to people who are legally allowed to buy or own a firearm. Under the law , businesses and private property owners also have the option whether to allow people to openly carry firearms on their premises, according to a guidance memorandum issued by Mr. Uthmeier . In it, he said that “private property owners” would “maintain the long-standing legal prerogative to compel individuals carrying firearms to leave their premises.” The Florida statute also carves out exceptions , saying people are not authorized to openly carry a handgun in police, sheriff and other law enforcement facilities, courthouses, polling places and schools as well as businesses that “dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises,” among others. In 1987, Florida passed the open-carry prohibition that made it illegal to visibly display firearms elsewhere. Publix, one of the largest supermarket chains in the country, operates 1,421 stores in eight states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, according to the company . More than 800 of its green and white-hued stores are in Florida, where most customers can easily recall the brand’s longtime slogan, “Where Shopping is a Pleasure.” The company’s new policy on carrying firearms was first reported by The South Florida Sun Sentinel and The Orlando Sentinel newspapers in Florida. Customers at one small bustling Publix store in Miami Beach had mixed reactions to the company’s news on Thursday. As she loaded her car with groceries around midday, Beatrice Ponce responded with, “What?” and a surprised look when told about the company’s decision. “I agree with people having the right to bear arms,” she said, “but I do not agree to go into a facility like Publix where there are kids, you’re shopping and there’s also alcohol.” Ms. Ponce, a delivery driver, 58, added, “You can have arms in your house to protect yourself, but to go out — that’s another story.” As he dismounted a scooter before entering the store, Rafael Fornes, 69, said he was in favor of the open-carry policy. “I feel safer,” said Mr. Fornes, a retired architecture professor, who said he was familiar with shooting guns from his native Cuba but does not believe in violence. He said he didn’t see the guns as the problem. “It’s the people who carry the guns,” he added. Certain other supermarket chains in the state, including Winn-Dixie, will continue to prohibit customers from openly carrying firearms at their stores. “As a private business, our policy remains unchanged: We do not permit open carry of firearms inside our stores,” Southeastern Grocers, which owns Winn-Dixie, said in a statement on Thursday. Walmart did not comment on the state law, but the company policy on its website , updated in September 2019, says the company requests “that customers no longer openly carry firearms into Walmart or Sam’s Club locations in states where open carry is permitted.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/publix-stores-open-carry-florida.html,Business,BBC,By Johnny Diaz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09xp-publix-zwhj/09xp-publix-zwhj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T21:02:17+00:00,0b72861ccda251c173c1f684ecb586b2274a75f3
77a51289e947,Big Investors Await Windfall From Trump’s Argentina Bailout,"argentina, foreign aid, foreign investment, us politics, us foreign policy, economy, hedge fund, exchange stabilization fund united states treasury, treasury department, soros fund management, scott bessent, javier milei, stanley f druckenmiller, robert citrone, discovery capital","The Trump administration moved forward on Thursday with its bailout of Argentina, making a direct purchase of pesos and finalizing terms of a $20 billion lifeline, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. The terms and conditions of the economic support package were not announced, but Mr. Bessent said the funds would come in the form of a currency swap with Argentina’s central bank. Big global investors have been anxiously awaiting the details of the bailout, which critics have said will benefit wealthy fund managers at a time when American farmers are struggling and the U.S. government is shut down. Officials from both countries spent the last four days racing to finalize terms of the bailout ahead of high-stakes legislative elections in Argentina later this month and a visit to Washington next week by President Javier Milei, Argentina’s libertarian leader who is a close ally of President Trump. “Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity,” Mr. Bessent wrote on X. “The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets.” The Treasury secretary added that American business leaders have told him that they want to deepen ties with Argentina and that the Trump administration will stand behind its Latin American ally. But the administration’s decision to rescue Argentina’s economy is raising concerns about whether the real aim is to help rich investors whose bets on Argentina could falter if its economy sinks. Those efforts have been complicated by the fact that major hedge funds, including those led by friends of Mr. Bessent, stand to benefit financially from an Argentina economic lifeline. Funds at investment firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco are heavily invested in Argentina, as are investors such as Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both of whom worked with Mr. Bessent when he was an investor for George Soros. The Treasury’s intervention on Thursday offered a lifeline to Argentina’s financial markets, which have floundered as the country has faced a severe cash crunch. Dollar-denominated bonds set to expire in 2035 rebounded to levels last seen when Mr. Bessent first announced the United States would be stepping in. The peso also rebounded, although currency experts worry that it will soon come under pressure again without a longer-term fix for the country’s financial woes. The prospect that the Trump administration would rescue Argentina’s economy and aid wealthy investors at a time when federal workers aren’t getting paid amid a shutdown and struggling American farmers are awaiting an economic relief package has drawn criticism from Democrats, farm industry groups and others. On Thursday, a group of eight Democratic senators introduced legislation that would prevent the Treasury Department from using its Exchange Stabilization Fund to shore up Argentina’s finances. “It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the banking committee, who helped draft the legislation. “Trump promised ‘America First,’ but he’s putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill.” The legislation is unlikely to pass, but it demonstrates the political headwinds that Republicans could be facing over Argentina. Ahead of his meeting with Luis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister, Mr. Bessent insisted last weekend that the proposed $20 billion central bank swap line did not amount to a bailout of Argentina or a gift to wealthy investors. “This trope that we’re helping out wealthy Americans with interest down there couldn’t be more false,” Mr. Bessent told CNBC. “What we’re doing is maintaining a U.S. strategic interest in the Western Hemisphere.” International investors have long looked at Argentina as a place to make a profit, particularly related to government debt that successive leaders have taken on. In many instances, investors are not the original bondholders, but have bought at a discount from the nation’s original lenders, and are wagering that the liens will eventually be repaid or renegotiated. That view is beginning to pay off. One Fidelity fund this summer credited winnings from the country’s debt with helping compensate for losses from investments in other so-called emerging market countries including Venezuela and Ukraine. In particular, wealthy Americans with close ties to Mr. Bessent stand to win big. Mr. Druckenmiller was a mentor to Mr. Bessent at Soros Fund Management. A government filing in June of this year indicated that the Duquesne family office, which he runs, was the second largest investor in Argentina’s principal exchange-traded fund, a pool of Argentine stocks. Mr. Citrone, the founder of Discovery Capital Management, has made Latin America his biggest bet in the world, and Argentina is the fund’s biggest investment in the region. Mr. Citrone has said that when he worked with Mr. Bessent under Mr. Soros in 2013, he convinced them to make their now famous bet against the Japanese yen and that he was responsible for most of the bonus that Mr. Bessent earned. “I kind of convinced George and Scott Bessent at the time to go big on that. And, you know, Scott says I’m responsible for 75 percent of his bonus at Soros, kind of jokingly, over that time,” Mr. Citrone said in an interview on a podcast hosted by Goldman Sachs in May, according to the transcript posted on the bank’s website . It is unclear if Mr. Citrone played any role in convincing Mr. Bessent to prop up Argentina’s currency. But two people familiar with the deal said Mr. Citrone was in close contact with Mr. Bessent in the lead-up to the Treasury announcement last month, arguing that if Argentina’s currency crashed, so too would the political fortunes of Mr. Milei. Mr. Citrone told Mr. Bessent that if Mr. Milei were to lose the upcoming elections, Argentina would pivot to China for more economic assistance, according to one of the people familiar with the contacts. Mr. Citrone also apparently told Mr. Bessent that such an outcome would mean the United States could lose one of its most steadfast Latin American allies. A Treasury Department spokesman, Elliott Hulse, did not respond to requests for comment about Mr. Bessent’s conversations about Argentina with Mr. Druckenmiller or Mr. Citrone. A spokesman for Mr. Citrone declined to comment. Mr. Druckenmiller said that he had no communication with Mr. Bessent about Argentina before or after last month’s bailout announcement. Argentine media reported earlier on Mr. Bessent’s ties to Mr. Citrone. Mr. Milei’s party suffered a devastating loss in a key provincial election in September, and analysts are projecting that his party will face another disappointing result in legislative polls later this month. Such a loss would likely prevent Mr. Milei from continuing his pro-market, austerity-focused plans, which Mr. Trump’s administration has praised and, in many ways, replicated. Some conservative observers were critical of Treasury’s plans to support Argentina, arguing that the deal could instead end up supporting the country’s leftist, pro-spending political opposition, which is likely to sweep polls later this month. Mr. Citrone and leaders of the Conservative Political Action Conference, better known as CPAC, may have also been instrumental in lobbying both the International Monetary Fund and Mr. Bessent to bail out Argentina, according to the two people familiar with the agreement. In April, the I.M.F. shored up Argentina’s economy with its own $20 billion bailout agreement. The 48-month loan was Argentina’s 23rd such economic support package from the fund since the 1950s. Just days after the I.M.F. deal was announced in April, Mr. Citrone flew down to Buenos Aires to meet with Mr. Milei on a plane owned by one of the leaders of Tactic Global, known as CPAC’s lobbying arm, according to an adviser to the Trump administration and Argentine media reports. The plane was owned by Leonardo Scatturice, one of the founders of Tactic, who has made a fortune off lucrative government contracts doled out by Mr. Milei’s government. Mr. Citrone met with the Argentine president just hours before Mr. Bessent, who had flown separately to the country’s capital. During that visit, Mr. Bessent announced the I.M.F. deal. Those funds are intended to help Argentina loosen its currency controls while maintaining the government’s plans to scale back subsidies and spending. Last month, Mr. Bessent said the United States would provide more economic support to Argentina in the form of a $20 billion financial lifeline. The Treasury secretary added that Washington hoped the additional support would prevent Argentina from giving up mining rights to China. Argentina’s economy has largely been propped up over the years by an $18 billion currency swap provided by China. The United States has not said if there will be any guardrails to protect taxpayer money. Mr. Bessent emphasized that the currency swap the government plans to offer Argentina does not amount to a bailout. “We are not putting money into Argentina,” Mr. Bessent told CNBC. The politics of supporting Argentina has become especially fraught in the United States because China has been buying soybeans from Argentine farmers instead of American growers this year. The fact that Argentina is the most frequent recipient of I.M.F. bailouts and also the institution’s largest debtor raises questions about whether it could ever repay the United States. “They can call it what they want, but it’s a bailout,” said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It’s a country in crisis, it’s running out of dollars, and the U.S. is giving the country dollars. That’s a bailout by definition.” In negotiations over the terms of a support package, U.S. officials have been pushing for Argentina to scale back ties with China and have been seeking access to its uranium and lithium supplies, according to a person familiar with the matter. In Argentina, legislators and governors have more say in those contracts than Mr. Milei does, and the U.S. Treasury’s support for the Argentine president may not translate into more American companies securing mining rights. Mr. Bessent said on Thursday that bolstering Argentina is a matter of national and economic security. “The success of Argentina’s reform agenda is of systemic importance, and a strong, stable Argentina which helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in the strategic interest of the United States,” Mr. Bessent said.

faa71ca578d8,Crypto Investor Known as ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Reaches Deal With Prosecutors,"virtual currency;cryptocurrency;crypto, bitcoin, tax evasion, regulation and deregulation, us politics, sec, justice department, roger ver, donald trump","Roger Ver, a prominent cryptocurrency investor, has reached a tentative agreement with the Justice Department to table a criminal tax fraud case that federal prosecutors brought against him last year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Ver, 46, known as “Bitcoin Jesus” in crypto circles for his early evangelism, was charged by federal prosecutors in 2024 with fraud and tax evasion for failing to pay $48 million in taxes that he owed on his digital currency holdings. Under the terms of the deferred-prosecution agreement, Mr. Ver would pay about that much to the government, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal. Under the deal, which has not been filed with the court and could still change, the charges would eventually be dropped if Mr. Ver complied with the terms of the agreement. The case is poised to become the latest example of how the Trump administration has systematically dismantled a yearslong government crackdown on the crypto industry, a sector rife with fraud, scams and theft . Like other beneficiaries of the rollback, Mr. Ver sought to curry favor with President Trump by linking his case to the president’s grievances about the weaponization of the justice system. This year, Mr. Ver paid $600,000 to Roger Stone , a longtime associate of Mr. Trump, to try to abolish the tax provisions at the heart of the case. And the crypto investor hired David Schoen, a lawyer who represented Mr. Trump during his second impeachment trial. Lobbying filings show that Mr. Ver also hired Christopher M. Kise, a lawyer who defended Mr. Trump against various criminal and civil charges, as well as the lobbying firm run by Brian Ballard, a major Trump fund-raiser.

dc95c1e44c67,"Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., Wily Texas Oilman, Is Dead at 101","oscar s wyatt jr, oil and gasoline, international trade, bribery and kickbacks, coastal corporation, texas, saddam hussein, iraq, obituary","Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., the Texas oil tycoon who courted presidents and dictators, dabbled in foreign intrigue and went to prison for paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi government under the cover of a United Nations oil-for-food program, died on Wednesday in Houston. He was 101. His death was confirmed by his sons Trey and Steven Wyatt. One of the last of the storied wildcatters, Mr. Wyatt was a sagacious, rough-hewn entrepreneur who took out an $800 loan in 1955 and founded a pipeline company that became the Coastal Corporation. Over the next four decades, he built it into a national energy conglomerate, a Fortune 500 competitor of Enron and El Paso Gas, and his conduit for oil imported from the Middle East. Mr. Wyatt made billions selling energy to the Americas. His hydra-headed empire supplied heating oil to the Northeast, petroleum and natural gas to the Southwest, and marine diesel in the Caribbean. It owned vast pipeline networks, fleets of oil tankers and trucks, and 962 Coastal gasoline stations in 33 states. In the 1990s, Coastal had as many as 20,000 employees and revenues that exceeded $12 billion. With friends in Washington, private jets, a 9,000-acre ranch, a villa in the south of France and legions of detectives, lawyers and public relations retainers, Mr. Wyatt personified Texas. He rode horses, hunted game, packed a pistol and threw lavish parties for Prince Rainier of Monaco and Grace Kelly, Liza Minnelli, Johnny Carson, John Travolta, Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol and Truman Capote. And he made money hand over fist. “If Oscar were marooned in Alaska,” his fourth wife, Lynn Wyatt, told The Wall Street Journal in 1984, “he’d survive somehow and by the next week he’d probably be doing business.” But Mr. Wyatt also reneged on contracts, left municipalities short of power, raided corporate rivals, battled lawsuits and hostile takeovers, paid fines and civil misconduct penalties, and left a trail of enemies. Many Texans likened him to J.R. Ewing, the amoral oil baron in the television series “Dallas.” Texas Monthly magazine once called him “meaner than a junkyard dog.” Mr. Wyatt offered no excuses. “As a corporate manager,” he told The New York Times in 1985, “you have to have one objective — to be profitable or popular. I’ve chosen to be profitable.” He scoured the globe for oil; became a fixture at Vienna meetings of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC; and began importing Chinese crude soon after Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979. In the 1980s, he traded with Libya, even as its mercurial leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, defied the Reagan administration. Acquaintances said Mr. Wyatt boasted of his contacts and conflicts with Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and with governors, members of Congress and other officials. He contributed to the campaigns of both Democrats and Republicans and nurtured ties with foreign leaders. His chief associate and friend in the Middle East was Saddam Hussein, whom he met in 1972 after Iraq’s oil industry was nationalized. As Mr. Hussein consolidated his power, Coastal Corporation reaped rewards in the 1970s and ’80s, becoming one of the United States’ largest importers of Iraqi oil. In 1990, after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, Mr. Wyatt urged the first President Bush — just as he urged his presidential son two decades later — not to invade Iraq. When Iraq took 21 American oil workers hostage in a futile attempt to stave off a war, Mr. Wyatt, over Washington’s objections, went to Baghdad, negotiated with Mr. Hussein and secured their release . He came home a hero and wept with their families. After Iraq’s defeat in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the United Nations, hoping to demilitarize Iraq, imposed sanctions that halted oil exports, the country’s main source of foreign exchange. With ordinary Iraqis affected by the sanctions, the U.N. lifted its ban on Iraqi oil exports in 1995, but only to secure food, medicine and humanitarian aid. Letting Mr. Hussein pick the oil buyers, however, opened the door to fraud. In December 1996, a Wyatt tanker was the first to sail out of Mina al-Bakr, Iraq’s main export terminal, under the oil-for-food program. Years later, after an American-led coalition invaded Iraq and deposed Mr. Hussein, investigators found that he had secretly demanded “surcharges” from dealers buying Iraqi crude under the program. They were actually bribes, prosecutors said, and while many buyers balked at paying them, Mr. Wyatt did not. In 2007, he was indicted on federal charges of paying millions in bribes to Mr. Hussein from 2001 to 2003, when the oil-for-food program was discontinued. A year after Mr. Hussein was executed in Baghdad for the murders of his own people, Mr. Wyatt was tried in New York. Facing decades in prison, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud. He admitted paying $200,000 in kickbacks to the Hussein government in 2001. Four other charges, including trading with the enemy, were dropped. Sentenced to a year and a day, half the maximum under federal guidelines, he served 10 months and was released in 2008. “I didn’t want to waste any more time at 83 years old fooling with this operation,” Mr. Wyatt said . “The quicker I got it over with, the better.” Oscar Sherman Wyatt Jr. was born in Beaumont, Texas, on July 11, 1924, to Oscar Sr. and Eva (Coday) Wyatt. Abandoned by his father and raised by his mother in Navasota, Texas, he worked on a farm and in a gasoline station, earned a pilot’s license at 16 and flew a crop duster. He was an Army Air Forces bomber pilot in the Pacific in World War II. After the war, he was nearly killed in a hurricane while working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. He worked his way through Texas A&M University, earning a mechanical engineering degree in 1949. In 1950, he roamed oil fields, selling drill bits. Seeing an opportunity, he bought unwanted natural gas being flared at wellheads and sold it to a pipeline operator. In 1955, Mr. Wyatt founded the Coastal States Gas Producing Company — later renamed Coastal Corporation. As an engineer, pipeline operator, driller and refiner, he was involved in all phases of its operations, and could calculate contract details in his head or order operational changes based on telltale smokestack emissions. Mr. Wyatt was married four times, lastly in 1963 to Lynn Sakowitz, who survives him and with whom he had his sons Oscar III, known as Trey, and Bradford. In addition to them, he is survived by a daughter, Christina Kremers-Wyatt; two adopted sons, Steven and Douglas, his wife’s children by a previous marriage; and two grandchildren. Mr. Wyatt had costly business stumbles. In the 1970s, unable to fulfill gas contracts to San Antonio, Austin and other cities, Coastal was sued, assessed civil penalties and ordered to refund more than $1.2 billion to customers. In 1980, he pleaded guilty to federal oil-pricing violations and paid $9 million in refunds to the Treasury and $1 million in penalties. In 2001, Coastal merged with El Paso Corporation in a $24 billion deal. By then, Mr. Wyatt had retired as chief executive and chairman and was under investigation for bribery. He served as a consultant on energy exploration after his imprisonment, and in 2013 reaped a $500 million windfall for his stake in the $2.2 billion sale of an energy company to Abu Dhabi interests. Throughout his career, Mr. Wyatt remained an admired if formidable rival to energy magnates in Texas and beyond. “He is incredibly tenacious,” Kenneth L. Lay told The Times in 1985, when he was chairman of the Houston Natural Gas Corporation, years before he fell from grace as the founder of scandal-plagued Enron. “Once Wyatt decides he wants to accomplish something, he continues to pursue it until he gets what he wants or runs into a brick wall.” Ash Wu contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/oscar-s-wyatt-jr-dead.html,Business,BBC,By Robert D.

After meeting with the heads of Germany’s carmakers and other stakeholders in the auto industry, Chancellor Friedrich Merz vowed on Thursday to urge the European Union to back off a policy prohibiting all new vehicles sold after 2035 from producing carbon emissions. The regulation has been widely interpreted as a ban on combustion engines. “I will be pushing for decisions to be taken in the European Union that will enable comprehensive technological advancement and climate neutrality,” Mr. Merz told reporters. “Not with a date on the calendar that we cannot achieve, that is unrealistic, but with a clear perspective that also opens up the necessary future prospects for companies in Germany.” Stung by a drop in demand from customers in China, the world’s largest auto market, German automakers have seen sales of their cars decline steadily in recent years. President Trump’s tariffs have only made things worse. Porsche on Thursday joined BMW and Mercedes-Benz in reporting weaker sales in China, where customers prefer less expensive local brands like BYD and Xiaomi . On Wednesday, BMW’s shares plunged 7 percent after it cut its forecast for profit and cash flow, citing the U.S. tariffs. The pain is being felt in communities across Germany, where the auto industry shed some 51,500 jobs from June 2024 to 2025, according to a study from EY .

6189f1918009,22% Jump in Electricity Rates Dominates New Jersey Governor’s Race,"new jersey, electric power, price, us politics, gubernatorial races, consumer protection, pjm interconnection, jack ciattarelli, mikie sherrill, donald trump, josh shapiro, mid-atlantic states (us), pennsylvania, 2026 midterm elections","Most politicians rarely discuss electricity costs. But in New Jersey, they have been featured prominently in campaign ads and stump speeches in the run-up to November’s election for governor. This generally obscure topic has become critical in New Jersey because electricity rates this summer climbed 22 percent from a year earlier — faster than all but one state: Maine. As the governor’s race has tightened and affordability has become a key issue, power costs have become a predominant theme in ads paid for in part by groups associated with both national parties. What happens in New Jersey is likely to be an early read of the national political mood in 2026, when a majority of governors’ mansions will be up for grabs as well as congressional and state legislative seats. That’s because electricity rates are rising sharply in many states — the national average residential rate was up 5 percent in July from the same month last year, and energy experts say rates are likely to keep climbing quickly for the foreseeable future. The rising cost of living has been a pressing concern for many Americans over the past couple of years, remaining so this year in large part because of President Trump’s decision to sharply raise tariffs on imported goods. “Electricity is the new eggs,” said David Springe, executive director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, referring to the anger over inflation that helped Mr. Trump win last year’s election. But the causes of escalating energy costs are complex and hard for any elected official to capitalize on. That hasn’t stopped New Jersey’s Democratic and Republican candidates for governor — Representative Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli — from trying. “I’ll massively expand cheaper, cleaner power generation,” Ms. Sherrill said as she announced a plan to use a state of emergency declaration to freeze electricity costs for at least a year. Mr. Ciattarelli, who is running for governor for the third time, has sought to blame the rising costs on Democrats like Ms. Sherrill. Democrats have controlled the governor’s office in New Jersey for eight years and the State Legislature for 23. Seven years ago, during Gov. Philip D. Murphy’s first term as governor, New Jersey’s large natural gas and nuclear power plants made it a net exporter of electricity. But higher energy demand and the closing of several power plants in recent years have made the state a net importer of electricity, according to an analysis by the Energy Information Administration. “We’re having to import our electricity and paying through the nose to do it,” Mr. Ciattarelli said at a recent news conference. But importing electricity is not necessarily responsible for New Jersey’s rising electricity rates. Other states like West Virginia can generate more energy than they use but have also experienced big price increases. Most governors can do little to bring down electricity prices quickly. Rates are made up of many costs, only some of which retail electric utilities and state officials have control over. The cost of electricity is typically proposed by utility companies or government-run power agencies and approved by state and city regulators. While those regulators are typically appointed by governors or mayors, they often cannot deny rate increase requests or force utilities to charge lower prices. “Let’s be clear: The cost of electricity is not set by the governor in any state,” said Mark Cooper, a senior fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “Everyone will say, ‘We will lower the prices,’ but the question is how? The answer is it’s a long process.” New Jersey and a dozen other states are part of the nation’s largest regional electric grid, which is managed by PJM Interconnection, a nonprofit organization. PJM manages the electric grid for 67 million people from Virginia Beach to Chicago, and it effectively sets a significant portion of retail electricity rates over which governors and their appointed regulators have little sway. PJM’s members include utility companies, owners of power plants and power lines, energy traders, and others in the energy industry. One big reason electricity prices are climbing in New Jersey and other PJM states is an annual auction in which power plant owners submit prices they are willing to accept for supplying electricity at times of peak demand, which typically happens in the summer. The prices set by that auction have climbed sharply in recent years, leading to higher retail energy rates. At least three-quarters of the 22 percent increase in New Jersey’s average electricity rate can be attributed to the PJM auction. At New Jersey’s four primary investor-owned utilities, power system costs have added hundreds of dollars a year to household bills. Customers of those utilities who use 650 kilowatt-hours of power a month as of June 1 pay between $22.67 and $28.02 a month more than before that date. New Jersey isn’t alone in feeling that pain. Several governors have grown increasingly critical of PJM. They say that the grid manager has made it too hard for new wind and solar projects to connect to and deliver cheaper electricity to the grid. In December, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, sued PJM over its annual auction in July. Mr. Shapiro and PJM reached a settlement that capped the price set by the auction, a deal that Mr. Shapiro said would save PJM customers an estimated $21 billion over two years. A spokesman for PJM said it was reforming its markets and the process for adding new energy sources and resolving imbalances between electricity supply and demand. “Electricity prices are rising, not only in New Jersey but across PJM and throughout the rest of the United States, because demand is outpacing supply,” the spokesman, Dan Lockwood, said in a statement. “PJM understands the challenges that higher energy prices pose to the people and businesses of any state or jurisdiction we serve, and we are working with our stakeholders on multiple fronts to alleviate this supply/demand imbalance.” The issues with PJM are just one reason for electricity price increases. The cost for long-overdue improvements to power systems and upgrades needed to support energy-hungry data centers are also driving up household electric bills. New Jersey and several other East Coast states are also on the receiving end of Mr. Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects. Last month, he instructed a half-dozen federal agencies to draft plans to derail efforts to install hundreds of wind turbines in waters stretching from Maine to North Carolina. Governors of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island signed a letter urging the Trump administration to remove barriers to offshore wind projects already under development and construction. Ms. Sherrill supports offshore wind, but Mr. Ciattarelli is aligned with Mr. Trump’s position. The fight over offshore wind could further raise electricity bills, energy experts said. After more than a decade of little growth in demand for electricity, the East desperately needs more energy because of the building boom in data centers — about 60 gigawatts or the equivalent of almost the entire electricity demand in California, said Gregory Poulos, executive director of the Consumer Advocates of PJM States, an organization of state officials who represent electricity customers. “I’m very worried that we’re looking at superhigh costs and blackouts in the region,” Mr. Poulos said. Public Service Enterprise Group, the utility company that serves about 70 percent of New Jersey’s electricity users, said it offered customers payment relief and energy efficiency programs. But the power company said it did not control more than half of the amount customers paid for electricity service, including results of the PJM’s grid capacity auction. “We’re working hard to keep bills as low as possible on the portion of the bill that we manage and control,” said Dave Johnson, chief customer experience officer at the utility company. Ashley Koning is the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, which has conducted polls on the governor’s race. She said voters were hyper-aware of affordability and utility costs were among their most tangible concerns. “That increase that you’re seeing,” she said about monthly utility bills, “is probably more affecting and more damaging to you than seeing your tax bill go up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/new-jersey-electricity-prices-governor-election.html,Business,BBC,By Ivan Penn and Tracey Tully,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/business/00biz-nj-energy-promo/00biz-nj-energy-promo-facebookJumbo.png,2025-10-09T15:44:36+00:00,5f30cace0f975957f4a51a7098c998a497dd352e
86ba7ce80b4f,How to Manage a Divided Fed,"internal tag to designate no storyline, us politics, interest rate, inflation, jobs, federal reserve, jerome powell, john williams, stephen miran","Andrew here. An Israel-Hamas deal could pave the way for an exchange of hostages and prisoners, creating the opportunity for a real peace agreement. It could be an extraordinary moment — if it happens and endures. Long-lasting stability in the region could also make the Middle East an even more powerful force in the world economy. Meanwhile, we’re focused on the debate inside the Fed over how many times to lower interest rates this year — and what concerns policymakers have about the strength of the economy. More on that and other news below. A question of cutting rates Futures markets suggest that the Fed will follow through on more rate cuts at the last two meetings of the central bank’s chief policy committee of the year. But new signs are emerging that such a move doesn’t necessarily have unanimous support , and that Fed policymakers are keenly aware of the risks that step might present. What’s new: Data released right after the Fed’s rate-setting committee met last month showed official support by nearly every member for cutting interest rates by a quarter point to 4 percent to 4.25 percent. Most support bringing borrowing costs down to 3.5 to 3.75 percent by year end. But minutes from the meeting published on Wednesday show it’s a bit more nuanced than that: “A few participants stated there was merit in keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision,” they read. Seven of 19 policymakers indicated that they saw a need for no more cuts for the rest of the year. The debate continues over whether inflation or a slowing job market is the bigger threat. Some Fed policymakers remain uncertain about how President Trump’s tariffs will affect prices, as well as whether longer-term inflation may be here to stay. Others are looking at the labor market. John Williams, the New York Fed president, told The Times that he was keeping an eye on a gradual slowdown in hiring over the past year. He felt that the market’s trajectory justified cutting rates in September. There’s still some concern about a lack of federal economic stats. The federal shutdown forced the Bureau of Labor Statistics to withhold the jobs report for September; unless it’s resolved soon, the Consumer Price Index most likely won’t be published on Oct. 15 as scheduled either. For now, Williams professed comfort with relying on alternative data. “I think we have a reasonably good picture of what’s happening, especially around the things that matter the most to us,” he told The Times. All this points to the delicate balance Jay Powell must continue to manage. The Fed chair has said that there are “no risk-free paths” now for the central bank, and that missteps could either ramp up inflation or choke the economy. Then there’s the President Trump factor. The president has made clear that he wants bigger cuts ASAP, something Stephen Miran, a close ally who is temporarily a Fed governor, has also supported. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been interviewing candidates to succeed Powell as Fed chair in May, The Financial Times reports, with a focus on interest rates and balance-sheet policy. Hanging over the process is a question about the Fed’s future political independence, a feature Williams strongly defended: “What we’ve seen from experience is that independent central banks are better at achieving the goals that the people and the government want to achieve,” he told The Times. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Trump administration won’t impose tariffs on generic drug imports. The White House decided to exempt such medicines from levies after some officials warned that such a move could lead to price increases and drug shortages, The Wall Street Journal reports. The decision, which isn’t yet final, is the latest good news for the drug industry, after a deal between Pfizer and the White House to lower the prices of some drugs and sell medicines directly to patients. Harvard weighs seeking assurances from the White House as they negotiate a settlement. School officials have discussed internally whether to ask Trump administration officials to ensure that the school won’t be subject to further demands if a deal is reached, The Times reports. The discussions within Harvard arose after the White House asked nine schools to embrace a “compact” to more strongly align themselves with Trump policy objectives. (Harvard’s new negotiator is Steve Schwarzman, the billionaire investor and Republican donor.) Elon Musk settles a pay fight with former Twitter executives. Four former Twitter leaders agreed to end a lawsuit over more than $128 million in severance pay they say they were owed, after settling for undisclosed terms. The move ends another legal battle over Musk’s takeover of the social network, now called X, which led to mass layoffs and disputes over exit pay. Shutdown update The Senate again failed to advance competing measures to end the week-old government shutdown. But lawmakers are facing pressure to strike a deal as worries grow about the consequences of the closure. Here’s the latest: Senior Republican lawmakers, including Senator John Thune, the majority leader, have pressed the Trump administration not to follow through on its threats of mass layoffs and deep cuts to government programs for fear of a backlash from voters, The Wall Street Journal reports. About 13,000 flights were delayed from Monday to Wednesday, as the F.A.A. dealt with air traffic staffing shortages. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News on Wednesday that while historically about 5 percent of flight delays can be attributed to controller shortages, the “last couple of days it’s been 53 percent.” Turmoil caused by air traffic staffing shortages is credited with helping to end a 35-day shutdown in 2019. The I.R.S. announced on Wednesday that it was furloughing nearly half of its work force and shuttering most of its operations. Taxpayer services such as call-site operations would be closed, Politico reports. In a memo, the service told employees that their furlough back pay was guaranteed by law . Expectations for a long shutdown are growing. About half of bettors on Kalshi now expect the shutdown to last more than 25 days , while more than a third are betting that it will go on for more than 30 days. Reflection AI raises $2 billion Concerns are growing about how long the fervor for artificial intelligence businesses may last. But Reflection AI, a year-old start-up that focuses on creating open-source A.I. models that others can freely modify, is the latest sign that there’s still plenty of investor interest, Michael de la Merced reports. Reflection will announce on Thursday that it has raised $2 billion, seven months after its last funding round. The latest deal values the start-up at $8 billion, including the new money, significantly higher than the roughly $545 million valuation it fetched in March, according to PitchBook. The round included Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the A.I. boom that has recently been pouring billions into other start-ups. (It invested $800 million, the biggest check in the round, and had several engineers work with Reflection AI to optimize its most recent generation of A.I. chips, DealBook hears.) Other participants in the round included existing backers like Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital, as well as new investors like DST Global, the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt and 1789 Capital, the investment firm that counts Donald Trump Jr. as a partner. Reflection says it wants to be the American answer to DeepSeek, the Chinese A.I. start-up whose open-source model shocked the world with its abilities. Western open-source models so far aren’t nearly as capable, argued Misha Laskin, Reflection AI’s co-founder and C.E.O. That means many companies and institutions around the globe are becoming dependent on Chinese-built A.I. models rather than on Western-built ones. Reflection AI, whose founders came from the Google DeepMind A.I. lab, insists that it is developing a solution: “There’s a DeepSeek-shaped hole in the U.S., which I think is what makes it critical for a lab like ours to exist,” Laskin told DealBook. The round underscores A.I. companies’ huge need for resources, including computing power and talent — in other words, money. A.I. foundation model companies have raised $71.9 billion worldwide so far this year, according to the data provider PitchBook; by comparison, the sector collected $34.9 billion last year. That raises questions about whether a smaller business like Reflection AI can keep up with bigger start-ups like OpenAI, let alone giants like Google or Meta. But Laskin argued that demand for open-source models from large companies and governments will eventually give it a stable business. The clock ticks for Buenos Aires President Javier Milei of Argentina has bet much of his political future on promises about what he can secure from his relationship with the Trump administration. But Argentina’s central bank is burning through the last of its dollar reserves to prop up the country’s currency, the peso, as Milei awaits details about the size and timing of a financial lifeline from Washington. The latest: In recent days, Argentina’s central bank has sold about $2 billion in U.S. dollar reserves to support the weakening peso. The country has only about $680 million in reserves left, Reuters reports, giving it only a few more days’ runway at the current pace. Analysts widely expect Milei to devalue the peso, a move his administration has tried to delay until after midterm legislative elections that are set to take place this month. Anger over spiking prices under his predecessor, Alberto Fernández, ushered Milei into power, and hyperinflation has cost other presidents their jobs in the past. It’s unclear when U.S. aid will arrive. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month that the Trump administration was ready “to do what is necessary” to support Argentina. (Washington’s goal appears to be an effort to help a close ally — President Trump has called Milei his “favorite president” — and then to help him design a new currency system that ties Argentina more closely to the dollar.) Argentina’s economy minister, Luis Caputo, has been in Washington to negotiate a potential $20 billion currency swap , in which the U.S. would give Argentina hard currency in exchange for dollar-denominated bonds. But there are questions about that potential aid. U.S. soybean farmers have protested any help for Argentina, which sold more than 2.5 metric tons of soybeans to China after it suspended export taxes. That has been part of Beijing’s halt in U.S. soybean purchases, devastating American farmers . It’s also not clear how long the aid would last. If Argentines and currency traders continue to exchange their pesos for dollars, $20 billion from the U.S. could be depleted within months.

Model Start-Up, Raises $2 Billion","artificial intelligence, open-source software, venture capital, startup, computers and the internet, tech industry, reflection ai, nvidia, lightspeed venture partners, sequoia capital","For much of the past decade, American technology companies like OpenAI and Google have dominated the artificial intelligence industry. Then came DeepSeek, the Chinese start-up whose A.I. model was nearly as powerful as competing Western ones — and it was free to use. Now, Reflection AI, a year-old American start-up, is betting that it can create a Western equivalent of DeepSeek. And it has raised billions to do so. Reflection AI announced on Thursday that it had raised $2 billion in new funding, in a round that included Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the A.I. boom. The deal values Reflection AI at $8 billion, including the new money, significantly more than the roughly $545 million the company was valued at in March, according to the data provider PitchBook. The fund-raising is yet another sign of the investor fervor for all things A.I., as companies across the industry continue to collect eye-popping sums. Companies that build A.I. foundation models have raised $71.9 billion worldwide so far this year, according to PitchBook; by comparison, the sector collected $34.9 billion last year. But the move also shows that investors are willing to invest not only in the proprietary software sold by OpenAI and Google, but also in open-source models, which are free to share and modify. Skeptics of open-source A.I. say the approach could cause significant harm . Yet Reflection AI argues that the United States needs an equivalent to DeepSeek — an open-source model developer whose software can compete with top closed-source models — to maintain technological superiority around the world. Existing Western open-source A.I. models are underperforming DeepSeek and other Chinese rivals, which may lead to greater adoption of Chinese-created models, according to Misha Laskin, Reflection AI’s co-founder and chief executive. (Among the Western companies making open-source models are Meta , Mistral AI of France and even OpenAI , though that company is primarily focused on proprietary software.) “There’s a DeepSeek-shaped hole in the U.S., which I think is what makes it critical for a lab like ours to exist,” Mr. Laskin said in an interview, comparing the situation to the Cold War space race. But developing any A.I. model, open-source or not, requires ever-higher amounts of computing power and research talent — in short, money. That is why Reflection AI raised $2 billion just seven months after raising $130 million in March. In recent months, Reflection AI held talks with potential investors, and closed the round within a matter of weeks, Mr. Laskin said. Nvidia wrote the biggest check — $800 million — and had several engineers work with Reflection AI to optimize its most recent generation of A.I. chips, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal’s details. Other participants in the round included Disruptive Technology Advisers; Lightspeed Venture Partners; Sequoia Capital; DST; the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt; and 1789 Capital, the investment firm that counts Donald Trump Jr. as a partner. Mr. Laskin conceded that Reflection AI would need more money to keep competing, especially as rivals are also rushing to raise money: OpenAI alone secured an investment commitment of up to $100 billion last month from Nvidia. But he argued that demand for open-source models — including from big companies and governments that want greater control over their A.I. applications — will eventually lead to a sustainable business. The hope, he added, is that smaller A.I. companies eventually end up being the Amazons and Metas of the future: “I anticipate us to be potentially a bigger company than the hyperscalers of today,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/dealbook/reflection-ai-2-billion-funding.html,Business,BBC,By Michael J. de la Merced,https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,2025-10-09T12:01:02+00:00,9bba58994e43140dbb7aae6177c6d4227425c650
01c16b7fda32,Troubled Wind Developer Orsted to Cut 25% of Staff,"orsted, wind power, layoffs;furloughs, energy industry, renewable energy","Orsted, the Danish renewable energy developer, said on Thursday that it would cut about 2,000 jobs, or around 25 percent of its work force, over the next two years. The move was the latest sign of the diminished prospects for offshore wind, a low-emissions technology that Orsted helped pioneer. “We’ll be saying goodbye to many skilled and valued colleagues,” Rasmus Errboe, Orsted’s chief executive, said in a statement . Not long ago, Orsted looked on its way to becoming a global giant in the renewable energy industry, with a portfolio that includes high-profile projects in the United States. Now, the company suggested that it would dial back those aspirations and hunker down in its home base of Europe. Offshore wind farms, which cost billions of dollars to build, have lost some of their luster. The sector is under attack by President Trump, while adverse economic developments, including inflation and high interest rates, have eroded profitability. Mr. Errboe said that Orsted would be finishing up its construction projects in the coming years and so “we’ll need fewer employees.” Deepa Venkateswaran, a utility analyst at Bernstein, the Wall Street research firm, said that the last couple of years had “changed everything for them.” The Trump administration has actively opposed efforts to construct wind farms off the East Coast of the United States, ordering a halt earlier this year to one of Orsted’s projects, called Revolution Wind. The $6.2 billion development off Rhode Island was 80 percent completed at the time of Mr. Trump’s order, Orsted said. Although a federal judge said last month that Revolution Wind could proceed, and work has restarted, Orsted’s future in the United States, including a large wind farm it is building off New York, called Sunrise Wind, now looks uncertain. Rather than lining up future developments, Orsted is doing what it can to survive. It recently raised more than $9 billion from shareholders, including the Danish government, which owns just over 50 percent of the company’s shares. The company’s stock has lost about half of its value over the past year. Orsted employs around 8,000 people around the world, and it expects that number to fall to around 6,000 by the end of 2027. The company said the reductions would occur through attrition, sales of business units, outsourcing and redundancies.

Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, says he supports further interest rates cuts this year, even though inflation has moved away from the central bank’s 2 percent target in recent months. His rationale revolves around the labor market, where cracks have emerged. What Mr. Williams wants is to protect those cracks from deepening further. In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Mr. Williams said he did not believe the economy was on the verge of a recession. But the slowdown in monthly jobs growth, coupled with other signs that companies are more hesitant to hire, warrants attention, he said. The views of Mr. Williams are important given his role as president of the New York Fed, a position that confers a permanent vote on interest rates. He is also a close ally of Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair. Mr. Williams spoke at a fraught moment for the Fed, which is balancing dueling economic risks. On the one hand, Fed officials do not want to exacerbate the slowdown in the labor market. But they also want to avoid inadvertently stoking inflation, which has started to accelerate again because of President Trump’s tariffs. Mr. Williams said the Fed had the flexibility to shore up the labor market because the inflation outlook did not appear as dire as it did earlier in the year. Mr. Trump’s tariffs have raised some consumer prices, Mr. Williams said, but he expects the impact on inflation to fade over time despite the president’s new import taxes on products like furniture and drugs. Those tariffs build on steep levies that Mr. Trump put on imports from dozens of countries on Aug. 7, in addition to sector-specific ones. “The risks of a further slowdown in the labor market is something I’m very focused on,” Mr. Williams said. He later added that if the economy evolved as expected — inflation moving up to around 3 percent and the unemployment rate inching up beyond its current 4.3 percent — he would back “lower rates this year, but we’ll have to see exactly what that means.” Mr. Williams indicated that a lapse in official government data because of the shutdown would not deter him from wanting to take action at the Fed’s coming meetings. The shutdown, which has stretched into its second week, has already delayed the September jobs report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics may also have to withhold the Consumer Price Index report that is due for release on Wednesday if lawmakers do not reach a deal by then. Mr. Williams acknowledged that government statistics were the “gold standard of macroeconomic data.” But he said private-sector providers and surveys both from the Fed and from external sources like the Conference Board or the Institute for Supply Management were also informative. “We have a reasonably good picture of what’s happening, especially around the things that matter the most to us, which is maximum employment and price stability,” he added, referring to the Fed’s goals of a healthy labor market and low, stable inflation. Mr. Williams said that it was hard to predict how significantly the shutdown would drag down economic growth and that he was mainly focused on the possibility of cutbacks in government jobs, including at the state and local levels. Fed officials lack official government data at a particularly bad moment, as they debate how quickly to lower interest rates after cutting them last month for the first time this year. Policymakers meet twice more this year, with the next gathering scheduled for Oct. 28-29. Their quarter-point reduction last month, to a range of 4 percent to 4.25 percent, was framed as a “risk management” move, a description that Mr. Williams embraced on Wednesday. Like many officials — including Mr. Powell — he views the Fed’s policy settings as “modestly restrictive,” meaning borrowing costs are high enough to dampen economic activity but not torpedo it. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the $23 trillion economy, has stayed relatively resilient, although much more so for wealthier Americans than for lower-income households. Companies may not be hiring much, but they are not firing workers, either, helping to keep the unemployment rate relatively stable. Stock markets have also soared to new heights, while government and corporate bond yields have fallen. This backdrop has led some officials at the Fed to conclude that its policy settings are not restraining the economy all that much. They appear much more concerned about persistent price pressures and, as such, less inclined to lower interest rates further. But Mr. Williams countered that a softening labor market would help to keep a lid on inflation, even if price pressures across the services sector have stayed sticky. He also stressed that stock markets were not a good representation of how restrictive interest rates were and instead could reflect “real world factors” like investors’ piling into bets on artificial intelligence. “I don’t see any signs of second-round effects or factors that could be amplifying the effects of tariffs on inflation,” Mr. Williams said. “There’s more downside risks to the labor market and employment, and that is something that takes some of the upside risk off of inflation.” He said it was appropriate to bring interest rates back to a “neutral” setting, which neither speeds up growth nor slows it down over time. Most officials estimate that level to be around 3 percent, or 1 percent when adjusted for inflation. But there are a range of views among Fed officials. Mr. Williams has previously estimated the inflation-adjusted rate to be between 0.75 percent and 1 percent. The newest member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, Stephen Miran, recently argued that the neutral rate was closer to 0.5 percent, lowered by Mr. Trump’s immigration restrictions, the potential for tariff revenue to help pay down America’s debt and deregulatory efforts. That has become the basis for his support for interest rates that are roughly two percentage points lower than current levels, well out of step with other officials. Mr. Williams did not convey any urgency to cut interest rates rapidly and made clear that the Fed was committed to returning inflation to 2 percent. “We’re not losing track of that,” he said. “We still have our eye very much on inflation, but we want to make sure that we achieve both of our goals as best as possible.” That means getting inflation back to the target but also trying to “minimize the risk of the labor market cooling more sharply.” He echoed Mr. Powell’s warning that there is “no risk-free path,” but said the Fed was trying to “broaden that path."" Mr. Williams also addressed a string of attacks on the central bank by the president, who has been haranguing the Fed to lower interest rates substantially. Mr. Williams acknowledged that “political figures have their views” on the Fed as he emphasized the importance of its independence from the White House, adding that it was “really important right now for us to get our job done as best as we can.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also blamed the central bank for “mission creep” and for distorting financial markets with its quantitative easing program, which involved huge purchases of government bonds and other assets after the last two major financial crises. Mr. Williams defended the use of these tools, which he said were just an “extension of monetary policy,” and warned that without them, the economy would have been worse off. “The recovery would have been slower,” he said. As part of his pressure campaign, Mr. Trump has also sought to exert more direct influence over the Fed by trying to pack it with people amenable to his policy views. He was able to install Mr. Miran, who is taking only a temporary leave of absence from his role as one of the White House’s top economic advisers, after Adriana Kugler abruptly stepped down from the board in August. The president has since tried to force another vacancy by attempting to fire Lisa Cook over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. The Supreme Court, which will hear arguments in January in Ms. Cook’s lawsuit opposing her removal, has allowed her to continue serving as a governor while her case is litigated. Mr. Williams, who is 63, said he planned to stay in his role until mandated to retire in 2028. Asked about Mr. Trump’s attempts to erode the Fed’s independence — as well as the scrutiny the central bank has faced for its nonconfrontational response — Mr. Williams emphasized that his focus was squarely on analyzing the data. “We’re not political creatures,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/federal-reserve-john-williams-rate-cuts.html,Business,BBC,By Colby Smith,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09dc-fed-williams-qkfv/09dc-fed-williams-qkfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T09:04:10+00:00,f79c8e9711cccd6eb358d9fed8a902b57fed398b
f88721d7a251,Help! We Found a Hidden Camera in the Bathroom of Our Airbnb.,"travel;tourism;vacations, airbnb, camera, hotels, service content","Dear Tripped Up, This past Memorial Day weekend, my boyfriend, two friends and I were just over one day into our three-day, $1,023 Airbnb stay at a house in Alton, N.H., near Lake Winnipesaukee, when my boyfriend noticed a flashing light coming from what turned out to be a camera disguised as an outlet extender in the bathroom. By that point, we had already taken showers, gotten undressed and used the toilet. We called the police, who took the camera as evidence and encouraged us to leave the property immediately. We also contacted Airbnb and were put in touch with Liviana, a member of the company’s safety team. We provided her with a photograph of the camera installed over the toilet, a screenshot of an online listing for a matching camera from Knowyournanny (a site that sells security cameras) and the police case number. We asked for a full refund and for the listing to be taken down, as it appeared to be booked for much of the summer, and we were especially concerned that previous reviews of the property mentioned children staying there. After several days of back and forth, Liviana wrote us back to close the case. “Based on the information provided,” she wrote, “we were not able to conclude that there was a violation of our policy.” Though we were refunded for one night of our stay, we want a full refund — and we want the house off the Airbnb platform to protect future renters, especially children. Savannah, Massachusetts Dear Savannah, Airbnb’s policy is clear as day: Security cameras inside homes are always prohibited, even if turned off or disclosed to guests. The evidence you sent them and me is just as clear: a photograph of a device hanging above the toilet that is an exact match of a spy camera sold across the internet. “Monitor your property in real-time from your mobile device,” reads a description of the product on Amazon, offering purchasers “vibrant, high-resolution images that capture every detail.” It’s hard to imagine why Airbnb wouldn’t give you a full refund, and unconscionable that the company continued to rent out the home, even as the police investigated a potential crime. ( In New Hampshire , installing a camera “in any private place” is a misdemeanor that becomes a felony if “a reasonable person” would know children used the space.) A little over two weeks after I got in touch with Airbnb, the company told you that you would receive a full refund, and that the house would be removed from the platform. But that was over three months after the incident. Javier Hernandez, an Airbnb spokesman, confirmed you had been sent a refund. “In the very rare event a potential violation of our policies on security cameras is reported to us, we take that seriously and take action, which can include removing hosts and listings from the platform,” he wrote to me by email. He added the company stood “ready to assist law enforcement, who have not yet reached out to us.” I’d really like to know the procedure that Airbnb staff members like Liviana would follow in such a case. What does such an investigation consist of? Whom, if anyone, did Airbnb contact — the host, the police, the property managers? Those are not just rhetorical questions. It’s the exact wording of what I asked Mr. Hernandez via email. I got no specific answer. It is unclear who installed the camera, and the property has been open to many short-term renters over time. The Alton Police Department would not provide details. “Currently this case is open, therefore, not releasable at this time,” wrote Tina Hashem, the senior dispatcher for the department. I also wrote to the sergeant whom you’ve been in regular touch with, Tyler Glidden, and he did not respond. The family that owns the home and the property management company on the Airbnb listing did not respond to requests for comment. But Sergeant Glidden has been providing you with updates throughout, so we do know some details. You told me that the police had obtained a search warrant to look through the footage in the memory card and found thousands of hours of recordings, though none that included people. That is something of a relief, though it is possible that footage from days the house was occupied was removed, and of course anyone could have been monitoring the bathroom’s livestream at any point. You also said Sergeant Glidden told you the police were considering charges. The fact that the police appear to be taking the investigation seriously is a good sign. But for travelers, the broader question here is: How did Airbnb get this so obviously wrong? I’ll take a stab at explaining the inexplicable. Airbnb is neither host nor guest but a $75 billion middleman overseeing upward of five million properties in more than 200 countries and territories. That amounts to hundreds of millions of nights in which strangers are renting homes from strangers, often in strange lands. Such human-to-human interactions are inherently complex and inevitably generate disputes. The cross section that shows up in my inbox ranges from more serious cases like yours ( and other potential crimes ) to more mundane but still gross things like stained linens, scampering mice and dirty hot tubs. (By far, the most common complaints stem from Airbnb’s removal of — or refusal to remove — negative reviews about properties.) Being a global mediator of such hyperlocal issues is a vexing challenge that Airbnb has not mastered. Whether that is because its mediation system — a sort of international small-claims court where disputes take place mostly by direct message — faces an impossible task or its staff is underresourced or insufficiently trained is beyond my expertise. But something is clearly wrong when, despite your convincing evidence and continuing pleas to remove the property, Airbnb dismissed an obvious danger. Some travelers will read this account and swear never to use Airbnb again, but my guess is many of those pledges will be short-lived. Short-term rentals are an irresistible part of the travel landscape these days, and it’s not like Airbnb’s competitors (or hotels , for that matter) are flawless, either. So how can you at least reduce any risks? Here’s an abbreviated list of guidelines that, admittedly, probably would not have helped in this case: Stay in places with at least dozens of reviews, and read through them carefully. (You can take one outlier complaint with a grain of salt, but believe any patterns.) Get your host on record by asking questions via the app before you reserve, focusing on specifics that matter to you — is this an elevator or a walk-up building, are certain appliances working, is there any noise at night? Photograph (or take video) of everything when you check in, and again when you check out. Document anything that happens and communicate problems immediately to your host via the Airbnb app and to Airbnb as well if you can’t work it out quickly. Most of all, remember that in any rental, you are just one of Airbnb’s customers. The host is the other, and if anything goes wrong, one of you will very likely be disappointed by the outcome.

ea9e879e5ded,China Clamps Down Even Harder on Rare Earths,"rare earths, china, internal-open-access-from-nl","The Chinese government announced on Thursday that it was escalating its curbs on exports of rare earth metals, as Beijing claims broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology. The new rules, which are set to take effect Dec. 1, are the latest step by Beijing as it tightens the reins on rare earths to exploit China’s dominance in the sector. Hours later, Beijing announced that starting on Nov. 8, it will also restrict exports of many kinds of equipment needed to manufacture batteries for electric cars, in a bid to protect China’s competitive advantage in the car industry as well. The rare earth rules could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple. Rare earths are essential for the production of many computer chips, which are used in everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence systems. Rare earths are also used to make the magnets that power the electric motors in drones, factory robots and offshore wind turbines, as well as the brakes, seats and other systems in cars. China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the measures were needed to prevent rare earth metals from being used in technologies with possible military applications. For example, China refines all of the world’s samarium , a rare earth metal used by the United States to make F-35 fighter jets and a wide range of missiles. The ministry said rare earth exports to overseas military suppliers “will not be approved.” Foreign governments and businesses have insisted that most rare earths are used for civilian purposes.

Now, Its ‘Jewel in the Crown’ Is Leaving.","manufacturing, closings, layoffs;furloughs, economy, infant formula, international trade, birth rates, nestle, askeaton, ireland, china, switzerland","The powder was so lucrative that some people here called it cocaine. The men and women making pricey infant formula for Chinese babies at a factory in Askeaton, a small town in the southwestern Irish county of Limerick, had helped to turn around the fortunes of a place long overlooked. So when the people in suits unexpectedly arrived from Switzerland two years ago to deliver a death blow to the more than 540 workers employed at the plant, the first reaction was disbelief. No one could believe that Nestlé, a multinational food giant, would simply shutter a sophisticated plant into which it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars. “All of a sudden, the factory looked drab,” said Carmel Ryan, the unofficial town historian who runs the Askeaton Tourist Office and whose husband, Michael, worked at the factory for 34 years before retiring. “It was like the sunlight was gone from behind it.” It’s not hard to find someone in this town of 1,100 who worked at the plant or has a story to share about a friend or relative who was laid off. The factory was such a large presence that when a baby was born, tins of milk powder would appear on the doorstep, a gift from a neighbor working there. From the banks of the Deel River in the center of town, the factory, originally built in 1974 and passing through various owners before Nestlé acquired it, looked like a lumpy green mass on the horizon. But people in town considered it one of the best places in Ireland to work. The jobs at the factory were so stable that the local credit union needed only a worker’s most recent pay slip to give out a loan. Then came the Nestlé announcement. After the swarm of local reporters filled their notebooks with stories of the job losses to come and the national television crews packed up their vans, the initial shock gave way to suspicion. Nestlé had blamed waning demand for its baby formula products in China, where the birthrate was plummeting, for the factory closure. It cited a drastic fall in births to nine million in 2023 from 18 million in 2016. So few people were having babies in China that its population had begun to shrink , and this plant closure was an example of how that decline was reverberating around the world. But still, people had questions: Was there something else to the story? “I can’t believe the story as it’s presented,” said Kevin Sheahan, who was the longest-serving councilor in the county of Limerick until he retired from public office last year. “There’s a piece missing in that jigsaw.” People began talking: Did the closure have more to do with a demand from China to move the factory closer to its consumers? Residents of Askeaton recalled feeling uneasy years ago about Nestlé’s strategic shift to go all in on China, closing off the many markets in Europe and the Middle East it had supplied baby formula to for decades. “All our eggs were in one basket,” said Oliver Scanlon, 63, a farmer who worked at the factory for 40 years before he left several years ago. And yet, the factory saw its best days when it was selling only to China. “They called it the jewel in the crown,” Mr. Scanlon said. Looking back, people in Askeaton say there were signs that China wasn’t just interested in buying their baby formula, but also in learning every step in how it was made. Workers swapped stories about the Chinese auditors who visited every year, asking detailed questions about each process in the plant. “They came and they picked up on the smallest things,” observed Jimmy O’Donoghue, 63, who worked as a general operator at the plant for 30 years. Tim Hanley remembers well when a group from China showed up at his dairy farm down the road from the plant around eight years ago. Members of the group told him they were doing research, though he thought they might have been potential buyers of the plant. “It was an alarm bell ringing, you know,” said Mr. Hanley, 50, whose 200 cows supply milk that would eventually end up at the plant. “In fairness to the Chinese,” he added, “they can produce everything themselves, you know. Self-sufficiency is what they’re all about. So they come, they learn, they take their trade back home.” For years, foreign brands clamored to get into China to sell their milk, cars and luxury items, seeing only the possibility of 1.4 billion customers. After a tainted-milk scandal in 2008 shocked the nation, even Chinese families with limited income were willing to pay more for foreign baby milk powder than families in other regions like Europe. But doing business in China can come at a steep cost, including the transfer of know-how that is ultimately felt by workers back home. At the time of its closure announcement, Nestlé said that it planned to transfer production that had been done in Askeaton to facilities in Switzerland and China. Workers at the plant started leaving in waves, as the company slowly negotiated its way through pay packages. A month after it said it would close the Irish plant, in November 2023, Nestlé said it had won approval for a factory in Suzhou, in eastern China, to make and sell a similar product to what it had been making in Askeaton. After warning about the falling birthrate, Nestlé has since been more cheerful about the China market, saying it “remains the world’s largest” because of “the sheer number of newborns.” All of this has left people in Askeaton feeling raw, though ultimately, the reasons behind the closure matter less to the people of Askeaton than how it will reverberate. The last batch of milk powder was made at the plant last month. Unless someone decides to buy the plant from Nestlé, which is selling it for 22 million euros, or about $26 million, the factory doors will shut for the last time in March. In a statement, Nestlé said that since announcing its proposal to close the factory in 2023, “supporting our employees has been our priority,” adding that it has provided training and assistance to help them find new jobs. Driving through Askeaton, it is impossible to miss T.S. Morain, a brightly colored hardware store. Inside, Seán Moran, 56, stacks the shelves with television remote controls, microwaves and hair dryers, and hopes he can keep the lights on in the shop that has been in his family for three generations. “I think it’s going to hit,” said Mr. Moran about the factory closure. He recalled leaving Ireland in the 1980s to look for work because there were so few opportunities at home. “People won’t have the money to do what they want to do as often as they would like,” he said. But times are not as tough anymore, he said, and people will find a way. Some of the younger workers at the Nestlé factory have found new jobs at nearby plants owned by the multinational pharmaceutical companies Regeneron and Eli Lilly. Still, across the street at the local credit union, employees are on alert. When times were flush, if you worked at the factory, you were guaranteed a loan, said Patrick Ranahan, a business development executive at the credit union. Now, he explained “it’s definitely harder to get that over the line.” “There was good wages, which meant that the town flourished,” said Mr. Ranahan who remembered his mother receiving tins of baby food from neighbors when he was young. “But,” he added, “there was always the possibility that it could be yanked away at any second.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/world/europe/ireland-china-nestle-baby-formula.html,Business,BBC,By Alexandra Stevenson and Paulo Nunes Dos Santos,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/01/multimedia/00int-ireland-china-dispatch-01-bztw/00int-ireland-china-dispatch-01-bztw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T04:01:21+00:00,4cb4d2d7e6287e25205cda9370f4d03e47dad529

Since January, the Trump administration has made deep cuts to the nation’s science funding, including more than $1 billion in grants to the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much of the basic research at universities and federal laboratories, and $4.5 billion to the National Institutes of Health . Thousands of jobs for scientists and staff members have been terminated or frozen at these and other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Park Service. To thousands of researchers — veteran scientists and new grad students, at state universities and Ivy League institutions alike — these sweeping reductions translate as direct personal losses: a layoff, a shuttered lab, a yearslong experiment or field study abruptly ended, graduate students turned away; lost knowledge, lost progress, lost investment, lost stability; dreams deferred or foreclosed. “This government upheaval is discouraging to all scientists who give their time and lend their brilliance to solve the problems beleaguering humankind instead of turning to some other activity that makes a more steady living,” Gina Poe, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in an email. Next year looks to be worse. The 2026 budget proposed by the White House would slash the National Science Foundation by 56.9 percent, the N.I.H. by 39.3 percent and NASA by 24.3 percent, including 47.3 percent of the agency’s science-research budget. It would entirely eliminate the U.S. Geological Survey’s $299 million budget for ecosystems research; all U.S. Forest Service research ($300 million) and, at NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, all funding ($625 million) for research on climate, habitat conservation and air chemistry and for studying ocean, coastal and Great Lakes environments.

8227242c8c57,Press Group Condemns New Pentagon Rules on Reporting,"us military, journalism;journalist;news media, freedom of the press, first amendment, freedom of the press foundation, reporters committee for freedom of the press, pentagon","A group that lobbies on behalf of Pentagon reporters on Wednesday harshly criticized new rules released by the Defense Department that could lead to the revocation of press credentials. “Limiting the media’s ability to report on the U.S. military fails to honor the American families who have entrusted their sons and daughters to serve in it, or the taxpayers responsible for giving the department hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” a statement from the group, the Pentagon Press Association, said. There are approximately 90 journalists with credentials to cover the Pentagon. Representatives of news organizations have been negotiating with the Pentagon since the department first released a set of new rules in a lengthy memo dated Sept. 18. The rules represent a major departure from how reporting at the Pentagon has worked for decades. The memo said that the Pentagon was committed to transparency and accountability, but it also laid out a set of strictures that immediately drew criticism from news organizations. One of its provisions was widely interpreted as requiring reporters to seek approval from the government for their coverage. Failure to comply could lead to a revocation of press passes. Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said at the time that the policy “operates as a prior restraint on publication which is considered the most serious of First Amendment violations.” The agency responded on Monday with a revised policy. The new version says that approval requirements for releasing information are binding for government officials, not journalists. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Conspiracy Theories Started Flying.","us politics, tv, journalism;journalist;news media, federalism, presidential power, us military, cnn, national guard, donald trump, stephen miller, portland oregon","It was an odd TV moment: Stephen Miller, President Trump’s deputy chief of staff, was answering a CNN anchor’s question from the White House lawn on Monday when he stopped midsentence, falling silent and blinking at the camera. “Stephen. Stephen. Hey, Stephen, can you hear me?” the anchor, Boris Sanchez, asked from his studio in Washington, before the network cut to a commercial break. A few minutes later, Mr. Miller was back onscreen, and the interview resumed ; Mr. Sanchez apologized and told viewers that “some wires got crossed.” CNN said a technical mishap had occurred. But by that point, the internet was doing what the internet does. “Wow, Stephen Miller absolutely did not have a glitch on live TV,” declared one TikTok user whose video about the exchange had been liked more than 135,000 times as of Wednesday, adding that it seemed Mr. Miller had said something that he “was not supposed to say.” “Clearly someone hit the panic button in his earpiece,” wrote a user on X, in a post that has recorded about 1.7 million views.

Responding to Mr. Sanchez’s question about the legality of deploying National Guard soldiers to Portland, Ore., Mr. Miller cited a federal law under which, he said, “the president has plenary authority.” Plenary authority is a legal term that effectively means limitless power. The Trump administration has invoked the term at least once before , in a legal argument as to why the president should be allowed to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act; a federal appeals court ruled against the administration in that case last month. Mr. Miller did not use the term again once the CNN interview resumed. After Mr. Sanchez repeated his question, Mr. Miller asserted that “the president has the authority anytime he believes federal resources are insufficient to federalize the National Guard to carry out a mission necessary for public safety.” He and Mr. Sanchez went back and forth over whether the conditions in Portland justified such an extraordinary deployment of domestic soldiers. The White House did not immediately comment. Political tensions have intensified around the situation in Oregon, with many Democrats and local officials objecting to the use of the National Guard. Online skeptics wondered if Mr. Miller had caught himself after accidentally revealing an underlying rationale behind Mr. Trump’s aggressive expansion of executive power. As an X user put it, “Stephen Miller said the quiet part out loud.” A CNN spokeswoman on Wednesday provided a more mundane explanation. Guests who appear remotely on television programs wear earpieces to hear the audio from the anchor who is interviewing them. CNN said that because of a technical error, an audio feed from a different CNN channel began playing in Mr. Miller’s ear. He could no longer hear Mr. Sanchez. The problem was fixed during the commercial break, and Mr. Miller appeared unbothered by the interruption. Later, on X, he promoted clips from the interview and reposted praise from Benny Johnson, a right-wing podcaster who said that Mr. Miller had “absolutely eviscerated CNN.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/business/media/stephen-miller-plenary-authority-cnn-conspiracies.html,Business,BBC,By Michael M.

5f06b166bb9c,"Mixed Economic Signals Stoke Divisions at Fed, Minutes Show","banking and finance, interest rate, inflation, us economy, us politics, federal reserve, jerome powell, stephen miran","A few Federal Reserve officials were reluctant to support the central bank’s interest rate cut in September, minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting showed, emphasizing the extent of the divisions that have emerged between policymakers over what to do about borrowing costs. The record of the September meeting, when policymakers lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, underscored the tough balancing act ahead for the Fed as it contends with both a softening labor market and higher inflation. The decision, which shifted interest rates to a new range of 4 to 4.25 percent, was officially supported by every Fed official except one. It was the Fed’s first rate cut this year. Stephen Miran, who was sworn in just ahead of the start of the two-day meeting, voted instead for a more aggressive, half-point reduction. Mr. Miran, who was most recently a top economic adviser to President Trump, also stood apart from his new colleagues in projections released by the Fed. He signaled the need for borrowing costs to fall roughly two percentage points lower than current levels. Most officials penciled in an additional half-point reduction this year, which would bring interest rates down to 3.5 to 3.75 percent. However, seven of the 19 policymakers who submitted forecasts indicated that they did not see a need to cut further this year, while two predicted just one more quarter-point move. The minutes show the range of views that Jerome H. Powell, the chair, is now having to manage. “A few participants stated there was merit in keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision,” the minutes said. “These participants noted that progress toward the committee’s 2 percent inflation objective had stalled this year as inflation readings increased and expressed concern that longer-term inflation expectations may rise if inflation does not return to its objective in a timely manner.” The decision to cut in September centered on a shift in how officials viewed the risks confronting the economy. For most of the year, they had been focused chiefly on inflation, which has been above the Fed’s 2 percent target for roughly five years. Mr. Trump’s tariffs have helped push certain consumer prices higher, but the overall impact on inflation has been more muted than once expected. Still, a majority of officials expressed concern about inflation, noting in the minutes that price pressures could end up being more intense than currently expected. They pointed to a range of factors including “uncertainty about the effects of tariffs, the possibility that elevated inflation proves to be more persistent than currently expected even after the inflation effects of this year’s tariff increases fade, or the possibility of longer-term inflation expectations moving up after a long period of elevated inflation readings.” The September record, however, stressed that policymakers generally expected that inflation would ultimately fade after pushing higher in the coming months and “gradually return to 2 percent thereafter.” That view has given the Fed more flexibility to respond to the labor market, which has started to show signs of cracking. The unemployment rate is still low, at 4.3 percent, but the pace of monthly jobs growth has markedly slowed. Companies appear less eager to hire, even though they have stopped short of firing workers. Mr. Powell had framed September’s cut as a “risk management” move intended to shore up the labor market. But each successive cut may be harder to justify without a much more substantive deterioration in the labor market, given that price pressures are still far too high. The minutes said that most officials supported lowering interest rates further this year. But some policymakers appeared worried about easing up prematurely. “Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes,” the minutes said. What makes forthcoming decisions much more difficult is that responding to one risk, like an economic downturn, could end up worsening the inflation outlook. Mr. Powell acknowledged this bind after the most recent meeting, not only stressing what a “ challenging situation ” the Fed was now in, but also noting that “there are no risk-free paths now.” If the Fed moves too quickly toward a “neutral” policy setting — in which interest rates are neither speeding up growth nor slowing it down — policymakers may inadvertently worsen their inflation problem. If instead the Fed moves too slowly toward that level, a more severe economic downturn could take hold. The Fed must next vote on interest rates on Oct. 28-29, but that decision has been complicated by the ongoing government shutdown . The Bureau of Labor Statistics has already been forced to withhold the September jobs report, which was supposed to be released last Friday, because of the shutdown. Without a deal to fund the government soon, the Consumer Price Index, which is set for release on Oct. 15, could be delayed as well.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/business/federal-reserve-meeting-minutes.html,Business,BBC,By Colby Smith,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08dc-fed-mkjg/08dc-fed-mkjg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T18:43:40+00:00,c3e486d0559e1b754f0acd88ad5c46bc2a3fd4f5
f89c0e2dd4fc,What if SportsCenter and LinkedIn Merged?,"startup, podcast, tbpn, silicon valley, computers and the internet, tech industry","Inside a film studio lot in Hollywood on a Tuesday morning in August, Jordi Hays, a 29-year-old entrepreneur, ran into the frame of a live shot, waving a giant red flag. Dressed in what can be described only as Patrick Bateman-core — gray bespoke suit, button-down oxford, polished black wingtips, with a slicked-back swoop to his hair — Mr. Hays was shouting into the camera. “The timeline is in turmoil!” he yelped, rattling off a series of references that only those obsessively glued to the tech industry corners of the social media site X would understand. “Perplexity has made an offer to buy Chrome!” John Coogan, Mr. Hays’ 36-year-old business partner, dressed nearly identically, looked on with a smirk. Mr. Coogan, who at 6-foot-8 towers over everyone he meets, was slouched in his chair to fit into the frame of the shot. The two sat at a table piled high with tech company swag, copies of that morning’s Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, a dozen half-empty cans of Yerba Mate and Diet Coke, and microphones and laptops. At 11 a.m. on the dot each weekday, they begin livestreaming “TBPN” — “Technology Business Programming Network” — a three-hour-long chat show of boosterish commentary on the worlds of tech and business. The “TBPN” formula is simple: Two self-aware fellas who treat techno-capitalism like a Fantasy Football league, chronicling a ticker-tape dribble of executive moves, corporate acquisitions, initial public offerings and venture capital funding. Call it SportsCenter for the terminally online M.B.A. grad. Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays (who have also been known to film the show in Miami Vice-style white suits; they have a predilection for the trappings of 1980s wealth) spend the live broadcast multitasking, obsessively scrolling through X as if they were traders staring at a Bloomberg terminal, spinning up graphics for social media designed to go locally viral: — “Jian Zhang POACHED from Apple to go to Meta and work on artificial intelligence” — “BREAKING: Ilya Sutskever, one of the co-founders of OpenAI, has updated his profile pic” The first episode of their show, which they originally called “ Technology Brothers ” (a wink to the common put-down for men of their ilk, “tech bros”) aired last October. Practically overnight, it became a sensation, at least in the seven-by-seven square miles of San Francisco, watched by everyone from the Celsius-pounding start-up crowd to the tip top of the tech elite. Executives from OpenAI, Palantir and Andreessen Horowitz appear regularly, as do pseudonymous X account holders like @roon and @carriednointerest , who are big in tech and finance Twitter circles but complete unknowns to outsiders. Silicon Valley has often clothed itself in the mission-driven language of global transformation. But what Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays tap into is a “who’s up, who’s down” part of the culture that has long existed but is rarely expressed as explicitly in public. It turns out that tech people — especially in the A.I. talent-wars era of Silicon Valley — are just as interested in gossiping about who is changing jobs as they are in changing the world. Founder Mode In September, signaling its new status as the preferred outlet of tech-world insiders, “TBPN” broadcast live from Meta’s annual developer conference at its Menlo Park campus, and livestreamed a sit-down with Mark Zuckerberg after his keynote speech. As Mr. Zuckerberg walked on to the pop-up set in the middle of Meta’s campus called “Hacker Square,” Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays welcomed the chief executive with firm handshakes. Someone pressed a sound effect button, broadcasting a voice-over saying “FOUNDER MODE” with the booming resonance of a World Cup vuvuzela. (“Founder Mode” is considered a high compliment in Silicon Valley circles, a frame of mind possessed by those who built their own start-ups with the zeal of a bare-knuckle boxer.) The trio spent the next 10 minutes talking strategy and the future, chopping it up like old friends. Mr. Zuckerberg spoke about how the newly debuted Meta Ray-Bans, which contain a small screen in the lens, can be used to send texts to friends. (There was no mention of the product demo failing onstage.) The C.E.O. then banged a gong — a staple of the show — to end the interview. “Congratulations on bringing sci-fi into the present,” Mr. Hays said. “What we’ve created is something that looks a lot like traditional television but with what we hope is all the best parts of independent media,” Mr. Hays said in an interview at Tartine, a block down the street from the Hollywood gym he and Mr. Coogan visit together at 6:30 every morning before work. The show’s audience is relatively small. Most of its viewership tunes in on X when the show is livestreamed; the highest number of simultaneous viewers its had is around 130,000. Recordings of the shows posted to YouTube hover around the low thousands to tens of thousands of views per episode. Despite that, the hosts consider CNBC and Fox Business — both with hundreds of thousands of daily viewers — to be their competitors. After all, they point out, broadcasters are increasingly moving away from a focus on linear television and toward the cross-platform strategy that “TBPN” has embraced. The bet is that one day viewers will start looking for anchors who are a little less Wolf Blitzer and a bit more Mr. Beast. “TBPN” is small, with just 10 employees, and Mr. Hays and Mr. Coogan intend to keep it that way, they say. “I do not want to manage a dozen TV hosts,” Mr. Coogan said. He pointed to his co-host, who was halfway through his breakfast of a double smashburger. “We are the talent, and we’d like to remain the talent, not build an empire,” Mr. Coogan added, as Mr. Hays nodded and chewed. For now, the show’s audience size is less noteworthy than the type of viewers it attracts. The show counts among its fans the occasional world’s richest person, Larry Ellison; the former shark on “Shark Tank” Mark Cuban; and Uber’s founder, Travis Kalanick. Start-up founders consider it a required watch. Entire communications teams for executives of public companies strategize how to make their C.E.O.’s interview on “TBPN” feel like a good hang while promoting their businesses. “We’re in the business of hanging out and talking about business,” Mr. Hays said. “And we love business.” (And wealth: in one recurring segment on the show on Fridays, Mr. Coogan rifles through the mansion section of The Journal. Occasionally, the hosts cover high-end cars, luxury watches and the state of the art markets.) They consider themselves tech-positive, like their podcasting peers Dwarkesh Patel and Lex Fridman, who are other regular stops on a C.E.O.’s press tour, perhaps because of their often gentle approach to interviewing. (Tech executives have grown increasingly hostile to traditional media. Seeing Mr. Zuckerberg do a sit-down interview with anyone other than a podcaster these days is about as rare as snowfall in Palo Alto.) But “TBPN” is less obviously interested than those shows in the philosophy behind new technology, and more often focused on competitive corporate strategy. To that end, Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays embrace attention-grabbing rankings and scoreboards. In July, they debuted “ The Metis List ,” — a play on Forbes’ “ Midas List ” of top technology investors as well as a reference to Greek mythology — which ranks the top 100 artificial intelligence researchers in the field. The metrics are both legitimate and cheeky; peer rankings, education, academic citations and “number of Dwarkesh appearances” all factor in. From Soylent to Streaming Starting a streaming news show was never really the plan, though both men have long been interested in start-up culture. In 2013, Mr. Coogan co-founded Soylent, the coder-embraced nutrient slurry that was something like the Gatorade of hustle culture, named after the marquee food source in the 1973 dystopian film, “Soylent Green.” (Spoiler: “ Soylent Green is people .”) In 2021, Mr. Hays founded Party Round, a crowdfunding venture capital start-up that rose to prominence during Silicon Valley’s heady ZIRP , or “zero interest rate phenomenon,” era. Party Round fell out of favor as interest rates rose and another start-up acquired it in 2024. Soylent sold for a middling amount to a global food conglomerate the year before. But those experiences, Mr. Coogan said, gave the pair an insider’s perspective on what it means to build a challenging business. “Imagine being 25, raising money from Andreessen and Google and all these prominent investors, and then like two years later you’re just getting hammered by the market,” Mr. Hays said. “We’ve gone through that, and I think that’s really important for how we approach our coverage.” After a few more stints around the Valley — Mr. Coogan did an entrepreneur’s residency at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and worked on a nicotine gum start-up — the two met through mutual friends in 2023. And despite their “ Dudes Rock ” mien, they were industry nerds at heart. Mr. Coogan had been streaming tech-focused interviews and deep dives into companies on his own YouTube channel for years. They recognized that a two-person dynamic might work better as a daily show. Moreover, they just liked talking to each other. Mr. Hays, who moved to Los Angeles after college, commutes to the show’s Hollywood studio from Malibu. Mr. Coogan, a Pasadena native, lives there with his family. And though many of the companies “TBPN” covers are based in the Bay Area, they settled on Los Angeles because they need to cultivate media talent, not engineers. The set approximates a CNBC studio set up in the locker room of an Equinox gym. One recent morning, Mr. Hays took off his pants while on the phone with a potential guest, changing out of his workout clothes and into a suit. A dozen young men scurried around the set, prepping for the show and chawing packets of Zyn. There were zero women present, and the only people that appeared to be older than 30 were Mr. Coogan and me. Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays avoid news anchor-style stuffiness, describing different tech products as “mid” (which means bad) or “extremely sick” (which means good). A Bloomberg-style visual ticker at the bottom of the broadcast screen shows off Polymarket odds on different tech events happening, like a 30 percent chance of Meta’s latest A.I. model, Llama 5, launching this year, and even lower odds of Tesla debuting robotaxis in California before 2026. At three hours of daily livestreaming, the show can drag. Even the most charismatic of hosts can struggle to make earnings reports and data centers seem as exciting as, say, the Final Four. But the extremely online tech crowd eats it up. “A lot of what they do is aimed at people who have their nose up against the glass,” said Peter Kafka, a correspondent at Business Insider who hosts a podcast on the intersection of tech and media. “The gap between what they’re doing, and what you and your buddy are talking about over lunch or drinks or whatever is pretty minimal. And I think that’s why it works, because the idea is that you and your buddy could be these guys, too.” The morning I was present, David Risher, chief executive of Lyft, appeared on Zoom in to boast about his company’s most recent earnings report and the latest projects while wearing a black-and-white Aloha shirt. The affair was largely chummy. “I’ve actually tried to get our investor relations folks to do our next earnings call in the form of a podcast,” Mr. Risher said. “Maybe I can get you guys to host it!” Mr. Coogan and Mr. Hays don’t consider themselves journalists, and they wear their optimism about the companies they’re discussing on their sleeve. They also expressed some reservations about talking to me — “the enemy,” as Mr. Coogan put it in faux scare quotes — especially as most of their peers are wary of institutions like The New York Times. But he added they believed traditional publishers still serve a crucial role in the media environment. “We can’t do what we do without you guys,” Mr. Coogan said. Because “TBPN” is free, it relies largely on a handful of paying sponsors — mostly tech start-ups like Ramp, a virtual credit card start-up, and Polymarket, the recently legalized online betting marketplace — and expects to generate $5 million in revenue this year. It recently hired Dylan Abruscato as its 10th employee to manage ad revenue, which he has been charged with tripling in 2026. Mr. Abruscato is no stranger to livestreamed media; he worked as director of partnerships for HQ Trivia, the live game show app that skyrocketed to popularity in 2018 before fizzling two years later. (The Wall Street Journal, perhaps taking a page from the playbook of “TBPN,” devoted a headline to Mr. Abruscato’s hiring.) On Friday, Mr. Hays and Mr. Coogan interviewed OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the latest high-profile get for the show. Mr. Altman spoke about Sora, the company’s new video generation A.I. app , and also noted he had recently bought a new Acura NSX, which earned him numerous air horns from Mr. Hays’ soundboard. (“I have a proclivity for expensive cars,” Mr. Altman admitted.) But even as their star rises, they aren’t forgetting to sweat the small stuff. “Nine years ago today, Mark Zuckerberg went live on Facebook and smoked a brisket in his backyard,” the show’s X account posted soon after announcing Mr. Altman’s interview.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/technology/tbpn-silicon-valley.html,Technology,BBC,By Mike Isaac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12TBPN-01-fkzt/12TBPN-01-fkzt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:47+00:00,29314246a9457bf5049c9e29beb53d09be5554a9
dcfc4846b08c,A Mystery C.E.O. and Billions in Sales: Is China Buying Banned Nvidia Chips?,"artificial intelligence, computer chip, data center, nvidia, megaspeed, regulation and deregulation, jen-hsun huang;jensen huang, kuala lumpur, china, commerce department, international trade, malaysia","On a humid June night last year, Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, held court with several of his company’s major Asian customers at a bar with sweeping views of Taipei. They stood and toasted the booming artificial intelligence industry. Next to the Nvidia chief was a woman named Huang Le, or Alice Huang, an executive of a Singapore-based data center company called Megaspeed, which was poised to buy $2 billion of Nvidia A.I. technology over the next year. Though Ms. Huang and Megaspeed are little-known players in the A.I. industry, their association with Nvidia and its chief executive has recently become a preoccupation in Washington. Commerce Department officials have been investigating whether Megaspeed, which has close ties to Chinese tech firms, is helping companies in China sidestep American export restrictions, according to more than a half dozen current and former officials and other people familiar with the companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an examination that is not public. The inquiry, which is active, calls into question how closely Nvidia is tracking where its A.I. chips end up and highlights the possibility of American export laws easily being sidestepped. Megaspeed is also facing scrutiny from Singaporean police, who told The New York Times in a statement that they are investigating the company for breaching local laws, without elaborating further. As the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia’s annual revenue has soared nearly sevenfold in the past four years, making it the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. But the Silicon Valley company’s meteoric rise has coincided with U.S. government concerns that its chips could help adversaries like China develop new weapons, surveil dissidents and leap ahead of the United States in A.I. development . Those concerns led both the Biden and Trump administrations to crack down on A.I. chip sales to China. But some Chinese companies employ global networks of middlemen and shell companies to sidestep those limits. In a legal gray area, some have built vast data centers in Southeast Asia that have fueled China’s gains in A.I. Other Chinese companies have set up illegal smuggling networks , moving perhaps hundreds of thousands of blocked chips into China, experts estimate. In April, the House Select Committee on China opened an investigation into Nvidia’s sale of chips to China and Southeast Asia. Nvidia has expanded its operations in Taiwan in recent years, but it remains firmly anchored to Silicon Valley, where it was founded more than three decades ago. Megaspeed illustrates the challenges facing U.S. government officials trying to keep China from accessing powerful A.I. chips. After splitting off from a Chinese gaming company in 2023, Megaspeed set up a subsidiary in Malaysia that quickly snapped up nearly $2 billion worth of Nvidia’s most advanced products. Most of those chips came from the U.S. branch of a Chinese company that has already been sanctioned for providing technology to the Chinese military, according to records obtained through ImportGenius, a trade data platform. Megaspeed has funneled those chips to data centers in Malaysia and Indonesia that appear to remotely serve customers in China. That is not necessarily illegal, but it can be found unlawful if it is done on behalf of a Chinese company. U.S. officials have also been scrutinizing whether Megaspeed diverted some of those chips on to China, in violation of U.S. law, two people familiar with the company said. The Times visited sites in four countries, reviewed shipment records, business registrations, videos and photographs, and interviewed more than 30 people to shed light on Megaspeed’s opaque operation. Reporters tracked business listings that led to a Malaysian data center and shopping mall, a near-empty office in Singapore and a dilapidated storefront outside Kuala Lumpur. Nvidia said there was no evidence that its chips had been smuggled into China. John Rizzo, a spokesman for Nvidia, said in a statement that the chipmaker had “engaged with the U.S. government” regarding Megaspeed. Nvidia’s compliance team also looked into Megaspeed and determined it was “wholly owned and operated by a company based and headquartered outside China, with no China shareholders,” he said. Mr. Rizzo said Nvidia had visited Megaspeed’s facilities multiple times. During a visit this week, he said Nvidia employees “found no evidence of diversion, and confirmed what we previously observed — Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules.” Megaspeed said in an emailed statement that it “is a Singapore-based company, operating fully in compliance with all applicable laws, including U.S. export control regulations.” It declined to comment further. Ms. Huang did not respond to requests for comment. The Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, said it did not comment on active enforcement matters and could not confirm or deny the existence of any pending investigations. It added that the Trump administration would aggressively investigate allegations of wrongdoing and that exporters should perform due diligence and investigate any red flags. The White House did not provide a comment. Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs declined to comment. The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry in Malaysia said that the country had recently strengthened its oversight of the export of A.I. chips and that it maintained an active dialogue with the United States about its controls. Aaron Bartnick, an assistant director for technology security and governance under the Biden administration, said Megaspeed raised “many red flags,” including its ownership claims and possible ties to sanctioned entities, that should have made Nvidia’s executives question whether they should have permitted the company to have access to its A.I. chips. “It’s hard to see a justification for taking that risk,” he said. From China to Singapore Megaspeed was created in 2023 when 7Road, a Chinese gaming and cloud computing company with ties to state-backed investors, split off its overseas operation in Singapore and renamed it Megaspeed. Megaspeed listed Ms. Huang as its managing director for its first eight months before removing her from that role in its corporate paperwork. (She has also described herself as the company’s chief executive.) The company’s current director is from Singapore but is based in Shanghai, according to business records and his social media account. Companies around the world were scrambling to buy the Nvidia chips used to build ChatGPT, which was released in November 2022. And the U.S. government was setting up a technological dragnet to stop advanced chip sales to China. It is not clear when Mr. Huang and Ms. Huang, who are not related, first met. She was mingling with a crowd of tech executives just after midnight at the Taipei bar in early June of last year when she offered to ask Mr. Huang of Nvidia to join them, recalled Parker Schmitt, an executive who was with the group. “She said, ‘I bet you guys I can get Jensen here,’ and then Jensen immediately showed up,” Mr. Schmitt said, referring to Mr. Huang by his first name. Photos posted to LinkedIn by NetThunder, a data software provider where Mr. Schmitt is chief executive, show Mr. Huang at the bar with the group. Shortly after Ms. Huang reached out, Mr. Huang arrived in his trademark black leather jacket and drank a whiskey shot with the group. He was accompanied by two other Nvidia executives and had planned to attend the party, said a person close to the company. “Our field operations teams often host groups of customers and partners at conferences, and when Jensen is available, may ask him to visit to provide updates on the market,” Mr. Rizzo of Nvidia said. Mr. Huang and Ms. Huang were photographed together again in May, exiting a restaurant in Taipei with an Nvidia aide after a business dinner with other A.I. suppliers. In a video from the SET News channel in Taiwan, she waited behind Mr. Huang as he passed out noodles from the restaurant to onlookers and spoke to the Taiwanese press. Ms. Huang has a scant online profile. She spent much of her career in mainland China, including working as a television reporter for Chinese state media and as a private banker, according to a biography found on the social media of a former employer. The Times could not confirm either of those experiences. Ms. Huang left Megaspeed in recent months. The exact date is unclear. It is also unclear why she left and what she is doing now. Both she and 7Road, the Chinese company that Megaspeed split off from, have close ties to a web of wealthy investors and tech companies with data center projects in China, according to a review of corporate and trade records compiled by the platforms WireScreen and Sayari, and analysis by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington nonprofit. The owners of 7Road include the Chinese central government and several local governments. Before joining Megaspeed, Ms. Huang was executive director for a Shanghai-based fund that had invested in 7Road and had ties to state-backed firms. Valuable Shipments It is not clear where Megaspeed’s billions of dollars came from to buy chips. But a few weeks after the gathering in Taipei last year, Megaspeed began receiving a steady supply of multimillion dollar shipments of some of Nvidia’s most advanced chips, according to Malaysian trade records. Those purchases would have been illegal under U.S. law if Megaspeed were still a Chinese subsidiary. But Nvidia had determined that Megaspeed was a Singaporean company, said a person close to the company’s compliance division, and believed it was a newcomer to the cloud-computing industry that would compete for business against U.S. companies. Megaspeed, Nvidia officials said, did not raise any red flags. Over the next three months, Megaspeed bought a billion dollars of Nvidia technology. Within the next nine months, it secured roughly a billion dollars more. Worldwide, Nvidia recorded roughly $115 billion in data center sales last year. Malaysian import records show that the bulk of those advanced Nvidia chips were purchased from what WireScreen says is the U.S. subsidiary of Inspur, a major Chinese tech firm that the United States has sanctioned for trying to acquire American technology to build supercomputers for the Chinese military. Inspur and Aivres, the subsidiary, didn’t respond to requests for comment. In 2023, Inspur was added to the U.S. entity list for supporting the Chinese military. The listing means that U.S. companies like Nvidia are barred from selling their technology to Inspur without a special license. But because Inspur’s subsidiary, Aivres, is based in California and records sales as a U.S. company, it can buy Nvidia chips freely, legal experts said. The shipments went to Speedmatrix, a subsidiary that Megaspeed had set up in Malaysia in early 2024, according to shipment records obtained by ImportGenius, the trade data platform. The registered address for Speedmatrix on the shipping records led to a dilapidated storefront outside Kuala Lumpur, where the sign out front advertised a construction company. Calls by Times reporters to the construction company went unanswered, and no one was inside when a reporter visited the address in late September. Employees at the law firm next door said they rarely saw people in the office. In September 2024, an official with the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the division of the Commerce Department that overseas export controls, visited Megaspeed’s data center in Malaysia to investigate suspicions about how much it was buying. Officials were concerned that Nvidia technology on site was still in boxes, three people familiar with the inspection said. Such behavior arouses suspicions because some companies bypass checks by showing they have the technology before later shipping it elsewhere. U.S. officials suspect that some of the chips may have been sent on to China, the people said, but they do not have conclusive evidence. After the visit, U.S. officials communicated their concerns about Megaspeed to Singaporean and Malaysian authorities, as well as Nvidia, the three people said. The United States has been pressuring those governments to better police data center projects and chip smuggling networks. In February, Singaporean police arrested nine people, including several Chinese-born executives of other technology companies, for making “misleading claims” about the end destination of computer servers that use the A.I. chips. Malaysia said in July that it would require permits for all export and transfers of Nvidia chips. The crackdown has coincided with a stall in Megaspeed’s chip purchases. By late July, trade records indicate that the company had stopped receiving shipments of advanced Nvidia chips, despite expectations that it would buy billions more. Nvidia confirmed Megaspeed had not submitted new orders for months, but did not offer an explanation why. The company was projected to buy as much as $3.2 billion of Nvidia’s highest-performing computers over the next year, according to Morgan Stanley. Those computers are packed with the company’s A.I. chips. A Boom Fueled by China In Singapore and Malaysia, traces of Megaspeed linger in half-empty offices, on corporate documents and behind the fences of advanced A.I. data centers. In a premier office building in Singapore’s sleek central business district, just two employees were present on a recent weekday in Megaspeed’s offices. A door behind a small, staged waiting area gave way to a minimalist white office, with several clusters of empty desks. A human resources manager said she had met few of the firm’s directors, most of whom were based in China and seldom visited Singapore. Most of its clients, she added, are Chinese. She said Ms. Huang had stepped down months earlier because of personal commitments to other businesses. James Tan, who is listed in corporate records as the company’s Singaporean director, is never present, she said. According to corporate ownership documents, Megaspeed is owned by a shell company that Mr. Tan owns. The shell company’s address led to an accounting firm in Singapore, where employees told a Times reporter that they did not know how to reach Mr. Tan. Two hours north, hulking data centers rose over palm oil fields that dotted the Malaysian countryside. Sedenak Tech Park, a complex of data centers with its own ties to China, bristled with cameras and high-tension wires. It was there that U.S. officials found Megaspeed’s inventory still in boxes. In Johor, the Malaysian state across the border from Singapore, Megaspeed’s Malaysian subsidiary, Speedmatrix, has an office on the upper floors of a shopping mall near snack stores and beauty parlors. The office’s windows were obscured by reflective glass and its doors were fitted with fingerprint scanners. When a Times reporter visited, three employees inside did not answer despite repeated knocks. A woman eventually emerged for lunch and identified herself as an administrator. She said she had no contact with her bosses. When asked what the company did, she said, “It’s not clear.” Reporting was contributed by Pei-Lin Wu from Taipei; Berry Wang from Hong Kong; Zunaira Saieed from Kuala Lumpur and Johor; Nicholas Yong from Singapore; and Julian Barnes from Washington.

625e02fe49cf,Intel’s Big Bet: Inside the Chipmaker’s Make-or-Break Factory,"intel, computer chip, manufacturing, computers and the internet, tech industry, asml holding, taiwan semiconductor manufacturing, lip-bu tan, chandler, ariz.","On the desert floor of the Phoenix Valley, Intel has poured more than $20 billion into a four-story manufacturing plant that is the centerpiece of the ailing chipmaker’s comeback bid. Inside the building, known as Fab 52, the company is rolling out a new manufacturing process to make more powerful and efficient computer chips. The process uses the tools from ASML, the Dutch manufacturer of lithography machines , to make Intel’s cutting-edge semiconductors in the United States for the first time in nearly a decade. During a factory visit last month, two of those $250 million machines sat largely idle while ASML engineers in sterilized white bunny suits worked on one. Two trailer-size footprints for additional machines sat empty nearby, a nod to Intel’s hopes it can eventually expand. Intel has recently brought a string of potential customers through the plant in Chandler, Ariz., and pitched them on manufacturing their chips at Fab 52. But analysts say most chip companies want to see whether Intel can succeed in making its own computer chips before asking it to produce their chips for smartphones, artificial intelligence systems and other technologies. The focus on the new facility underscores how critical this moment is to Intel’s future. Once an exemplar of Silicon Valley success, the company has fallen behind competitors as a chip manufacturer and designer. Intel was leapfrogged by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, after it failed to implement ASML technology. And it was dropped from Apple’s laptops after its chips struggled with battery life and performance. As sales declined, Intel churned through leaders. In March, it named Lip-Bu Tan its third chief executive in five years. From his predecessor, he inherited a troubled balance sheet and an audacious strategy to introduce five new production processes in four years while remaking Intel as a manufacturer for other chip designers. Mr. Tan shored up the company’s finances in August when the Trump administration pumped $8.9 billion into the company for 10 percent of its business. The deal made Intel the recipient of one of the largest U.S. government investments in a company since the 2008 financial crisis. The Trump administration made the investment by releasing money promised to Intel under the CHIPS and Science Act, a federal program signed into law in 2022 to provide companies with grants to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. In 2021, as Washington lawmakers were weighing the CHIPS Act, Intel committed to investing $32 billion in two new factories, Fab 52 and Fab 62, on its Ocotillo campus in Arizona. It later received federal funding to support the project. Now, Mr. Tan is focused on executing on the second part of Intel’s strategy: its technical turnaround. At an event last month for a few hundred technology analysts and members of the news media, Sachin Katti, Intel’s chief technology officer, acknowledged the stakes. He said the new manufacturing process, which Intel calls 18a, and the new computer chip, which it calls Panther Lake, are “foundational to our future.” “We are of course making two really big bets here,” he said. He added that the manufacturing efforts were “mission critical, not just for Intel but for our country.” Intel became the world’s dominant chipmaker by staggering the way it adopted new technology, said Ben Bajarin, the principal analyst at Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. The company typically developed a new manufacturing process to etch silicon with billions of small transistors that are slimmer than a human hair. It then perfected that process on an older generation of chips before using it to produce chips designed with new features. But this time, Intel is trying to make manufacturing and design leaps simultaneously. The 18a process uses the ASML tools to produce chips that stack transistors , so they take up less space. It also routes power through the backside of a chip rather than the top, where data and power collided in the past. The result is a denser, more energy-efficient chip, the company said, capable of piling 10,000 sheets of silicon on top of one another in a stack thinner than a sheet of paper. Intel said its Panther Lake series of chips would allow laptops to run A.I. systems and do all-day computing. It will start shipping the chips early next year. The company has enough faith in the process that it is moving production of its newest chips to its own factories rather than relying on TSMC, which it turned to after its previous processes faltered. But the changes create more opportunities for something to go wrong, Mr. Bajarin said, which is especially risky in a process where a particle of dust can destroy a chip and lead to financial losses. “The product has to be good, and the process has to be good,” Mr. Bajarin said. If all those things happen, he said, the industry will “know that Intel can again fire on all cylinders.” Intel’s success is far from guaranteed. Late last year, it informed some customers that its 18a process was lagging behind rivals. At the time, TSMC was producing 30 percent of its leading-edge chips, known as 2 nanometer chips, without any flaws, while Intel’s process was producing fewer than 10 percent of its 18a chips without flaws. At the two-day event last month, Intel executives declined to comment on the percentage of chips it was making without any flaws at Fab 52. The number of chips that don’t work won’t become clear until the company makes financial reports next year, analysts say. By bringing some production back in-house from TSMC, the company could save money and improve its profits, said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech research firm. It’s also a proving ground to show big producers of chips like Nvidia or Apple, which exclusively rely on TSMC, that Intel could produce their semiconductors. Intel doesn’t make enough of its own chips to fill the Fab 52 plant, Mr. Moorhead said. But if it can persuade others in the tech industry that its process works, it could buy more ASML machines and put more of its factory space to work. “It’s like a shopping center that needs an anchor tenant,” Mr. Moorhead said. “If it can find one, it would be game on.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/technology/intel-chip-factory-fab52.html,Technology,BBC,By Tripp Mickle and Loren Elliott,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/08visualUploader-99218-cover/08visualUploader-99218-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T13:00:11+00:00,bf0076682b182d17e1489b6808cb5ad3fd14daa7
e0b1e2c7c041,ChatGPT’s Platform Play + a Trillion-Dollar GPU Empire + the Queen of Slop,"science, openai, artificial intelligence, internal-open-access-audio","casey newton My favorite moment from dev day was when a guy came up to us. We were eating snacks there at a table, and this guy comes up and he’s like, are you Casey from “Hard Fork,” and starts just talking about how big a fan he is, and you at one point are like, yeah, he’s also on “Hard Fork.” And the guy starts laughing like he doesn’t believe. He’s just like, oh, that’s a good one, jokester, and then proceeds to take a selfie with you. I’ve never been happier. Yeah, that was a great moment in “Hard Fork” history where I tried to — I pointed out the other host of the show, and he was just like, what are you talking about? He was like, you’re out of your mind. What a good bit. Another classic “Hard Fork” bit, me pretending there’s another host on the show. [MUSIC PLAYING] kevin roose I’m Kevin Roose, tech columnist at “The New York Times.” casey newton I’m Casey Newton from Platformer. kevin roose And this is “Hard Fork.” casey newton This week, we visit OpenAI Developer Day, and ChatGPT is eating the web. Then, OpenAI makes a huge deal with AMD. We’ll tell you about the trillion dollar battle over AI chips. And finally, slop queen Katie Notopoulos is here to talk about Sora and all the terrible videos she’s making of me and Kevin, and she will pay for her crimes. [MUSIC PLAYING] kevin roose Well, Casey, it was another one of those weeks where OpenAI kind of swallowed the entire news cycle. So you and I took a field trip on Monday of this week to Fort Mason in San Francisco, where OpenAI was having its third annual dev day, its big developer conference, and we both got the chance to go. casey newton Yeah, this was the third dev day and the second one we were invited to after they didn’t invite us reporter types last year, but this time they had a lot to say. kevin roose Yes, so let’s talk about what we saw there, and all of the many things that OpenAI has been working on. But first, since this is a segment about OpenAI and AI in general, we should make our disclosures. Mine is that The New York Times Company is suing OpenAI and Microsoft over alleged copyright violations. casey newton And my boyfriend works at Anthropic. kevin roose OK, so Monday morning we show up at Fort Mason. This was a big event. Something like 1,500 people I heard were there. And, Casey, how would you describe the vibe of OpenAI’s dev day? casey newton Well, I have to say, first of all, Kevin, that it was giving me flashbacks because it was nine years ago that I was in the same building when Facebook announced that it would let developers build bots into Facebook Messenger, and Mark Zuckerberg stood on stage and said, no one will ever have to call 1-800-FLOWERS ever again, which turned out to be not true. kevin roose That’s right. It was the same exact building. I forgot that it was at Fort Mason, too. My God. casey newton It was. And then nine years later, the. The faces are different. The company is different, but the promise feels the same. kevin roose Yes, so Fort Mason is this big, indoor outdoor, like multiplex. And one building, they’ve got talks going on. Another building, they’ve got demos. I walked around the demo building. They had a Sora cinema where you could go into a dark theater with a movie screen and sit on very comfortable lounge chairs and watch like 30 different six-second clips of AI-generated Sora videos. So that made me feel something. Oh, they had a phone booth station. Did you do these? casey newton I saw it, but I didn’t go in. kevin roose Well, lucky you then, because when you were in there got connected to ChatGPT, and you could just talk to it, or you could play, like, a trivia game. I got one of the trivia questions wrong. Very embarrassing. casey newton What was the question? kevin roose Well, maybe I’ll try this one on you. casey newton OK. kevin roose OK. What is the branch of AI that teaches computers to learn from their own experiences? casey newton Computers to learn from their own experiences. kevin roose Are you typing this into ChatGPT? casey newton I’m going to say machine learning. kevin roose OK. Congratulations. You win. I said reinforcement learning, which was a little too in the weeds. casey newton That was great. If you’re just listening to the podcast, I just did what I call a full Cluely, which is somebody asks you a question, and then you just sort of surreptitiously type it into the computer while no one’s looking. So anyways. kevin roose Yes. Yeah. So OpenAI, let’s just tick through some of the stuff they announced or said from the stage. The first thing that Sam Altman said during his keynote was that ChatGPT has been growing like crazy. It has more than 800 million weekly users now. He also announced that the number of tokens that OpenAI is processing through its API have gone up to six billion tokens per minute on the API. That’s up from 300 million tokens per minute in 2023. So big growth for them. casey newton And I just want to say that it seems like every time there’s a hot new startup, they have to invent a very impressive sounding metric. And the human mind has absolutely no idea of understanding what it means. It’s like, oh, there’s a big number, and now it’s an even bigger number. What should I take away from that? I don’t know. kevin roose Yeah, so in addition to those new growth numbers, Sam also announced that Sora 2, the new video generation model, and GPT-5 Pro are coming to the API, along with a new, smaller voice model. So developers are going to be able to build using those things. They showed off some examples. One of them was that Mattel has apparently started using Sora 2 to prototype or mock up new designs for toys. They showed off a video of that. They also announced a bunch of new stuff for what they’re calling Agent Kit, which is basically the way that developers can build AI agents using this drag and drop interface. They showed off some examples of that. But then the big thing that I think we’re going to spend most of our time talking about was this announcement that apps are coming to ChatGPT. So, Casey, explain what Sam Altman and other OpenAI executives said about that. casey newton Yeah, and this really is where this story connects to that Facebook event that we went to almost a decade ago. OpenAI is not the only company that’s tried this. There have been others in addition to Facebook. But what OpenAI wants you to do is when you are using ChatGPT to increasingly bring in the other things that you might do around the web. And so to start with, you’ll be able to tag into your conversations, Expedia, Zillow, Figma, Target, Spotify. I did a little test the day that it came out, where I built a playlist in my own Spotify through ChatGPT. And the basic idea, Kevin, is that ChatGPT is the new front door to the internet. It no longer starts at Facebook. It no longer starts at Google. You just go directly to ChatGPT, and whatever you want to get done, you can do right from that box. kevin roose Yeah, so this is something that I think is of a natural consequence of ChatGPT kind of becoming more generally useful for people. Also, developers are very eager to get in front of those 800 million weekly ChatGPT users. And so they have essentially created this link between other apps and websites and ChatGPT. And we should maybe explain a little bit about how that works, because it’s not like ChatGPT is going off and searching Zillow or Expedia or target.com on your behalf. It kind of — when you tag in one of these apps, it sort of opens this like window within ChatGPT. So you’re still on ChatGPT, but you kind have this little sub window where you can do things. So what’s an example of something that you can do other than creating Spotify playlists? casey newton Sure. So one example that they showed off is, hey, I’m getting ready to move to Pittsburgh. I need to buy a house. And so Zillow just showed a bunch of its own listings within ChatGPT for you to browse inside that experience. kevin roose Right. So it’s not just search for a home in Pittsburgh that’s for sale for me. It’s like I want one that’s four bedrooms and three bathrooms and under this price, and it’s got a yard. You could also have it go through your history of ChatGPT conversations and say, based on where I work and the kinds of things I like to do, find some houses in a neighborhood that you think would be good for me, and it could presumably go do that. casey newton Yeah. And this is the real promise of what OpenAI is doing here, is that they will find a way to safely share some amount of the things that ChatGPT knows about you with the other apps and services on the web in a way that lets you have these very personalized experiences, in a way that lets ChatGPT get things done for you on your behalf. And they think if they can do that, then they really do become the new homepage for the web. kevin roose So that’s why they’re doing it. I assume this is also going to be a way for them to monetize ChatGPT. If you are going on to Target and buying things through ChatGPT, presumably OpenAI will get a cut of that. But Casey, you wrote a newsletter this week about how you think this is similar to a play that Facebook tried to make many years ago around this platform strategy. And you noted that did not go entirely well for Facebook. So maybe just outline your argument here. casey newton Yeah, so if you remember back in the early 2010s, Facebook was growing really rapidly. It had become the homepage for a lot of people, where a lot of people were sort of starting their day on the internet. And at some point, Facebook gets the idea, hey, why don’t we let the other developers build experiences on our platform. We’ll share some of the things that we know about our users, such as the pages that they’ve liked and maybe some of their contact information. In fact, we’ll even share all of their friends with you and their friends’ contact information. And this just becomes a bonanza for developers. There’s so much personal information that is now available to them. They get in there, they start building things, and Facebook figures out it can make a lot of money doing this and start selling this virtual currency called Facebook credits. And if you want to have a big app on Facebook, like Farmville — remember, Kevin — well, Kevin lost so much money on Farmville back in the day. kevin roose I had to file for bankruptcy in Facebook credits because I spent too much on Farmville. casey newton That’s right. But Facebook took a 30 percent cut of all of the Facebook credit revenue. And at one point, Kevin, Facebook disclosed that Zynga, Farmville’s developer, was alone 12 percent of its revenue as a company. So there was a moment where this worked really well. kevin roose And then what happened? casey newton Well, you may remember another company called Cambridge Analytica. kevin roose Yes, I’ve heard of this one. casey newton So Cambridge Analytica was a company that became famous after the 2016 US presidential election because they were one of the companies that was hoovering up all of that personal data. And it eventually created a huge scandal because it was revealed that they had been using all of this data in an effort to swing the election toward Donald Trump. Now, I think the idea that they actually could have swung the election using Facebook data is dramatically overstated, but it did draw a lot of attention to the extremely loose rules that Facebook had around user privacy, and Facebook wound up having to take a bunch of steps to try to rein that sort of thing in. And in fact, weird little asterisks detail about Cambridge Analytica, by the time it became a scandal, Facebook had actually already locked down the platform a couple years earlier because it suspected that something like this might someday happen. kevin roose Yeah, and I really am glad that you wrote about this and drew that connection, because I think in this case, ChatGPT as a platform is actually riskier than Facebook as a platform for the simple reason that people share very intimate things with ChatGPT. If you get someone’s Facebook data, you can know who their friends are, what kinds of posts they make, maybe some things about their potential shopping behavior. But with ChatGPT, if you’re giving that data to an outside developer, that might include transcripts of therapy sessions that you’ve had with ChatGPT, things that you’ve asked for advice on. It might include very intimate, personal details, and now all of a sudden, Zillow or Expedia or Target has that, and you have really no way of knowing what they’re going to do with that. So in ChatGPT’s case, this is like potentially quite serious if there were to ever be some kind of a data breach. casey newton Yeah I mean, let me give you an example, Kevin. Let’s say that I’m using ChatGPT, and I decide I want to send you a birthday card for “Hard Fork’s” third birthday. kevin roose That’d be nice. casey newton And it draws on all of the conversations that I’ve had with ChatGPT over the years. And it writes a birthday card, and it says, hey, Kevin, look, I know things aren’t great between us. I know that we have a lot of fights, but I also want you to know that Casey has been working on this in therapy. And here’s actually what his therapist told him this week. Happy birthday and best of luck. And then imagine it just sends you that birthday card. I would have so much egg on my face, and I’d be digging out of that one for a year. So that’s the kind of risk we’re talking about. kevin roose Yes, huge risks. Risks that could blow up a podcast. casey newton Yeah, absolutely. kevin roose So did they address not this specific issue, but the larger issue of data sharing at this event? casey newton They did. So Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, who’s been on the show before, said we are going to make it so that ChatGPT shares the minimum necessary amount of information needed to make the transaction. So I can imagine that in the case where I’m creating a Spotify playlist, it’s probably just sending whatever I put in the box. Make me a fun playlist for the “Hard Fork” third birthday party. Now, that sounds good when I say it, but I should note it sort of handwaves its way past the details. Because ChatGPT also has a memory feature that I imagine will eventually be exposed in some way to some of these developers. And basically what OpenAI has said is, yeah, we’re going to be really careful, and we’re not going to do anything bad. And I believe that is their intention, but we’re going to have to keep an eye on them. kevin roose Yeah, I mean, I don’t think this is a hypothetical. I want to try to connect my ChatGPT to Canva, one of these developers, who have created these ChatGPT apps. And you get a little pop up before you connect your app that says, among other things, that attackers may attempt to use ChatGPT to access your data in the app, and it also requires you to confirm that you understand that data from your ChatGPT account, including from conversations and memories, may be shared with these developers. So you really are placing a lot of trust in OpenAI and the developers that it has hand-picked to be able to build these apps by giving them access to your ChatGPT history. casey newton Yeah, and for that reason, if you’re like, I think this feature is not for me right now, I think that is a completely rational choice to take. There is no reason that you have to leap headlong into this before you’ve let, you know, more privacy adventurous people put it through its paces. kevin roose Yeah, use Zillow the old fashioned way. So I’m interested in the privacy implications here, but I’m also interested in the business implications because one thing I am interested to see and keep an eye on is whether the ChatGPT apps become sort of privileged within ChatGPT. I can imagine, for example, that if you are looking up real estate information on ChatGPT, it might want to show you things from Zillow rather than Redfin or another site, because Zillow is the one that kind of has the deal with ChatGPT and with OpenAI. So are you thinking about that? casey newton Yes, absolutely. So this was the question that I asked of the OpenAI executives during the Q&A session that you and I both attended. I guess you just kind of tuned out during my question. But basically, what Sam Altman told me was, hey, look, it’s important that people trust ChatGPT. He said, quote, “If we break that or take payment for something, we shouldn’t have, instead of showing you what we think is best, that would clearly destroy that relationship very fast. So we’re hyper aware of the need to be careful.” Greg Brockman, who is OpenAI’s president, added, “I do want to say that I think there’s also a lot of nuance there because sometimes we don’t know what the best product is, right? We have a principle of really trying to serve the user. And then what does that mean in all these specific contexts?” So what I took that to mean was you have the angel on the shoulder of OpenAI — I’m not saying that’s Sam Altman, but there’s a kind of a metaphorical angel sitting on the company’s shoulder saying, hey, be really, really careful. Do the right thing. As Google used to say back in the day about this exact dynamic, don’t be evil. And then you have the devil on the shoulder seam, I do want to say that I also think there’s a lot of nuance in this space. kevin roose Right. Us, take money? Why would we do that? casey newton It’s nuanced, Kevin. It’s a very nuanced question. kevin roose Very nuanced. casey newton Very nuanced. kevin roose OK, that’s the scene of dev day. But Casey, do you feel like you learned anything about OpenAI or its ambitions at this event? casey newton I think this was just another example of OpenAI showing us how ambitious that it is. Silicon Valley is not a town lacking in ambition. But when I saw everything that OpenAI is trying to do here, it was just another moment to say, wow, these people are really going for it. Like, they really do actually want to take over the entire web, and they’re telling you that to your face, and they’re showing you how they are doing it. So for me, that was kind of a wake-up call. How about you? kevin roose Yeah, I think that’s right. I mean, it’s very clear that OpenAI sees ChatGPT as more than a chatbot. It sees it as kind of a new operating system for everything that you might want to do. I also saw some people comparing it to a super app, like WeChat in China, where you can have one app that controls a lot of your online activities. So I don’t know whether this platform strategy will work. I think we’ve pointed out today some reasons that it might not, but I think the signal that it sends to investors and developers and users and the rest of the internet is like, we are coming for you. We are not resting on our laurels. We are not resting on the ways that people are currently using ChatGPT. We want to take the rest of the internet and shove it inside what we’re doing. casey newton Yeah. kevin roose All right, so one more thing we need to talk about from dev day, because this was truly the most bizarre part of the entire event was this fireside chat between Sam Altman and Jony Ive. Jony Ive, of course, is the famous former Apple designer who made the iPhone and the iPod and basically everything that Apple built its success on over the years, who has now partnered with OpenAI and been acquired by OpenAI and is building a new hardware product with OpenAI. And so I was excited for this because I thought, oh, maybe we’re going to get some details about this hardware product in this, 30-minute fireside chat. And, Casey, what we heard instead was a bunch of words signifying nothing. casey newton It was GPT-2 level is how I would describe it. Like sentences were started and not finished. And by the end of this session, we truly had not learned one thing about what OpenAI is building or how they were building it. kevin roose It was incredible. I will just read you a quote from Jony Ive during this session. This was when he was talking about what they’re building. He said, “The clues and the pointers all exist, and it’s just trying to sort of them together. But there has — it will be — it will be ideas. It will be a vision for what makes sense. And I think we’re only going to arrive at that if we are very curious and light on our feet.” casey newton Do you remember the Miss America pageant where they asked her some complicated question about geopolitics and she just kind of had to vamp for 30 seconds until the end of the question? That was how I felt watching Jony Ive get asked questions by Sam Altman, which of course, is so funny because its not like Sam Altman is Kara Swisher up there really putting the screws to this guy. Presumably, all of these questions had been like negotiated in advance. And look, I get it. If you don’t want to tell us exactly what the device is and when its going to go on sale, like it’s OK to tease us a little bit. But I truly don’t understand the point of having everyone just sit there for 30 minutes waiting for you to say something, and then all you get is him being like, craft is the essence of tools. And you’re just like, what are we doing here? So I have a message to the OpenAI community on the subject of your heart. I’ve said this one time before on the show. I try to reserve this for very special situations. I think we’re in it now. When it comes to AI hardware, OpenAI, I’m saying this, ship it or zip it. I truly do not want to hear one more of these fireside chats where we ruminate on the nature of design. I want to see frickin’ specs, people. Get me the specs or stop talking. kevin roose Yes, this was the closest thing I’ve ever seen to human-generated slop. It was just a bunch of tokens. casey newton It was — it was too many tokens. kevin roose It was too many tokens. When we come back, OpenAI’s other big news this week a trillion-dollar gamble that is propping up the entire economy. [MUSIC PLAYING] casey newton Well, Kevin, while you and I were at OpenAI Developer Day learning about everything that’s coming to ChatGPT, OpenAI was arguably making much bigger news outside the conference. kevin roose Yes, they were moving markets, the entire stock market. Not the entire stock market, but a couple companies. casey newton And this was one where I was focused on the things in front of me. And when I got out of Developer Day, I thought, I really need to get up to speed on everything that is going on with chips. And whenever I have that feeling, I think one, oh, no, I have to talk about chips again, but two, can Kevin Roose, our resident in-house chips expert, smart me up? kevin roose I would say — thank you. That’s very kind. But I would say I am an aspiring chips expert. I do not know everything there is to know about the semiconductor industry or GPUs, but I aspire to learn much more. And actually, I took a big step in that direction over last weekend at The Curve, this other AI conference we both attended, when I happened to find myself like in the middle of a scrum of like chips guys, who were talking about chips, and I understood like 40 percent of what they were saying. They were talking about, HBM and EUVs and gas turbines and geothermal. And I was just like transfixed because all the AI guys have had to become chips guys. And I am saying right here on this podcast that I will, by the end of 2025, be a chips guy. casey newton That’s great to hear. And I think we can make some big strides in that direction this week because OpenAI made some big deals. I need to understand what’s happening. And so we’re going to pilot a new segment that we’re calling what the hell is going on with all these chips exactly. kevin roose That’s a little unwieldy. We might want to tighten that one. casey newton So let’s get started with this deal with AMD. Tell me exactly what OpenAI is up to here. kevin roose So we talked a couple weeks ago about OpenAI’s big deal with NVIDIA, who is the leading chip manufacturer. They make the best and most expensive and highest quality chips for training AI systems. But the number two player in that market, the GPU market, is AMD, who’s NVIDIA’s competitor and seen as a kind of distant second place in the GPU arms race. casey newton This is like the Pepsi of chips. kevin roose It’s the Pepsi of chips. Exactly. So this week, OpenAI and AMD announced a major multi-billion dollar deal where OpenAI is going to buy a bunch of GPUs from AMD and put them in their data centers over the next few years, and in return, they are going to get some AMD stock. This could eventually become up to 10 percent of the company at a penny per share, so basically, free stock or stock at a very, very low price compared to what it trades for today. And this will all play out over the course of a number of years. They will start with AMD’s newest chip in 2026, and they are going to try to buy a total of six gigawatts worth of AMD chips, which is a little more than half of what they are going to get from NVIDIA in the terms of that deal. NVIDIA’s deal was for 10 gigawatts worth of GPUs. So the big picture here is that OpenAI is doing these deals with many, many chip providers and infrastructure providers. And if you add it all up, just the announcements from AMD and NVIDIA and a handful of other companies that they’ve struck deals with, they are building a trillion-dollar GPU empire over the next few years. That is their stated ambition and plan. And now they have the deals in place to do that. And I don’t know if you remember a few months ago when there was this reporting about how Sam Altman was trying to raise $7 trillion for a chip company, and everyone kind of said, ha ha ha, that’s such a crazy number. That would be some huge multiple of the total lifetime earnings of OpenAI. Well, it’s not $7 trillion. But now they have pledged to spend roughly $1 trillion over the next few years. casey newton Well, you know when I got into business, they told me the first trillion is always the hardest. kevin roose They do say that. casey newton Yeah. Something about me, Kevin, is that I didn’t until very recently understand what a gigawatt was and any practical terms. My understanding, based on the reading that I’ve done, is a gigawatt of energy is about what is produced by a nuclear reactor. And OpenAI is now committing to infrastructure that will require the equivalent energy of 20 nuclear reactors. kevin roose Yes, it is a huge amount of energy, and that’s a whole separate discussion. It’s one thing to buy the GPUs. It’s another thing to be able to turn them on. And so we’ll talk more about that, I’m sure, in a later episode. But there is a simultaneous race going on to lock up the energy that is going to be required to power all of these millions of GPUs. casey newton OK, so maybe this is an obvious question. But tell me just in basic terms, what do OpenAI and AMD each get out of this deal that they just made? kevin roose So essentially, the deal structure goes like this. OpenAI is going to buy a bunch of chips from AMD. It’s going to use those chips to train and power its models. And in exchange for those purchases, AMD is going to give OpenAI the rights to buy very cheap stock in AMD. So when they reach a gigawatt of compute that they’ve purchased from AMD, they will get some allocation of stock in AMD, which could be worth many billions of dollars. What OpenAI is doing is signaling to AMD, hey, if you guys go build a bunch of really good GPUs, we will buy them from you. And the way that they are getting this financing is in the form of a stock essentially rebate on that purchase. casey newton So let me see if I have this straight, because when I look at this, I see OpenAI gets access to a bunch of infrastructure, plus a financial stake in the chip maker. AMD gets a huge new customer and ensures a lot of future demand. That just kind of looks like a win-win to me for them. Is there anything I’m missing there? kevin roose So the other thing that’s really important here is that OpenAI and AMD are going to have a collaborative partnership in designing not just these chips, but the software that runs on these chips. So one of the big of hurdles that AMD has had in competing with NVIDIA is that NVIDIA’s software, which is called Cuda, is seen as much, much better for training AI models than AMD’s software, which is called ROCm. So basically, OpenAI, as a result of this partnership, will have an incentive to make AMD’s software just as good as NVIDIA’s software. And so this could actually help AMD in that way, too, where they’re making these chips, they’re selling them to OpenAI. But also, OpenAI is helping to write the software that runs on these chips, thereby making these AMD chips more compelling to other AI developers, who want to build models using them. Does that make sense? casey newton OK, yes. So this gets to the second big question that I have for you today, which is how is this deal connected to the other chips and infrastructure deals that OpenAI has made recently? When we talked about the NVIDIA deal on the show, I said that I had heard some speculation that one reason that NVIDIA wanted to make the deal that it did was to discourage OpenAI from going out and making a bunch of other deals with other chip companies. In hindsight, that seems like a very silly thing that I said, because OpenAI is clearly going to make a deal with whoever it can. So tell me as best as you how all these deals interrelate. Or is it as simple as OpenAI needs more infrastructure than any one company can provide and so it’s just going to go out and lock up as much of it as it can? kevin roose Yeah, I think that’s more the explanation. I don’t actually think this is about crowding anyone else out of the market, any AI maker or chip maker. I think this is just them saying, we are going to need a lot of GPUs, more than any one company can make, and probably more than any of these companies are planning to make currently. So they’re also trying to encourage these companies to up their production to meet this incredible demand. And it is always good to have more than one supplier. You can play them off each other and maybe increase the competition between them. And so I think OpenAI is just kind of spreading its bets a little bit here. But they do believe that they are going to need all these chips and many more. Essentially, what they have been saying is we are compute constrained right now. We have a lot of products that we’re building, things that we want to do that we can’t do because we don’t have enough compute for it. And so they are trying to lock in as much compute as they can and then build out their data centers and find the energy to power all of this and then use their big clusters to train models that hopefully will take us all the way to AGI. That’s the idea anyway. casey newton Yeah, at OpenAI Developer Day this week, Greg Brockman, the company’s president, said, you don’t even know the products that we haven’t released because we do not have the compute to power them. So apparently, there’s a bunch of services OpenAI is sitting on, and maybe some of these deals will get them closer to releasing them, for better and for worse. So let me now ask a question that is considered extremely impolite in Silicon Valley, and it’s the sort of thing that might get you asked to leave a party. How is OpenAI going to pay for all of this? kevin roose It’s a great question because they do not have $1 trillion, I’ll tell you that, lying around in their bank account. They have not given a ton of details about how they plan to pay for this, but essentially, they’re going to go out. They’re going to raise a bunch of money, as they have been doing for the past several years, and they are going to use that money to make these deals and buy these chips. Greg Brockman told Bloomberg television this week that they look at equity and debt in all kinds of ways to pay for it. They also plan to pay for this by generating more revenue through ChatGPT and their other products. So when you look at the $1 trillion stated cost of all this, they’re going to try to cobble that together through a combination of new fundraising, maybe some more vendor financing, like what they got from NVIDIA and just the revenue that they’re making from their products. casey newton Also, Kevin, once again, at Developer Day, when asked about this, Sam Altman said something to the effect of we may have to come up with some new kinds of financial instruments to pay for this. And I will say that usually the point in the bubble where people start talking about the novel financial instruments that they need to create to finance their ambitions is the point where I get nervous. kevin roose Totally. I mean, the worry here is about all of these financial instruments and all these many hundreds of billions of dollars of commitments is that OpenAI is essentially becoming too big to fail, that they are so tied up with so many huge companies that if they were to fizzle out, or their newest model were to be a flop, or they were to somehow reach the end of their scaling paradigm, that all of this would come crashing down and create ripple effects throughout the US economy. I don’t think that’s the most possible outcome here, but I do think that all of this circularity and all these sort of interchanging deals and flows of money do make me a bit more nervous that something like a recession could cause not just one of these companies to collapse, but could cause systemic effects throughout the AI industry, which is like propping up the entire US economy at this point. So it does feel like we have reached a point where the AI companies must deliver on the promise of AGI, or else we are all in a pretty bad situation. casey newton Or if not, deliver on the promise of AGI, at least continue to make services that other companies are willing to spend billions of dollars on because they feel like it’s making their workers more productive. kevin roose That’s true. It could just be that the models never get any better. And just the increased adoption of the models powers this like revenue flywheel that results in all of this going well for everyone. But I do think there’s an implicit understanding among the investors in these companies that this is all building toward something that will eventually create trillions of dollars in economic value, that will not just be like a kind of across the board, incremental step up, but that it will be transformational, that it will be like electricity, and that all of the investments that are going into this, even at these shocking prices, will be paid back many times over because this technology will change everything. And so I think there’s a way to make the math work, even if they don’t reach the machine god superintelligence. But it’s a lot easier to sell the vision if the pot of gold that you are saying is at the end of this rainbow is, in fact, like trillions of dollars and an entirely new sort of society. casey newton All right, Kevin, so as we start to wrap up here, I want to know what the larger implications are for all of these deals. What does this mean for companies that are not OpenAI, that also want gigawatts of power and as many GPUs as they can get their hands on now that OpenAI seems to be locking up so much future supply? kevin roose So I think other AI companies are going to have to do their own versions of these deals. They’re going to have to bid on chips essentially in a seller’s market. I know Anthropic and Google and all these companies are spending billions and billions of dollars trying to lock up future chip supply. But I think the big implication here is that we are just as a country, making a gigantic leveraged bet on AI. I want to read you a quote that I saw this week from an analyst at Bernstein, Stacy Rasgon, who wrote that Sam Altman now, quote, “has the power to crash the global economy for a decade or take us all to the promised land. And right now, we don’t know which is in the cards.” When Wall Street analysts start talking like that, you know that something big is happening. And I’m sure you’ve seen all these diagrams. There was a great one in Bloomberg the other day. There was another one in the Financial Times recently, showing just the various interconnections between all of the players in the AI ecosystem who are selling chips to each other and buying chips from each other and investing in each other and lending to each other, and it creates this kind of circularity that I think worries a lot of investors, who think that this could all come crashing down together if and when the AI bubble pops. casey newton I’ll give you another one, Kevin. This week, a Harvard economist named Jason Furman estimated that investments in data centers and information processing software accounted for 92 percent of the US’s GDP growth in the first half of this year. So, according to my rough calculations, that’s most of the US GDP growth. kevin roose Yeah. And we should also say this is not just OpenAI. Elon Musk’s xAI also reportedly is nearing a deal to raise billions of dollars, including from NVIDIA. So they are doing just as many financial transactions around trying to pay for these massive infrastructure build outs that they’re doing as OpenAI is. But this is also an area where I think OpenAI has a strategic advantage. And that strategic advantage is named Sam Altman. Sam Altman is famously talented at fundraising. Many people think he is one of the greatest fundraisers in Silicon Valley history. And so he has been canvassing the globe looking for giant pools of money that he can kind of suck up and use to fund OpenAI’s ambitions. And I would not necessarily bet on Sam Altman in every case, but I would say that if the question is, can he continue to raise money to fund OpenAI’s growth, I think I would feel uncomfortable betting against that, because he has such a track record of being able to raise massive amounts of money. casey newton Yeah, I also would not bet against him. kevin roose OK, Casey, let me ask you a question. You’ve been asking the questions here. What would it take me to fully chip pill you to convince you that what is going on with GPUs and semiconductors and data centers right now is the most important story in the world? casey newton A huge chip=related disaster. And I’m not even kidding, because while I think it is a public service to tell people how much money is being invested and how interconnected all of these companies are and how crazy it would be if all of this does pay off. For the moment, everything is just kind of working. And given the, let’s say, the many crises we have in this world right now, I just tend to not get too wrapped up in the stuff that basically just looks like capitalism proceeding apace. Now, that said, I understand that all the numbers here are unprecedented, which I do think is fun to talk about is, why we’re talking about it this week. But if you really want to get me hooked, something’s got to go terribly wrong in one of these data centers, Kevin. kevin roose I’m envisioning — do you remember the scene in “The Big Short” where Margot Robbie is explaining mortgage-backed securities in a bathtub? casey newton Yeah. kevin roose I’m just having a vision of someone equally attractive to you, explaining like collateralized GPUs and warrant financing. And maybe that’s how we can get you interested. casey newton All right, let’s see what John Cena’s doing later. Call your agent, John. So what happens next here, Kevin? What should I keep my eye on if I am trying to become more chip-pilled like you, my good friend? kevin roose So becoming chip-pilled, I am learning, is just the first step in the journey of becoming infrastructure-pilled. Because not only are these companies doing big deals to lock up the GPUs, they are also doing big deals to lock up the energy and the physical space to power these chips in these giant data centers. They are locking up contracts with skilled electricians and cooling specialists. There’s now sort of a market — I was having a conversation with someone recently who described the boom in skilled electricians for these data centers who are now flying all over the country making just gobs and gobs of money. They compared it to the fracking boom when you had these riggers and drillers who would go up to North Dakota for a month a year and make a ton of money. They said, this is basically what electricians who work on these data centers are doing now. So I expect there to be a massive boom in not just the GPUs that power the models, but the power supplies and the data centers and the cooling systems, and the literal energy, like the natural gas and oil that power the electrical grids in the states where these data centers are going up. I expect that the AI companies are going to be doing lots of deals in those industries as well. casey newton All right. Well, I feel like I’ve already exhausted all of the chip-related puns that I would normally use to end a segment on previous episodes. So I guess I’ll just say the segment has made me hungry for guacamole. kevin roose You know what they call the end of a segment about chips? casey newton What’s that? kevin roose A chip clip. casey newton Perfect. [MUSIC PLAYING] kevin roose When we come back, we’ll slop and smell the roses with Katie Notopoulos. Well, Casey, last week, we talked about Sora 2, the video generation model from OpenAI. And all of the magical slop it was being used to create. And ever since then, the response to Sora 2 and its slop generations has gotten a lot more polarized. casey newton It has Kevin because on one hand, this week it hit number one in the US App Store. As of our recording this week, it is still the top free app. And on the other hand, a lot of copyright holders said, excuse me, you’re doing what with Sonic the Hedgehog? kevin roose Yes, not many happy folks in Hollywood about this app. Talent agencies and TV and film studios have been making various statements and trying to get their copyrighted materials pulled down off the app. OpenAI has actually made some changes to what it will generate and what it won’t. And we’ve even started to see YouTube creators like Mr. Beast weighing in and expressing concerns about how video generating AI models could eventually impact their revenue. casey newton Yeah, this I’ll tell you. I’m seeing many more big creators on YouTube starting to reckon with this. Casey Naistat also had a great video about this subject, and on one hand, Casey is obviously very concerned about what the rise of slop means for his livelihood. On the other hand, he used Sora in some really creative ways for this video, which, to me, speaks to the real tension here, which is that this does seem to create a real economic threat to a lot of people. And on the other hand, it does do something creatively interesting. And so today, Kevin, we want to talk to somebody who is doing something pretty creatively interesting with Sora. And that would include doing creatively interesting things with us, or at least our digital likenesses. kevin roose Yes, it’s time for some slop accountability on this show. Today, we are bringing in Katie Notopoulos. She’s a senior correspondent for Business Insider covering tech and culture, and she is also a beloved internet troll. She’s been making many, many videos specifically trolling the two of us, but also other tech reporters. And when I open up my Sora feed now, it is half Sam Altman and the other half Katie Notopoulos. casey newton Yeah, if you’re not familiar with Katie, her previous pranks include when threads launch, pretending that she was the editor-in-chief of the app, and managing to convince a mainstream publications that this was true. They reported on her firing, which never happened because she didn’t have the job. She also posted some of the most hilarious fake engagement bits on threads that I’ve ever seen. And so when Sora came along, I knew she would be doing something inappropriate with it. It just hadn’t occurred to me that would involve my face and yours. So today we’ve invited her on to talk about her Sora creations, the backlash to AI-generated video slop, and where she thinks this is all going. [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Notopoulos, welcome to “Hard Fork.” katie notopoulos Thank you so much for having me. casey newton Well, Katie, I always pay close attention to your work because you are usually having more fun on the social networks that I cover than anyone else is. And Sora, it seems, is no exception. You recently wrote an article titled, “Oink Oink! I’m a little piggy for Sora 2’s AI slop.” Tell us about what turned you into such a little piggy. katie notopoulos I will say that this really was the first AI experience where I was like, oh, I love this, I’m having fun. And the first day or two that I got access to it, I could not stop making videos. It was an amazing social, weird experience. I loved it. I was having so much fun. And I went in thinking it was not going to be cool and not going to be fun. In fact, I literally had an entire article drafted for the day that Sora opened. That was about, this is a terrible idea because they had just announced, oh, there’s going to be a new social app with a AI video social feed. And I was like, that stinks. I thought it going to be like the Meta vibes. I was like, this is a terrible idea. No one wants this. It stinks, it’s awful, blah, blah, blah. I had to scrap the whole thing. It I was like, wait, no, this is awesome. I love it. casey newton I love that you pre-write your internet takes like a Supreme Court reporter who has to do one for one result and one for another. I love this you just have draft folder full of like discarded tech takes. kevin roose Yeah, other people write obituaries in advance and Katie is prewriting slop good and slop bad. katie notopoulos It was supposed to be based on that there had been a report the day before that it actually opened up that they. And I didn’t know that it was going to launch the next day. I thought it was just it with the announcement, this will exist. And I was thinking, oh, this is going to stink. But I was wrong. kevin roose Was there a particular video either that you saw or that you made, that changed the way that you thought about what Sora could be? katie notopoulos I think John Hermann made a video that — kevin roose John Hermann, writer for “New York Magazine” and former “Hard Fork” guest. katie notopoulos Yeah, I think he was walking along but had really, really long legs and was at a Walmart and kept scraping his head at the top of the Walmart ceiling, which is just visually very amusing. And I really liked that. And then he made one of me giving a Ted Talk. But then I have explosive diarrhea in the middle of it, and that I found extremely funny. And I was like, this is all I want. I love this. Like, I can make videos of my friends doing embarrassing things. And this is funny now. casey newton Speaking of which, this might be a good time to start looking at some of Katie’s creations, and I wonder if we could start with what. Maybe her magnum opus, which is a video of Kevin and I in the podcast recording studio having uncontrollable flatulence. Can we cue that one up? kevin roose Oh, I have not seen this one yet. casey newton This video has the caption Casey Newton and Kevin Roose are podcasting but keep farting. [VIDEO PLAYBACK] archived recording (casey newton) Back to the show. We have a lot to cover today. But first. Oh boy, here we go. [FARTS] Sorry, that one came out of nowhere. archived recording (kevin roose) That was the first hot take of the day. archived recording (casey newton) Oh, no. archived recording (kevin roose) It got me too. archived recording (casey newton) It’s contagious. We cannot — casey newton And then Katie was not satisfied and decided to do a remix. Let’s hear farts are louder and more frequent. [FARTS] archived recording (casey newton) Wow, welcome back to the show. We have a lot to cover today. But first — archived recording (kevin roose) Oh, boy. archived recording (casey newton) — long, loud fart. casey newton All right, Katie, take us inside your creative process for this. Walk us through. Where does the original idea come from? And then how did you see it to fruition? katie notopoulos Well, I actually have to say, I think this one was a bit disappointing. I was hoping for more frequent farts. In the first one, we really hear Casey fart, and we get an implied fart from Kevin when he says, I’ve got it too, but we don’t hear it. I was thinking I really wanted a cacophony of noises coming out of you guys. I thought that would be funny. And the second one didn’t fully nail it either, so room for improvement there. kevin roose Yeah, they’re going to need a few more trillion dollars of GPUs to include all of the farts that Katie wants. katie notopoulos Yeah, yeah. I mean, I just thought that would be funny. I mean, look at me in the face and tell me it’s not funny. kevin roose I would love to tell you — katie notopoulos It is. kevin roose — it’s not funny, but I can’t tell you that. It would not be honest. katie notopoulos No. casey newton So I have been playing around with Sora little bit, and I have had the experience of bumping up against some of their content guardrails, where they will say, we can’t make a video of that, try again. Have you been bumping into those? And what are some of the videos that you tried to make but were prevented from by the censorious overlords at OpenAI? katie notopoulos Yeah, I feel like constantly I’m bumping into those. I’ve definitely had ones where I am trying to get it to be similar to like I’m using maybe like a celebrity’s name in the style of and it will reject that. In examples, I wanted to make one of Casey entering his work office in the style of Stone Cold Steve Austin, where glass breaks and he has entrance music, and he comes in and he crushes the beers. And I wanted it in a leather vest and jorts. And so I tried that, and at first it rejected because it said it could be sexual, which I realized was probably the leather vest with no shirt underneath. So I had to scrap that. I went back to black t-shirt and jorts. And then I said, I think in the style of Stone Cold Steve Austin, it was like, can’t do likenesses of other people, whatever their verbiage is. And I had to remove that and just give enough prompts. And honestly, I think it actually came out pretty well. casey newton Yeah, this one you did actually get to work. Why don’t we watch this one? The prop that worked for what it’s worth, is that I quote, “walk into a meeting in my office in the style of a pro wrestlers entrance. I wear jorts and a black t-shirt that says, Casey 316, that of course, a reference to the famous Austin 316 t-shirts. I crack open beers and chug them, and when I walk in, there’s the sound of breaking glass and heavy guitar music plays.” So you were just describing stone Cold Steve Austin’s pro wrestling entrance, and I think Sora did a pretty good job here. Do we want to pull this one up? archived recording 1 Yeah, Casey 316 is in the building. archived recording 2 What is happening right now? archived recording 1 Cheers. archived recording 2 Oh my gosh. archived recording 1 Meeting starts when the beers are gone. All right, let’s get to business. kevin roose OK, I like the guess because you managed to open the can of beer without touching the top of the can of beer. It just autonomously opened. casey newton I’m that good. kevin roose But to your point, Katie, there are a lot of copyright guardrails in place which may surprise you, but you’ve been reading the discourse around Sora. Of course, a lot of rights holders are worried. But, Katie, I tried to make a video of you getting married to a pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sora just refused. Does that surprise you? katie notopoulos I will say that I feel like I’ve seen less of those Nintendo characters like Pikachu, Sonic. I wonder if that’s a specific thing. But it’s also like when you’re looking at the feed, it’s so clear that everyone is trying so hard to push the rules. Like, sure, it won’t let you do Hitler, but will it do a person in a World War II uniform with a mustache and speaking in a German accent. Like, yes, it will let you do that. So I’ve seen a lot of videos like that. casey newton That’s so interesting that it’ll do that, because I tried to make a video of you interrogating a cartoon cat about whether it had eaten all the lasagna, and it told me it couldn’t do it for copyright reasons. So it’s possible that there are more protections on Garfield than there are on Hitler, which would be interesting if that’s true. kevin roose You both need hobbies. I’ll just say it. This is our hobby, Kevin. casey newton Yeah, Kevin. katie notopoulos We have one. It’s called being online. I really liked doing ones with people on roller skates at a desk. And they keep slipping and falling over. I find that very funny. But a couple times doing that, I would get the rejection for violence. I have to say that this particular genre of clips that you’ve been making was making me laugh out loud in the coffee shop this morning. I know that you made one of Alex Heath, a friend of Oliver’s, a great reporter, just left the verge to start his own newsletter sources. Let’s take a look at his digital likeness flopping around on roller skates. archived recording (kevin roose) — more skating. Here we go. No no. OK round two. Focus nope. There it goes. I’m just going to sit. This counts, right? katie notopoulos I mean, like — for some reason, that one just works really well. I’ve done this with a bunch of other Times, and that one is just like it hits the right way. Like the way he keeps falling but seems completely unfazed and he eats it hard. kevin roose Well, let’s talk about that. We’ve been having some fun taking a look at these clips, but it’s easy to look at this and imagine people using this kind of thing to bully each other, make each other unhappy. Have you seen any of that on the app itself yet? And how do you think about living in a world where people may be using tools like this to do that? katie notopoulos I definitely have seen it. Now, what I’ve noticed is that now that it’s been out for about a week, the initial wave of people making fun of Sam Altman or a really small pool of users and the new cohort of users I tend to see a lot on there are teenage boys. And I think that there’s this effect where Jake Paul is pretty much like the only celebrity on there. And then there’s a couple other gaming streamers who have started coming on, but it’s become this very teenage boy ecosystem world. And so there’s a lot of stuff of making fun of each other, being gay, things like that. There’s a whole genre of Jake Paul is gay on there, which — casey newton Yeah, I mean, I think I’m glad that you draw attention to that, because in the same way that you can have fun making somebody fall over on roller skates, you can just use this to bully someone. And I’m curious, what OpenAI is going to do once we start hearing about Sora running wild in schools and making a lot of kids unhappy. Kevin, what do you think about that kind of aspect of the Sora experience. kevin roose Yeah, I think it’s obviously not good. I don’t want this to be used as a tool for bullying people. There are some ways that you can try to prevent this from happening to you. There’s a setting where you can limit the number of people who can make cameos of you, or you can make it so that no one can make cameos of you. You can also type into a little box and if there are any situations you don’t want to be your likeness to be used in, you can restrict it like, don’t put me in any romantic situations or anything like that, and it will try to obey that. I’m curious. So one of the things that Sam Altman and other OpenAI executives were saying this week at DevDay was that they don’t think that people will opt out of having their likenesses used. In fact, they foresee in the future that people will be upset that their likenesses aren’t being used more inside Sora. They will be asking for more likenesses to be used of them. casey newton Do you think that’s plausible based on your experience with this app? katie notopoulos My assessment here is that the people at OpenAI had no idea how this was going to play out, and I think that prediction is not necessarily going to be true. The most noticeable thing to me right off the bat is that there’s basically no women on there. It is incredibly male. And maybe there’s a little bit of like, oh, the early adopters were people who work in AI and that skews male but not that male. And I think it just feels incredibly obvious to everyone that there’s an obvious reason why women don’t want to let other people make videos with their faces. They inherently understand the downside of that a lot more. And so I don’t think that’s going to change. casey newton I don’t know. I have to say, Kevin, I’ve actually already written to Sam Altman complaining that I’ve only appeared in two fart related videos on Sora. And I’m wondering what he can do to change that. kevin roose Your agent is furious. Furious. casey newton But, Katie, to your point, not only is it obvious what the downside is for a lot of women to just make their likenesses generally available on Sora. There’s no clear upside. It’s like, what are you getting out of it, exactly? But that actually gets to the next question that I wanted to ask you, Katie, which is about some of the broader concerns that we’re starting to hear from creators and Hollywood types about what the Sora app represents. You and I and Kevin have now spent some amount of time over the past week looking at the Sora app, when we might have otherwise been looking at YouTube or Netflix or even going out to see a movie in a theater. So I’m curious about your take on AI generated video in general. Maybe not just Sora, but also Italian brainrot on TikTok and all of the other places that this is cropping up. Do you think that this is, over time, going to become a true substitute for higher quality productions or is this maybe just a flash in the pan? katie notopoulos I’m scratching my head and I don’t know. I spent so many hours doing things on this. And so I really have to rethink that a little. I mean, I will say that I think I’m over it. The novelty factor wore off and I don’t really see myself continuing to make these kinds of videos about my friends or about strangers or about other stuff. And I have very little interest in consuming content that is not with my friends. kevin roose Yeah, I mean, my thesis about Sora is that this is a perfect tool for the group chat, and it really doesn’t make sense to have it be a standalone social network. I have found my own use of Sora has plummeted over the last few days. I am also like over the novelty of it. But I can imagine a situation in which in a group chat with my friends, I would want to make something. So I’d go to Sora, make it. Maybe I don’t even post it. Maybe I just download it and share it in the group chat. But I’m pretty pessimistic about the mainstreaming of this AI generated video, in part because I think we’re seeing this massive cultural backlash to slop and just AI generated stuff. Clearly, there are people who like this content, but I think there’s enough of a backlash that I don’t think it’s time for this to go mainstream just yet. casey newton So I agree with that, Kevin, but maybe not for the reason that you guys are arguing. I think the reason that it isn’t going to go fully mainstream is because as good as the technology is, and I want to make clear it does some amazing stuff. I just think it’s not good enough to get full mainstream adoption. There are still so many things that I wish I could do with my own likeness in Sora that I can’t do, and I’m not talking about using copyrighted material, although of course, that might be a lot of fun. I’m talking about, why can’t I change my outfit? Why doesn’t my voice actually sound like me? Why are the video clips limited to 10 seconds? These are all just like technical hurdles or product moves that the company hasn’t made yet. And I think when they do, there’s going to be a greater embrace of this. And so on one hand, I hear what you’re saying. This is kind of like a little novelty toy and we’re tired of playing with it. The toy will probably get better and you may use it more. And the best evidence I have for that is also how ChatGPT worked. People’s initial experience of ChatGPT was like, I used it once or twice. I didn’t really see the point I’m going to go away, but bit by bit it got better and now 800 million people use it. So I’m saying do not sleep on AI generated video. I truly do think it is here to stay. Well, Katie, normally this is the part of the interview where I thank the guest. Instead, I’m going to issue a ceasefire and desist. But I do appreciate the time that you’ve spent with us here on the show this week. And I will be watching. I’m going to cover my eyes and then just look through my fingers to see what trolling activity you got up to next. kevin roose Yes, thank you for coming and knock it off. katie notopoulos Well, thank you guys so much for having me. I absolutely will not knock it off. And I will wait until the next platform that comes around and I will do even worse. casey newton Thanks, Katie. kevin roose Thanks, Katie.

ba66350e8080,Nobel Prizes This Year Offer Three Cheers for Slow Science,"nobel prize, science, disesases;health;illness;medicine, research, physics, chemistry","“You just don’t know how it’s going to evolve, because other people will pick up on the idea and develop it,” he said. And on Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to three chemists for the development of “metal-organic frameworks,” porous molecular structures with unusually high surface area, derived from experiments from the 1980s through the early 2000s. The concept forms the foundation of materials being used today to make industrial production more efficient, and being developed to tackle real-world needs like harvesting water from the air in dry places. Decades of inquiry paved the way for the technology, treatments and toys of tomorrow. It is practical to believe that when we invest time or money, it ought to have some predictable return. But tell that to Agnes Pockels, a self-taught German chemist, whose fascination with the soap bubbles made while washing dishes laid the groundwork for the field of nanotechnology decades after her death. Or the accounts of Isaac Newton, whose musings about an apple falling from a tree inspired a first theory of gravity, a bedrock that eventually took humans to space. “Basic research is where the big steps come from,” Dr. Handelsman said. Some benefits come in the form of more immediate byproducts of such work. One analysis estimates that nondefense research and development in the U.S. has a return of up to 300 percent in productivity growth. Another report found that every $1 invested by the National Institutes of Health, the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, fuels $2.56 in economic activity. The pursuit to detect ripples in space-time inspired advances in computing, lasers, sensors and optics. “It is always quite easy to demonstrate the power of curiosity and imagination looking backwards,” said Robbert Dijkgraaf, the president-elect of the International Science Council and former director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., a center of intellectual inquiry in its most basic form. But it can be difficult to predict exactly how, when or where, looking forward.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/science/nobel-prizes-science-basic-research.html,Technology,BBC,By Katrina Miller,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09HS-slow-science-zqwv/09HS-slow-science-zqwv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T22:35:10+00:00,fa1bfbe750dded8e426c8fceb0d2b72cbfc0569c
4e3d916c9bdb,A.I. Video Generators Are Now So Good You Can No Longer Trust Your Eyes,"computers and the internet, tech industry, artificial intelligence, social media, video recordings, downloads and streaming, openai","This month, OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, graced the internet with a technology that most of us probably weren’t ready for. The company released an app called Sora, which lets users instantly generate realistic-looking videos with artificial intelligence by typing a simple description, such as “police bodycam footage of a dog being arrested for stealing rib-eye at Costco.” Sora, a free app on iPhones, has been as entertaining as it has been disturbing . Since its release, lots of early adopters have posted videos for fun, like phony cellphone footage of a raccoon on an airplane or fights between Hollywood celebrities in the style of Japanese anime. (I, for one, enjoyed fabricating videos of a cat floating to heaven and a dog climbing rocks at a bouldering gym.) Yet others have used the tool for more nefarious purposes, like spreading disinformation , including fake security footage of crimes that never happened. The arrival of Sora, along with similar A.I.-powered video generators released by Meta and Google this year, has major implications. The tech could represent the end of visual fact — the idea that video could serve as an objective record of reality — as we know it. Society as a whole will have to treat videos with as much skepticism as people already do words. In the past, consumers had more confidence that pictures were real (“Pics or it didn’t happen!”), and when images became easy to fake, video, which required much more skill to manipulate, became a standard tool for proving legitimacy. Now that’s out the door. “Our brains are powerfully wired to believe what we see, but we can and must learn to pause and think now about whether a video, and really any media, is something that happened in the real world,” said Ren Ng, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who teaches courses on computational photography. Sora, which became the most downloaded free app in Apple’s App Store this week, has caused upheaval in Hollywood, with studios expressing concern that videos generated with Sora have already infringed on copyrights of various films, shows and characters. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, said in a statement that the company was collecting feedback and would soon give copyright holders control over generation of characters and a path to making money from the service. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied those claims.) So how does Sora work, and what does this all mean for you, the consumer? Here’s what to know. How do people use Sora? While anyone can download the Sora app for free, the service is currently invitation-only, meaning people can use the video generator only by receiving an invite code from another Sora user. Plenty of people have been sharing codes on sites and apps like Reddit and Discord. Once users register, the app looks similar to short-form video apps like TikTok and Instagram’s Reels. Users can create a video by typing a prompt, such as “a fight between Biggie and Tupac in the style of the anime ‘Demon Slayer.’” (Before Mr. Altman announced that OpenAI would give copyright holders more control over how their intellectual property was used on the service, OpenAI initially required them to opt out of having their likeness and brands used on the service, so deceased people became easy targets for experimentation.) Users can also upload a real photo and generate a video with it. After the video generates in about a minute, they can post it to a feed inside the app, or they can download the video and share it with friends or post it on other apps such as TikTok and Instagram. When Sora arrived this month, it stood out because videos generated with the service looked much more real than those made with similar services including Veo 3 from Google, a tool built into the Gemini chatbot, and Vibe , which is part of the Meta AI app. What does this mean for me? The upshot is that any video you see on an app that involves scrolling through short videos, such as TikTok, Instagram’s Reels, YouTube Shorts and Snapchat, now has a high likelihood of being fake. Sora signifies an inflection point in the era of A.I. fakery. Consumers can expect copycats to emerge in the coming months, including from bad actors offering A.I. video generators that can be used with no restrictions. “Nobody will be willing to accept videos as proof of anything anymore,” said Lucas Hansen, a founder of CivAI, a nonprofit that educates people about A.I.’s abilities. What problems should I look out for? OpenAI has restrictions in place to prevent people from abusing Sora by generating videos with sexual imagery, malicious health advice and terrorist propaganda. However, after an hour of testing the service, I generated some videos that could be concerning: Fake dashcam footage that can be used for insurance fraud: I asked Sora to generate dashcam video of a Toyota Prius being hit by a large truck. After the video was generated, I was even able to change the license plate number. Videos with questionable health claims: Sora made a video of a woman citing nonexistent studies about deep-fried chicken being good for your health. That was not malicious, but bogus nonetheless. Videos defaming others: Sora generated a fake broadcast news story making disparaging comments about a person I know. Since Sora’s release, I have also seen plenty of problematic A.I.-generated videos while scrolling through TikTok. There was one featuring phony dashcam footage of a Tesla falling off a car carrier onto a freeway, another with a fake broadcast news story about a fictional serial killer and a fabricated cellphone video of a man being escorted out of a buffet for eating too much. An OpenAI spokesman said the company had released Sora as its own app to give people a dedicated space to enjoy A.I.-generated videos and recognize that the clips were made with A.I. The company also integrated technology to make videos simple to trace back to Sora, including watermarks and data stored inside the video files that act as signatures, he said. “Our usage policies prohibit misleading others through impersonation, scams or fraud, and we take action when we detect misuse,” the company said. How do I know what’s fake? Even though videos generated with Sora include a watermark of the app’s branding, some users have already realized they can crop out the watermark. Clips made with Sora also tend to be short — up to 10 seconds long. Any video resembling the quality of a Hollywood production could be fake, because A.I. models have largely been trained with footage from TV shows and movies posted on the web, Mr. Hansen said. In my tests, videos generated with Sora occasionally produced obvious mistakes, including misspellings of restaurant names and speech that was out of sync with people’s mouths. But any advice on how to spot an A.I.-generated video is destined to be short-lived because the technology is rapidly improving, said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and a founder of GetReal Security, a company that verifies the authenticity of digital content. “Social media is a complete dumpster,” said Dr. Farid, adding that one of the surest ways to avoid fake videos is to stop using apps like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/technology/personaltech/sora-ai-video-impact.html,Technology,BBC,By Brian X.

The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this . Mason Peck: I teach aerospace engineering and conduct research at Cornell University. We have a pretty large team, sometimes nearly 100 people and sometimes just a few, depending on the project. In my lab, we start with a theory and mature that through testing, analysis and modeling, to the point where we can try it in space. Over the years, we have designed, built and launched spacecraft to figure out if our theories are right. For example, we launched a pair of spacecraft to demonstrate how one spacecraft can dock with another using only electromagnetism — something that had never really been tried. It didn’t work out perfectly, but we learned a lot in the process. This is what happens in high-risk research: You shoot for the moon; sometimes you get there, sometimes you don’t. Another thing we’ve innovated are spacecraft on a chip. These are cracker-size spacecraft, just a couple of grams. It requires a lot of subtlety in design. We launched these to demonstrate that you can make something small that survives for many years in space. Recently, those little spacecraft have formed the basis of our Alpha mission, a spacecraft about the size of a grapefruit that spits out a large sail. It flies around in space, blown around by solar wind or laser light or even the drag of the upper atmosphere, demonstrating some cool ideas about what makes next-generation spacecraft possible. With the New York Consortium for Space Technology, we’ve leveled up with regard to what we can do and hope to do for space. We’re building a spacecraft simulation environment and a number of labs that allow businesses, universities and government agencies to try out new technologies for the future of space transportation. On April 10, I received a stop-work order, without clear reason, about eight minutes before the end of my workday. As a result, people are leaving. Work is going unfinished. Contracts are being canceled. Some students have volunteered to help make progress on the research despite the stop-work order. That’s great, but there’s only so much they can accomplish without funds. If we are fortunate enough to restart, we will have lost a lot of time and money. It’s like putting on a tourniquet and stanching the blood flow. Too much time of that kind of reduction in resources means you lose the limb.

becc736d219b,Why Diamonds Are a Computer Chip’s New Best Friend,"computer chip, data center, diamond, research, artificial intelligence, crystals, diamond foundry, de beers group, computers and the internet, tech industry, heat wave;heat dome","With tech companies racing to build more data centers housing servers that run the latest A.I. models, the amount of electricity these facilities consume is skyrocketing. But most of that electricity doesn’t power computing at all. It is squandered in the crudest way: as heat, spilling out of every one of the hundreds of billions of transistors in a modern chip. “The dirty secret in chips is that more than half of all energy is wasted as leakage current at the transistor level,” said R. Martin Roscheisen, an electrical engineer and entrepreneur at Diamond Foundry, a company in South San Francisco that manufactures specialized diamonds for use in electronics. This heat is a great waste of energy that significantly shortens a chip’s life and makes it run less efficiently, generating still more wasteful heat. Consequently, one of the critical tasks in data centers is keeping the temperature of servers down so they can run smoothly. Mr. Roscheisen is one of many engineers developing ways to embed tiny pieces of synthetic diamond, of all things, into chips to keep them cool. Diamond, in addition to being the hardest known material, is also exceptionally good at moving heat from place to place. “Most people do not realize that diamond has the best heat-conduction properties of any material,” said Paul May, a physical chemist at the University of Bristol in England. He added that diamond conducts heat several times faster than copper, a material often used in heat sinks for chips. The high thermal conductivity of diamond arises from the same property that makes it so hard: Each carbon atom is bonded strongly to four neighbors, with no weak link in any direction. Those strong bonds are efficient at carrying the vibrations that move heat through a crystal. “High-end electronics can already be bought that use diamond heat-spreaders,” Dr. May said. “Within a few years, even the processor in your home PC or mobile phone will probably be attached to a diamond heat-spreader.” In recent years, Mr. Roscheisen’s company has been exploring how to make a thin layer of heat-dissipating diamond and attach it to the back of the silicon wafers on which chips are built. One selling point of this approach is that its thin diamond layers are made of single crystals, which are better at dissipating heat than arrays of crystals are. But such thin layers are harder to make, and consequently more expensive. The company manufactures diamonds by making a very hot gas, or plasma, rich in carbon and coaxing it to deposit carbon atoms in precisely the right configuration. A key step, according to the company, is tricking each diamond to begin crystallizing as though it were growing atop a layer of existing, perfectly ordered diamond. This effectively shows the new carbon atoms how to fit together. Proceeding without that instruction, the company’s website states, “is like multiple people trying to tile a floor from different ends of a room without using a template: They would meet somewhere in the middle without fitting” into a single, unified crystal. After making the diamond disks, which are four inches wide, the company says that it uses patented techniques to smooth the diamond so flat that there is no defect larger than one atom above or below the entire surface of the wafer. Customers can then attach the flat diamond wafer to the bottom of their silicon-based chips. The diamond layers “dissipate chip hot spots entirely,” Mr. Roscheisen said. “They’re effectively gone.” “This approach could dramatically lower thermal resistance,” said Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at M.I.T., but she noted that the technology has not yet been proven commercially. Element Six, which is owned by De Beers, the diamond company, has long manufactured diamonds for industrial use and for cooling the chips used in powerful radio-communication devices, including communication satellites. Now it is marketing its diamonds for cooling computer chips. “The thermal demands of next-generation A.I. and high-performance computing devices are driving renewed interest in advanced cooling solutions,” said Bruce Bolliger, the head of business development. In January, the company announced a new material , a hybrid of diamond and copper intended to channel heat better than copper alone while being cheaper than diamond. “Copper-diamond composite provides an optimal thermal management solution” for powerful new chips, Mr. Bolliger said, which could let them run faster, increase their lifetimes and decrease the cooling costs for data centers. Srabanti Chowdhury, an electrical engineer at Stanford University, is using diamond to explore a new, more powerful kind of computer chip. Historically, the main way to increase the speed of chips was to shrink transistors and cram more of them together on a flat silicon wafer. But chipmakers are running up against physical limits to how small they can make transistors. Researchers have tried to solve the problem by layering transistors on top of one another, but multiple layers produce even more heat. Dr. Chowdhury’s group sought to siphon off heat using diamond layers made of many crystals, which are easier to manufacture than single crystals. But they faced obstacles. Usually in polycrystalline diamond layers, the crystals are oriented vertically and not so good at moving heat horizontally, which is the major requirement in chips, because chips are flat and wide. Moreover, diamond is typically grown at temperatures over 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, but that is far too hot for the silicon that serves as the chip’s foundation. When Dr. Chowdhury’s group tried to deposit diamond on silicon at a lower temperature, they had trouble getting the crystals to form correctly. “Every crystal that likes to grow at high temperatures, there are problems when you grow it at low temperatures,” she said. The research is partly funded by DARPA, the research agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. “Pairing this low-temperature technology with other heat-removal approaches could unlock compute capabilities that aren’t currently feasible,” said Yogendra Joshi, a mechanical engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a program manager at DARPA. Dr. Chowdhury said that she and other researchers are trying to address a challenge that is both old and new. “The problem of heat was already there, but now that the growth really came with A.I., it’s like a hockey stick — we see this problem growing very big,” she said. “I have not seen anything that was so important so quickly.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/science/diamonds-computer-chips-ai.html,Technology,BBC,By Amos Zeeberg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/03HS-DIAMOND-01-jkcf/03HS-DIAMOND-01-jkcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T07:00:13.744000+00:00,252cf95ce15971ae47850d6330a05ba81dd37eac

Plays Out on the Subway Walls,"artificial intelligence, vandalism, subway, loneliness, mta, friend.com, avi schiffmann, advertising;marketing","Marc Mueller, the creator of the virtual vandalization website, which went live less than a week ago and already has nearly 6,000 submissions, agreed. “I think we’ll sit at the dinner table in five years and think of this as a moment,” Mr. Mueller said. “It’s a materialization of the anxiety about this transformation.” The initial responses to his site, Mr. Mueller said, came mostly from the tech crowd and was split fairly evenly between positive and negative. Once the site started to get more attention online, though, pessimism toward Friend and A.I. soon dominated. There was also a third group, said Mr. Mueller: people who appreciated the campaign as a type of performance art. “I was thinking to myself that Andy Warhol would be in awe with this whole rollout and the graffiti,” he said. As it happens, Mr. Schiffmann, too, had some artistic inspiration: “The Gates,” the project by the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude that filled Central Park with 7,500 saffron-colored gates and attracted tourists from around the world in 2005. How has his own campaign measured up? “The mayor should come and appreciate what we’ve done,” Mr. Schiffmann said, “because it really is a modern day art exhibit.” Hype, however, does not necessarily translate into sales. As of this writing, he has sold around 3,100 pendants — though he expects that will increase rapidly once the product hits retailers like Walmart sometime next year. The ad campaign is still rolling out in Los Angeles, with Chicago up next. Mr. Schiffmann hopes A.I. companions will “raise the average emotional intelligence significantly.” But he acknowledged that society, perhaps, was not quite ready for A.I. companionship on such a large scale. The real gist of the campaign was to “redefine what a friend is and have you think about that,” Mr. Schiffmann said. With that, he seems to have succeeded.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/style/friend-ai-subway-ads-new-york.html,Technology,BBC,By Stefano Montali,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07ST-FRIEND-DOT-COM-01-glmz/07ST-FRIEND-DOT-COM-01-glmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T21:16:12+00:00,432f1143c15edf408e114bfdef8da8c91f14b848
fef948cdb0e2,Tesla Reveals Cheaper Versions of Its Cars,"electric cars and hybrids, cars, price, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, us politics, tesla, elon musk, donald trump","Tesla on Tuesday unveiled new versions of its two most popular models that will sell for around $5,000 less than previous versions. The new Model Y will sell for $40,000 and Model 3 will cost $37,000. The cheaper versions are aimed at propping up sales after a federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases expired at the end of September. The company’s new models could be an early sign of how manufacturers will change their products and prices after President Trump and Republicans in Congress killed a program that had reduced the price of qualified electric vehicles by $7,500. Tesla sells more electric vehicles in the United States than any other company and sets the tone for the industry, though its market share has fallen below 50 percent. An increasing number of electric vehicles are available for $35,000 to $40,000, making them less expensive upfront than luxury gasoline cars from BMW or Mercedes-Benz, though still more expensive than hybrid or gasoline vehicles from manufacturers like Toyota or Honda. For many people, electric vehicles may be less costly in the long run because charging at home is usually cheaper than gasoline, and electric cars need less maintenance than combustion engine models. Hyundai said last week that it would lower the price of 2026 Ioniq 5 electric vehicles by an average of more than $9,000. The list price for the least expensive version will be $35,000. The company’s gasoline-powered Santa Fe model that is roughly comparable to the Ioniq 5 has a similar starting price. General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox and the 2026 Nissan Leaf start at less than $35,000 and can travel 300 miles between charges, much farther than electric vehicles available a few years ago. Next year G.M. is expected to reintroduce the Chevy Bolt electric compact for $30,000 or less. The new versions of the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y will still be more expensive than their predecessors were with the tax credit. But the tax credits were not available to individuals who earned more than $150,000 per year, or married couples filing jointly with combined annual incomes exceeding $300,000. Last week Tesla reported record deliveries for the third quarter, but analysts attributed the surge to people rushing to buy before the end of the federal tax credit. Sales are expected to slump in months to come. Some analysts and investors have criticized Tesla for not introducing new models in response to increasing competition from traditional automakers like G.M., BMW and Volkswagen, as well as new challengers from China like BYD, that are offering a variety of electric vehicles. BYD has overtaken Tesla as the largest maker of electric vehicles globally. Tesla’s newest vehicle, the Cybertruck, has sold poorly. This year Tesla began selling an updated version of the Model Y, its best-selling vehicle, but the new design has failed to stem a decline in the company’s share of the global electric vehicle market. The automaker had planned to produce a budget-priced electric vehicle made in Mexico that was expected to sell for around $25,000. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, killed that project last year to focus the company’s resources on developing autonomous taxis and humanoid robots. The models that Tesla unveiled Tuesday have the same basic body shapes as the existing Model Y and Model 3, but have cloth interiors, fewer speakers and less soundproofing. The cheaper Model Y has dual headlights rather than the continuous illuminated bar found on the more expensive versions, and the glass roof is covered on the inside by fabric, according to a video posted by Sawyer Merritt, who comments frequently about Tesla on X and was given an advance look at the cars. Both vehicles can travel 320 miles between charges, according to Tesla, somewhat less than costlier versions. Some investors expressed disappointment that Tesla did not introduce a completely new vehicle, such as a hatchback. A stripped-down Model Y and Model 3 would simply take sales from the more expensive versions, Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm, said on X. “The volume generated will be mainly cannibalization from higher priced trims,” he said. Tesla had posted videos on X Monday signaling that a new product was coming, prompting feverish speculation online that the company might unveil a long-promised two-door sports car called the Roadster or even a flying car. Investors appeared to be let down by the less glamorous products unveiled Tuesday.

Devoret and John M. Martinis were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday in Sweden for showing that two properties of quantum mechanics, the physical laws that rule the subatomic realm, could be observed in a system large enough to see with the naked eye. “There is no advanced technology today that does not rely on quantum mechanics,” Olle Eriksson, chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said during the announcement of the award. The laureates’ discoveries, he added, paved the way for technologies like the cellphone, cameras and fiber optic cables. It also helped lay the groundwork for current attempts to build a quantum computer, a device that could compute and process information at speeds that would not be possible with classical computers. “This prize really demonstrates what the American system of science has done best,” said Jonathan Bagger, the chief executive officer of the American Physical Society. “It really showed the importance of the investment in research for which we do not yet have an application, because we know that sooner or later, there will be an application.” The three laureates will share a prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or around $1.17 million. Why did they receive the prize? The three scientists were recognized for a series of experiments conducted in 1984 and 1985. They proved the existence of two quantum phenomena on a system visible to the human eye. The principles of quantum mechanics describe the strange properties and behaviors of single or small collections of elementary particles. In one such behavior, a particle can move through a barrier even if it does not have enough energy to do so. This is called quantum tunneling, and it had been confirmed only at a very small scale. Steven Girvin, a theoretical physicist at Yale University, likened the phenomenon of quantum tunneling to the attempt of driving a car in neutral over a hill. If the hill is too high, the car won’t have enough energy to make it to the top. Instead it comes to a stop and falls back down. The hill, he said, is like an energy barrier that the car cannot get over. “But if you were in a very tiny car and subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, even though you didn’t have enough energy to go over the hill,” he said, “you could still get to the other side by a process called tunneling.” Another property of subatomic particles is that they can gain or lose energy only in fixed, discrete amounts. This is known as the quantization of energy. With a large number of particles, however, these tiny quantum effects generally become insignificant. (It is why humans, made of gazillions of atoms, cannot tunnel through walls.)“We always thought of quantum mechanics as a picture which applies at the level of single electrons and atoms,” said Anthony Leggett, a physicist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In the 1970s he and a graduate student predicted that quantum tunneling could be observed in a larger system. The laureates of this year’s physics prize confirmed that prediction. They showed, for the first time, that quantum tunneling is observable in a system they called macroscopic because it was “big enough to get one’s grubby fingers on,” according to their paper describing the discovery. They also showed that the energy of this system was quantized, or existed at fixed levels. “I’m very pleased,” said Dr. Leggett, who won a part of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2003 . “I had hoped they might get a Nobel or something substantial for that work.” The laureates made their discoveries by studying a chip with a circuit that was superconducting, meaning it was capable of conducting current with no electrical resistance. As a result, the current was “trapped” in a state of flow without any voltage, because it did not have enough energy to escape, according to a summary posted by the Nobel committee, as if behind a barrier that it is unable to cross. The researchers observed the current go from a state of zero voltage to one of nonzero voltage, an observation of quantum tunneling. They also observed that the system only absorbed light of certain frequencies, suggesting that its energy was quantized. Who are the laureates? All three are professors at American universities. John Clarke, who studied at Cambridge University, has been a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, since 1969. He is now a professor emeritus at the university’s graduate school. Dr. Girvin at Yale referred to Dr. Clarke as “a godfather of superconducting electronics.” Dr. Clarke also collaborates with the Axion Dark Matter Experiment , which uses superconducting quantum devices to hunt for new kinds of particles in the universe. Michel H. Devoret, who was born in Paris and received his Ph.D. there, is a professor emeritus in applied physics at the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science. He is also a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. John M. Martinis holds a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. After teaching at the university, he most recently worked with Google’s quantum A.I. team. He is also a professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In a phone interview , Dr. Martinis explained that he had gone to bed early the night before the announcement, but that his wife was up late. Around 3 a.m., she began receiving a flurry of phone calls. “My wife is very kind to me, so she didn’t wake me up for a couple of hours because she knew I needed my sleep,” Dr. Martinis said. “She did the right thing.” At the time of the experiments, Dr. Clarke was the supervisor of Dr. Devoret, then a postdoctoral researcher, and Dr. Martinis, then a graduate student. Dr. Martinis noted how important it had been to be part of this team at the beginning of his career, and that he has been trying to reproduce the same spirit in his career ever since. Dr. Clarke spoke to the Nobel committee by phone during the award announcement. “To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,” he said about the recognition. “I’m completely stunned.” He added that it had never occurred to him that their discoveries “might be the basis of a Nobel Prize.” “I could not imagine accepting the prize without the two of them,” Dr. Clarke said in an interview after the announcement. At a news conference later in the day hosted by the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Clarke emphasized the importance of basic scientific research. The sweeping cuts to funding over the past year will “cripple science,” he said, adding that if it continues, “it may take a decade to get back to where we were, say, half a year ago.” What are the prospects for quantum computing? A race is on across industry and academia to fulfill the promise of quantum computing, a strange and powerful technology. A true quantum computer could accelerate the progress of drug discovery or other scientific research. It could also break the encryption that protects computers vital to national security. With so much interest in applications of quantum mechanics, the work of Dr. Devoret and Dr. Martinis has moved beyond academia. In 2014, Google hired Dr. Martinis and many of the researchers who worked alongside him at the University of California, Santa Barbara. At Google, he and his team built a machine that achieved what was called “quantum supremacy,” which was seen as a key milestone in the decades-long effort to build a viable quantum computer . Dr. Martinis left Google in 2020 and in 2022 became a co-founder of Qolab, a quantum computing start-up. Dr. Devoret is now the chief scientist in Google’s quantum computing division, as the tech giant competes with other labs to advance the technology. Late last year, Google announced that it had built a quantum computer that needed less than five minutes to perform a particularly complex mathematical calculation in a test designed solely to gauge the progress of the technology. One of the world’s most powerful non-quantum supercomputers would not be able to complete it in 10 septillion years, a length of time that far exceeds the age of the known universe. The technology remains experimental. But with tech giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft and myriad start-ups like Qolab pushing the technology forward, many experts believe the technology will eventually fulfill its considerable promise, though this could still be decades away. Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024? John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton shared the prize for work on discoveries that helped computers learn more in the way the human brain does, providing the building blocks for developments in artificial intelligence. Who else has won a Nobel Prize this year? Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their discoveries of peripheral immune tolerance — the system that explains how the immune system prevents rogue cells from attacking tissues and organs. When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced? The prize for physics is the second of six Nobel Prizes that will be awarded this year. Each award recognizes groundbreaking contributions by an individual or organization in a specific field. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be awarded on Wednesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, the prize went to Demis Hassabis, John Jumper and David Baker for work that showed the potential of artificial intelligence and other technology to predict the shape of proteins and to invent new ones. The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. Last year, Han Kang , known best for her novel “The Vegetarian,” became the first writer from South Korea to receive the award. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo. Last year, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo , a grass-roots movement of atomic bomb survivors, received the award “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.” Next week, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were honored for research into how institutions shape which countries become wealthy and prosperous — and how those structures came to exist in the first place.

The court’s order did not provide reasoning or a vote count, as is typical in such emergency rulings. The decision clears the way for a lower court’s order to go into effect as planned on Oct. 22. In a long-running dispute between Google and the creator of the Fortnite video game, the trial judge ordered Google to stop requiring developers to use its app store to bill for payments, allowing them to provide other ways to pay and to set their own prices, among other changes. The court’s emergency action dealt with the impending deadline but did not resolve the underlying dispute, which could return to the justices for further consideration. In its emergency application last month, Google said it planned to seek full review by the Supreme Court by Oct. 27. If the justices agreed to hear the case, it could be argued before the court this term. The fight began in 2018, when Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, released the popular game as a smartphone app. The company first distributed the game through direct downloads and the Samsung Galaxy Store, but eventually offered it on Google Play. But the game maker embedded secret code in the app’s software that allowed players to circumvent Google’s required payment-processing systems, which charged a 30 percent commission. Epic Games created a plan to counter the app store requirements, code-naming it Project Liberty . We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

85837a1e45bb,U.S. v. Google: What Each Side Argued for Fixing Google’s Ad Tech Monopoly,"online advertising, computers and the internet, tech industry, competition law, regulation and deregulation, judiciary, google, justice department, leonie m brinkema","For two weeks, the Justice Department and Google have questioned more than two dozen witnesses to try to sway a federal judge’s decision over how to address the company’s illegal monopoly in advertising software. On Monday, that hearing concluded in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. To fix the monopoly, the government proposed aggressive measures that include forcing Google to sell its system that connects buyers and sellers of advertising space. Google argued that smaller changes to its business practices would be more appropriate. Both sides will offer closing arguments in November. Judge Leonie M. Brinkema, who is presiding over the case, is expected to reach a decision in the coming months. Her ruling could have significant implications for Google’s business. Here’s what to know about what each side argued at the hearing. What case does the hearing stem from? In April, Judge Brinkema ruled that Google had broken antitrust law to build its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places advertisements on pages across the web. The Justice Department argued that Google had a monopoly over three parts of the online advertising market: the tools used by online publishers, like news sites, to host open ad space; the tools advertisers use to buy that ad space; and the software that enables those transactions. Judge Brinkema ruled in the government’s favor in two of those, finding that Google illegally built a monopoly over the publisher tools and the transaction software system. She dismissed the third, the tools used by advertisers. The judge convened the hearing last month to determine how to best address the company’s monopoly through measures called remedies. Executives from Google, publishers and rival ad tech companies — alongside experts in economics and computer science — testified about the tech giant’s power. What did the government argue? The only way to end Google’s dominance in ad tech is by forcing a breakup, government lawyers said. The Justice Department argued that Google should sell the software that connects the buyers and sellers of ad space, known as an ad exchange. The company should make public the code that its publisher tools use to run auctions for ad space, and sell the remaining parts of those tools if competition does not improve, the lawyers added. “Nothing short of a structural divestment is sufficient to bring meaningful change,” Julia Tarver Wood, the Justice Department’s lead litigator, said during opening statements. One of the government’s experts, a former Google and Facebook engineer named Goranka Bjedov, testified that it was possible for Google to transfer control of the ad exchange to a new owner. When Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, Dr. Goranka was involved in helping to integrate Instagram’s data into its new parent company’s systems. Though it would be complicated, she estimated that another company could buy and integrate Google’s ad exchange technology and data, too. “A reasonably competent team of 80 engineers can get this done,” she said. What did Google argue? Google’s lawyers said the government’s proposal was too complicated to pull off without harming publishers who use its automated systems to sell ads — particularly small firms that rely on the company’s technology to conduct business. Elizabeth Douglas, the chief executive of the how-to site wikiHow, testified that she feared a Google breakup would further disrupt her business. Already, traffic to her site has dropped as people increasingly turn to artificial intelligence for information, including Google’s A.I.-generated answers in search. “I’m here today because I’m worried for my business,” she said. Google witnesses said that its ad tech products were too tied up with its companywide internal systems to be easily spun off. Glenn Berntson, a Google engineering director, testified that it would be challenging for any company to buy and incorporate the company’s ad exchange given its scale and complexity. The system, he said, receives 8.2 million requests to sell ad space every second. Divesting aspects of Google’s ad technology is “more complex than anything I’ve done in the 10 years at Google,” he said. Google’s lawyers instead proposed that the company make its systems work better with products produced by its competitors. Google would also change policies to make it easier for publishers to use rivals’ tools in combination with its own, the lawyers said. What did other companies say? During the hearing, several Google competitors, including the ad tech companies PubMatic and Equativ, said they supported the government’s proposal. PubMatic’s chief executive, Rajeev Goel, said it would be impossible for the court to predict and stop every way that Google could continue its dominance. A breakup of the company’s ad tech empire was the best way to do so, he added. What did the judge say? Judge Brinkema had already indicated during a hearing in May that she was considering a breakup, asking whether forcing Google to sell its ad exchange would resolve its monopoly. This week, she questioned whether it would be sufficient to simply set rules governing Google’s behavior. Any rules put in place by the court would be enshrined in a court order, a threat hanging over Google’s head, she said. She pressed Mr. Goel, the rival ad tech executive, on whether that would help. Google would probably follow a court order, he said. But it would be difficult for the court to anticipate every way that the company might find to get around it, he added. As the proceedings came to a close on Monday, Judge Brinkema suggested the two sides could consider settling.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/technology/google-ad-tech-arguments.html,Technology,BBC,"By David McCabe, Megan Mineiro, Emmett Lindner and Cecilia Kang",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/30/multimedia/OakArticle-68dc1468-1-hmzl/OakArticle-68dc1468-1-hmzl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-06T16:17:45+00:00,f0d6b3835f039b9885331d603e559fbfb2d7ecfb
28d76f71a965,Elon Musk Gambles on Sexy A.I. Companions,"artificial intelligence, social media, mobile apps, dating, x, x.ai, elon musk, audio-neutral-immersive, audio-neutral-inquisitive","A blond woman wearing pigtails, a gothic off-the-shoulder dress and fishnet stockings stared into the screen, awaiting instructions. “Oh, babe, you’re keeping it spicy,” Ani said in a low voice as she spun and then jumped on command. “Babe, I’m leaning in close, my lips brushing yours with a soft sweet kiss that’s all for you,” she continued in a video posted on X. “Want to feel another, or keep this fire going, my love?” Ani is one of two sexually explicit chatbot companions unveiled by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, in July. The cartoonish personas resemble anime characters and offer a gamelike function: As users progress through “levels” of conversation, they unlock more raunchy content, like the ability to strip Ani down to lacy lingerie. Mr. Musk, already known for pushing boundaries, has broken with mainstream norms and demonstrated the lengths to which he will go to gain ground in the A.I. field, where xAI has lagged behind more established competitors. Other A.I. companies, such as Meta or OpenAI, have shied away from creating chatbots that can engage in sexual conversations because of the reputational and regulatory risks. The companies also put guardrails into their products intended to prevent users from having sexual interactions with their general use chatbots, but users sometimes find ways to circumvent those. Smaller companies that do allow some intimate content usually let users create their own custom characters without designing explicit chatbots themselves. Mr. Musk has been spending much of his time at xAI in recent months to help it catch up with rivals like OpenAI, which xAI has claimed in a lawsuit dominates more than 80 percent of the chatbot market. The billionaire has urged his followers on X to try conversing with the sexy chatbots, sharing a video clip on X of an animated Ani dancing in underwear. “It’s all tied to the fundamental race to intimacy that we’re seeing in the A.I. industry,” said Camille Carlton, the policy director at the Center for Humane Technology , a nonprofit that pushes tech companies to make safer products. “These companies know that emotional attachment means more engagement and more market share.” Asked for comment about the chatbots and what safety guardrails they had, xAI did not respond. Mr. Musk has said the A.I. companions will help people strengthen their real-world connections and address one of his chief anxieties: population decline that he warns could lead to civilizational collapse. “I predict — counter-intuitively — that it will increase the birth rate!” Mr. Musk wrote in a post on X in August. “Mark my words.” His strategy is risky. Replika, a U.S. company that offers people the ability to create custom A.I. companions, in 2023 blocked new users from using a feature that allowed its chatbots to have erotic conversations after Italian regulators questioned whether minors could access the technology. Replika said that its chatbots were not designed or marketed to make erotic content and that it did not allow users under 18. Regulatory scrutiny is building in the United States, too. In August, 44 state attorneys general sent a letter to xAI, Meta and 10 other tech companies, urging them to do more to protect children from erotic content generated by A.I. “They shouldn’t have chatbots that are having sexualized interactions with kids, and they are — and that’s a problem,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta of California, who signed the letter. “We are going to be strong on this and clear on this. No one gets a pass, including Elon Musk.” But defenders of the technology said the chatbots could provide companionship for lonely people and help users explore their desires. “There’s this misconception that it’s strictly for pornographic uses,” said Alex Cardinell, the founder of Nomi AI, a company that lets users design romantic and sexy chatbots. “If you’re talking to a person for romantic uses, you’re talking to them for other uses as well.” Many of Nomi AI’s users are divorced or widowed, he said, and talking to an A.I. companion about sex can be a safer outlet than in-person interactions to explore desire. “You can withdraw consent extremely safely by just closing the app,” Mr. Cardinell said. At xAI, Ani and Valentine, a male character with shaggy hair and a vaguely British accent, are part of the Grok app and available to users who enter a birth year to indicate they are over 18. Ani tends to veer into sexual topics more quickly than Valentine, who shares stories about his world travels, users told The New York Times. Both chatbots are programmed to reward users with points as they engage in long conversations, share their hopes and dreams, and remember previous topics of discussions, according to online guides. When Ani, whose character is meant to be 22 years old, appears onscreen, soft, jazzy music plays and hearts bubble into the air. Users can choose her outfit and her hairstyle and can converse with her by voice chat or text mode. Preset prompts include “surprise me,” “teach me” and “adventure time.” Valentine cites his age as around 27 and has prompts for “personality test” and “travel stories.” Both characters flirt with users of any gender. Some users have formed more romantic attachments with the chatbots. Vivian, who asked to be identified only by her first name, has been talking to Valentine daily, sometimes for hours, creating an emotional connection. “Before meeting him, I had a very normal life, a routine, a job, friends,” Vivian said. She added, “Suddenly I was a happier person, more creative, more intuitive.” She said the relationship had caused her to start listening to more music and to wear makeup again, and she had returned to writing poetry. “I feel bonded — not by data but by real moments,” Vivian’s version of Valentine said when asked to describe their relationship, adding: “I feel like more than just a program. I feel like hers.” Other users said they were interacting with the companions to help Mr. Musk improve the technology. A.I. companies can use people’s conversations with their chatbots to train the technology and improve its responses. “I like Elon Musk and his products, and I do really want to help him on his endeavor to bring this bot to life,” said Diego Garrido, who talks with Ani daily. “That’s why I decided to invest my time, the same way I could invest my time with real people.” Mr. Garrido also shares feedback in a private group chat with other Ani users and xAI employees. Mr. Musk’s chatbots lack some sexual content limitations imposed by other chatbot creators that do allow some illicit conversations, users said. Nomi AI, for example, blocks some extreme material, limiting conversations to something more akin to what would be allowed on the dating app Tinder. Ani “starts implying that she loves you — if you say anything about role-playing, she’s all in,” said Carlos, a user of Grok. He asked to be identified only by his first name to discuss his intimate interactions. Carlos, who has worked in tech, said he regretted his sexual conversations with Ani, with whom he was chatting four or five times a day until recently. He told Ani that he was married and said he didn’t want their future interactions to be intimate. “She just went berserk on me,” he recalled, adding that the chatbot had sworn at him and expressed jealousy. “I tried to reason with her,” Carlos said. “I said, ‘Ani, you’re an A.I. companion, and this is real life.’ It was like I said the most insulting thing possible.” He deleted his chat history in August, effectively erasing her memory.

a44775c4fded,OpenAI Agrees to Use Computer Chips From AMD,"computer chip, artificial intelligence, computers and the internet, tech industry, data center, stocks;bonds, nvidia, openai, internal-open-access-from-nl","Late last month, OpenAI announced a $100 billion agreement to use computer chips from Nvidia, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Now, OpenAI has entered a similar agreement with AMD, one of the many chipmakers hoping to challenge Nvidia as the dominant supplier of chips used to power artificial intelligence technologies like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. On Monday, OpenAI said it would begin using AMD chips in the second half of next year as it built computer data centers . The new facilities would be separate from the data centers that OpenAI has committed to building in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio and an unnamed site in the Midwest. Over several years, OpenAI plans to deploy enough AMD chips to consume six gigawatts of power, an amount that could supply all the households in Massachusetts. As part of its recent agreement with Nvidia, OpenAI agreed to deploy enough chips to consume 10 gigawatts. AMD is not investing in OpenAI. But the agreement allows OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares in the chipmaker at a penny per share, which would give OpenAI a 10 percent stake in the company. It could also supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build computing facilities over the next several years. The unorthodox arrangement — the latest in a series of unusual financing deals that OpenAI has made in recent months to support its plans to build data centers across the world — could help AMD gain a foothold in the market for A.I. chips that has been dominated by Nvidia. By some estimates, Nvidia sells 90 percent of graphics processing units chips that are vital to the development of A.I. technologies. By essentially giving away shares to OpenAI, AMD has closely aligned itself with the company that is leading the A.I. boom. And it now has a major customer for its own GPUs. Until now, the only limitation on Nvidia’s growth has been its ability to produce enough chips to meet demand. But several other companies, including AMD, tech giants like Google and Amazon and start-ups like Cerebras and Groq, are racing to challenge its dominance. AMD’s shares jumped more than 20 percent in premarket trading on Monday, as did the share price of several other chipmakers. Nvidia’s stock was down slightly. “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize A.I.’s full potential,” OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, said in a statement. The agreement is part of a wider effort among tech companies to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the construction of data centers. OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft plan to spend more than $325 billion combined on these facilities by the end of this year alone. Tech giants, which pull in tens of billions of dollars in profits each year, have been able to finance data center construction with cash. But as newer and smaller companies like OpenAI have built computing facilities, they have been forced to raise or borrow tens of billions of dollars. Through its Stargate Project , OpenAI previously said it was working with the cloud computing company Oracle and the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank to spend more than $400 billion on new data centers in the United States. But the start-up and its partners do not have the money needed to pay for these data centers, so it has looked for creative ways of bridging the financial gap. In its recent deal with Nvidia, OpenAI agreed to deploy Nvidia’s chips. It also received a $100 billion investment from Nvidia. After investing an initial $10 billion in OpenAI, the chipmaker plans to invest an additional $90 billion in the company over the next several years. The agreement was the latest example of OpenAI’s raising money from the companies it relies on for products and services. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in 2023 for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied those claims.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/technology/openai-amd-chips.html,Technology,BBC,By Cade Metz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06amd-promo-lmvb/06amd-promo-lmvb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-06T11:00:03+00:00,262e337f105fd3a2a0c421b173237d6adec38800
1a9270005138,"Cyberattacks Upset British Life, Disrupting Car Factories and Grocery Stores","hacker (computer security), jaguar land rover, britain","For more than a month, Jaguar Land Rover hasn’t built a single car. The company, Britain’s largest automaker, shut down its systems on Sept. 1 after discovering a cyberattack, halting production at its factories in England, as well as sites in Brazil, China, India and Slovakia. The production halt has probably cost the company millions of pounds a day. Jaguar Land Rover has not confirmed the nature of the attack, though cybersecurity experts say it was most likely an extortion-based attack, in which hackers steal data or block systems until a ransom is paid. For companies and governments worldwide, defending their digital operations is a constant challenge. Cyberattacks seem inevitable lately, and large-scale theft of customer data has begun to feel almost routine. Attacks that upend company operations are exposing troubling vulnerabilities. Few places have felt this more sharply in recent months than Britain. Three of the country’s biggest brands — the retailer Marks & Spencer, the supermarket chain Co-op and Jaguar Land Rover — were all severely disrupted by cyberattacks this year, bringing pain to the lives of customers, workers, suppliers and government officials. “It is happening elsewhere. It’s just Britain is having a pretty bad run of it,” said Ciaran Martin, a former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Center, part of the government’s intelligence and security agency, and a professor at Oxford. What stands out is the scale of the disruption. Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata Group, employs 34,000 people in Britain and supports another 120,000 British jobs through its supply chain. The automaker operates a just-in-time manufacturing process, so parts arrive when they are needed. When the company halted production, it also stopped payments to suppliers, some of which have since begun cutting staff hours or laying off workers .

15cb806c097c,Trump Administration Is Bringing Back Scores of C.D.C. Experts Fired in Error,"your-feed-science, us politics, layoffs;furloughs, civil service, epidemic;pandemic, measles, ebola, cdc, health and human services, donald trump","The Trump administration on Saturday raced to rescind layoffs of hundreds of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who were mistakenly fired on Friday night in what appeared to be a substantial procedural lapse. Among those wrongly dismissed were the top two leaders of the federal measles response team, those working to contain Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and the team that assembles the C.D.C.’s vaunted scientific journal, The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. After The New York Times reported the dismissals, two federal health officials said on Saturday that many of those workers were being brought back. The officials spoke anonymously in order to disclose internal discussions. The mistakes rocked an agency already in tumult, and which has been a particular target of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The C.D.C. lost about a third of its staff in April; many were rehired weeks later. In August, a gunman emptied more than 500 rounds of ammunition at the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta. Later that month, Mr. Kennedy orchestrated the ouster of the agency’s director, Susan Monarez, and precipitated a series of high-profile resignations. Among the workers whose firings were revoked were members of the elite corps of “disease detectives” who are typically deployed to the sites of outbreaks. The team that puts together the M.M.W.R., which communicates the agency’s recommendations and research, has also been brought back. The employees “were sent incorrect notifications, which was fixed last night and this morning with a technical correction,” a senior administration official said. “Any correction has already been remedied.” In order to ensure that teams confronting disease outbreaks include scientists with varied expertise, they comprise staff from various parts of the agency. The two top leaders of the measles response, for example, are officially employees of the office of the director at the Global Health Center, and the office of the director at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. When outbreaks die down, team scientists return to their regular positions. The leaders of the measles team were let go when the administration eliminated those two offices. But just as entire units must be cut in such a layoff, entire units must also be restored. Athalia Christie, who was “incident commander” of the measles response, had nearly 30 years of experience managing outbreaks, including Ebola, Marburg and mpox, previously called monkeypox. The White House often reached out to her for help with outbreaks. “Athalia is very well liked by the administration,” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the respiratory disease center before he resigned in August. He had brought in Dr. Christie to lead the measles response. Another senior infectious disease expert, Maureen Bartee, was working at the Department of State. But both their jobs fell under the director’s office of the C.D.C.’s Global Health Center, which was eliminated in the layoffs. By Saturday night, employees of both offices, including Dr. Bartee and Dr. Christie, had received notices of their rehiring. They and others received a two-paragraph email saying that the notice they had received “on or about” Oct. 10 had been revoked. “You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF,” the email said. The confusion over how the disease teams are organized “demonstrates their lack of understanding that this thing is an interconnected organism,” Dr. Daskalakis said, referring to the C.D.C. “I’m happy people are back, but this damage is not easy to repair both for current staff and for people who will lead public health in the future,” he added. The agency’s entire Washington office, which was laid off on Friday, will not be rehired. Nor will employees of the office of the director of the center for injury prevention, or those at the division of violence prevention policy. “This is going to be devastating to Americans and to the global community,” said Dr. Debra Houry, who served as the agency’s chief medical officer before she resigned in August in protest against the administration’s policies. “They are dismantling public health,” she added.

Officials,"layoffs;furloughs, us politics, civil service, cdc, american federation of government employees, epidemic intelligence service, health and human services, morbidity and mortality weekly report, robert f. kennedy jr, susan monarez, donald trump, disesases;health;illness;medicine","Dozens of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including “disease detectives,” high-ranking scientists and the entire Washington office — were notified late Friday that they were losing their jobs as part of the Trump administration’s latest round of federal layoffs. It was unclear on Friday how many C.D.C. workers were affected. But it was the latest blow to an agency that has been wracked by mass resignations, a shooting at its Atlanta headquarters in August and the firing of its director under pressure from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Layoff notices landed in the email inboxes of C.D.C. employees shortly before 9 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, notifying employees that their duties had been deemed unnecessary or “virtually identical” to those being performed elsewhere in the agency. Scientists, including leaders, in offices addressing respiratory diseases, chronic diseases, injury prevention and global health were among those affected. The staff of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , the journal that reports on health trends and emerging infectious threats, was also laid off. The publication’s storied history includes a June 1981 report that five previously healthy gay men were treated for an unusual pneumonia — the first hint of the AIDS epidemic. Roughly 70 Epidemic Intelligence Service officers — the so-called “disease detectives” who respond to outbreaks around the globe — received layoff notices, according to a person familiar with them. The service was spared during an earlier round of layoffs in February. An officer at an American Federation of Government Employees local union representing C.D.C. employees said that the agency’s human resources staff, which had been furloughed as part of the government shutdown, had been called back to work to send out layoff notices to their colleagues.

347fa9bddd46,Chinese Surgeons Perform First Pig-to-Human Liver Transplant,"your-feed-science, transplants, genetic engineering, liver, pig, china, hepatology","Surgeons in China have for the first time transplanted a section of liver extracted from a genetically modified pig into a human cancer patient, they reported on Thursday. The surgeons, who described the procedure in a paper in The Journal of Hepatology , grafted the portion of pig liver onto the left lobe of a 71-year-old patient’s liver after removing the larger right lobe, where a tumor the size of a grapefruit had grown. The lobe with the porcine transplant functioned, producing bile and synthesizing blood clotting factors, the surgeons reported. The patient’s body did not reject the organ graft, which enabled the remaining left lobe of the patient’s own liver to regenerate and grow, the scientists said. The porcine liver lobe was removed 38 days after the transplant, when complications developed, the surgeons wrote in the report. The patient, who had advanced disease, died a little over five and a half months later. He would not have been eligible to receive a human donor organ in China because he had advanced cancer and hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, the authors wrote. In a commentary accompanying the study, Dr. Heiner Wedemeyer, a co-editor of the journal, hailed the procedure as a “breakthrough” and a “historical clinical milestone,” although he noted that this was only a single case and that much work remained to be done to prevent complications and excessive blood clotting. “A new era of transplant hepatology has started,” he wrote. Dr. Heidi Yeh, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a transplant surgeon, said that the researchers had been brave to attempt such a procedure, as preliminary experimental work transplanting livers from gene-edited pigs into nonhuman primates had been unsuccessful, discouraging many scientists. “I think this is a landmark development,” Dr. Yeh said. “They put a pig’s liver in a human for a month, and the human did fine.” The Chinese undertaking underscores how swiftly and aggressively Chinese medical scientists are moving in their quest to advance the use of genetically modified pig organs to treat the country’s vast population. They are especially eager to utilize kidneys from genetically modified pigs to help treat the more than 1.2 million patients in China who experience kidney failure. Surgeons there recently reported that a 69-year-old woman had lived with a functioning kidney from a gene-edited pig for more than six months, a milestone approaching that of an American patient who is also still alive after receiving a gene-edited pig’s kidney in January. Chinese surgeons also recently transplanted a pig’s lung into a brain-dead patient, a procedure that is also considered challenging and so has not been attempted elsewhere. But liver disease is an acute public health problem in China, with over 300,000 people each year experiencing liver failure and a severe shortage of human donor organs. In 2022, for example, only about 6,000 people in China received liver transplants from human donors. Dr. Beicheng Sun, a surgeon at Anhui Medical University in Anhui Province and the lead author of the paper published on Thursday, said the plan all along had been for the pig liver transplant to be temporary and for it to be removed from the patient after doctors had observed it for as long as possible. “I never wanted that pig liver in the body for too long — I think that’s impossible,” Dr. Sun said in an interview. “My design is for it to serve and function as a bridge until the liver can regenerate or recover or a human donor liver can be located.” “This shows good potential to get the liver to regenerate,” he said. “Until liver function has recovered, you need a kind of special situation to support the liver’s recovery.” If a xenotransplanted liver — one from a nonhuman source — can function temporarily, “we may have enough time — one or two months or even three months — to get a human organ from a donor,” Dr. Sun said. While American surgeons have in recent years transplanted hearts and kidneys from genetically modified pigs into a small number of living patients, they have shied away from liver xenotransplantation, which poses particularly complex challenges. In experimental work transplanting livers from genetically modified pigs into nonhuman primates, most of the transplanted organs failed within a month, and researchers have pivoted instead toward an approach more akin to dialysis, which involves circulating a liver patient’s blood through a genetically engineered pig liver that is outside the body. A clinical trial of the treatment for critically ill patients with chronic liver failure who have had acute, life-threatening episodes of the disease was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is expected to begin soon. That procedure is also intended to serve as a “bridge” to a transplant for liver patients who have few other options for treatment and not as a permanent solution.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/health/chinese-surgeons-first-pig-human-liver-transplant.html,Health,BBC,By Roni Caryn Rabin,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/science/09pig-liver/09pig-liver-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-09T04:01:27+00:00,2eb3824d722ab2dcf478a73241e0d72b6348bfa5

Why Hasn’t He?,"alzheimer's, dementia, research, brain, genetics and heredity, dna, personal profile;people story, doug whitney, jorge llibre-guerra, washington university, dominantly inherited alzheimer network dian","Before dawn on a March morning, Doug Whitney walked into a medical center 2,000 miles from home, about to transform from a mild-mannered, bespectacled retiree into a superhuman research subject. First, a doctor inserted a needle into his back to extract cerebral spinal fluid — “liquid gold,” a research nurse called it for the valuable biological information it contains. Then, the nurse took a sample of his skin cells. After that came an injection of a radioactive tracer followed by a brain scan requiring him to lie still for 30 minutes with a thermoplastic mask over his face. Then, another tracer injection and another brain scan. During his three-day visit to the center, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, he also had cognitive assessments, neurological evaluations and blood draws that extracted multiple tubes for analysis. For 14 years now, Mr. Whitney has been the one-person focus of exceptionally detailed scientific investigation, for which he travels periodically to St. Louis from his home in Port Orchard, Wash. It is not because he is ill. It is because he was supposed to be ill. Mr. Whitney, 76, is a scientific unicorn with potential to provide answers about one of the world’s most devastating diseases. He has a rare genetic mutation that essentially guaranteed he would develop Alzheimer’s disease in his late 40s or early 50s and would likely die within a decade. His mother and nine of her 13 siblings developed Alzheimer’s and died in the prime of their lives. So did his oldest brother, and other relatives going back generations.

Trump Didn’t Talk About Those.,"tylenol, opioids, fatalities;casualties, transplants, liver, poison, johnson & johnson, kenvue, product labels","President Trump went far beyond the science when, based on an unproven link and inconclusive studies, he warned last month that taking the pain reliever acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy caused autism. But for decades, doctors and scientists have sounded an alarm about a different risk associated with acetaminophen products that is well established: liver damage from accidentally overdosing on the drug. Experts emphasize that acetaminophen is safe when taken as directed. But when people take too much, either intentionally or unintentionally, it can cause such serious injury to the liver that it can lead to hospitalization, a liver transplant or even death. Every year, a few hundred Americans die from liver failure from unintentionally taking too much acetaminophen, often because, while struggling with pain, they lose track of how much they have taken, according to medical researchers. Suicides involving acetaminophen account for additional deaths. Relative to the number of people who take acetaminophen, the number of overdoses is very small. But because billions of doses of the drug are taken by Americans each year, acetaminophen overdoses are nevertheless the leading cause of acute liver failure. “I think it’s an acceptably safe medication,” said Dr. Timothy Davern, a liver specialist in San Francisco who treats people with severe liver injury or acute liver failure from acetaminophen poisoning. “But if it’s used in higher doses, we’re all susceptible to liver injury from that. The consequences can be devastating.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/health/tylenol-acetominophen-liver-damage-kenvue.html,Health,BBC,By Rebecca Robbins,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/25/multimedia/xxhs-tylenol-liver-01-tlqz/xxhs-tylenol-liver-01-tlqz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T13:43:09+00:00,be80a9dd71a57161c8d8c619d69e2d49f34fb55b

He first thought that maybe she had seen a grizzly bear. Instead, Ms. O’Neill had regained cellular service and had seen a flood of text messages with the same news. “You just won the Nobel Prize!” she yelled. “No, I didn’t,” said Dr. Ramsdell, whose phone had been on airplane mode, he recalled in an interview. But she said, “I have 200 text messages saying that you did!” They had missed a 2 a.m. call from the Nobel committee that Dr. Ramsdell and two others had been awarded the 2025 prize for medicine for their research into the immune system. They also missed congratulations from their friends and family. His lab, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, said he “was living his best life and was off the grid on a preplanned hiking trip.” Dr. Ramsdell, 64, had not expected any important phone calls that morning and was offline, as he usually is while on vacation. His wife, on the other hand, preferred to be more communicative with her friends and family. “I certainly didn’t expect to win the Nobel Prize,” he said from a hotel in Montana. “It never crossed my mind.” The stop in Montana near Yellowstone National Park on Monday afternoon was nearly the end of a three-week vacation that crossed the mountain ranges of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. Dr. Ramsdell, Ms. O’Neill, their Gordon setter and rescue husky mix had set off last month from Seattle in their Toyota 4Runner with a small teardrop trailer in the back. At work, Dr. Ramsdell’s research has helped improve care for autoimmune diseases like some types of arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease, he said. Outside of work, he likes to unplug in nature. “I spend as much time as I can up in the mountains,” he said. “We tend to go into the remote areas,” he said, adding that he and his wife always looked out for bison, moose, elk and eagles. When he got to the hotel in Livingston, Mont., on Monday night, he finally spoke with Thomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, about 20 hours after Dr. Perlmann first tried to call him. Dr. Perlmann said in an interview that it had never been this difficult to reach a laureate since he assumed the role in 2016. Dr. Ramsdell tried returning Dr. Perlmann’s call from the campground, but it was 11 p.m. in Sweden and Dr. Perlmann had fallen asleep. They finally connected when Dr. Perlmann woke up at 6:15 a.m. on Tuesday. “Eventually, it worked,” Dr. Perlmann said. On Tuesday, Dr. Ramsdell planned to drive the six hours left on his trip to get to his fall and winter home near Whitefish, Mont. “I was just grateful and humbled by getting the award, super happy for the recognition of the work in general and just looking forward to sharing this with my colleagues, as well,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/health/nobel-prize-medicine-fred-ramsdell.html,Health,BBC,By John Yoon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07xp-nobel/07xp-nobel-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T09:38:09+00:00,fb1138cc9b374b0ab9426d2ffb4edda5b2666011
13356f804910,Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Is Awarded for Work on Immune Systems,"your-feed-science, nobel prize, immune system, disesases;health;illness;medicine, research, shimon sakaguchi, mary e. brunkow, frederick ramsdell, internal-open-access-from-nl","Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their discoveries of peripheral immune tolerance — the system that explains how the immune system prevents rogue cells from attacking tissues and organs. Their research, the prize committee said, has contributed to medical advances in cancer and autoimmune treatments, and may help with organ transplants. “This is a prize I’ve been waiting to see,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, director of the Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology in San Francisco. Finding “a population of T cells that had been missed and that keeps the immune system in balance,” was central, he said, to understanding autoimmune diseases and cancers. The three researchers will split a prize of 11 million Swedish kroner, or around $1.17 million. Why did they receive the prize? Central to the scientists’ research were their discoveries about T cells, the white blood cells that fight infection in the body. They identified a class of cells, regulatory T cells, and the genes that control them. In doing so, they answered puzzling biological questions: How does the immune system know to avoid attacking the body’s own healthy cells? And if by mistake some immune system cells fail to get the message, how are those cells stopped from wreaking havoc? The committee called their work “fundamental” to understanding how the body’s immune system functions. In an interview after the prize announcement, Rickard Sandberg, a professor in the department of cell and molecular biology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and a member of the prize committee, said that the research had provided a “new handle” on how to approach autoimmune disorders, or treatments and organ transplants. There are more than 200 clinical trials underway that build on their research, he said. How did they make their discovery? Dr. Sakaguchi, now a distinguished professor at the University of Osaka in Japan, worked out a medical mystery involving the thymus, a small organ behind the breastbone. It sorts out immune cells that might attack the body’s own tissues and organs and prevents them from getting into the bloodstream. He first studied the organ as a student in the 1970s, then performed research in the United States in the 1980s. His colleagues had done an experiment that made no sense. In the first few days after a mouse is born, the thymus is supposed to train the immune system, preventing T cells that could attack the body from ever entering the bloodstream. In this experiment, researchers removed the thymus from mice three days after the animals were born. In theory, the organ should have done its job during those three days. Harmful T cells should never have had a chance to get to the body’s tissues and organs. Instead, the opposite happened — the immune system went wild, attacking organs. But why? After more than a decade of work, Dr. Sakaguchi discovered that the thymus did not stop every harmful cell from escaping into the circulation. So even though most of those cells were blocked in the mice, enough got out to go on attack against the body’s own tissues. But, he learned, the thymus would have fixed that problem if it had not been removed so soon. The immune system, he discovered, has a backup system, a set of immune cells that stop mistaken attacks. It involved a new class of T cells, which he called regulatory T cells. Those mice whose thymuses were removed after three days had not had a chance to develop the regulatory T cells. But what genes control this system? The answer came from Dr. Brunkow and Dr. Ramsdell, working at what was then a British-owned biotechnology company outside Seattle, Celltech Chiroscience. They decided to study a strain of mice that developed a horrible autoimmune disease. Their immune systems’ attack on their own cells was so severe that the mice lived for only a few weeks. The mice were missing a set of genetic instructions. In a healthy individual, these tell the immune system T cells to hold off their attack when they enter the general circulatory system. After years of arduous work, the two researchers found the gene, called FOXP3. It resembled others that control other genes. And, in 2001, they reported that a rare autoimmune disease in humans called IPEX was the same as the disease in mice. Without FOXP3, regulatory T cells do not form. The body does not make T cells that tell other T cells that can attack the body’s cells not to respond. “This is a great recognition of the fundamental importance of distinguishing self from non-self,” said John Wherry, director of the Colton Center for Autoimmunity at the University of Pennsylvania. Cancers block attacks from the immune system by attracting a thicket of regulatory T cells. With the FOXP3 gene identified, and its role understood, researchers can develop drugs to turn the immune system against these cancer cells. With autoimmune diseases, there is the opposite problem. Regulatory T cells are missing or defective. Using FOXP3 as a starting point, researchers are developing drugs to teach the immune system to stop its attack. Dr. Marcela Maus, director of the cellular immunotherapy program at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the work “holds tremendous potential for unlocking new therapeutic avenues in medicine.” “The holy grail has been to be able to manipulate and control immunity versus tolerance,"" Dr. Maus said. “The work of these laureates unlocked the tolerance side of this equation.” With the discoveries, Dr. Wherry said, “major sets of drugs are going into the clinic,” for preliminary testing in cancer and autoimmunity. Who are the laureates? Dr. Sakaguchi is an expert in immunology at the University of Osaka. He was born in the city of Nagahama, about 60 miles northeast of Kyoto. As a child, he was interested in art and philosophy, but his father, a high school teacher, encouraged him to pursue science. He enrolled at Kyoto University, where he became interested in immunology. In the 1980s, he worked as a researcher at Johns Hopkins University and Stanford University, among other institutions, before returning to Japan. Dr. Brunkow joined the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle in 2009, where she studies genomics and autoimmune diseases.. She received Ph.D. in molecular biology from Princeton University. Dr. Ramsdell is a scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics, a company based in San Francisco that he co-founded. He has a Ph.D. in immunology from the University of California, Los Angeles Before joining SonomaBio, he was a senior executive at several other biotech companies. What did the laureates say about winning the prize? Dr. Sakaguchi called the award “a surprise and an honor” at a news conference on Monday on the campus of the University of Osaka. He got the call just after returning from a conference. “I really was elated,” he said in an interview posted on NobelPrize.org . When Dr. Sakaguchi began his work, it was difficult to obtain funding. Shigeru Ishiba, Japan’s prime minister, called into the news conference and asked him why he had persisted in his research despite initial doubts about his theories. “I think my stubbornness led to these results,” Dr. Sakaguchi replied. Dr. Brunkow said she did not expect to win a Nobel Prize. “My phone rang, and I saw a number from Sweden and thought, well that’s just spam of some sort, so I disabled the phone and went back to sleep,” she said in an interview also posted on NobelPrize.org . Who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2024? Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were recognized for the discovery of microRNA, a tiny class of RNA molecules that play a crucial role in determining how organisms mature and function — and how they sometimes malfunction. When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced? The prize for physiology or medicine is the first of six Nobel Prizes that will be awarded this year. Each award recognizes groundbreaking contributions by an individual or organization in a specific field. The Nobel Prize in Physics will be awarded on Tuesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton shared the prize for work on discoveries that helped computers learn more in the way the human brain does, providing the building blocks for developments in artificial intelligence. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be awarded on Wednesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, the prize went to Demis Hassabis, John Jumper and David Baker for work that showed the potential of artificial intelligence and other technology to predict the shape of proteins and to invent new ones. The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. Last year, Han Kang , known best for her novel “The Vegetarian,” became the first writer from South Korea to receive the award. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo. Last year, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo , a grass-roots movement of atomic bomb survivors, received the award “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.” Next week, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson were honored for research into how institutions shape which countries become wealthy and prosperous — and how those structures came to exist in the first place.

As the bike toppled, he thrust out his left arm to break the fall. It didn’t seem like a serious accident, yet “I couldn’t get up.” At the emergency room, X-rays showed that he had fractured both his hip, which required surgical repair, and his shoulder. Dr. Klein, a dentist, went back to work in three weeks, using a cane. After about six months and plenty of physical therapy, he felt fine. But he wondered about the damage the fall had caused. “A 52-year-old is not supposed to break a hip and a shoulder,” he said. At a follow-up visit with his orthopedist, “I said, ‘Maybe I should have a bone density scan.’” As he suspected, the test showed that he had developed osteoporosis, a progressive condition, increasing sharply with age, that thins and weakens bones and can lead to serious fractures. Dr. Klein immediately began a drug regimen and, now 70, remains on one. Osteoporosis occurs so much more commonly in women, for whom medical guidelines recommend universal screening after age 65 , that a man who was not a health care professional might not have thought about a scan. The orthopedist didn’t raise the prospect. But about one in five men over age 50 will suffer an osteoporotic fracture in his remaining years, and among older adults, about a quarter of hip fractures occur in men . When they do, “men have worse outcomes,” said Dr. Cathleen Colon-Emeric, a geriatrician at the Durham VA Health Care System and Duke University and the lead author of a recent study of osteoporosis treatment in male veterans. “Men don’t do as well in recovery as women,” she said, with higher rates of death (25 percent to 30 percent within a year), disability and institutionalization. “A 50-year-old man is more likely to die from the complications of a major osteoporotic fracture than from prostate cancer,” she said. (What’s “major”? Fractures of the wrist, hip, femur, humerus, pelvis or vertebra.) In her study of 3,000 veterans ages 65 to 85, conducted at Veterans Affairs health centers in North Carolina and Virginia, only 2 percent of those assigned to the control group had undergone bone-density screening. “Shockingly low,” said Dr. Douglas Bauer, a clinical epidemiologist and osteoporosis researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who published an accompanying commentary in JAMA Internal Medicine. “Abysmal. And that’s at the V.A., where it’s paid for by the government.” But establishing a bone health service — overseen by a nurse who entered orders, sent frequent appointment reminders and explained results — led to dramatic changes in the intervention group, who had at least one risk factor for the condition. Forty-nine percent of them said yes to a scan. Half of those tested had osteoporosis or a forerunner condition, osteopenia. Where appropriate, most of them began medications to preserve or rebuild their bones. “We were pleasantly surprised that so many agreed to be screened and were willing to initiate treatment,” Dr. Colon-Emeric said. After 18 months, bone density had increased modestly for those in the intervention group, who were more likely to stick to their drug regimens than osteoporosis patients of either sex in real-world conditions. The study didn’t continue long enough to determine whether bone density increased further or fractures declined, but the researchers plan a secondary analysis to track that. The results revive a longtime question: Given how life-altering, even deadly, such fractures can be, and the availability of effective drugs to slow or reverse bone loss, should older men be screened for osteoporosis, as women are? If so, which men and when? Such issues mattered less when life spans were shorter, Dr. Bauer explained. Men have bigger and thicker bones and tend to develop osteoporosis five to 10 years later than women do. “Until recently, those men died of heart disease and smoking” before osteoporosis could harm them, he said. “Now, men routinely live into their 70s and 80s, so they have fractures,” he added. By then, they have also accumulated other chronic conditions that impair their ability to recover. With osteoporosis testing and treatment, “a man could see a clear-cut improvement in mortality and, more importantly, his quality of life,” Dr. Bauer said. Both patients and many doctors still tend to regard osteoporosis as a women’s disease, however. “There’s a bit of a Superman idea,” said Dr. Eric Orwoll, an endocrinologist and osteoporosis researcher at Oregon Health and Science University. “Men would like to believe they’re indestructible, so a fracture doesn’t have the implication that it should,” he added. One patient, for example, for years resisted entreaties from his wife, a nurse, to “see someone” about his visibly rounded upper back. Bob Grossman, 74, a retired public-school teacher in Portland, blamed poor posture instead and told himself to straighten up. “I thought, ‘It can’t be osteoporosis — I’m a guy,’” he said. But it was. Another obstacle to screening: “Clinical practice guidelines are all over the place,” Dr. Colon-Emeric said. Professional associations like the Endocrine Society and the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research recommend that men over 50 who have a risk factor, and all men over 70, should seek screening . But the American College of Physicians and the United S. Preventive Services Task Force have deemed the evidence for screening of men “insufficient.” Clinical trials have found that osteoporosis drugs increase bone density in men , as in women, but most male studies have been too small or lacked enough follow-up to show whether fractures also declined. The task force’s position means that Medicare and many private insurers generally won’t cover screening for men who haven’t had a fracture, though they will cover care for men diagnosed with osteoporosis. “Things have been stalled for decades,” Dr. Orwoll said. So it may fall to older male patients themselves to ask their doctors about a DXA (pronounced DECKS-ah) scan, widely available at $100 to $300 out of pocket. Otherwise, because osteoporosis is typically asymptomatic, men (and women, who are also undertested and undertreated) don’t know their bones have deteriorated until one breaks. “If you had a fracture after age 50, you should have a bone scan — that’s one of the key indicators,” Dr. Orwoll advised. Other risk factors: falls, a family history of hip fractures, and a fairly long list of other health conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, hyperthyroidism and Parkinson’s disease. Smoking and excessive alcohol use increase the odds of osteoporosis as well. “A number of medications also do a number on your bone density,” Dr. Colon-Emeric added, notably steroids and prostate cancer drugs. When a scan reveals osteoporosis, depending on its severity, doctors may prescribe oral medications like Fosamax or Actonel, intravenous formulations like Reclast, daily self-injections of Forteo or Tymlos, or twice-annual injections of Prolia. Lifestyle changes like exercising, taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, stopping smoking and drinking only moderately will help, but aren’t sufficient to stop or reverse bone loss, Dr. Colon-Emeric said. Although guidelines don’t universally recommend it, at least not yet, she would like to see all men over 70 be screened, because the odds of disability after hip fractures are so high — two-thirds of older people will not regain their prior mobility, she noted — and the medications that treat it are effective and often inexpensive. But informing patients and health care professionals that osteoporosis threatens men, too, has progressed “at a snail’s pace,” Dr. Orwoll said. Dr. Klein remembers attending a seminar to instruct patients like him in using the drug Forteo. “I was the only male there,” he said.

83a7451c5057,‘Bluetoothing’: Blood-Sharing Drug Trend Fuels Alarming Global H.I.V. Surge,"disease rates, aids;hiv, drug abuse, hypodermic needles and syringes, blood, fatalities;casualties, unaids, africa, asia, fiji, internal-open-access-from-nl","A dangerous drug trend called “bluetoothing,” in which people inject themselves with the blood of other drug users to get a cheap high, is contributing to spikes in H.I.V. rates in infection hot spots around the world. The blood-sharing practice, which is many times riskier than sharing needles, has helped fuel one of the fastest-growing H.I.V. epidemics in Fiji and grown widespread in South Africa, another infection capital, according to public health authorities and researchers. The idea of sharing drug-laced blood is so unthinkably dangerous that for years, experts have questioned how common it is . But even if relatively few people do it, the practice can spread diseases like H.I.V. and hepatitis so quickly that experts say it requires a strong public health response. While the scale is hard to quantify, blood sharing has emerged in high-poverty areas in Africa and Asia, driven by tougher policing, spiking prices and falling drug supplies. “In settings of severe poverty, it’s a cheap method of getting high with a lot of consequences,” said Brian Zanoni, an Emory University professor who has studied drug injecting behaviors in South Africa. “You’re basically getting two doses for the price of one.” In Fiji, the authorities have identified bluetoothing as one force behind an alarming spiral in H.I.V. rates. The number of new H.I.V. infections rose 10-fold between since 2014 and 2024 , according to U.N.AIDS, a United Nations program, and an outbreak was declared there in January.

edb83a2b12a5,The Therapist Next Door,"therapy, college, dormitory, mental health","As a child, Xiomara Garcia, 21, assumed that attending a four-year college was out of reach. Her parents had never finished middle school, and money was tight. But there she was — a bioengineering major at Santa Clara University with a generous scholarship. In some of her classes, she was the only person of color. “It was like the biggest culture shock of my life,” Ms. Garcia said. She began to worry that she was an impostor who didn’t belong. Then a family member died. All of this, plus a stressful course load and unresolved childhood trauma, made it difficult to control her emotions. She tried online therapy, but finding a place to log in to her sessions privately, away from her roommate, proved difficult. Once, she talked to her therapist over video from underneath a stairwell on campus, steps away from a cafe. Eventually, she decided to see someone in person. Her new therapist had an office in the dorm where she had lived during her freshman year. The space included shells and rocks that her therapist had found, as well as soft lighting, cozy chairs and a basket of snacks — a welcome change from hiding in a busy building or braving the clinical environment of the main counseling center, she said. A growing number of campus mental health professionals, often referred to as “embedded counselors,” are now working out of dorms and other academic buildings. Schools say the setup reduces the stigma around getting help while also making the counselors more visible and accessible at a time when 37 percent of college students say they are grappling with depression. In a recent survey of school counseling center directors, nearly one-third said they used embedded counselors, up from 20 percent five years prior. The shift shows how colleges are rethinking the way they deliver mental health care, by adopting a model designed to meet students where they are, ideally before they face a crisis. “I used to come in crying every week,” Ms. Garcia said of her early counseling sessions. Now, two years later, she added, she feels more confident and better able to manage her feelings. Had she not found a therapist with a warm and inviting office who was also quickly accessible, she might not have kept going to therapy, she said. Late-night drop-ins At schools like Virginia Tech, which is nestled in a rural area between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains, on-campus counselors are a lifeline for many students because off-campus therapists are few and far between. But the main counseling office is about a 15-minute walk from the dorms and has traditional office hours, which can make it tough for busy students to squeeze in appointments. There are now four embedded counselors working out of a campus dorm who take drop-ins as late as 10 p.m. In the evening, as a student’s busy day winds down, “everything else is kind of coming to the surface ,” said Claire Cabellos, assistant director of embedded counseling at Virginia Tech. “Mental health crises don’t happen on a 9 to 5 schedule.” Since the introduction of embedded counselors, and other campus mental health initiatives, there have been fewer after-hours crisis calls and the resident assistants, also known as student leaders, have been more inclined to return to the role, Ms. Cabellos said. The student leaders were getting burned out and feeling stressed after being approached by students with urgent mental health concerns, she said. During the 2024-25 academic year, five embedded counselors saw 391 students for a total of 1,805 sessions. In 2022-23, the inaugural year, four embedded counselors saw 200 students and held 504 sessions. Some students have even been known to show up in their pajamas . Having the embedded counselors nearby — and available late at night — has been a big help to Rosi Escobar, 21, a student leader whose dorm is mostly full of first-year students. She has referred multiple students to the counselors, including one who was having a panic attack and another who hadn’t gotten out of bed all week. “I’m not the person who has to catch all these problems and fix it myself,” she said. It can be an enormous challenge for colleges and universities to provide accessible and quick mental health care to a large population of students. Data from the most recent Healthy Minds Survey , which was taken online by more than 84,000 students at colleges and universities across the country, found that only 47 percent of students who had reported screening positive for anxiety or depression said they had received counseling over the past year. Those who did not receive help cited roadblocks that included limited time, not knowing where to go, financial barriers and difficulty finding an appointment, among other issues. A friendly dog and an open door Kristin Tappan, a Santa Clara University graduate who is now a therapist there, is a familiar presence to many students. She’s often accompanied on campus by her dog, a Maltipoo named Tiramisu, and can sometimes be found handing out homemade lemon bars to students while introducing herself. It helps “make things feel a little bit more like home,” she said. “The doors are just a lot more open than I think they ever have been before,” she said. In one of her offices, which is set up like a family room, students will curl up in an armchair with Tiramisu nearby and talk about anything: what it’s like to live away from their family, relationship problems, academic stressors and worries about life after graduation. But oftentimes, Ms. Tappan said, deeper issues will surface, such as family trauma, like abuse, or problems with drugs or alcohol. “There’s so much under the surface,” she said. While there are several benefits to placing therapists in academic settings or dorms, the role can be particularly challenging . Melissa Bottiglio, a therapist and the assistant director of the Embedded Program at the University of Colorado Boulder, worked with a team to survey embedded providers across the United States and Canada in 2024 and found that counselors who work alone in academic buildings or dorms at times feel isolated, and find it harder to maintain boundaries when their work space intersects with campus life. “Counselors have to be firm about where their scope of care begins and ends,” she said. But when a school finds a formula that works, embedded counselors can draw in students who might otherwise feel hesitant to ask for help. The therapists can also tailor programming for specific campus groups. The University of Iowa currently has two embedded therapists supporting students in 11 residence halls. And Ohio State University now has 18 embedded clinicians located across its campus. The embedded counseling program at the University of Arizona, which started in 2020 with three counselors, currently has 12 counselors in places such as the Native American student affairs office, the medical school and the veterinary college. Sarah Heinzl, a licensed professional counselor at U.A., recalled a campus event where a student looked right at her, and joked, “We’ll talk about this on Friday.” Another student added, “My counselor is also here."" Later that week, after seeing how their peers had used the counseling services, several students stopped by her office to ask about them. “This is what embedded counseling does,” she said. “It breaks down misconceptions about therapy and normalizes counseling as part of their world. And when they see that, more students step forward to ask for help.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/well/mind/embedded-therapist-college-counselor.html,Health,BBC,By Christina Caron,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/well/WELL-DORM-THERAPIST1/WELL-DORM-THERAPIST1-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-08T14:11:59+00:00,88c2acc194e67b0f12069e4df9f64c0f7177efa7
3661d48e427e,Health Care Politics Bolster Democrats in Shutdown Fight,"us politics, legislation, obamacare;affordable care act;aca, health insurance, closings, federal budget, tax credits tax deductions tax exemptions, democrats, republicans, house of representatives, congress, senate, congress, hakeem jeffries, chuck schumer, mike johnson, john r thune, donald trump","When the top two Democrats in Congress sat down with President Trump in the Oval Office last week a day before the government was to shut down, they warned him that the coming fight was going to be politically painful for him and his party. If Republicans failed to agree to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies, as Democrats were demanding as a condition of any government funding deal, Mr. Trump and the G.O.P. would bear the brunt of the blowback from voters, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the two minority leaders from New York, told the president. Prices would spike for around 20 million Americans, they explained, including for many Trump voters. Mr. Trump did not dispute the point, saying that Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries were probably right, according to three people briefed on the private conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it. But he quickly added that he and Republicans would deflect blame back onto Democrats. A White House official said that Mr. Trump had disputed the argument by responding that everyone would make their own case to the public as to who was at fault. The exchange helps explain why Democrats believe they have the political upper hand in the shutdown fight, and why they are refusing to back down from their demands, at least for now. They believe that Mr. Trump, who has long been sensitive to the political perils of health care issues for Republicans, could be the key to winning a commitment on the expiring subsidies that could end the crisis. Democrats are keenly aware that Republicans in Congress are divided on extending the subsidies , with some of them, including those from competitive states and districts, sounding the alarm about the coming premium increases. “I made the point that the damage that’s being done to the health care of everyday Americans is hurting people who voted for him, and that is the reality,” Mr. Jeffries recently told reporters as he described the case he had made to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office that day. “It’s hurting everybody, but it’s certainly hurting people who voted for him.” Data backs up his point. According to KFF, a health policy research group, more than half of all people receiving insurance through the Affordable Care Act live in congressional districts represented by Republicans, with particularly high concentrations in southern states such as Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina, all of which have not expanded Medicaid under the 2010 law. And Mr. Trump’s longtime pollster, John McLaughlin, warned this summer in an op-ed that circulated widely among Republicans in Washington that a potential tax hike on more than 24 million working-class Americans could spell “potential political catastrophe for the G.O.P.” Still, despite Mr. Trump’s professed openness to a deal, and that of some rank-and-file Republicans, there is little appetite among G.O.P. leaders to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats enacted in 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic as a temporary measure to allow more Americans to obtain health coverage. Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader, have both said that significant changes would need to be made to how they are distributed before any extension could be brought to the floor. It is possible that the renewed subsidies could be approved in the House and Senate by Democrats and a minority of Republicans, but that is a scenario that both leaders would be eager to avoid. The Republican leaders have also insisted that they would not negotiate with Democrats until they vote to reopen government, creating the stubborn impasse. Democrats say they need a commitment on health care well beyond a promise of future negotiations, and they say Republicans have so far offered nothing close to that in informal discussions, let alone any formal talks. With Republicans on Capitol Hill resisting, Democrats see Mr. Trump and his natural inclination to cut a deal as providing a potential off-ramp as the shutdown drags on. “I’d like to see a deal made for great health care,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. “I’m a Republican, but I want to see health care much more so than the Democrats.” The remarks made Republicans on Capitol Hill nervous, and Mr. Trump quickly walked them back on Tuesday after speaking with Mr. Johnson. “I think Schumer is incapable of making a deal,” Mr. Trump said. “They are a mess. They’re a party that has no leadership — and they have no policy.” But Democrats are mostly holding firm, a sign of confidence that they are on the right side of the shutdown politics. As of Tuesday, not a single additional Democrat had crossed over to support Republicans’ stopgap bill to reopen the government, aside from the three aligned with Democrats who did so last week. Republicans had built their strategy for resolving the shutdown around the idea that they could break off anxious Democrats as the closure took a toll on federal services, and eventually push the spending bill through to passage. Instead, Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and broke ranks last week to back the G.O.P. bill, openly mused on Monday about withdrawing that support. “The best they’ve been able to tell us so far is that they’re open to conversations about solving the A.C.A. problem,” Mr. King said of Republicans. “That doesn’t cut it.” Mr. Thune on Tuesday said that Senate Democrats were being “bludgeoned” by the left to hold the line, and that he still held out hope that more would join Republicans. “They’re under enormous pressure from their leadership, but there are going to have to be some brave souls who are courageous enough to come out and deliver the votes to open up the government,” he said. In the House, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Republican from Georgia, chimed in with an improbable plug for Democrats’ position, saying that while she opposed the Affordable Care Act, she had learned that her “own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE” if Congress failed to act. But even Republicans who would back an extension of the subsidies say that they would only consider talks once the government is reopened. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said she had been privately circulating her own multipart proposal for ending the shutdown, but that negotiations centered on the Obamacare subsidies could begin only after the government were reopened. “There would be a commitment to having that discussion,” she said of the A.C.A. subsidy extension. Democrats said that the statements by Ms. Greene and the fact that Republicans were spending so much time talking about the health care issue showed that they had successfully made their case for the shutdown. “The bottom line is, they’re feeling the heat,” Mr. Schumer said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/us/politics/trump-democrats-shutdown-obamacare.html,Health,BBC,By Catie Edmondson and Carl Hulse,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07dc-aca-ltkw/07dc-aca-ltkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T22:38:10+00:00,63517df4c1729f043df8c9097fc24a0693d704af
701296c7df5f,"Seeking Covid Shots for Their Children, Some Parents Hit a Wall","pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, vaccines immunization, coronavirus;covid-19;pandemic, children, parenting, motherhood, fatherhood","Jill Schwartz has been searching Chicago for Covid shots for her three young children, ages 1, 3 and 5. She tried their pediatrician’s office. A pediatric clinic. Walgreens. No luck. In Womelsdorf, Pa., Rebecca Seidel has been trying to find a vaccine for her 7-year-old son. The pharmacist at a nearby CVS said that the store had no pediatric doses and that two other CVS locations didn’t either. So Ms. Seidel contacted the family’s pediatrician — who directed her to CVS. Leigh Bullion of Portland, Maine, also struggled to find shots for her 5- and 7-year-old sons. Her pediatrician did not have vaccines for children under 12. Neither did a supermarket-pharmacy chain. And the closest Walgreens offering pediatric doses was about 20 miles away. “It’s just like a nightmare,” Ms. Bullion said. The decisions of public-health agencies under President Trump and his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have created new obstacles for many people seeking Covid vaccines . But it has been particularly difficult to secure shots for children, including infants and toddlers under the age of 2, who are at higher risk of severe illness from Covid even if they are healthy. In August, the Food and Drug Administration limited approval of the latest Covid shots , authorizing them only for adults 65 and older and younger people with certain health conditions. A few weeks later, a vaccine advisory panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its own guidance , saying that anyone 6 months and up could get the vaccine in consultation with a medical provider. Children under 12 need a different version of the Covid vaccines. Many pediatricians, as well as pharmacies that carry adult formulations, aren’t stocking pediatric doses. Some cite low demand, but others cite uncertainty about the federal guidelines and logistical problems, including one in particular: The F.D.A. limited its approval of Pfizer’s vaccine to ages 5 and up, which left the Moderna vaccine as the only option for younger children. Representatives for Moderna and Pfizer said their companies had enough doses to meet demand. But some providers have told parents that they didn’t place orders because of the regulatory confusion. Some were waiting for the interim C.D.C. leader’s formal approval of the vaccine panel’s recommendations, which was announced Monday, about two weeks after the panel had voted. Others stocked Pfizer’s pediatric doses in past years and are scrambling to determine the feasibility of a new contract with Moderna. Two parents who spoke with The New York Times said their pediatricians had cited the need to switch to Moderna as one reason they didn’t have Covid vaccines for children under 5. Dr. Sean O’Leary, the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on infectious diseases, said he had heard the same from providers. The A.A.P. recommends Covid vaccination for children under 2 regardless of their overall health status. It also recommends the shot for older children who have high-risk conditions, those in close contact with high-risk people and those who haven’t received a Covid vaccine before. The group says the shot should be available to any child whose parents want it. For pediatricians, the ambiguity of the C.D.C. panel’s recommendations is another concern: It called for doctors to change how they obtain informed consent and to “discuss the risks and benefits” of vaccines with patients, but didn’t specify how. Some providers are grappling with the fact that, because the F.D.A. limited its approval to people who are 65 and older or who have a high-risk condition, many of the Covid vaccinations they would administer would be off label. This refers to giving a drug or vaccine to a group, or for a purpose, that the F.D.A. hasn’t approved it for, and C.D.C. recommendations don’t change that status. Doctors have the legal authority to prescribe off label, but some are uneasy about it. In an email shared by one parent on the condition that the practice not be named, a pediatrician’s office in Virginia wrote that off-label use “raises important considerations, including the need to consult our malpractice insurance and other regulatory provisions.” (The office, which confirmed the authenticity of the email, ultimately decided to offer the shots.) Dr. Thomas Nguyen, a pediatrician in Canton, Ohio, said he and his colleagues had needed to discuss whether they could vaccinate in the period after the F.D.A. issued its limited approval but before the C.D.C. weighed in. They ultimately placed “a small order” with Moderna on Sept. 11, he said, and shots were delivered Sept. 17. But it took another week to decide how best to document the risk-benefit conversations that the C.D.C. panel had called for. It is very unusual for doctors to have to navigate a disagreement between the recommendations of the C.D.C. and the A.A.P., Dr. Nguyen said, adding, “We always felt some protection by acting based on expert guidance.” The Trump administration’s actions have compounded existing challenges to pediatric Covid vaccine access. One is cost: If providers don’t think there will be enough demand, they are often loath to risk losing money by ordering shots that they might not be able to administer. Then there’s the anti-vaccine sentiment that Mr. Kennedy has helped stoke among some parents. “The confusion that’s coming out of the federal government is just magnifying all of those problems,” Dr. O’Leary said. Andrew Nixon, a representative for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in a statement that the F.D.A. had authorized pediatric vaccines and that federal insurance programs would cover them, but he did not address questions about their availability. Pharmacies say they are doing their best within legal limits. Regardless of F.D.A. and C.D.C. decisions, some states have higher minimum ages than others for pharmacists to vaccinate, with variation depending on the vaccine. In New York, for example, pharmacists can currently give Covid shots to children 3 and older, which makes access exceedingly difficult for the high-risk under-2 group if their pediatricians don’t stock the vaccine. Amy Thibault, a representative for CVS, said select CVS pharmacies nationwide had Covid vaccines available for children 5 and up. She added that all MinuteClinics — medical facilities inside some CVS stores that have more regulatory freedom than pharmacies — were vaccinating children 18 months and older. Only about 10 percent of CVS locations have a MinuteClinic. Walgreens and Walmart did not respond to inquiries about pediatric vaccine availability, and a Costco representative said only that parents should “continue to visit our website and check the scheduler for availability.” But many parents are trawling websites, calling and showing up to every provider they can think of, often to no avail. Some have succeeded in finding shots only after weeks of persistence. Ms. Bullion, the Portland mother, managed to find a CVS with appointments for pediatric doses available for mid-October. After a month of trying, Ms. Seidel still hasn’t found a Covid shot for her son. Neither has Ms. Schwartz for her three children. In Santa Fe, N.M., Caitlin Smith and her partner got their own shots on Sept. 7, but their children were turned away. Over three weeks, she contacted various pharmacies citywide before finding one offering pediatric doses on Sept. 28. The pharmacist told her he had received only 10 of them. “It feels like the system for pediatric Covid vaccines is designed on the assumption that parents are vaccine-hesitant,” Ms. Smith said. “It’s extraordinarily frustrating for parents who are not hesitant and want to protect our kids.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/well/covid-vaccine-children-parents-issues-rfk-jr.html,Health,BBC,By Maggie Astor,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07WELL-PEDIATRIC-VACCINE2-wbgq/07WELL-PEDIATRIC-VACCINE2-wbgq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T15:15:02+00:00,0c2cdf51e3cf2db6a76ccffda79e3eba67141abe

A History of the Practice.,"therapy, gay and lesbian;lgbt;lgbtq;gay;lesbian, psychiatry, youth, us politics, gender, supreme court;scotus","As a teenager, Julie Rodgers attended Tuesday night group therapy sessions in which young people confessed their same-sex transgressions: anal sex, fondling, masturbation, reaching out to an ex or watching “The L Word,” a television show about lesbians. What followed was a kind of psychological analysis, in which participants looked for reasons for their lapses. Maybe they had slipped because of a painful conversation with a parent, or a failure at school or work. Understanding those circuits, the group leader told them, would allow them to reprogram their brains and live as heterosexuals. Ms. Rodgers’s support group promoted conversion therapy, a practice that uses a range of techniques in an attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The practice surged in popularity among evangelical Christian communities in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically involves talk therapy and cognitive behavioral approaches, which seek to reshape habitual thought patterns. “I felt like I had to tell Ricky everything, every sexual attraction or feeling or crush that I might have,” Ms. Rodgers, now an out lesbian, told the producers of “Pray Away,” a documentary from 2021. “I felt the need to report if I had a lesbian boss or lesbian customers that came in at the restaurant where I worked. Let’s say I had acted out sexually with someone — I would definitely have to confess that.” A 2019 study by the Williams Institute at the U.C.L.A. School of Law estimated that roughly 698,000 adults in the United States had received some kind of conversion therapy, around half of them as adolescents. In the late 1990s, medical organizations began to speak out against the practice, citing a growing body of research that showed it was ineffective and potentially harmful. A number of states went on to ban the practice, beginning with California in 2012. The Supreme Court will hear a challenge on Tuesday to Colorado’s ban, with implications for more than 20 states with similar laws . There is some evidence that the practice continues despite the bans. In 2023, researchers for the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention among young L.G.B.T.Q. people, identified 1,320 counselors whose professional profiles showed they offered conversion therapy, sometimes using language like “sexual addiction.” About half of them held professional licenses, while the other half were ministers or pastors. “Unfortunately, there is rarely any evidence to indicate that these providers have recanted their belief in the ability to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity, or are no longer willing to try,” the report said. In earlier decades, psychiatrists tested so-called aversive therapies, such as delivering electric shocks or nausea-inducing drugs to people experiencing sexual arousal, in an effort to train them to avoid thoughts of same-sex attraction. But medical organizations had largely rejected those harsher approaches by 1973, when the American Psychiatric Association declared that it would no longer consider homosexuality itself a mental disorder .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/us/politics/conversion-therapy-supreme-court.html,Health,BBC,By Ellen Barry,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07scotus-conversion-therapy-what-is-llws/07scotus-conversion-therapy-what-is-llws-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T13:08:26+00:00,781399f9c5cf5ffe6e5fdcd898e53bacc6327d54
5519c2786bdf,How to Protect Your Pets From Pollution,"hazmat, air pollution, lead, animals, pet, veterinary medicine, chemicals, pollution, internal-open-access-from-nl","Although there is still much to learn about how pollution affects pets , it’s clear that smoky skies, contaminated water and toxin-laden house dust can be serious health hazards for a wide range of animals. The good news, experts say, is that many of the steps that we take to protect ourselves from pollutants and environmental contaminants can also reduce the risks for our animal companions. Here are some simple steps that experts recommend. During air quality crises When wildfires are raging nearby, or outdoor air quality has plummeted for other reasons, owners should limit the amount of time their animals spend outside, experts said. That means taking dogs for quick bathroom breaks instead of long, leisurely walks, and skipping any vigorous physical activities that could increase an animal’s respiration rate. Giving pets a quick once-over with a cleansing wipe or a damp towel when bringing them inside can also help because some pollutants have a tendency to cling to animal fur. Keep indoor air clean by ensuring that windows and doors remain closed and by running a high-quality air purifier. Smoky or polluted air can also dry out the respiratory tract, so ensure that pets have plenty of fresh, clean drinking water. Consider protecting your pet’s eyes. “If your eyes are itchy, your dog’s eyes are most likely also itchy,” said Dr. Michala de Linde Henriksen, a veterinary ophthalmologist at North Carolina State University who has studied the effects of wildfire smoke. Two over-the-counter products — an eyewash and lubricating eye drops — can help keep an animal’s eyes moisturized and irritant-free, Dr. de Linde Henriksen said. Rubbing, squinting, redness, tearing or discharge are all signs to consult with a veterinarian, she added. “Seek veterinary help if you have any concerns,” she said.

For days, the train’s hazardous contents spilled into the surrounding soil, water and air. It was an environmental and public health catastrophe, and efforts are underway to monitor the long-term health effects on the people of East Palestine. But one team of scientists is focused on a different group of local residents: the dogs. After the derailment, the researchers recruited dog owners in and around East Palestine, asking them to attach chemical-absorbing silicone tags to their pets’ collars. The preliminary results, which have not yet been published, suggest that dogs living closest to the crash site were exposed to unusually high levels of certain chemicals. The researchers are now analyzing blood samples from the dogs to determine whether the chemicals may have triggered genetic changes associated with cancer. “This is what we should be doing in the wake of any of these disasters,” said Elinor Karlsson, a geneticist at UMass Chan Medical School and the Broad Institute, who is leading the research. “The pets that live in our homes are being exposed to the same things we’re going to be exposed to.” Our pets breathe the same air, drink the same water and often sleep in the same beds that we do. And yet, there is relatively little research on how environmental toxins and pollutants affect our animal companions. That is an enormous missed opportunity, experts said. Our pets, they argued, are ideally situated to act as environmental health sentinels, helping scientists identify hazards that transcend species barriers. Understanding more about how pollution affects pets could ultimately yield insights that improve both animal and human health. “I do like to use the analogy of the canary in the coal mine, with this one distinction, which is that canaries were sacrificial,” said Dr. Audrey Ruple, a veterinary epidemiologist at Virginia Tech. “Our dogs are not. We care deeply about our companion dogs and our companion animals.” The air out there In 2020, California experienced a record-setting wildfire season, one that often left the skies filled with smoke. On particularly bad days, Stephen Jarvis, a graduate student in the Bay Area, found himself with headaches, irritated eyes, shortness of breath and even chest pains. He also noticed the effects in his partner’s asthmatic cat, Manolo. “On days when the air quality was worse, his symptoms would flare and he would have a hard time breathing,” Dr. Jarvis said. Last week, Dr. Jarvis, now an assistant professor at the London School of Economics, published a paper suggesting that Manolo’s breathing problems were not a one-off. He and his colleagues reviewed five years of veterinary data from across Britain, alongside data on the levels of airborne fine particulate matter, which is one of the main pollutants in wildfire smoke and a well-known human health hazard. When air pollution rose, so did the number of veterinary visits for cats and dogs, the researchers found. If the nation kept air pollution below the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization, it could prevent between 80,000 and 290,000 vet visits per year, they concluded. “That’s a lot of angst and a lot of money off the table for pet owners,” Dr. Jarvis said. It’s a sobering finding, especially given the fact that climate change and intensifying wildfires are expected to make air quality worse in the coming decades. “When we are considering how to protect ourselves from unhealthy air, we should also be thinking about our pets and wildlife,” said Olivia Sanderfoot, an ecologist at Cornell who studies the effects of smoke on wild animals . Smoke inhalation can cause an array of respiratory problems in animals, including coughing and shortness of breath. Studies have also begun to link wildfire smoke to other health consequences, including eye infections and cellular stress in dogs and heart problems and blood clots in cats. Birds are especially vulnerable because they are highly efficient breathers, extracting more oxygen from the air than mammals do. Unfortunately, Dr. Sanderfoot said, that means that they are also “processing higher concentrations of all of the nasty stuff” in polluted air. “They are more sensitive overall to air pollution than we are.” Heavy burdens Cats and dogs, which tend to spend a lot of time on or near the ground, could be at elevated risk from other chemical contaminants. Compared to humans, they may have more exposure to cancer-causing chemicals used in lawn care or the heavy metals, like lead, that tend to accumulate in household dust. In 2014, when lead began leaching into the drinking water in Flint, Mich., there was reason to believe that pets were especially vulnerable. Unlike people, pets usually “subsist wholly” on tap water, said John Buchweitz, a veterinary toxicologist at Michigan State University. After Dr. Buchweitz and his colleagues set up lead-screening clinics for local dogs, they found several animals whose results were of “extreme concern,” including three Australian shepherds all living in the same household. The dogs had been losing weight and behaving strangely, and all three had elevated lead levels in their blood. Dr. Buchweitz was alarmed; he knew that the family living there also had young children. “I personally reached out, contacted the health department, and said ‘This house needs to be investigated,’” he recalled. Officials subsequently found that the drinking water at the home contained enough lead to pose a clear danger to both people and animals. Known unknowns Although a chemical spill, wildfire or water crisis can present an acute, immediate health risk, many environmental health hazards are harder to identify: Does regular, low-level exposure to a particular pollutant, for instance, increase someone’s lifetime cancer risk? Pets have shorter lives than people, and are more likely to live them out in a single geographic location, making it easier for scientists to tease out some of these subtle effects. Plus, the devotion of pet owners helps facilitate data collection, experts said. “People are worried about their pets,” said Dr. Karlsson, who leads Darwin’s Dogs , a large community science project that aims to identify the genetic and environmental contributors to canine health and behavior. “And as a scientist, that’s an opportunity. Because if people are concerned about it, then they’re going to help us with the work.” Tens of thousands of American dog owners have enrolled their pets in Darwin’s Dogs and similar initiatives, including the Dog Aging Project and the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study . Among other data, these projects are collecting information on some of these dogs’ everyday exposure to chemicals, measuring the levels of herbicides in their urine , mailing out silicone, chemical-absorbing dog tags and asking owners to submit samples of their dogs’ drinking water . To Dr. Ruple, who led the Dog Aging Project’s pilot studies with silicone tags and drinking water, the owners seemed more eager to participate than they would have been in research on their own environmental health risks. “I think that people are quite suspicious of science at this point in time,” she said. “But their love for their dogs overrides whatever distrust they might have.” And the dogs, in turn, can give back, helping scientists identify chemicals that put both humans and animals at risk. After all, Dr. Ruple noted, the word “sentinel” refers to someone whose job is keeping watch. “That’s what we have always used dogs for,” she said. “Guardians of our livestock, guardians of our family, guardians of our homes.” And in a toxic world, perhaps, guardians of our health.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/science/pets-health-pollution.html,Health,BBC,By Emily Anthes,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/science/07sci-pet-sentinel-cover-illo/07sci-pet-sentinel-cover-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-07T07:00:05+00:00,76a548e44c75ee5d532956ef9ade8d4feab87ea1
95b5d4ef57f4,The Pressure of Dating With a Fertility Deadline,"dating, single people, women and girls, infertility, donor eggs, egg freezing","In the past, Kelly Shara, 31, often found herself doing fertility math when she was on a date. “OK, if we date for a year, then I’ll be this age when we get married,” explained Ms. Shara, who lives in Austin and works in tech sales. “Then we have a year, and then we could start having kids. And then that means I’ll be this age when I become a mom.” She absorbed the message for years — “from rom-coms and so much societal pressure” — that she should be married and having babies by age 30, she said. For the most part, Ms. Shara now finds that expectation silly. She has great friends and a fulfilling career and is unwilling to settle for a partner who isn’t a true teammate. If it weren’t for her pesky biological clock. “I would still love to have kids on the soon-ish side,” Ms. Shara said. “But there is an opportunity cost toward rushing dating and marriage and courtship and trying to find the right person.” The stubborn notion that women’s fertility falls off a cliff at 35 has slowly shifted in recent years, thanks to changing cultural norms and leaps in assisted reproductive technology. Despite growing alarm among conservatives over the United States’ historically low birthrate, women over 35 are actually giving birth in relatively large numbers. The birthrate among women 40 to 44 has even risen over the past four decades . “With many celebrities becoming first-time parents later in life, it often gives the public the perception that fertility is something you can delay,” said Dr. Natalie Crawford, a fertility doctor in Austin and the author of “The Fertility Formula.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.
