20a4c8f8d0b9,"Spies, Burgers and Bombs: After a New War, Old Wounds Resurface in Tehran","iran, us foreign policy, tehran, iran-israel war, embargoes sanctions, museum","The elephant had been clinging to a rope for months, swinging from the rafters of a disused factory outside the Iranian capital, waiting for an audience to turn up. He was made of fiberglass, not flesh, part of a surrealist art exhibition that was supposed to open in June. Then Israeli warplanes struck, marking the start of a blistering 12-day war that also drew in the United States. The show was postponed and the artists, unable to return home, were stranded at the gallery. Every night they pulled chairs into the courtyard to watch “the fireworks,” as the gallery owner, Houman Dayhimi, tartly put it — missiles streaking across the sky, the dark glow of explosions with a terrifying orchestra of booms and thuds. Reality took on the air of the art show. “It was surreal,” Mr. Dayhimi said. Like many Iranians, Mr. Dayhimi was used to bending to the vagaries of geopolitics. A decade earlier, his gallery space, the Dayhim Art Society, was a sprawling furniture plant with 700 employees. Then American sanctions forced it into bankruptcy, so he filled its workshops with artworks and the offices of tech start-ups. Even so, this latest flash of hostilities with the United States and Israel, at a time when Iran’s regional influence was crumbling, appeared to signal a volatile new path. “We know that change is coming, but we don’t know what or how,” Mr. Dayhimi said. “And that’s what makes it worse. It’s so unpredictable.” Nearly half a century after Iran’s revolution, people are accustomed to navigating the fraught space between the dictates of their government, pressure from foreign powers, and their own identities and desires. Signs in upmarket restaurants order women to wear the hijab, yet are roundly ignored by young diners with flowing hair. The internet is censored, so people used VPNs to scroll through Instagram and TikTok. American sanctions make for a thriving black market. Religion was strangely muted. Over eight days in July, I hardly saw a cleric on the streets, and rarely heard the three-times daily call to prayer, even though Iran is a theocratic republic. Certainly, there was plenty that conformed to Iran as advertised. Many women covered their hair. Black-clad police officers patrolled on dirt bikes. Giant murals depicted official heroes — stern-faced clerics, slain generals and nuclear scientists — and designated villains. “DOWN WITH THE USA” read the slogan across an American flag dropping cartoon bombs. But there was also, just a few streets away, splashes of beauty or history on walls covered in images of flowers or ancient Persian warriors. And while “Death to America!” rang out at Friday Prayer, some Iranians confided that they didn’t agree, even since the cartoon American bombs became jarringly real. (As part of the restrictions that journalists face in Iran, the government assigned a translator to us whose work we later verified. It was excellent.) During our trip, the city had a wounded air, its sang-froid shaken by a war that few had anticipated, or wanted. Residents said they felt rattled, and worried about what might come next. The ‘Den of Espionage’ A diplomatic ghost ship of sorts was moored on Taleghani Street in the form of a long, two-story building. Once it was the epicenter of hostilities between Iran and the United States. Now it is a museum. The sign over the front door still reads “United States of America Embassy,” complete with a crest of a soaring eagle. But the lobby is dominated by images of skulls, and crossbones and a ghoulish Statue of Liberty. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stared from a poster in the corner, a faint smile playing on his lips. The hostage crisis of 1979, when Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy and held 52 Americans for 444 days, was the foundational trauma between Iran’s rulers and the United States. It set the stage for decades of smoldering hostility during which the Americans cut off diplomatic ties and the Iranians sought to write their own version of that history in the halls of the deserted embassy, now officially known as the “U.S. Den of Espionage Museum.” After buying my ticket for $1.40 (the prevailing price for foreigners), I entered via the Roosevelt Gate, as it was once known. A path led through an overgrown garden, where street cats lounged under the pine trees. Charred helicopter parts were stacked on a plinth, wreckage from a failed rescue mission when American military aircraft collided during a sandstorm in 1980, killing eight American service members. “The sands in the desert were God’s agents,” read an inscription. Upstairs, the ambassador’s office had been carefully preserved — leather chairs, a handsome desk and immaculate American flag. (Iranian factories produce thousands of U.S. flags every year, mostly to be burned at street demonstrations.) A portrait of a smiling President Jimmy Carter hung from a wall. “Carter paid the price,” remarked our guide, Amir, a 21-year-old military conscript, referring to the role of the crisis in Mr. Carter’s failed re-election bid in 1980. Like many in a country where self-censorship is common, he requested to use one name. At the end of the hall, beyond a steel door, lay the main focus of the museum: the C.I.A. station. An array of vintage American spy gear was on proud display. There were compartmented rooms, machines to encode and decode messages, satellite transmitters, eavesdropping equipment, industrial shredders and devices that, according to the exhibit label, were used to forge passports and license plates. Waxwork figures sat beside a mound of shredded paper, in a depiction of the painstaking, yearslong effort by Iranian students to reassemble shredded American documents found inside the embassy, later published in several books. The Iranians liked to call the American hostages “guests of the ayatollah,” and exhibits in the museum stressed they had been treated fairly. In the embassy hallway, a line of portraits offered descriptions of each hostage, including details of their post-crisis careers and lives, some written in an almost fond tone. In fact, many hostages later complained of psychological abuse and physical mistreatment during their ordeal. The message of the museum is clear: Americans were only interested in meddling in Iran, not helping it. Still, it has a limited audience. The museum welcomes about 5,000 people every year, mostly tourists from Russia and China, Amir said. Even that flow had dried up since the war in June. During our tour, there was only one other visitor. On the way out, a museum manager presented me with some merch: A plaque commemorating Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian commander killed in an American drone strike in Iraq in 2020. Then I took at a break at the Boof Cafe, a smart little coffee house that recently opened on the embassy grounds. Photos of Charlie Chaplin and Marlon Brando adorned the walls. The owner, a soft-spoken man in his 60s, offered a warm smile but was wary of talking politics. “That’s up to the politicians, not ordinary people like me,” he said of the tensions between Iran and the United States. He pushed my order — an iced Americano — across the table. It was delicious. Jammed Signals Beyond the old embassy, hints of American culture were on open display. Songs by the Pixies, the Boston rock band, played in a Starbucks-style coffee shop. A vintage Lincoln Continental was parked in the lobby of my hotel. Young men clustered in darkened gaming cafes to play Grand Theft Auto. If the museum was the past, most people were preoccupied by the present, in particular the daily struggle to survive, and how it had gotten worse since relations with the United States took a sudden dive. Siyavash Naeini cursed as he maneuvered his modest taxi through the city’s infamous traffic. Snapp!, the ride-hailing app that is Iran’s version of Uber, was barely functioning, he grumbled. The authorities were jamming GPS signals in the city to make it harder for Israeli or American warplanes to locate potential targets. But that also made it near impossible for customers to hail his cab. Since June, his business was down 70 percent. Mr. Naeini, 59, couldn’t afford to stop. He had been diagnosed with cancer — “terminal,” he said matter-of-factly — and needed the money to pay for the drugs that kept him alive. “Since I started chemotherapy, I can’t feel the pedals very well,” he said, idling at a stop light. He got the drugs at subsidized prices from a government-run pharmacy, he said. But sometimes supplies ran out, forcing him onto the black market, where prices were 10 times higher. It was cleaning him out. “My wife sold her jewelry,” he said. “I sold our rugs.” As we pulled up to our destination, I offered my sympathies. Mr. Naeini brushed it off. He didn’t want pity, he said. It was just the struggle of life. Then he drove away, scouring the streets for his next customer. Waiting for Godot We were standing near the British embassy, where a sign read “Babbi Sandz Street.” The street was named for Bobby Sands, a member of the Irish Republican Army who in 1981 died on hunger strike in prison in Northern Ireland, demanding to be treated as a political prisoner. In Britain, Mr. Sands was reviled, but in Iran he joined the pantheon of martyrs. Lionizing martyrs has become a key part of Iran’s political culture. As well as ordaining enemies, like the United States, the authorities anoint national heroes said to share the values of the Iranian revolution. It can also be a way of irking rivals. The British embassy later shifted its entrance to an adjacent street, to avoid having its address named after an Irishman who opposed British rule. Until recently, Egypt’s embassy in Tehran was on a street named after Khalid al-Islambuli, the extremist who assassinated the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. In a sign of warming relations between Iran and Egypt, the name was changed in June. The enthusiasm for Mr. Sands has taken some unorthodox forms. Just before midnight I stopped for dinner at “Bobby Sands Burgers,” a fast-food restaurant on a hilly street in northern Tehran. A line of diners stretched down the street, waiting to order burgers and fries over a counter that was decorated with neon images of the dead Irishman. “Bobby Sands stood for freedom and liberation,” the manager, Kia Garabandi, told me. “Iranians can relate to that.” If it seemed odd to name a burger joint after a person who had starved to death, Mr. Garabandi didn’t think so. “A great man,” he said. “And we make great burgers.” With so much turbulence around, others preferred to focus on the future instead of history, hoping it might bring a kind of deliverance. At a memorial for the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed in an Israeli strike, a mourner told me he welcomed the war. He said it would bring forward the moment when a religious savior known as the Mahdi would return to earth, turning everyone into Muslims. “Even you,” he said, jutting a finger in my chest. Others are not holding their breath for any savior to appear. In downtown Tehran, students crowded into an artsy gathering spot called the Cafe Godot, named after the Beckett play. “It’s an existential tragicomedy,” remarked the cafe owner, Homayoun Ghanizadeh, a well-known movie and theater director. “Iranians can relate to that.” “Just like in the play,” Mr. Ghanizadeh said, “every day a messenger comes and says: Godot won’t come tonight, but he will surely come tomorrow night. And the next day, it all starts over again.” “In my view, the Islamic Republic is also in a state of waiting,” he said. “Although their Godot is quite different from the one ordinary people are waiting for.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/middleeast/iran-tehran-united-states.html,World,Washington Post,By Declan Walsh and Nanna Heitmann,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/world/xxint-iran-dispatch-promo/xxint-iran-dispatch-05-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:00:41+00:00,04abdcc9d6e75a8e200153669037322aa6511f8c
53ab7ade1f83,Frustrated Gen Z Threatens to Topple African Governments,"africa, morocco, kenya, madagascar, william ruto, civil unrest, generation z;gen z, youth, politics, human rights, international relations","First Kenya, then Madagascar and now Morocco. A wave of protests under the banner of Gen Z has swept through parts of Africa. Demonstrators have stormed Parliament buildings. Security forces have killed and injured hundreds, and in Madagascar the president fell from power on Tuesday. Each protest has had specific causes, but under the surface each reflects the failure of elected governments to provide economic opportunities for young people across a continent with the youngest population in the world , according to protesters and analysts. The frustration among young people poses a challenge to governments beyond where Gen Z protests have taken place, not least because of the continent’s young demographic. Africa’s median age is 19, which means that young people are entering the workplace and becoming politically active in large numbers. Young voters in Botswana last year helped defeat the party that had ruled since independence, while in South Africa discontent among young people with the economic performance of the African National Congress helped cause its vote share to fall below 50 percent for the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994. “Young people want some form of prosperity, they want some form of hope and they are not seeing that,” said Ndongo Sylla, a Senegalese economist and author. The attempts by security forces to repress the protests suggest that governments lacked clear answers, he added. In one measure of the limited economic opportunities in Africa, the vast majority of new jobs on the continent are in the informal sector, according to the African Development Bank. Young people often lead demands for change and analysts argue that, while social media makes these protests distinct, it does not constitute a fundamental difference. But social media has made it easier for Gen Z, the demographic cohort born roughly between 1997 and 2012, to outfox the authorities by orchestrating demonstrations on the fly without high-profile leadership. At the same time, political demands have often shifted and become more ambitious over time, which has kept governments off balance in the face of the protests. Kenya, where global Gen Z protests broke out last year, is a case in point. Young people marched through the capital, Nairobi, and other cities to protest a finance bill introduced by the government of President William Ruto that they said would raise prices. Behind that lay an array of grievances, including spiraling debt, corruption, rising prices and youth unemployment. In a significant victory, the president withdrew the bill in June last year, the day after some protesters stormed parts of Parliament and more than 60 people had died, largely as a result of police fire. The protests resumed in June on the anniversary of the largest demonstrations, with calls for the president to resign, and at least eight others were killed. “The systemic change that everybody wants has not happened,” said Nelson Amenya, a student activist. Mr. Amenya’s role as a whistle blower over a proposed deal by the government to overhaul the capital’s main airport last year helped fuel the protests in Kenya. In recent weeks there have also been protests in Indonesia and Nepal, where the government fell, while President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar was forced to dissolve his government in an attempt to quell protests. The protesters had demanded that he step down for his failure to deliver basic services, including electricity and water. Many young people were not appeased. “Firing the government is not a solution. The real problem hasn’t been uprooted,” said Rakoarivao Andritiana Kevin, 20, a law student at the University of Ankatso in the capital, Antananarivo, arguing that Mr. Rajoelina should resign. Mr. Rajoelina has since gone into hiding and was impeached by Parliament on Tuesday. The demonstrations that erupted in Morocco in recent weeks were driven by anger over spending on infrastructure ahead of this year’s Africa Cup of Nations football tournament and the 2030 World Cup. Three people were killed. The protests, organized by a group known as Gen Z 212, used social media to call for better schools as well as hospitals and broader freedoms. “Promises have not been kept and the credibility of the country’s political elite has suffered as a result,” said Aboubakr Jamai, dean of the Madrid center at the American College of the Mediterranean. The success of the demonstrations in Madagascar and Nepal, which have prompted changes of government, has forced activists in Kenya to reflect on their lack of progress. “I’ve been looking at them with green eyes, with jealousy, because they are literally getting what they want,” said Lee Makenna Jelani, who has supported Kenya’s protests and organized a dialogue on social media to discuss what lessons could be learned. But others in Kenya said they have been inspired by what they see as a movement that has spread across the continent and beyond. Hanifa Adan, 29, who played a prominent role in rallying the demonstrations last year and was briefly detained, said she had followed the other protests avidly. “We are validating each other. We are inspiring each other,” she said. “We borrow courage from each other.” Aida Alami and Gaelle Borgia contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/africa/africa-gen-z-protests-kenya.html,World,Washington Post,By Matthew Mpoke Bigg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15int-DRIC-genz-1-mfgk/15int-DRIC-genz-1-mfgk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:02:36+00:00,a46d8f2bc1c2fc099d023e88478751ed27515962
e20d15135f95,"With Truce in Place, Hamas Pursues Bloody Crackdown on Rivals in Gaza","military, israel gaza war, palestinians, terrorism, peace process, targeted killings, hamas, gaza city, deir al balah, gaza strip","The public execution was captured on video. Masked gunmen, some wearing green headbands associated with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, lined up eight captives in the middle of a crowded street in Gaza City on Monday. They forced the men to bend over, leveled their rifles at them, and opened fire, leaving their bodies in the dirt. A Hamas internal security official confirmed that the video, which The New York Times geolocated to Gaza City, showed Hamas fighters executing Palestinian rivals. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to journalists. The execution took place just days after a cease-fire with Israel began on Friday and Israeli forces pulled back from parts of Gaza. Analysts say that Hamas appears to be trying to assert that it is still the dominant force in the territory, no matter how weakened it is after two years of war with Israel. Hamas lost many of its top commanders and thousands of fighters in the conflict, and some Gaza residents launched rare protests against the group’s iron-fisted rule earlier this year. Israel has acknowledged that it also sought to undermine Hamas’s control by backing rival Palestinian clans in Gaza, with mixed results . “Hamas is sending a message: ‘We are here. We are the sole authority in Gaza,’” said Tamer Qarmout, a Palestinian political analyst and academic from Gaza, who is based in Qatar. Since Monday, at least 10 members of Hamas’s security forces and at least 20 members of rival Palestinian groups have been killed in the internecine fighting, according to a Gaza health official and the Hamas internal security official. It was not clear whether the eight men who were executed in the video were counted in those tolls. Some of them were members of the Doghmosh family, which has a long-running rivalry with Hamas, Nizar Doghmosh, a family leader, told The Times on Wednesday. The outbreak of internal violence in Gaza, which has been limited to a few incidents so far, could further complicate President Trump’s vision for a postwar Gaza. His plan to end the war requires Hamas to lay down its weapons, allow an international force to stabilize the territory, and effectively end its two-decade control — demands the group has rejected so far. After a visit to Israel on Monday coinciding with Hamas’s release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, Mr. Trump was asked by a reporter about the possibility of the group reasserting itself as a police force in Gaza and shooting rivals. Mr. Trump suggested the United States was not opposed, at least for now. “They’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” he said. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump addressed the issue again, saying Hamas had “taken out a couple of gangs that were very bad,” and adding: “That didn’t bother me very much, to be honest.” The U.S. military’s Central Command — which oversees Middle East operations — later issued a statement telling Hamas to stop shooting at Palestinian civilians in Gaza, adding that the United States had conveyed concerns over the violence to international mediators. During the war, uniformed Hamas fighters were rarely seen on the streets of Gaza. They avoided moving in the open as much as possible so they would not be targeted by Israeli airstrikes. Palestinian witnesses in Gaza say groups of masked, rifle-toting Hamas security forces are appearing again now, including when Hamas handed over the remaining hostages to the Red Cross on Monday. Some of the Hamas activity does appear to entail restoring public order in Gaza’s daily life. In the central city of Deir al-Balah, for example, armed men have been spotted in the streets directing traffic this week, which they had hardly done throughout the war. Hamas officials publicly acknowledge that they are also launching operations against people they deem to be lawbreakers or collaborators with Israel. Two Hamas internal security officials said the killings shown in the video were in retaliation for the Doghmosh family’s killing of several Hamas militants during the war. The clashes that led to the killings shown in the video began on Sunday, Mr. Doghmosh said, after Hamas had sought to apprehend members of the family it accused of being collaborators with Israel. He denied that the family as a whole was working with Israel. Later that evening, Hamas fighters and armed members of the Doghmosh family fought a pitched gun battle in Gaza City, according to two Gaza health officials, two Hamas internal security officials and Palestinian residents. One of those killed in the clashes was Naim Naim, whose father, Basem Naim, is a senior Hamas leader, according to two family members and one of the Gaza health officials. After the clashes, armed Hamas fighters burst into nearby houses, checking identity cards to see who belonged to the Doghmosh family, said a Palestinian witness who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. He said his family spent hours huddled in the center of their home amid a hail of gunfire and explosions outside. Then Hamas fighters showed up and ordered them to flee, he recounted. At least 24 bodies arrived at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City from the Hamas-Doghmosh clashes on Sunday night, said Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the medical facility’s director. He said he did not know how many were from each side. On Monday, the day after the gun battle in Gaza City, the Hamas gunmen were filmed shooting the masked and blindfolded men in the middle of neighborhood where the clashes took place, surrounded by a large crowd of bystanders. Hamas’s interior ministry has warned rival groups that it will come after any “criminal gangs” that threaten “civil peace.” It called for members of those groups who were not involved in killings to hand themselves over in exchange for amnesty and warned that anyone who did not would face consequences. Mahmoud Mardawi, a Hamas official, vowed on social media on Tuesday that the group would not allow “chaos to spread in beloved Gaza nor criminals to escape punishment.” Military analysts say a major target for this Hamas crackdown will likely be the string of small Palestinian militias that have sprung up in Gaza over the past several months, though it is not clear whether Hamas has already moved against them in force. None have mounted a serious challenge to Hamas yet, the analysts said. Some of these smaller militias say they have worked in coordination with Israel . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel confirmed in June that Israel was “using clans in Gaza” who were fighting Hamas on its behalf. Israeli officials later confirmed helping to arm one operated by Yasser Abu Shabab in eastern Rafah. Mr. Abu Shabab was notorious for ransacking humanitarian aid from U.N. convoys earlier in the war, according to aid officials. Later, he set up a militia in an Israeli-controlled zone inside Gaza, saying this zone would be peaceful and free of Hamas. His militia uploaded videos showing makeshift classrooms and quiet tents in an effort to attract displaced Gazans to join. “This adventure was only ever going to end one way,” said Michael Milshtein, a former senior Israeli intelligence officer. “We armed and supported these militias, and now Hamas is coming for its revenge.” If Hamas attacks any of the clans affiliated with Israel, it would pose a “heavy dilemma” for the Israeli authorities, who would have to decide whether to defend them — thus breaking the cease-fire — or allow them to be killed or arrested, Mr. Milshtein said. For now, at least some militia members say they have no plans to surrender to Hamas. “We are preparing to defend ourselves by any means necessary should Hamas attack,” said Mohammad al-Mansi, 21, whose father leads a small armed group opposed to Hamas in northern Gaza. “We won’t turn ourselves in. We would rather die.” Bilal Shbair and Abu Bakr Bashir contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/middleeast/hamas-crackdown-rivals-gaza.html,World,Washington Post,"By Iyad Abuheweila, Aaron Boxerman and Sanjana Varghese",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15int-gaza-hamas-2-jlgm/15int-gaza-hamas-2-jlgm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:58:39+00:00,f53fd413249ef63372e7410a79b6905488d8c1a0
2a5a4bd472d3,Syria’s New Leaders Are Talking to a Former Enemy: Russia,"international relations, war;armed conflicts, embargoes sanctions, military bases, ahmed al-shara, bashar al-assad, vladimir putin, syria, russia, internal-open-access-from-nl","The shops in the Syrian town of Hmeimim — hair salons, kebab stalls, a mechanic’s garage — have signs in Russian. But most of them were shuttered on a recent morning. Soldiers from the nearby Russian air base don’t visit anymore, a cafe owner said. Ten months after the fall of its ally, the authoritarian president Bashar al-Assad, Russia’s influence is barely visible in Syria. Most of its troops are gone, and the bases and investment projects built up during its decade-long intervention are largely abandoned. The new president, Ahmed al-Shara, who led the Islamist rebel force that overthrew the Assad regime and upturned Russia’s interests in the region, allowed Moscow to maintain a small footprint in Syria rather than chasing it out completely. “With al-Shara, we are clearly seeing pragmatism over ideology,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “There is no reason for al-Shara to make another enemy, as he is trying to survive in this geographic region.” For many Syrians, including the former rebels who now run the country and one-time refugees back home after many years, there is no love lost for Russia. It propped up Mr. al-Assad’s brutal dictatorship for decades and entered the 13-year civil war directly, unleashing deadly bombing raids on Syrian towns and villages. In previous contacts with Russian officials, Syria’s Islamist leaders have asked that Mr. al-Assad, who has taken refuge in Moscow, be extradited for a war crimes trial and that Russia pay war reparations. But Syria, under pressure from neighbors and larger powers, faces many security and economic challenges that could motivate Mr. al-Shara to seek compromises. His priorities are to negotiate an end to international sanctions and ease the nation’s crippling poverty, while preventing outside interference as he consolidates power and secures Syria’s borders. Russia has made clear that it wants to maintain its air bases in Syria — the one at Hmeimim and a smaller one in the northeastern city of Qamishli — and to continue to use the port of Tartus on the Mediterranean coast, analysts said. Together, they provide Russia with its only stopover points in the eastern Mediterranean for planes and ships traveling to and from Africa. Officials at the Syrian Foreign Ministry declined requests for comment on the government’s plans for its relations with Russia. But political analysts and politicians in Syria said that Moscow was in no position to make demands. “The reality is Russia continues to remain in Syria with a big, purple black eye,” said Ms. Aydintasbas, the Brookings Institution fellow. Russian personnel have to give prior notice of their movements to the Internal Security Service of Syria and are only allowed to travel under escort, according to Syrian security officers guarding checkpoints near Hmeimim and Tartus. Russia once controlled the naval base at Tartus, but now it can only use a single berth when the Syrians allow it, said Abed al-Thalji, an independent Syrian analyst based in Europe. A Russian submarine that had docked at Tartus now stays in Algeria and Libya, he said. And military vessels that escort Russian shipments to Syria anchor off Egypt, added Mr. al-Thalji, who tracks maritime traffic. After canceling Russia’s contract to manage the Tartus port, the Syrian government this summer signed a deal with Dubai Ports World, which agreed to invest $800 million in the facility, Ahmed Khalil, who has been the port’s general manager since December, said in an interview. Business at the port has started to take off since President Trump lifted most of the U.S. sanctions , Mr. Khalil said. “All the quays are busy and we have ships waiting to come inside,” he said. There were signs of ongoing Russian trade with Syria. Rolls of Russian steel were among the goods stacked at quays that New York Times reporters saw during a visit in August. Russia has also provided Syria with much-needed oil and grain at near-giveaway prices, according to several analysts. Syria needs Russia on its side at the U.N. Security Council for important security and political matters. For one, Mr. al-Shara and his interior minister are still on a U.N. sanctions list targeting members of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, Mr. al-Thalji said. Another is enforcement of the Disengagement Treaty, which created a buffer zone along the Golan Heights and which Israel has breached by occupying Syrian territory since December. Since Mr. al-Assad’s ouster, Israel has repeatedly bombed Syrian military facilities , concerned that the old regime’s weapons could fall into the hands of parties that are hostile to it. Israel is also suspicious of the country’s new Islamist leaders and has carried out airstrikes on the Defense Ministry building in central Damascus in July. Under the Assad regime, Russian forces helped patrol Syria’s southern border along the Golan Heights. Diplomats have raised the possibility of Russia’s returning to that role to ease tensions between Israel and the new government. After months of quiet contacts, Russia sent a senior-level delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Mr. Putin’s top energy strategist, to Damascus in September to recalibrate relations. Mr. Novak was welcomed by Maher al-Shara, a brother of the president who speaks Russian and is married to a Russian woman. Maher al-Shara is believed to be responsible for Russian affairs in the office of the presidency. After Mr. Novak’s visit, a delegation from the Syrian Defense Ministry visited a Russian air defense training facility. It is not clear whether any deals are on the table. But Ms. Aydintasbas said that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a close ally of the Syrian president, would most likely advise him, based on experience, to balance the risks of upsetting Western partners by drawing closer to Russia against the security and economic gains that could result. “It’s the Erdogan playbook of balancing acts among great powers and opening up possibilities for a small country,” she said.

ae7942da8f26,First Burials to Be Held for Israelis Returned From Gaza,"israel gaza war, funerals, israel, hamas","The bodies of two Israelis returned from Gaza earlier this week were expected to be buried on Wednesday, underscoring that while many in the country were celebrating the return of the living hostages from Gaza, others were also mourning the dead. A funeral for one of those whose bodies were returned, Guy Ilouz, was set to take place in the afternoon in central Israel, according to the Hostage Families Forum, which has advocated on behalf of the families of those held in Gaza. Mr. Ilouz was abducted in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the Gaza war. The body of Daniel Peretz, whose tank crew battled Hamas militants at an Israeli military installation on Oct. 7, 2023, was also scheduled to be buried Wednesday evening, according to the Forum. Mr. Peretz, who was 22, was declared dead by the Israeli military in March 2024 and his family held a funeral for him at the time. Hamas militants in Gaza have handed over the remains of eight people since Monday. Israel has identified six of those bodies as Israelis and one more as a Nepali. The identity of the eighth was not yet clear. Hamas officials have said the group is struggling to quickly locate all the bodies that have been held in Gaza, because of the vast destruction across the enclave after two years of war. Israeli officials have suggested that they could take measures to penalize Hamas for not turning over more bodies, including limiting the number of trucks entering Gaza with supplies. Mr. Ilouz, who was 26, was injured and taken hostage by Hamas after fleeing the Nova music festival in southern Israel, according to the Israeli military. The military said that he succumbed to his wounds after not receiving proper medical care while held in Gaza. Maya Regev, who was freed from captivity in Gaza in November 2023, met Mr. Ilouz at a hospital in the enclave. “You suffered a week alone until I arrived,” she wrote to him on Tuesday on social media. “We spoke about the most simple and pure things in the darkest and most horrific place that man has known.” On Wednesday, for the second consecutive day, the Red Cross delivered the bodies of 45 Palestinians to Gaza from Israel, according to the Gaza health ministry. Under the cease-fire deal concluded between Hamas and Israel last week, Israeli authorities were supposed to release the remains of 15 Palestinians for each Israeli body returned by Hamas, according to Arab officials. It was unclear what circumstances Israel had led to those bodies being held in Israeli custody. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment about why Israeli authorities were holding onto Palestinian remains, or when and where they had recovered them.

ebe74cfcf10d,London Became a Global Hub for Phone Theft. Now We Know Why.,"robbery, police, organized crime, crime, mobile phone, biking, scotland yard metropolitan police service, europe, britain, london, china","Sirens screamed as police vans pulled into a north London street, and shocked passers-by paused to watch as officers charged into three secondhand phone shops. “Do you have a safe on your premises, sir?” one officer asked a shopkeeper, who was sitting next to his computer and a half-drunk cup of tea. The man watched as they combed through phones, cash and documents from two safes. The raid, which The New York Times was invited to observe, was one of dozens carried out across the capital last month, part of a belated, highly visible effort by London’s Metropolitan Police to tackle the phone theft problem that has plagued the city in recent years. The scale of the crime has gone beyond the pick-pocketing familiar to London since before Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist made it famous. Increasingly brazen thieves, often masked and on e-bikes, have become adept at snatching phones from residents and tourists. A record 80,000 phones were stolen in the city last year, according to the police, giving London an undesirable reputation as a European capital for the crime. Last month’s raids were aimed at identifying a group of middlemen who, the police say, use secondhand phone shops as part of a multilayered global criminal network. By the end of the two-week operation, detectives had found about 2,000 stolen phones and 200,000 pounds ($266,000) in cash. After years in which phone theft was a low priority for an overstretched police force, the new operations are revealing the curious blend of factors behind the epidemic, including steep cuts to British police budgets in the 2010s and a lucrative black market for European cellphones in China. A Mile of Aluminum Foil For years, London’s police assumed most of the phone thefts were the work of small-time thieves looking to make some quick cash. But last December, they got an intriguing lead from a woman who had used “Find My iPhone” to track her device to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport. Arriving there on Christmas Eve, officers found boxes bound for Hong Kong. They were labeled as batteries but contained almost 1,000 stolen iPhones. “It quickly became apparent this wasn’t just normal low-level street crime,” said Mark Gavin, a senior detective leading the investigation for the Metropolitan Police. “This was on an industrial scale.” The breakthrough coincided with a broader push by the police to increase public confidence by tackling the city’s most common crimes. Phone theft has been the subject of particular anger among victims, who for years reported their cellphones stolen and handed the police the locations being transmitted, only to be given a crime reference number and hear nothing more. The police are now using that information to map where stolen phones are transported by street thieves. After the Heathrow seizure, a team of specialist investigators who normally deal with firearms and drug smuggling was assigned to the case. They identified further shipments and used forensics to identify two men in their 30s who are suspected of being ringleaders of a group that sent up to 40,000 stolen phones to China. When the men were arrested on Sept. 23, the car they were traveling in contained several phones, some wrapped in aluminum foil in an attempt to prevent them from transmitting tracking signals. At one point, the police said at a news conference, they observed the men buying almost 1.5 miles’ worth of foil in Costco. Some phones are reset and sold to new users in Britain. But many are shipped to China and Algeria as part of a “local-to-global criminal business model,” the police said, adding that in China, the newest phones could be sold for up to $5,000, generating huge profits for the criminals involved. Joss Wright, an associate professor at the University of Oxford who specializes in cybersecurity, said that it is easier to use stolen British phones in China than elsewhere because many of the country’s network providers do not subscribe to an international blacklist that bars devices that have been reported stolen. “That means that a stolen iPhone that has been blocked in the U.K. can be used without any problems in China,” Mr. Wright said. E-Bikes and Balaclavas The exporters are at the top of a three-tier criminal network, the police say. In the middle are the shopkeepers and entrepreneurs who buy stolen phones from thieves and sell them to unsuspecting members of the public or pass them on for transport abroad. On the lowest tier are the thieves. Their numbers have risen in line with the juicy profits on offer, and a growing sense of impunity. Overall crime in London has fallen in recent years , but phone theft is disproportionately high, representing about 70 percent of thefts last year. And it has risen sharply: The 80,000 phone thefts last year were a stark increase from the 64,000 in 2023, the police told a parliamentary committee in June. That is partly because this crime is both “very lucrative” and “lower risk” than car theft or drug dealing, Cmdr. Andrew Featherstone, the police officer leading the effort to tackle phone theft, told a news conference. Thieves can make up to £300 (about $400) per device — more than triple the national minimum wage for a day’s work. And they know they are unlikely to be caught. Police data shows about 106,000 phones were reported stolen in London from March 2024 to February 2025. Only 495 people were charged or were given a police caution, meaning they admitted to an offense. Of course, many other large cities, including New York, face phone theft. The police in London argue that varying crime recording practices make it impossible to identify where in the world the problem is worst. But many experts blame a specifically British issue: the impact of years of austerity imposed by Conservative-led governments in the 2010s, which led to cuts in the number of police officers and their budgets. In 2017, the Met said it would stop investigating low-level crimes where it judged there was little prospect of catching the culprits, so it could prioritize tackling serious violence and sexual offenses. Emmeline Taylor, a professor of criminology at City St. George’s, University of London, said in an interview that the police “became more of a reactive force,” adding, “Low-level career criminals realized that they were getting away with the crimes they were committing.” Then, a technological advance arrived that made their work even easier: electric bikes. Lime bikes, which can be rented and dropped off anywhere, launched in London in 2018. They exploded in popularity. Before long, e-bikes were the getaway vehicles of choice for phone thieves. Sgt. Matt Chantry, one of the leaders of the raid last month, said in an interview that thieves on e-bikes were “a real problem.” They mount sidewalks and swipe phones from people’s hands at high speed, he said, while making themselves “unidentifiable” by wearing balaclavas and hoods. “How do you police that?” he asked. Attempting to chase them on London’s sometimes gridlocked streets is “high-risk,” he said, endangering pedestrians, other drivers and the offender. Ultimately, he said, the police had to ask, is the risk of a fatality worth it for a cellphone? Lost and Found: 4,000 iPhones The raid on the three secondhand shops in north London last month paid off, with the police recovering £40,000 and five stolen phones. Those handsets will join around 4,000 other stolen iPhones recovered by the police since December, currently held in a storeroom in Putney, southwest London, as officers try to contact their owners. In the longer term, Commander Featherstone said, the police want to dismantle the criminal networks driving the illicit trade and “disincentivize criminals from wanting to steal phones” by making it clear they can be caught. But the police are also hoping users will become more savvy about their personal security. Even as smartphones have become more advanced and valuable, many people’s handling of them has become less protective. For the modern phone thief, a classic mark is a pedestrian walking close to the curb, deeply absorbed by the content on a cell screen — a map, a text, a video. “You wouldn’t count your money on the street,” said Lawrence Sherman, an emeritus criminology professor at the University of Cambridge. “But when the phone is worth £1,000, it’s like pulling £1,000 out of your wallet and looking at it as you walk.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/europe/london-police-phone-theft-china-gang.html,World,Washington Post,By Lizzie Dearden and Amelia Nierenberg,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16uk-phone-theft-01-vcmf/16uk-phone-theft-01-vcmf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T04:01:08+00:00,4a2afef45b54e354136ea5ed01bf39cae01aabc2
08f3dd5c9c85,"Raila Odinga, Champion of Kenyan Democracy and Former Prime Minister, Dies at 80","raila odinga, william ruto, kenya, politics, obituary","Raila Odinga, a towering figure in Kenyan politics who served as prime minister and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency five times, died on Wednesday while on a trip to India. He was 80. The Devamatha Hospital in Kerala, in southern India, said in a statement that Mr. Odinga died there after he collapsed during a morning walk. He had been treated for diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, the hospital said. A post-mortem examination was to be conducted. Mr. Odinga played a pivotal role in championing multiparty democracy in the 1990s, after multiple spells in detention without trial. He was a leader both inside and outside government, alternately holding ministerial posts and acting as an opposition figurehead for decades. As tributes from African leaders poured in, President William Ruto of Kenya announced the death in a televised address and declared seven days of national mourning as well as a state funeral. He described Mr. Odinga as a “colossus of Kenya’s modern politics, an indomitable warrior in our struggle for freedom and prosperity.” “In his passing, we have lost a patriot of uncommon courage,” he said, calling Mr. Odinga a pan-Africanist “who offered a compelling model of principled politics.” Mr. Odinga’s death leaves a void in Kenyan politics, given his role as the principal challenger to successive governments. In the short term, it could strengthen the hand of Mr. Ruto, Mr. Odinga’s one-time political nemesis, who will be up for re-election in 2027. Mr. Odinga was first treated at an ayurvedic hospital in Kerala five days earlier, a local police official said. On Wednesday, doctors performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation there before he was transferred to Devamatha, where he was pronounced dead about two hours later, the hospital said. “He was by far the most consequential political actor in Kenya over the last 30 years,” said John Githongo, a prominent anticorruption campaigner who supported Mr. Odinga’s 2022 election bid. “For a long time, Raila was the center of gravity in Kenya’s particular brand of often brutal elite politics.” His death is likely to bring “major realignments with quite a bit of head-spinning developments” in Kenyan politics, Mr. Githongo added. Thousands of people poured onto the streets in Kisumu, the city in western Kenya that was Mr. Odinga’s political stronghold and home to many members of his Luo ethnic group. Some waved tree branches as a sign of mourning, while others blew whistles or honked car and motorbike horns. “The death of Raila is the death of a hero,” said Jacob Otieno Akach, 75, who lives in the city. “His work toward development and democracy is evident and shall live beyond him.” Mr. Odinga was regularly referred to by his first name, and in later years he also became known as “Baba,” which means father in Kiswahili. In a statement , Mr. Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement party called him “a true giant of the nation.” A delegation led by the party’s secretary general, Senator Edwin Sifuna, was traveling to India to retrieve Mr. Odinga’s body. Speaking from the airport in Nairobi, Mr. Sifuna said it was “too early” to consider who might succeed Mr. Odinga as party leader. Mr. Odinga’s career tracked the twists of Kenya’s transition from autocratic and, for several years, single-party rule into one of Africa’s leading democracies. Born in western Kenya, he was a scion of one of the country’s most important political families. His father, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga , was a leading figure in the struggle for independence from Britain and served as vice president under Kenya’s founding leader, Jomo Kenyatta. In the early part of his career, Mr. Odinga cultivated a reputation as an anti-establishment politician, in part through his willingness to defy the police and lead mass demonstrations and also because of his popularity in the poorest parts of Nairobi. He played a leading role in a campaign for a new Kenyan constitution that was adopted in 2010. Mr. Odinga’s determination to become president made him a pillar of national politics. His failed attempts to achieve that goal frustrated progressives who sought to reform the country’s democratic institutions amid sometimes violent elections and the stubborn grip of ethnic considerations on national politics. But his reputation as an opposition firebrand was tempered in recent years by compromises with those in power, most notably a deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018, known as “the handshake.” That ushered in a period of political cohabitation that effectively neutered the opposition. The terms of “the handshake” were never made public. But critics said Mr. Odinga had put his ambition before his principals. In 2022, Mr. Kenyatta backed Mr. Odinga to succeed him. But Mr. Odinga lost his fifth presidential bid in an election that Mr. Ruto eventually won. Mr. Odinga’s early political outlook was influenced by a spell in Eastern Europe. In the 1960s, he won a scholarship to study in communist East Germany, which cultivated ties with many African nations through education. Mr. Odinga named his first son Fidel, after the Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Following a failed coup attempt in 1982 against President Daniel arap Moi, Mr. Odinga was arrested and charged with treason. He was beaten while in custody and spent six years in detention without trial. After his release, he helped lead protests that spurred a return to multiparty democracy in Kenya. The country joined other African states that were turning their backs on single-party rule after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Kenya’s first multiparty election was held in 1992, and Mr. Odinga’s father ran and lost. Mr. Odinga himself first ran for president five years later and came in third, behind Mr. Moi. He finally gained political power when he became prime minister in April 2008 , under a deal that helped bring calm after post-election violence killed more than 1,000 people . Mr. Odinga was the main challenger in the 2007 election but the incumbent, Mwai Kibaki, was declared the winner in a contest that many viewed as rigged. Mr. Odinga’s decision to enter government enabled Mr. Kibaki to retain the presidency, a fact that was galling to many supporters of the opposition leader. Mr. Odinga was prime minister for five years and ran for president again in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Each time he lost and declared that the result had been rigged. In 2017, Kenya’s Supreme Court ordered the election to be rerun , saying it had failed to meet democratic standards. Mr. Odinga lost again, but the court decision was hailed as a landmark and a validation of his criticisms. In his later years, Mr. Odinga came to be viewed by many Kenyan progressives as part of the elite. Few of the Gen-Z protesters that have electrified Kenya since last year with calls for wholesale reform have cited Mr. Odinga as their champion. For all that, Mr. Odinga’s prominence over successive decades helped him gain stature across Africa, a continent where political longevity commands respect. Backed by Mr. Ruto, Mr. Odinga bid this year to become chairman of the African Union, a leadership election he hoped to finally win. But in a vote in February, he was defeated by the foreign minister of Djibouti, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf. Among those offering condolences on Wednesday was President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, who called Mr. Odinga a “patriotic and selfless leader.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India called Mr. Odinga “a towering statesman and a cherished friend of India” in a statement posted on social media. Mr. Modi said Mr. Odinga had admired “the traditional medicine systems of India” since one of his daughters, Rosemary, traveled to the same ayurvedic hospital in Kerala for treatment. Mr. Odinga is survived by his wife, Ida, and three children. His eldest son, Fidel, died in 2015.

3b8f4b9e9cd9,Putin Welcomes the New Syrian Leader While Still Harboring the Old One,"international relations, ahmed al-shara, vladimir putin, bashar al-assad, russia, syria","President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia welcomed President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria for talks at the Kremlin on Wednesday, a remarkable scene in a country that is harboring the new Syrian leader’s toppled predecessor and enemy, Bashar al-Assad. The meeting demonstrated a clear desire by both the Russian and Syrian leaders to open a new chapter in relations between Moscow and Damascus. During Syria’s 13-year civil war, Mr. Putin backed Mr. al-Assad but ultimately failed to prop him up when Mr. al-Shara’s rebel forces stormed Damascus in December. For Mr. al-Shara, a former Qaeda operative who for years led his rebel forces under brutal Russian airstrikes in Syria, the meeting marked a clear victory. Despite having backed Mr. al-Assad in the war, Mr. Putin welcomed Mr. al-Shara in a gilded Kremlin hall, a calculated gesture as Moscow looks to retain its longstanding military bases in Syria. The summit also demonstrated Mr. Putin’s agility as a geopolitical tactician and his willingness to shift messaging drastically to suit Russia’s interests. Mr. Putin, like American leaders, for years denounced Mr. al-Shara’s rebel faction as a terrorist group. But in opening remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Putin elided that history and underscored decades of friendly relations between Moscow and Damascus, dating back to 1944. “During this time, relations between Syria and Russia have always been exclusively friendly,” Mr. Putin said. “We in Russia have never had any relations with Syria that were tied to our political circumstances or special interests. Throughout these decades, we have always been guided by one thing: the interests of the Syrian people.” Mr. al-Shara thanked the Russian leader for welcoming him to Moscow and expressed an openness to reboot relations between their nations. “We are working to restore and define the nature of this relationship in a new way,” Mr. al-Shara said. He added that Russia would play a role in the development of postwar Syria, describing a “long historic relationship” between the nations defined by “common interests.” He noted that a large part of Syria’s energy sector depended on Russian expertise. The Syrian leader said that Damascus respected agreements signed with Moscow, without specifically mentioning the military bases. After having fought against Russian forces for years, Mr. al-Shara has been trying to neutralize external threats to Syria while his government attempts to consolidate control over a nation still fractured by years of war. The talks at the Kremlin lasted more than two and a half hours. Alexander Novak, Russia’s deputy prime minister, told Russian media that the officials discussed the delivery of humanitarian aid, medicines and wheat, as well as projects in the energy, transport and tourism sectors. Mr. Novak said that Russia was prepared to help develop Syria’s oil fields. Ahead of the talks, Mr. Putin congratulated him on the parliamentary elections that Syria held this month, the first elections in the nation since Mr. Assad’s ouster. “This is a great success for you, as it leads to the consolidation of society,” Mr. Putin said. “Despite Syria currently going through difficult times, it will nevertheless strengthen ties and interaction between all political forces in Syria.” The meeting between the two leaders came in place of a broader summit between Russia and Arab nations. That meeting was scrapped as leaders instead converged on Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for a conference devoted to ending the war in Gaza. Mr. Putin was supposed to have welcomed an array of leaders from the Middle East to Moscow this week. Mr. al-Shara is turning to Moscow for assistance in his efforts to rebuild his nation and consolidate control. A Kurdish-led militia backed by the United States still holds much of northeast Syria, and militias from the Druse minority have maintained power over one southern province. That has complicated Mr. al-Shara’s desire to unify Syria under his government. Mr. al-Shara’s bid to strengthen his relationship with Moscow also reflects his approach so far on the international stage. He has sought to strengthen his government’s ties to other nations, even engaging in talks with Israel , once Syria’s sworn enemy. Anton Mardasov, a Russian military affairs expert, said that the Russian authorities wanted to maintain their air bases and port access in Syria, the only country in the Middle East where the Kremlin has a permanent military footprint. Moscow has used the Hmeimim Air Base in Syria as a logistics hub for Russian operations in Africa. Mr. Mardasov said that Mr. al-Shara was likely to press Moscow to extradite Mr. al-Assad to Syria for domestic political reasons, knowing that Mr. Putin was unlikely to agree. Despite harboring Mr. al-Assad, Mr. Putin had lost patience with the deposed Syrian leader. As the regime was collapsing, Russia made no move to intervene after using its military to help keep Mr. Assad in power for almost a decade. Russia held back partly because it was distracted by its own war in Ukraine. But the Kremlin had also wearied of Mr. Assad’s dogmatic refusal to engage with the Syrian opposition to try to bring the civil war to an end, according to diplomats and Syria analysts.

b8551f0e1f7a,Afghanistan and Pakistan Announce Cease-Fire After a Week of Deadly Clashes,"war;armed conflicts, terrorism, international relations, afghanistan, pakistan","Afghanistan and Pakistan announced a cease-fire between their militaries on Wednesday, in a bid to defuse tensions after a week of incendiary rhetoric and deadly clashes along their border threatened to spill into a broader conflict. The cease-fire, announced by both governments, took effect hours after at least 12 Afghan people were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in fighting near the two main border crossings between the two countries. In a statement, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said both sides would respect a 48-hour cease-fire and favor dialogue. Afghanistan also “instructed all its forces to observe the cease-fire,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Afghan government, said in a similar statement. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have dropped in recent weeks to their lowest point since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. On Sunday, Afghan forces attacked Pakistani military outposts along the border in what they said was retaliation for airstrikes in Afghanistan last week that Kabul has blamed on Pakistan. Both sides claimed dozens of casualties; they stopped fighting after Qatar and Saudi Arabia urged restraint. But border crossings have since remained closed, and in the early hours of Wednesday fighting erupted again near the two main border crossings between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both sides accused each other of attacking first. Mr. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said a Pakistani attack that included artillery had killed 12 people and wounded 100 others. Pakistan’s military said it had responded to an Afghan attack. The fighting took place in the Spin Boldak border area of southern Afghanistan and central Pakistan, according to Pakistani and Afghan officials, and near the Torkham border crossing, hundreds of miles north. Residents on the Afghan side of the border in Spin Boldak said in telephone interviews that explosions and the sound of heavy artillery had woken them in the middle of the night. The fighting later reached the area’s border crossing point and a market, sending residents fleeing to nearby Kandahar, one of Afghanistan’s largest cities and the residence of the country’s leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada. Noorullah Khatab, a construction engineer in Spin Boldak, said he had heard explosions around 3 a.m. and had rushed back to his home in Kandahar later in the morning, when he saw dozens of ambulances transporting the wounded from the border to the city. “The firing continued until morning,” he said. “I couldn’t sleep at all.” The Pakistani military also accused Afghan forces of attacking Pakistani border posts near the Torkham border crossing, in the northern Pakistani region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. But a spokesman for the governor’s office of Khost Province in Afghanistan, on the other side of the border, accused Pakistani forces of opening fire in the early hours of Wednesday. The spokesman, Mustaghfir Gurbaz, accused Pakistani forces of killing a journalist and injuring another from Afghanistan’s public broadcaster hours after the fighting stopped. The fighting on Wednesday further escalated tensions that began last week when at least two explosions rocked Kabul’s downtown and an airstrike hit a market near the border, according to Afghan officials who accused Pakistan of violating Afghanistan’s sovereignty and striking at the border. Pakistan has neither publicly confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attacks. A Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t allowed to discuss the ongoing tensions publicly, said on Wednesday that Pakistan had carried out strikes in the provinces of Kandahar and Kabul against Afghanistan’s military and the leaders of an armed group fighting in Pakistan’s Balochistan Province. The Afghan army attacked Pakistani border posts on Saturday, killing at least 23 soldiers and injuring 29 others, according to the Pakistani military. The Taliban government, which said it had carried out the attacks in response to the strikes days earlier, said nine Afghan soldiers had died and at least 16 others had been injured. Pakistan has accused the Taliban government of harboring militant groups that have killed hundreds of Pakistani security forces in recent years. Afghanistan has denied the accusations, even as many analysts, including independent United Nations experts, have pointed out that the banned group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the T.T.P. or Pakistani Taliban , has received financial support from the Afghan government, and that its militants have trained freely in Afghanistan.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/asia/clashes-afghanistan-pakistan.html,World,Washington Post,By Yaqoob Akbary and Safiullah Padshah,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15afgaistan-pakistan-clashes-01-hktc/15afgaistan-pakistan-clashes-01-hktc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T13:19:53+00:00,f0563664efd084bf3eed5cf57812ebb23a0a13b9
c3682fb2224c,A Repressive Russian Ally Feels a Mysterious Thaw From the U.S.,"political prisoner, international relations, russian invasion of ukraine (2022), us foreign policy, keith kellogg, aleksandr g lukashenko, donald trump, belarus, us","When he was first put into the crimson-colored cell with padded walls, Mikola Dziadok thought that his Belarusian jailers had found a new way of tormenting him. Soon he was whisked into a van with other political prisoners at the central K.G.B. prison in Minsk, the capital. They were ordered not to look out the windows as the vehicle sped down a highway, past the well-kept pastures of northwestern Belarus and across the border into Lithuania. Suddenly, the van stopped by the side of the road. The doors flung open, and a man addressed them. “Hi, I am John Coale,” the man said, according to Mr. Dziadok. “President Trump sent me to free you all.” Mr. Coale, a Trump administration envoy, had helped broker the release of 52 Belarusian political prisoners. His appearance in the country last month was the latest chapter in the United States’ unlikely rapprochement with Belarus, an autocratic Eastern European country that is a client state of Russia, which sees itself as fighting a war against the West . Ties between the United States and Belarus have been in a deep freeze for years because of Belarus’s political repression and its assistance in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There is no public indication that the administration is pushing Belarus to change course on either of these issues, and analysts say it is unclear what the United States hopes to get out of the thaw. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment. Mikola Dziadok was freed last month after spending a total of almost 10 years in prison for his antigovernment activity. Credit... Petras Malukas/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Keith Kellogg, special envoy to Russia and Ukraine — and Mr. Coale’s boss — has said that the administration wants to make Belarus a conduit for messages to Russia as Mr. Trump tries to bring peace in Ukraine. Mr. Kellogg described the prisoner releases as an unexpected side benefit, though they have given Mr. Trump a chance to burnish his humanitarian credentials. Mr. Coale has framed the diplomacy as reflecting Mr. Trump’s open-arms approach to adversaries that want to discuss normalizing relations. Mr. Trump has shown a particular affinity for strongmen like Belarus’s longtime ruler, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko , whom he has called a “highly respected” and “powerful” president. In most of the West, Mr. Lukashenko is reviled as a dictator who continues to run a police state and arrest political opponents, with more than 1,200 still in prison. For Belarus, analysts say, the warming relations are an easy win for Mr. Lukashenko. He has won concessions from the United States, including the lifting of sanctions on the Belarusian national airline, which some analysts say could benefit both Belarus and Russia. Closer U.S. ties could also serve as a hedge for Belarus as its economic lifeblood, Russia, suffers a slowdown. The rapprochement presents a quandary for current and former Belarusian prisoners, their advocates and political activists in exile. They want more prisoners freed and acknowledge that will happen only through talks with Mr. Lukashenko. But they worry that the U.S. diplomacy will strengthen him, making political change in Belarus even more remote. When Mr. Dziadok, 37, was freed last month after spending a total of almost 10 years in prison for his antigovernment activity, he was euphoric. “I was shouting, ‘God bless America,’” he said in an interview in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was taken after being released. “I was so happy. At that moment, I loved the whole American administration.” He quickly added, “But only for that moment.” Releasing Mr. Dziadok and the dozens of others was a “huge humanitarian win for the American administration,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Belarusian political analyst at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. Yet the diplomacy could be described as “exchanging hostages for goodies,” he said, calling it a “very, very big and hard moral question.” Sergei Antusevich, a former labor union leader in Belarus who was released from prison last year, was blunter. “This deal actually encouraged human trafficking,” Mr. Antusevich said. “People were actually sold for Boeing parts and aircraft maintenance.” The Trump administration is renewing a normalization effort that came to a halt in 2020, when Mr. Lukashenko, aided by Mr. Putin, suppressed protests against what Western governments called a sham election that kept the Lukashenko regime in power. Two years later, the freeze deepened when the Belarusian leader allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine. Signs of a turn in U.S. policy emerged shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January, when a top State Department official, Christopher W. Smith, traveled to Minsk . Mr. Coale and his boss Mr. Kellogg have since made several trips to Belarus, carrying gifts like a letter from Mr. Trump and White House cuff links. In addition to announcing the lifting of sanctions against the Belarusian airline Belavia last month, Mr. Coale expressed hope of reopening the U.S. Embassy in Minsk, which closed days after the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. The Trump administration has brokered at least three releases of Belarusian political prisoners, numbering nearly 70 in all, though many prominent figures remain incarcerated. Many of those freed and sent into exile have been stripped of their Belarusian passports. Deprived of adequate food and care, some have emerged from prison in poor condition, including the opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky, who lost 132 pounds while behind bars. Mr. Antusevich, the former labor union leader who was released last year, recounted a meeting with a fellow activist, Aleksandr Yarashuk, after Mr. Yarashuk was freed last month. He said that when he embraced Mr. Yarashuk, it felt as if he were hugging “half a person, because there are just bones left.” The day before Mr. Yarashuk and the others were released, a political prisoner died in detention , the ninth in five years, according to Viasna, a human rights watchdog whose founder, Ales Bialitski , is also in jail. To some observers, Washington’s policy has rewarded Mr. Lukashenko without forcing him to address any of the issues that caused the relationship to crumble in the first place. Mr. Lukashenko remains “a co-belligerent in a war that Russia itself has said it is waging against the West,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and a former British ambassador to Belarus. Minsk has “performed every kind of service for Russia in this war except contributing its own troops,” he added. Mr. Gould-Davies also noted that Moscow, which has faced intensifying Western sanctions, including on its aviation industry, could benefit if Belarus grew closer to the United States. “It’s clear why Lukashenko wants this, considering he’s given away nothing of significance and begun to gain things, which will also put him in Russia’s good books,” Mr. Gould-Davies said. “The puzzle is not why Lukashenko is doing this, but why Trump is,” he added. According to Mr. Gould-Davies, the lifting of sanctions on the Belarusian airline could give Russia access to urgently needed spare parts for its aircraft, as well as servicing and maintenance. But aviation experts said they doubted that Mr. Lukashenko would make such transfers because of the penalties he could face for violating sanctions on Russia. Mr. Lukashenko has said his goal is “full normalization of relations” with the United States, especially in the fields of “politics, economy, trade.” Some observers argue that he is trying to win back room for maneuvering after becoming fully dependent on Russia in 2020 and that it would be pragmatic for Western countries to engage with him and try to change his behavior. Years of Western sanctions, including on Belarus’s banks and mineral exports, have only made the country into what Valery Kavaleuski, a former Belarusian diplomat now in exile, “a threat to international peace and security.” Yauheni Preiherman, director of the Minsk Dialogue Council on International Relations, a group seen as close to the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, said the sanctions had pushed Belarus to retaliate in the security and humanitarian spheres, including by sending migrants toward the borders with Poland , Lithuania and Latvia. Mr. Preiherman said that Mr. Lukashenko was eager not to be “forgotten” in any peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, to ensure that if sanctions were lifted on Moscow they were also lifted on Minsk. He also noted that Belarus had contended with economic strains after an initial lift from its assistance to Russia’s war effort. Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians have emigrated, causing labor shortages. Still, Mr. Lukashenko has some cards to play. As repeated Russian drone incursions sow alarm in Europe, analysts say he is using the moment to remind the West that his country is the only thing standing geographically between European countries and Russia. Mr. Lukashenko also sees leverage, analysts say, in the fact that Belarus will be a key in maintaining any peace in Ukraine, with whom it shares a 650-mile border. Mr. Gould-Davies, the analyst and former ambassador, said that Russia would see weakness in the United States’ dealings with Belarus. “Russia will be taking note,” he said, “of how much America is giving away in return for how little.” Tomas Dapkus contributed reporting from Vilnius.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/europe/belarus-us-trump-russia.html,World,Washington Post,By Valerie Hopkins,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15int-belarus-us-kflc/15int-belarus-us-kflc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:01:04+00:00,a747b4219e77283aeb0cccf1254e151ffdf2baeb
13cf93843979,China Got Trump’s Attention but Renewed a Risky Game of Chicken,"international relations, us foreign policy, embargoes sanctions, asia-pacific economic cooperation, commerce department, communist party of china, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us, internal-open-access-from-nl","China’s decision to tighten export controls on rare earth metals was not only about strengthening its grip on the world’s supply of the crucial minerals. It was also a high-stakes ploy to jolt President Trump into paying attention to what Beijing felt were attempts by his subordinates to sabotage a U.S.-China détente, analysts say. Evidently, it worked: Mr. Trump has redirected his focus toward trade with China. But China’s move also unnerved governments and businesses in Europe , and sparked another round of tit-for-tat trade blows, rattling stock markets. Days after Mr. Trump said he would impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods next month, China added five American subsidiaries of a South Korean shipping company to its sanctions list. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil. By Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the U.S. government would counter Chinese economic measures by exerting more control over private American businesses in key strategic sectors. The escalating tensions threaten to wipe out any progress the two sides have made in the past five months to roll back punitive measures they had taken against each other. They also raise the question of whether Beijing pushed its strategy too far by making clear that China will use the minerals as a geopolitical weapon. China was reacting to a Sept. 29 decision by the U.S. Department of Commerce to expand the number of companies, including potentially Chinese ones, blacklisted from acquiring American technology. That move surprised Beijing, which thought the countries had reached a truce in their trade war after four rounds of negotiations and a Sept. 19 phone call between Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, and Mr. Trump, Chinese analysts said. Flexing China’s control over rare earths — akin to poking Mr. Trump in the eye — may also have been intended by Mr. Xi to demonstrate his strength to a domestic audience before a crucial meeting of Communist Party leaders next week. “If you are the leader and you just had a phone conversation” with the U.S. president, “and then 10 days later, they slapped you on your face, what would you do ahead of a major political event?” said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. Chinese state media have hailed rare earths as the ultimate weapon in trade negotiations with the United States, with one television commentator saying the restrictions dealt a “fatal blow.” Analysts who have spoken to Chinese officials said that Beijing believed that the Commerce Department move — which would target thousands of Chinese companies — was the work of hawkish members of the Trump administration. The sense in Beijing was that Mr. Trump, who was focused on Gaza peace talks and the U.S. government shutdown, needed to be made aware of the consequences of these moves. “By launching a very strong counterattack on the U.S. side, Beijing is reminding Donald Trump that you have to take a hands-on approach to relations with China” and not let “hawkish people” derail relations between the two countries, Prof. Wu said. Beijing was particularly aggrieved because it felt it had shown good will to the Trump administration by agreeing to allow the sale of TikTok , the analysts said. The question now is whether Beijing’s gambit will succeed in getting the Trump administration to back down, or if it results in a full-blown trade war that could lead to a global slowdown. Already, it has led to a broader backlash, with the European Union trade commissioner accusing China of weaponizing its hold on the minerals and urging the European bloc to coordinate with Group of 7 nations to push back against the restrictions. “The Chinese miscalculated,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington, who is currently visiting Beijing. “People around the world saw the rules and were shocked and considered it an overreaction.” For China, threatening to cut off access to its rare earth minerals has been its ace card against the United States. Beijing controls most of the world’s supply of those metals, which are needed for virtually every modern-day technology , including semiconductors, robots and jets. Earlier this year, the same tactic helped persuade the Trump administration to suspend its threat to impose sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods. But this time, China went a step further. It extended its controls extraterritorially, meaning that exporters anywhere in the world would have to apply for a license to sell products with even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths. It is probably not a coincidence that China is taking such an assertive posture ahead of a Communist Party meeting to lay out the blueprint for the country’s plan for the coming five years. Chinese leaders typically want to project stability and strength during the meetings to burnish their legitimacy, analysts say. “You have to respond strongly so that you can — I wouldn’t say save face — but you have to consolidate your political position and show to a domestic audience that you are strong enough to protect China’s national interests in the face of the provocation,” Prof. Wu added. With tensions heating up again, it is unclear if Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi will meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month, as had been anticipated. Both sides continued to up the ante in the past week. They began charging higher port entry fees for each other’s shipping firms. The Chinese government blacklisted five American subsidiaries of the South Korean shipping company Hanwha, accusing the subsidiaries of “supporting and assisting” the United States in its moves in the shipbuilding industry. Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that Beijing was harming American soybean farmers. He threatened to restrict more trade with China, including by boycotting Chinese cooking oil. U.S. analysts say that the Chinese Ministry of Commerce appeared to be aware that it may have overreached, as the ministry sought to reassure the world that the new controls would not be used widely and did not represent a blanket ban, even as it vowed to fight back against any tariffs. China was overly confident that it could get Washington to walk back its latest sanctions and, at the same time, avert any global blowback, analysts said. But China can ill afford more trade tensions on top of its existing troubles with the United States. Exports are among the few engines of growth for a Chinese economy suffering from a prolonged property crisis and a deflationary spiral, caused by overproduction in key industries and falling prices. Evan S. Medeiros, a professor of Asian studies at Georgetown University who was an Asia adviser to President Barack Obama, said China could have pushed back without threatening economic coercion against its geopolitical rivals. “This is a hell of a way to get Trump’s attention,” Prof. Medeiros said. “You get somebody’s attention by waving your hands in the air, not by arming yourself to the teeth and just promising you’re not going to use a 50-caliber machine gun on them.” The new rare earths export controls, which are modeled after U.S. export controls, were likely developed well in advance of their unveiling, experts said. Some analysts say that suggests Beijing was merely looking for a pretext — like the new Commerce Department rules — to deploy the new measures. “Xi fundamentally doesn’t want to give the U.S. rare earths, or really any ‘strategic materials’ it has,” said Kirsten Asdal, head of the China-focused consultancy firm Asdal Advisory. “The party has articulated that the country that controls the upstream inputs will enjoy the ability to develop the most advanced technology and keep it from others.” Lily Kuo contributed reporting from Taipei, Taiwan, and Berry Wang from Hong Kong.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/asia/china-trump-tariffs.html,World,Washington Post,By David Pierson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15int-china-us-analysis-btqc/15int-china-us-analysis-btqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T15:12:42+00:00,05c55b6a799826ed405e06a47515369cfc63c107
a7a7fe99ad13,A Photographer Who Brought a Vanished Central European Jewry to Life,"holocaust and nazis, judaism, archives, personal profile;people story, audio recordings, downloads and streaming, photography, edward serotta, united states holocaust memorial museum, vienna, eastern europe, central europe","Edward Serotta glided around the room of Holocaust survivors and their families like an impresario, checking that they had enough food and drink and company. He sat with some, patted others on the back, endured some kisses and made sure that this monthly meeting at Vienna’s Jewish community center went smoothly, even as Viennese police kept guard outside, just in case. About 80 people came to this pre-Rosh Hashanah gathering last month of Café Centropa, an outgrowth of Mr. Serotta’s singular project and achievement: Centropa , the nonprofit he built to document vanished Jewish life in Central and Eastern Europe. With the help of dozens of researchers and his countless trips to the region, Mr. Serotta and Centropa created a digital archive of 1,230 interviews conducted in 20 European countries, totaling some 45,000 pages of testimony. The archive includes more than 25,000 photographs. “And every one of them comes with a story,” Mr. Serotta said. “The Holocaust is mankind’s single greatest crime, and while there are witnesses to it, those stories should be told and recorded. But there is another chapter, one in which every one of these people had compelling lives before and after.” It was in Vienna that he found money for Centropa, partly from the Culture Ministry and partly from Hannah M. Lessing, managing director of Austria’s Holocaust restitution agency. “We immediately took to each other — we knew what we wanted to do for the survivors,” Ms. Lessing said. “As one survivor said, and this links me to Ed, ‘Everyone always asked how we died. No one asks us how we lived.’” Philipp G. Kornreich, 93, has lived one of those extraordinary lives. Born in Vienna, he fled with his parents to Riga in 1938. When the Nazis came there, the family was sent by the Soviets to a poor collective farm in the semidesert in Kazakhstan. It was only in 1947 that he was allowed to return to Vienna, after eight weeks on trains, before ultimately becoming a professor of electrical engineering at Syracuse University. Now living back in Vienna — “two blocks from where I started,” he said — he comes to Café Centropa to participate in “this nice Jewish community, which is now very small.” Rita Dauber was also there. Her parents were born in Poland, in Czernowitz, now Chernivtsi in Ukraine, and survived the war. “Until the end of their lives, they always refused to speak about it,” she said. “For most of these people, their lives are a book. And Ed helped them to tell it.” Later that evening, Mr. Serotta headed to Odesa, where he would run a workshop for Ukrainian teachers on how to use Centropa’s educational materials in a country at war. He then went to Bohdanivka, in eastern Ukraine, where in 1941-42, Romanian troops, after taking Odesa, killed up to 54,000 Jews. Mr. Serotta, with curly gray hair, a badly repaired retina and a bit of a limp, allows that he may be getting slightly long in the tooth for such an unrelenting schedule. “The whole idea of a 76-year-old, half-blind gay man with a bad leg traveling around a war zone looking for cities where Jewish writers lived seems a bit crazy,” he conceded. But he doesn’t much care. He was born into a small Jewish community in Savannah, Ga. where his father ran a credit jewelry store — “$5 down and $5 a week,” Mr. Serotta said. There were no books in the house, but his father, George, would take his son every weekend to watch the ships that came into the port. His father would call up to sailors, asking if he could bring his son aboard to take a tour. Once, Mr. Serotta remembered, there was an Israeli ship, the Shalom, and his father brought one of the sailors home to a Sabbath dinner. It all created a wanderlust in him, he said, “just the fantasy of travel.” After a move to Tennessee and unhappily studying marketing at the University of Tennessee, Mr. Serotta moved to Los Angeles, worked on the margins of the music industry and developed an abiding interest in photography. He got married for four years, then divorced and later came out as gay. He moved to Atlanta in 1980, sold office supplies and was miserable, taking solace in European writers from behind the Iron Curtain whom Philip Roth had championed. So he took off to Prague, Vienna and Budapest, selling freelance articles about the failed anti-Communist uprisings and an Austria unrepentant about the Nazis. By 1986 he found himself in Budapest, then Yugoslavia and Romania. There was enough of a market for his freelance work to keep him going, and “then I started photographing Jews,” he said, earning him a 300-page file from the Romanian secret police, the Securitate, who suspected he was a Western agent, stirring up trouble in what had been a fiercely antisemitic nation. In early 1988, he sold everything he owned in Atlanta, except his books, and never returned to America. He moved to Budapest, where he started the work that led to Centropa, publishing a first book of photographs of Jewish life, “ Out of the Shadows ,” then to Prague, Berlin and finally Vienna. He also covered the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, then reported on the Bosnian Serb siege of Sarajevo in the early 1990s. But it was the tales of vanished and vanishing Jewish life that captivated Mr. Serotta, and no one was documenting it, he said. “In every one of these countries, there were fascinating stories of rediscovery and self-discovery, and I got to be there to document them,” he said. The Centropa archive has now been acquired by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as part of its permanent collection. “It’s an incredible resource that helps fill out our understanding of Central and Eastern Europe,” said Zachary Paul Levine, director of curatorial affairs at the museum. As a graduate student, Mr. Levine said, “I often turned to Centropa and found testimonies that helped me understand what life was like on the ground.” The way that “Ed has mixed personal documents and testimonies with photos and context made it very rewarding to me.” Back at the community center in Vienna, Tanja Eckstein described how she ended up working for Centropa. Her father, born in 1905, was Jewish and survived Dachau after his parents were murdered, but “he wouldn’t tell me anything,” she said. “He was very traumatized and refused to come to Vienna,” making a solitary life in East Berlin. “I was interested in Jewish history because I had no family,” she said. In Vienna’s small Jewish community, she heard about Mr. Serotta and his quixotic interest in those who survived the Holocaust and their memories of their lives and villages. “I told my story to him,” she said. “And he gave me a big microphone and a cassette recorder and said, ‘Go for it.’” Ms. Eckstein conducted 71 interviews in the region. “You get close to these people,” she said. When they asked when they would see her again,“Ed said, ‘Let’s get everyone together, all the interviewees.’” The first meeting in 2006 was attended by the American, British and Israeli ambassadors. “Then Ed said, ‘Let’s do it every month.’” So was born Café Centropa, attended this evening by Kitty Schrott, 90, a Holocaust survivor and now a widow. “It’s wonderful to meet friends, to meet Jews,” she said, “and not stay at home and get sad.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/europe/edward-serotta-centropa-holocaust-testimonies.html,World,Washington Post,By Steven Erlanger,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15Int-vienna-serotta-profile-01-lfht/15Int-vienna-serotta-profile-01-lfht-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T09:01:18+00:00,d464cd2304d6154f2eb2513e49834c0b0bcb9f0c
fad10b5b8c84,"A Major Automaker, in a Nod to Trump, Shifts Production From Canada to the U.S.","tariff, cars, manufacturing, jobs, us foreign policy, stellantis, unifor, mark carney, antonio filosa, doug jr ford, donald trump, brampton, ontario, canada, ontario, us, internal-open-access-from-nl","Stellantis, the giant automaker, is abandoning plans to reopen a factory in Canada and is shifting production to the United States, a move that deals a blow to a key Canadian industry and reflects the fallout from President Trump’s tariff policy. The decision is part of a $13 billion, four-year investment announced by Stellantis on Tuesday to significantly ramp up production in the United States. Antonio Filosa, Stellantis’s chief executive, said the plans follow “very productive talks with the Trump administration” and described the deal as the largest investment in the company’s 100-year history in the United States. Stellantis had been planning to produce its Jeep Compass vehicle at a plant in Brampton, Ontario, west of Toronto. The company closed the factory in 2023 and laid off its roughly 3,000 workers as it retooled the facility, but now the fate of those employees is unclear. Stellantis, which owns more than a dozen brands, said it would instead make the vehicle at a plant in Illinois that had also been idle since 2023, creating 5,000 new jobs. Mr. Trump, who has imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canadian autos, has said he wants to move vehicle production back to the United States to help revive manufacturing and provide more jobs for Americans. The tariffs he applied would likely make it too expensive to produce cars in Canada, Mr. Trump said during a meeting in May with Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada. “We don’t really want cars from Canada.” Stellantis’s decision underscores the challenge Canada faces because — unlike other countries — it has been unable to negotiate a trade deal with the Trump administration and tariffs can inflict heavy damage on an economy that dependent on exports to the United States. Mr. Carney said the move by Stellantis was “a direct consequence of current U.S. tariffs.” He said his government was “focused on what we can control,” pointing to recent economic relief strategies, including a 5 billion Canadian dollar, or $3.6 billion, emergency fund for industries hardest hit by tariffs. Canadian officials have tried to make the case to U.S. officials that the auto industries in both countries are deeply integrated, with parts moving back and forth across the border multiple times as part of the assembly of vehicles. Dominic LeBlanc, the minister managing relations with the Trump administration, is in Washington this week to continue trade talks. The levies are also adversely affecting other automakers. In May, Honda announced that it would move the manufacturing of its CR-V sport utility vehicle to the United States from Alliston, Ontario, and postpone plans for electric vehicle and battery production. General Motors has also stopped the production of electric delivery vehicles in Ingersoll, Ontario, and cut a shift at a plant that produces pickup trucks in Oshawa, Ontario. “Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Lana Payne, the president of Unifor, the union that represents autoworkers, said in a statement. In 2022, the federal and Ontario governments allocated 1 billion Canadian dollars, or $712 million, to help Stellantis upgrade its plants, including its Brampton facility. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, who has become one of Canada’s staunchest defenders against Mr. Trump , said his government has not released any financing to Stellantis for the Brampton plant. “Stellantis has a duty to live up to their promise to Brampton autoworkers,” Mr. Ford said in a statement. After the Brampton factory shut down in 2023, Stellantis officials at the time promised that it would reopen and the company would fulfill its commitments to the community. Another union official said it would fight to ensure the company honors that promise. Flavio Volpe, the president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, a trade group, accused Stellantis of bending to Mr. Trump’s will. It is imperative for Canada, Mr. Volpe said, to respond to the company’s decision and “to hold them accountable, to get a new product in that plant, to not let them off the hook and feel bad for them because they got bullied by the White House.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/canada/stellantis-auto-production-canada-us-trump-tariffs.html,World,Washington Post,By Vjosa Isai,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/15int-canada-stellantis/05canada-tariffs-pbtv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:09:09+00:00,879257bc26ab6989f5d437bd29c21617ffd1a38b
a6e624dd1d20,Iran Sentences 2 French Citizens to Prison on Spying Charges,"iran, france, political prisoner, international relations, jean-noël barrot, tehran, europe","A court in Iran has convicted two French citizens of spying and given them heavy prison sentences, Iranian authorities said on Tuesday, in a case that has been a longstanding source of tensions between France and Iran. The Fars news agency, which is affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, identified the two defendants as Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, who have been held in Iran since 2022 on charges that France has called baseless. The Mizan news agency, which is overseen by Iran’s judiciary, announced the convictions, although it did not name the defendants. They were found guilty of spying for French intelligence services, conspiring to undermine Iran’s national security and cooperating with Israeli intelligence services, the news agency reported. One was sentenced to a total of 32 years in prison, and the other to a total of 11 years in prison and 20 years in exile, according to Mizan, although it was not immediately clear what that entailed. The news agency reported that their detention periods would be “deducted from the final sentence,” suggesting the sentences would run concurrently, not consecutively. The verdict can be appealed to Iran’s Supreme Court within 20 days. France’s foreign ministry declined to comment on Wednesday. But the detention of Ms. Kohler and Mr. Paris has become a major sticking point in relations between Iran and France, which has repeatedly and strenuously called the charges against them baseless.

b1b607841550,Trump Considers Overhaul of Refugee System That Would Favor White People,"us politics, live-detached, refugees;internally displaced people, race and ethnicity, discrimination, white people, alternative for germany, state department, homeland security, stephen miller, donald trump, christopher landau, right-wing extremism and alt-right","The Trump administration is considering a radical overhaul of the U.S. refugee system that would slash the program to its bare bones while giving preference to English speakers, white South Africans and Europeans who oppose migration, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The proposals, some of which already have gone into effect, would transform a decades-old program aimed at helping the world’s most desperate people into one that conforms to Mr. Trump’s vision of immigration — which is to help mostly white people who say they are being persecuted while keeping the vast majority of other people out. The plans were presented to the White House in April and July by officials in the State and Homeland Security Departments after President Trump directed federal agencies to study whether refugee resettlement was in the interest of the United States. Mr. Trump had suspended refugee admissions on his first day in office and solicited the proposals about how and whether the administration should continue the program. Trump administration officials have not ruled out any of the ideas, according to people familiar with the planning, although there is no set timetable for approving or rejecting the ideas. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential plans. The proposed changes would put new emphasis on whether applicants would be able to assimilate into the United States, directing them to take classes on “American history and values” and “respect for cultural norms.” The proposals also advise Mr. Trump to prioritize Europeans who have been “targeted for peaceful expression of views online such as opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist’ political parties.” That appeared to be a reference to the European far-right political party Alternative for Germany, whose leaders have trivialized the Holocaust, revived Nazi slogans and denigrated foreigners. Vice President JD Vance has criticized Germany for trying to suppress the views of the group, which is known as the AfD. A senior official said the Trump administration was monitoring the situation in Europe to determine whether anyone would be eligible for refugee status. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan had not been finalized. Mr. Trump enacted some of the proposals in the documents even before the plans were submitted to him, including slashing refugee admissions and offering priority status to Afrikaners, the white minority who once ran South Africa’s brutal apartheid system. Mr. Trump has claimed that Afrikaners face racial persecution in their home country, a claim vigorously disputed by government officials there. Police statistics do not show that white people are more vulnerable to violent crime than other people in South Africa . Taken together, the proposals provide a window into Mr. Trump’s intentions for a program that has come to symbolize America’s role as a sanctuary. Mr. Trump and many American voters have rejected that role after years of record illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border . Although the refugee program, with its meticulous screening processes and yearslong waits, is considered the “right way” of seeking protection in the United States, Mr. Trump has made clear he wants to crack down on immigration in general — both legal and illegal. According to the rationale laid out in the documents submitted to Mr. Trump, America’s acceptance of refugees has made the country too diverse. “The sharp increase in diversity has reduced the level of social trust essential for the functioning of a democratic polity,” according to one of the documents. The administration should only welcome “refugees who can be fully and appropriately assimilate, and are aligned with the president’s objectives.” To that end, the documents say, Mr. Trump should cancel the applications of hundreds of thousands of people who are already in the pipeline to come to the United States as refugees, many of whom have gone through extensive security checks and referrals. And Mr. Trump’s federal agencies proposed imposing limits on the number of refugees who can resettle in communities that already have a high population of immigrants, on the basis that the United States should avoid “the concentration of non-native citizens” in order to promote assimilation. Thomas Pigott, a spokesman for the State Department, would not comment on specific details of the documents, but he said: “It should come as no surprise that the State Department is implementing the priorities of the duly elected president of the United States.” He added: “This administration unapologetically prioritizes the interests of the American people.” The administration has made some exceptions to its refugee ban. According to the documents, federal agencies have worked to resettle a limited number of Afghans who assisted U.S. soldiers during the war. Critics say the plans exposes the president’s vision for what America should look like. “It reflects a preexisting notion among some in the Trump administration as to who are the true Americans,” said Barbara L. Strack, a former chief of the refugee affairs division at Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Bush and Obama administrations. “And they think it’s white people and they think it’s Christians.” Other changes include more intensive security vetting for refugees, including DNA tests for children to ensure they are related to the adults they are traveling with. Mr. Trump also is planning to slash the number of refugees allowed into the United States to 7,500 in the upcoming year, a drastic decrease from the limit of 125,000 set by the Biden administration last year. Mr. Trump is required by law to consult Congress on imposing a refugee limit, but White House officials say the government shutdown has delayed that. Administration officials are not done submitting proposals to the White House. According to a draft of a third report, obtained by The New York Times, the latest proposal calls for U.S. embassies to make referrals for who should be considered for refugee status, rather than the United Nations, which has long been the practice. The change would allow for greater American control of who gets funneled into the refugee pipeline. At the United Nations General Assembly summit last month, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, defended the Trump administration’s approach during a panel on refugee policies. “Saying that the process is susceptible to abuse is not being xenophobic, it is not being a mean or bad person,” Mr. Landau said. The administration has argued that allowing thousands of refugees from all over the world to enter the nation would overwhelm American communities that have already called for additional resources to assist the record number of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border during the Biden administration. Migrants at the border, however, seek protection through a separate program than refugees, who often wait years overseas before they are vetted to travel to the United States. The refugee program has historically received bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats. Mr. Trump and the architect of his immigration restrictions, Stephen Miller, have for years sought to limit the number of refugees entering the United States, particularly from Africa or Muslim-majority nations. During his first term, Mr. Trump demanded to know at a White House meeting why he would accept immigrants from Haiti and African nations, which he described as “shithole countries,” rather than Europe. His administration now appears prepared to turn those sentiments into policy. In the report, administration officials also proposed banning refugees from resettling in U.S. communities that have requested federal aid to assist migrants in recent years. But many local leaders and refugee advocates argue that not only can refugees adjust to life in America effectively, they also benefit local economies. Marian Abernathy, a lay leader at the Judea Reform Congregation synagogue in Durham, N.C., has helped refugees who had settled in her community since 2016, including a dozen families in the last four years from Afghanistan, Ukraine, Haiti, Venezuela and Syria. The refugees have worked as nursing aides, engineers, Uber drivers, medical technicians and lunch coordinators at local schools, she said. “They come to dinner at our houses,” she said. “We go to dinner at their houses. We go to events together, hang out at the museum. I don’t feel like they’re not integrated.” “I’ve rarely seen a group of people,” she said, “who work harder and who want fewer handouts.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-refugee-white-people.html,World,Washington Post,By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Hamed Aleaziz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/us/politics/14DC-REFUGEES/14DC-REFUGEES-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T18:06:22+00:00,a90c7d8e59637742c9a228043e7e579183f75999
f2705e881df3,Trump Administration Authorizes Covert C.I.A. Action in Venezuela,"venezuela, cia, us politics, us foreign policy, us military, spying and intelligence agencies, drug abuse, nicolas maduro, donald trump, john ratcliffe, caribbean, live-detached","The Trump administration has secretly authorized the C.I.A. to conduct covert action in Venezuela, according to U.S. officials, stepping up a campaign against Nicolás Maduro, the country’s authoritarian leader. The authorization is the latest step in the Trump administration’s intensifying pressure campaign against Venezuela. For weeks, the U.S. military has been targeting boats off the Venezuelan coast it says are transporting drugs , killing 27 people. American officials have been clear, privately, that the end goal is to drive Mr. Maduro from power . The new authority would allow the C.I.A. to carry out lethal operations in Venezuela and conduct a range of operations in the Caribbean. The agency would be able to take covert action against Mr. Maduro or his government either unilaterally or in conjunction with a larger military operation. It is not known whether the C.I.A. is planning any operations in Venezuela or if the authorities are meant as a contingency. But the development comes as the U.S. military is planning its own possible escalation, drawing up options for President Trump to consider, including strikes inside Venezuela. The scale of the military buildup in the region is substantial: There are currently 10,000 U.S. troops there, most of them at bases in Puerto Rico, but also a contingent of Marines on amphibious assault ships. In all, the Navy has eight surface warships and a submarine in the Caribbean. The new authorities, known in intelligence jargon as a presidential finding, were described by multiple U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the highly classified document. Mr. Trump ordered an end to diplomatic talks with the Maduro government this month as he grew frustrated with the Venezuelan leader’s failure to accede to U.S. demands to give up power voluntarily and the continued insistence by officials that they had no part in drug trafficking. The C.I.A. has long had authority to work with governments in Latin America on security matters and intelligence sharing. That has allowed the agency to work with Mexican officials to target drug cartels. But those authorizations do not allow the agency to carry out direct lethal operations. The Trump administration’s strategy on Venezuela, developed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with help from John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, aims to oust Mr. Maduro from power . Mr. Ratcliffe has said little about what his agency is doing in Venezuela. But he has promised that the C.I.A. under his leadership would become more aggressive. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Ratcliffe said he would make the C.I.A. less averse to risk and more willing to conduct covert action when ordered by the president, “ going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do .” The White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment. The United States has offered $50 million for information leading to Mr. Maduro’s arrest and conviction on U.S. drug trafficking charges. Mr. Rubio, who also serves as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, has called Mr. Maduro illegitimate, and the Trump administration describes him as a “narcoterrorist.” Mr. Maduro blocked the government that was democratically elected last year from taking power. But the Trump administration’s accusations that he has profited from the narcotics trade and that his country is a major producer of drugs for the United States have been debated. The administration has asserted in legal filings that Mr. Maduro controls a criminal gang, Tren de Aragua. But an assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts that conclusion . While the Trump administration has publicly offered relatively thin legal justifications for its campaign, Mr. Trump told Congress that he decided the United States was in an armed conflict with drug cartels it views as terrorist organizations. In the congressional notice late last month, the Trump administration said the cartels smuggling drugs were “nonstate armed groups” whose actions “constitute an armed attack against the United States.” White House findings authorizing covert action are closely guarded secrets. They are often reauthorized from administration to administration, and their precise language is rarely made public. They also constitute one of the rawest uses of executive authority. Select members of Congress are briefed on the authorizations, but lawmakers cannot make them public, and conducting oversight of possible covert actions is difficult. While U.S. military operations, like the strikes against boats purportedly carrying drugs from Venezuelan territory, are generally made public, C.I.A. covert actions are typically kept secret. Some, however, like the C.I.A. operation in which Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, are quickly made public. The agency has been stepping up its work on counternarcotics for years. Gina Haspel, Mr. Trump’s second C.I.A. director during his first administration, devoted more resources to drug hunting in Mexico and Latin America. Under William J. Burns, the Biden administration’s director, the C.I.A. began flying drones over Mexico, hunting for fentanyl labs, operations that Mr. Ratcliffe expanded. The covert finding is in some ways a natural evolution of those antidrug efforts. But the C.I.A.’s history of covert action in Latin America and the Caribbean is mixed at best. In 1954, the agency orchestrated a coup that overthrew President Jacobo Árbenz of Guatemala, ushering in decades of instability. The C.I.A.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 ended in disaster, and the agency repeatedly tried to assassinate Fidel Castro. That same year, however, the C.I.A. supplied weapons to dissidents who assassinated Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina, the authoritarian leader of the Dominican Republic. The agency also had its hands in a 1964 coup in Brazil , the death of Che Guevara and other machinations in Bolivia , a 1973 coup in Chile , and the contra fight against the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua in the 1980s.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html,World,Washington Post,By Julian E.

Giuliani, was 4,500 miles away wearing a different hat. Instead of the red “Make America Great Again” ball caps that have been a defining feature at Trump rallies for the last decade, Mr. Giuliani’s new hat promised to “Make Srpska Great Again.” His appearance in the hat at a political rally for Milorad Dodik, the president of the small self-governing territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, marked the public debut of a costly and wide-reaching influence campaign aimed at persuading the Trump administration to come to the defense of a pro-Russian authoritarian trying to fend off threats to his reign at home and in Washington. The effort has grown to include well-connected lobbyists and lawyers with ties to Mr. Trump who are being paid about $300,000 per month or more, according to filings with the Justice Department. Their goal is to present Mr. Dodik, a towering figure in Republika Srpska, as a sort of Trump of the Balkans. The campaign has cast Mr. Dodik, who is contesting an effort to remove him from the presidency and fighting to lift U.S. sanctions, as a victim of the same sort of political prosecutions that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump claim they have faced, and as someone willing to cut lucrative deals with Washington.

ebd4276f06b5,U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China,"us politics, politics, us economy, rare earths, metals and minerals, tariff, mining, internal-open-access-from-nl","The Trump administration is seeking to counter new economic measures from China by exerting more control over American companies in key strategic sectors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday. The approach marks a new era of industrial policy in the United States, a contrast to how policymakers have traditionally valued free markets and open investment. But as China’s dominance over the production of rare-earth minerals and battery technology grows, President Trump wants to take a page out of Beijing’s economic strategy. By taking more stakes in American companies that specialize in areas deemed critical to national security, the Trump administration aims to exert more control over what they produce. The goal is for the U.S. to become less reliant on China for sensitive technology that it has been using as leverage in trade negotiations. “When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policies,” Mr. Bessent said at a forum on investing in America sponsored by CNBC. Tensions between the world’s two largest economies have rapidly escalated after the Chinese government last week proposed a new licensing system to cover the global trade in products that contain trace amounts of Chinese rare-earth minerals, or minerals mined or processed using Chinese technology. The rules, which would go into effect later this year, shocked foreign governments and businesses, who would theoretically need to seek licenses from Beijing to trade in products ranging from cars to computer chips , even outside of Chinese borders. The system would also deny shipments to any U.S. and European defense or weapons manufacturers, who are still highly dependent on Chinese minerals. On Friday, Mr. Trump responded by threatening to put an additional 100 percent tariff on products from China on Nov. 1 and cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. After the announcements caused the stock market to plummet, Mr. Trump quickly qualified his statements. He said he might meet Mr. Xi anyway and wrote on social media on Sunday, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” The Treasury secretary pointed to China’s announcement last week of new export controls on rare-earth minerals as a reason the United States must exert more state control over corporations. “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said. The Trump administration has taken stakes in several companies including U.S. Steel, Intel, as well as Trilogy Metals and MP Materials, a rare-earth mining company. Mr. Trump has also demanded cuts of revenue from sales of chips that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices earn from China. The United States has been trying to catch up in the race for critical minerals, which are crucial for advanced technologies including weaponry, airplanes and computer chips. Mr. Bessent noted that the development of a “strategic mineral reserve” is a priority and said that JPMorgan Chase was interested in working with the administration on the initiative. Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration had identified seven industries that it considered of strategic importance where the United States could seek to exert more government control. He pointed specifically to the defense sector, where in some cases the U.S. government is the largest or only customer of certain companies, and said that the administration could insist that companies spend more money on research and less on stock buybacks. “I do think our defense companies are woefully behind in terms of deliveries,” Mr. Bessent said. The United States would use “price floors” and “forward buying” across a “range of industries,” he added, to ensure that China does not dominate other sectors the way it has with the processing and refining of rare earths. The push for greater government control over the private sector is a policy that he has criticized in the past. Last year, Mr. Bessent delivered a speech at the Manhattan Institute deriding the Biden administration’s subsidies of strategic sectors such as semiconductors as “central planning.” At a news conference at the Treasury Department on Wednesday, Mr. Bessent scolded China for deploying similar tactics. “They are a state economy,” Mr. Bessent said. “We are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.” Mr. Bessent and Jamieson Greer, the United States Trade Representative, appeared to escalate trade tensions with China by publicly rebuking their new controls as economic coercion. They accused China of violating the terms of a trade truce reached this year and said that Mr. Trump would not back down from the 100 percent tariffs that he threatened in retaliation even if the trade dispute causes the stock market to tumble. Mr. Bessent, in particular, struck a combative tone, assailing a Chinese trade official, Li Chenggang, in unusually personal terms. He suggested that Mr. Li was a “slightly unhinged” economic diplomat who had gone “rogue” in rolling out the new export measures. The rising tension between America and China comes as global policymakers are gathering in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. While the Trump administration has spent much of the year threatening U.S. allies with steep tariffs, Mr. Bessent suggested that he now wanted to work with those countries to confront China over its economic practices. Mr. Greer criticized China’s new restrictions as “an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world.” Because critical minerals and semiconductors made with them are in so many products, he said, “this rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy and the technology supply chain,” including not only A.I. and high-tech products but also cars, smartphones and even household appliances. Mr. Greer said that the United States complied with the terms of the economic truce it had struck with the Chinese this year. The United States had already drafted its paperwork to add tariffs to Chinese products, and would proceed with that if the Chinese licensing system went into effect later this year. “Our expectation is that this never goes into effect,” Mr. Greer said. The countries have also clashed over a U.S. move to impose fees on Chinese-owned ships docking in American ports, a policy U.S. officials say is geared at revitalizing American shipbuilding. Non-Chinese shipping lines must also pay the fees when they send Chinese-built ships to American ports. Those went into effect on Tuesday, The Chinese government has threatened to hit American vessels with similar fees, and on Tuesday it imposed sanctions on five subsidiaries of Hanwha, a South Korean company that is helping the United States build ships. The order, which took effect immediately, prohibits Chinese companies or individuals from doing business with the Hanwha units. Despite the strident tone from the United States, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi are still expected to meet in South Korea this month. Mr. Bessent also said that there were “working level” meetings taking place between U.S. and Chinese officials on the sidelines of the I.M.F. meetings this week.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/us-government-companies-china.html,World,Washington Post,By Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-bessent-01-jfwp/15dc-bessent-01-jfwp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T16:17:46+00:00,2651504e55ba3a970b75656201ca22ed8bb3b5ed
a8c618e5942f,L.A. County Declares State of Emergency Over Immigration Raids,"emergency response and preparedness, illegal immigration;undocumented migrants, federalism, immigration, us states, los angeles county","Los Angeles County voted on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency over federal immigration raids, the latest move by the county to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Southern California. The emergency declaration, traditionally used in response to events like natural disasters, would allow the county to provide resources for those who have been affected by the raids. County officials say the move will provide help for those who have refrained from going to work for fear of being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or who lose their income after family members are detained. The declaration, which was passed in a 4-to-1 vote by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, also gives officials the ability to vote later to impose an eviction moratorium and other protections for tenants who might have fallen behind on rent payments because of the raids. In justifying the declaration, county officials argued that federal immigration sweeps, in which thousands of people have been detained by heavily armed and masked immigration officials, have produced a climate of fear. “We have residents afraid to leave their homes,” said Janice Hahn, a board member who voted in favor of the declaration. “We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers were taken from their workplaces and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on the table.” Last month, county officials approved around $30 million in rental relief assistance for residents who were affected by wildfires or federal immigration raids. The county plans to begin accepting applications for that relief in December. The board did not provide an estimate for how many residents have been affected by immigration raids or how many might apply for relief. County lawyers have warned that the emergency declaration could create issues for landlords and tenants, as well as invite litigation from the Trump administration. They said the declaration could lead to significant income loss for landlords and expose tenants to lawsuits from landlords seeking to recover debts. It could also prompt tenants to publicly disclose their immigration status, the lawyers said, inviting enforcement action from the federal government. Kathryn Barger, the member of the board of supervisors who voted against the declaration, argued that the raids did not meet the criteria for an emergency. “Emergency powers exist for crises that pose life and death consequences like wildfires — not as a shortcut for complex policy issues,” she wrote in a statement provided to the news media after the vote. “Stretching emergency powers for federal immigration actions undermines their purpose, invites legal challenges, and circumvents the public process.” Los Angeles County — home to 10 million people and the country’s largest population of undocumented immigrants — became the primary battleground this summer in the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration. A spike in immigration arrests led to protests, and the federal government responded by deploying National Guard troops and Marines to the region. Local and state officials have sought to push back, banning federal officials from wearing masks in the state, filing lawsuits over the deployment of troops and challenging the tactics used by ICE . In July, a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from making indiscriminate immigration arrests in the county, and a sense of normalcy returned to Los Angeles. But last month, the Supreme Court overturned the order, reinstating fear among immigrants there.

12feeb6facf9,"South Korea Targets Cambodia’s Scam Industry After Kidnappings, Torture and a Death","fraud, kidnapping and hostages, murders and homicides, missing person, organized crime, cambodia, south korea, internal-open-access-from-nl","South Korean officials said Wednesday that they were trying to bring back missing South Koreans from Cambodia, where hundreds of people have disappeared into online scam centers that steal billions of dollars from victims worldwide. Outrage in South Korea has grown after 330 people were reported missing after traveling to Cambodia this year, including a 22-year-old university student who was later found dead. Others have been tortured and confined by those running the scams, South Korean officials said. The victims were lured by high-paying job offers, only to be forced to defraud other South Koreans, officials said. Most of those reported to have disappeared have since been accounted for, but 79 were still missing in Cambodia, Wi Sung-lac, South Korea’s national security director, said at a news conference on Wednesday. He added that the government would also try to repatriate about 60 people who had been detained by the Cambodian authorities. South Korea is the latest nation to try to combat Cambodia’s scam industry. In February, China led a crackdown on scam compounds in Myanmar and Cambodia. On Tuesday, the United States and Britain imposed sanctions on parts of a Cambodian conglomerate, Prince Group, which they said was running scam networks worldwide. U.S. federal prosecutors indicted its chairman, Chen Zhi, and seized $15 billion in cryptocurrency that they said were proceeds from his fraud and money laundering schemes. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said that, starting Thursday, it was barring South Koreans from traveling to parts of Cambodia where scams and human confinements were rife. Some Southeast Asian countries, like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, have become hotbeds for online fraud. Scammers based in the region stole at least $10 billion from victims in the United States last year, the Treasury Department said. South Korean nationals were defrauded of about $148 million in 2023, according to a report last year by the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime. Criminal groups traffic people to porous border regions of Southeast Asian countries, often through false job advertisements, to carry out scams in their native language. People from China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and Africa make up the majority of those trafficked to scam compounds, but some South Koreans are also lured by promises of high pay. About 200,000 people of various nationalities are involved in Cambodia’s scam industry, Mr. Wi said. He said that about 1,000 were believed to be South Korean. Advertisements targeting South Koreans on online job boards and Telegram, the online messaging app, seen by The New York Times promised weekly payments of at least 5 million won (around $3,500), more than the average worker in South Korea makes in a month. Organized crime groups from South Korea run scam operations in Cambodia that are smaller in scale than the thousand-strong compounds owned by Chinese syndicates, said Jeremy Douglas, the chief of staff and strategy at the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime. Smaller rings run by young Koreans in their 20s and 30s are also operated in Cambodia, Mr. Douglas said. Mr. Wi said that some South Koreans traveled to Cambodia intending to be involved in illegal activities, and that some willingly returned to Cambodia after coming home. He added that the South Korean government would work to prevent people from seeking high-paying jobs in Cambodia. Park Chan-dae, a South Korean lawmaker, said in a public hearing on Monday that some of those kidnapped had endured harsh treatment. “Some were forced to take drugs, sexually assaulted and subjected to medical exams for the purpose of organ trafficking,” he said. “Every minute and every second was a matter of life and death.” They were able to escape or reach their families through Telegram, leading to their repatriation, he said. Lee Jeong-sook, the president of the Korean Rescue Organization, a nonprofit that has helped extract South Koreans from Cambodia, said in a news conference on Wednesday that the people running the crime operations would confine those who refused to work, as well as beating them, torturing them, or extorting funds from their families. Park Minho, the 22-year-old university student, died of a heart attack caused by “severe torture,” the Cambodian government said in a statement on Tuesday. The statement said that his body had been found in August in a Ford pickup truck, and that he had been living in a building that the authorities later identified as a base for a scam operation. Three Chinese people and two others have been charged in connection to Mr. Park’s death and running scam operations, the Cambodian government said, adding that it was working with South Korean officials to locate other accomplices. After its crackdown in February, China repatriated hundreds of people freed from scam centers in Myanmar, where they were forced by Chinese criminals to engage in investment and cryptocurrency fraud, online dating cons and other schemes. While Chinese syndicates are still the main players in the scam industry, Mr. Douglas said, the recent lull created an opportunity for Japanese and Korean criminal actors who were already in the region. “The crackdown by China no doubt created a space for others and played a role in the diversification, but it was already happening,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/world/asia/cambodia-south-korea-scams.html,World,Washington Post,By John Yoon and Francesca Regalado,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15xp-scams-hlvj/15xp-scams-hlvj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T11:44:10+00:00,04a02eca3bef6cffa2f4d67db14948a165b4ecb6
657a76cb7917,Trump’s Tariff Fight With China Means Trouble for a Vast Wilderness in Brazil,"climate change;global warming, agriculture, forests, soybeans;soy, regulation and deregulation, international trade, us foreign policy, environment, protectionism, luiz inacio lula da silva, xi jinping, donald trump, amazon rainforest","The humble soybean is in the middle of a geopolitical tangle that spans three continents and threatens to devour the world’s largest tropical savanna. At issue is China’s enormous appetite for soybeans, millions of tons a year, mainly for cooking oil and livestock feed. Sating that demand has taken a grave toll in recent years on the forests and grasslands of Brazil, China’s biggest supplier. That stands to get worse in the coming months, because China has all but stopped buying American soybeans, giving Brazilian farmers greater incentives to expand into new areas to grow soy. Earlier this year, the government in Beijing slapped a hefty tariff on American soybeans in retaliation for hefty U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Until then, America had been China’s second-biggest supplier. But now, farmers in the United States have sold not a single bushel to China from this fall’s harvest. Hopes of a relief package from the White House have been delayed by the government shutdown. Likewise Argentina, whose president, Javier Milei, met with President Trump on Tuesday. Argentina sold a mountain of soybeans to China this year after American farmers were locked out. But no country stands to gain as much as Brazil, the world’s biggest soybean exporter. No surprise then that its powerful farm lobby is pushing to dismantle one of the most important industrywide measures, known as the Soy Moratorium and designed to limit deforestation in Brazil’s most famous biome, the Amazon. All of this is awkward for Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He is hosting the next round of international climate negotiations in November, in the Amazon rainforest city of Belém. His administration has pledged to get deforestation under control. “The government is facing a very difficult situation,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaigner with Greenpeace Brazil, said in an interview. “There is an attack on one of the most important mechanisms for zero deforestation.” Soybeans are Brazil’s biggest agricultural export. Its soy production has steadily risen over the past several decades. But it really accelerated in the past 10 years, as relations soured between Beijing and Washington, and China went looking for soybeans beyond the American Midwest. By 2017, at the start of the first Trump term, Brazil had overtaken the United States as the world’s leading soybean producer. Now, relations between Beijing and Washington have sunk to a new low, and American farmers stand to lose their biggest global customer. For much of the past year, prices have been around $10 a bushel , down from $13 or so at the start of 2024. “We’ve had strong growth in recent years, starting with that first U.S.-China trade war. And now, with the second one,” Lucas Costa Beber, vice president of Aprosoja, the Brazilian Association of Soybean Producers, said this week. “In the long term, if this situation continues, opportunities for Brazil will increase.” The prognosis for Brazil’s biosphere is less rosy. Soy plantations tend to come up on land that had been logged and cleared previously for cattle grazing. Today, soy plantations cover 40 million hectares, about 14 percent of the country’s agricultural land , according to MapBiomas, an independent group that uses satellite data. Most of that is in the Cerrado, a vast region of tropical savanna and forest corridors that is less a global celebrity than the Amazon but still a critical ecosystem for Brazil. In the Cerrado lie the headwaters of the country’s biggest river basins, and it is vital to regulating rainfall patterns and temperatures. Deforestation has declined in the past year, as the administration of Mr. Lula has tightened enforcement. But nearly half of the native vegetation of the Cerrado has vanished, making way for cattle grazing and soy plantations. “The Cerrado is disappearing,” said Luciana Gatti, a climate change researcher at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research. And now, she said, “the pressure to produce soybeans to export to China will be bigger.” In 2023 alone, soy was harvested from more than 460,000 hectares of recently deforested land in the Cerrado, according to Trase , a nonprofit group that tracks deforestation in agricultural supply chains. That is an area bigger than Rhode Island. The Cerrado is not part of the Amazon. Soy-related deforestation hasn’t been eradicated entirely in the Amazon itself, independent researchers say , but it has been slowed significantly by the Soy Moratorium. Under that industry pact, which applies only in the Amazon region, the world’s major commodity traders jointly agreed to not buy or finance soy grown on lands that were deforested after 2008. Partly as a result, in 2023, soy harvest in the Amazon came from 150,000 hectares of recently deforested land, according to Trase figures , a far smaller area than in the Cerrado. Now, pressure is mounting to suspend the Soy Moratorium in the Amazon. In August, Brazil’s national antitrust regulator briefly suspended it while the agency opened an investigation into alleged collusion among traders. A federal court immediately reinstated the moratorium, but its future remains uncertain. The soy producers’ association is leading the charge against the moratorium. Mr. Beber, the group’s vice president, called it a “trade barrier disguised as environmental protection.” He said the moratorium effectively favored other countries by regulating which Brazilian soybeans can be traded on the world market. Mr. Beber said farmers could vastly expand soy production in areas of the Cerrado that are currently pasture lands. “All of those regions have degraded pastureland with potential to be converted into cropland,” he said. “It really just depends on economic and market viability.” The market viability for American soy farmers is murky. Soybeans are the top U.S. agricultural export. The American Soybean Association has said American farmers risk losing their main customer , China, which brought in more than $12.6 billion last year, if the trade dispute continues. Meanwhile, tariffs on China have pushed up the costs of fertilizer and equipment in the United States. Mr. Trump has swung wildly on whether he intends to meet with Mr. Xi at the end of the month at a trade summit in South Korea. If they meet, soybeans are sure to be on the agenda.

0e9df33d852a,Inside Iran’s Museum of American Espionage,"us foreign policy, iran, kidnapping and hostages, iran-israel war, diplomats embassies and consulates, war;armed conflicts, museum, cia, israel, tehran","So we’re here outside the U.S. embassy compound in Tehran. Here we have an apple with the CNN logo. The Twin Towers interspersed with the dollar sign. The Statue of Liberty. This is one of the most photographed walls, probably in all of Tehran. Americans know this as the former U.S. compound. But to Iranians, this is known as the “U.S. Den of Espionage Museum.” And of course, what happened here is at the root of the hostility between the U.S. and Iran for over four decades, a hostility that escalated recently. In June, Israel and the U.S. launched strikes on Iran, resulting in a short but intense war that rattled the capital, killing hundreds. Foreign journalists face restricted access in Iran, but during a recent trip, officials allowed us to visit the former embassy, where much of the current animosity traces back to. On November 4, 1979, Iranian students stormed the embassy, fearing the U.S. planned to restore the Shah, or king, who had been deposed months earlier. They held 52 hostages for a total of 444 days. [Voiceover] “The students had restricted outside contacts with the hostages. So far they’d refused to forward letters to their captors.” “How can you call these hostages? These people are political smugglers.” “I announced a series of economic and political actions.” “We’re beyond the time for gestures. We want our people to be set free.” Six C.I.A. officers were among the hostages, the U.S. government later said, accusing Iran of violating diplomatic conventions. Decades of tensions would follow. “So this was during the hostage crisis?” “After the hostage crisis.” “After the students came in.” Twenty-one-year-old Amir is working here as a guide as part of his compulsory military service. Like many in Iran, where self-censorship is common, he asked us not to use his last name. “Typically, how many people visit this museum every year?” “It’s about 5,000, most of them from Asia. But rarely we have visitors from U.S. and U.K. too.” This is the former U.S. ambassador’s office. It’s been carefully preserved to look largely like it did before the hostage crisis. When it became certain that the students were taking over the embassy, the Americans inside desperately tried to shred as many classified documents as they could. “These are the famous shredding machines probably known to most Americans from the movie Argo, right?” “The students tried to recover some of these documents. It took six years to reassemble the shred papers together. And, after recovery, students classified all these documents as a book.” There’s a particular focus on this part of the museum, which is presented as the C.I.A. station. It’s full of spy equipment. There’s encryption devices, there’s an eavesdropping machine. There’s a secure room just behind me. And for the regime here that is presented as proof that this building wasn’t just used for diplomacy, but was also used to surveil Iranians and, as they see it, to meddle in their affairs. “This is all the material for tapping communications, monitoring communications.” “Yeah, I mean, I got to say, it’s more elaborate than I would have imagined, right? It gives you an insight into what espionage looked almost five decades ago.” The message at the museum was clear for its visitors, including the handful of foreign journalists, like us, who had been allowed in. The Americans were untrustworthy then and shouldn’t be trusted now. Many Iranians told me they viewed the museum as a relic of the distant past, but they were also on high alert since the war in June, and fears that fighting with the United States could start at any moment. A reminder that this troubled history still rings loud today.",https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000010446083/inside-irans-museum-of-american-espionage.html,World,Washington Post,"By Declan Walsh, Gelareh Kiazand, Jon Hazell and Christina Thornell",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/world/middleeast/Thumb/Thumb-facebookJumbo.png?video-overlay,2025-10-15T09:01:06.214000+00:00,ade7749ab1a289d91aca17dc81d87d06a3d75e8f
46c1cbd1d38c,Inmates Make Brazen Escape in Guatemala,"guatemala, prison escape, gang, barrio 18, latin america, internal-open-access-from-nl","In a brazen scheme that may have involved escapes during prison visits, 20 inmates accused of being members of a major gang have slipped out of a Guatemalan prison and set off a sweeping manhunt, the authorities say. The escapes took place over a period of time, but were only announced on Sunday, officials said. They came shortly after the American authorities designated the gang , Barrio 18, as a foreign terrorist organization, placing it on the same list as the region’s most notorious cartels. The prison break has set off a nationwide manhunt, with 45,000 police officers taking part. It has also created a crisis for the government, with several prison officials dismissed and intense scrutiny falling on members of the president’s cabinet, though corruption has long plagued Guatemala. Both members of President Bernardo Arévalo’s party and opposition lawmakers have called for an investigation. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala described the escapes as “utterly unacceptable,” and said in a statement on Sunday that the government “must act immediately and forcefully to recapture these terrorists, who pose a threat to both Guatemala and the security of U.S. territory.” Guatemalan officials said they were coordinating with Interpol and the authorities in neighboring countries, “especially Mexico's,” to track down the fugitives, Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez said at a news conference on Monday. The escapees included high-ranking gang leaders, the Guatemalan government said. Only one has been recaptured by so far. “I’m not going to deny the reality — there’s no good explanation,” Mr. Jiménez said. The prisoners escaped from the Fraijanes II prison, a maximum-security facility outside Guatemala City meant for gang members. When exactly they did so remains unclear, the director of the country’s prison system, Luis Alfonso Godínez, said at a news conference on Sunday. For around two months there had been “rumors” of escapes, he said, adding that the inmates had likely slipped out gradually — “one by one or two by two” — and that some may have done so during prison visits. In the past, leaders have had lower-ranking gang members take their place in prison, but officials said that such swaps did not appear to have occurred this time. Security protocols at Fraijanes II were “weak,” Mr. Godínez said. The prison did not have technology to help with prisoner counts or to “confirm that the people incarcerated are the same people that appear in its records,” he said. He also mentioned the possibility that prison employees had been bribed by the gang. The only fugitive to have been rearrested to date was identified as Byron Fajardo Revolorio , who is known as Black Demon. He is serving a 180-year sentence. Mr. Godínez said Sunday that in response to the escapes, facial-recognition and other technology would be used to monitor the prisoner population. The following day, Mr. Jiménez, the interior minister, announced that Mr. Godínez had been removed from his post, though he said he was not suspected of working with Barrio 18. The directors of several prisons had also been dismissed over suspected ties to the gang, he said. Mr. Jiménez also said that all prison directors would have to take polygraph tests. Citing corruption within the prison system, he called on the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Barrio 18 has often been compared with the violent Salvadoran street gang MS-13, and was long active in neighboring El Salvador. There, thousands of Barrio 18 and MS-13 members are being held in the maximum-security facility that El Salvador’s president often showcases online. Mr. Jiménez has said there were some 12,000 gang members and collaborators in Guatemala, with about 3,000 behind bars. The crisis coincides with the transfer last month of the man believed to be the top leader of Barrio 18 in Guatemala, Aldo Dupie Ochoa, who is known as El Lobo, from Fraijanes II to another prison. The transfer prompted prison riots across the country, with gang members calling for his return to Fraijanes II. A judge eventually ordered that the gang leader be sent back. Across Latin America, gang leaders often run their criminal organizations from behind bars, often with the aid of smuggled cellphones and other contraband. To do so, they rely on the widespread corruption among prison employees and government officials. After the Fraijanes II escapes were revealed this week, the interior minister described collaboration between the Guatemalan authorities and the Trump administration to overhaul the prison system, including building a new facility for gang members. “Talks are well underway with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the design and construction of the maximum-security prison,” Mr. Jiménez said. He said the government also had support from the U.S. government to collect biometric data in the prisons and to coordinate training for prison officers. Since President Trump took office, the U.S. government has labeled around a dozen organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, a designation which opens the way for more aggressive action against them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/americas/guatemala-prison-escape.html,World,Washington Post,By Annie Correal and Jody García,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14int-guatemala-prison-gwtp/14int-guatemala-prison-gwtp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T00:19:29+00:00,c56a96d036f25077023d35e03d5efae3cf3939c9
be896ec31ad7,What Makes a Martyr?,"charlie kirk, politics, right-wing extremism and alt-right, presidential medal of freedom","It’s not just American conservatives who are trying to immortalize Charlie Kirk. His name was a rallying cry at a large far-right gathering in London . His death was the No. 1 topic at a right-wing party conference in Madrid. Even the mayor of Lima, Peru, held a memorial for Kirk , comparing him to martyrs in Rome who helped spread Christianity. In the U.S., Kirk’s consecration as a MAGA saint has been swift. There are proposals to name portions of highways after him and to mint coins with his face on them. Oklahoma is considering a bill that would require all state colleges to build a statue of Kirk. Yesterday, on what would have been his 32nd birthday — and was officially a National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk, thanks to an act of Congress — President Trump held a ceremony to posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Martyrs are potent. Their deaths can be used to infuse a cause with quasi-sacred meaning. They can be used to unite people behind that cause and against an enemy. They can be used to justify violence. There are a number of criteria that experts say make someone a good martyr — and Kirk ticks all the boxes. Three ingredients George Floyd made an effective martyr. Ashli Babbitt less so. If you haven’t heard of Babbitt, it’s because efforts to elevate her after her death never reached the heights many on the right had hoped for. Babbitt died in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. She was killed by a police officer when she tried to breach a door that was one of the last barriers between rioters and members of Congress. Trump and other prominent MAGA figures framed her death as the execution of an “innocent.” There was a burst of Babbitt hashtags and T-shirts in QAnon and far-right circles, where she remains a martyr to this day. But efforts to broaden her appeal beyond that never really bore fruit. Floyd, a Black man, died facedown on the pavement when a white police officer knelt on the back of his neck. “I can’t breathe,” the words he repeatedly uttered in his final moments, became the rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. People across the globe marched in his name. Pilgrims still flock to the site of Floyd’s death outside a convenience store that was renamed after him. Murals of him abound. What accounts for the difference? I asked Tom Holland, a historian who has studied Christian martyrdom, what the most compelling martyrs had in common. He listed three criteria. First: a public, dramatic and ‘innocent’ death. Floyd’s victimhood was never in any serious question. The world watched the video of him taking his last breath. Babbitt’s death split the right. Senior Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham called the Jan. 6 rioters “domestic terrorists.” The House speaker at the time, Kevin McCarthy, said the officer who shot her “did his job.” Second: The death should have a cause linked to it. Martyr means witness in Greek; the early martyrs were witnesses to God. Babbitt and Floyd both had causes linked to their deaths. In Babbitt’s case, it was Stop the Steal; in Floyd’s, it was Black Lives Matter. But they differ again when it comes to Holland’s third piece of criteria. Third: Martyrs need a powerful movement. Movements have the resources to invest these deaths with greater meaning — to tell their stories in a way that galvanizes people. In May 2020, when Floyd died, America’s left was mobilized ahead of that year’s presidential election. By the time Babbitt died, Trump had lost that election and was a few weeks from leaving office. It wasn’t yet clear where MAGA was going. A powerful tool Kirk’s death, Holland noted, can be made to fit all the criteria. He was shot while debating college students. He was already recruiting young voters to the MAGA cause. And he’s being mourned by a movement that’s more powerful than ever. The ripple effects of Kirk’s death have already gone beyond statues and plazas. He’s become a powerful tool. The administration has used his death to crack down on free speech and liberal groups. It has threatened to deport people who trivialize Kirk’s murder and has canceled some foreigners’ visas . While guest-hosting an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show,” the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller declared that the administration was “at war” with the left, and he vowed “to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy” what he called a “vast domestic terror movement.” The government would do this, Miller said, “in Charlie’s name.” Interested in providing feedback on this newsletter?

2d474471ac94,Madagascar’s Military Has Taken Control. Here’s What We Know.,"madagascar, politics, coups d'etat, andry rajoelina, civil unrest, generation z;gen z, internal-open-access-from-nl","Madagascar’s military said Tuesday that it was taking control of the government, after weeks of deadly protests calling for the removal of President Andry Rajoelina, who appears to have left the country. The military has suspended the Constitution and dissolved all of Madagascar’s major institutions — including the highest court, the electoral commission and the Senate — but left in place the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The demonstrations began in late September over the government’s failure to provide reliable water and electricity but later spread to cover a wide range of grievances. The protesters have drawn inspiration from Gen Z demonstrations that erupted recently in Nepal and Kenya . The situation in Madagascar, an island in southern Africa off the coast of Mozambique, remains unstable. Here’s what we know so far. Why are young people protesting? Thousands of young people have been on the streets in Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, and other major cities since Sept. 25. They say that they’re fed up with official corruption and with the daily struggle to meet basic needs like water and electricity, especially as prices are rising. The recent protests began last month when two Antananarivo City Council members were arrested before a planned demonstration against water and electricity cuts. Civil society groups and young people saw the arrests as an attempt to silence dissent. According to activists in Madagascar, this is the first time the country has seen a youth-led movement that has sustained mass protests in multiple cities. The protesters see Mr. Rajoelina as an ineffective leader who has failed to deliver on his promises to help them and have been calling for weeks for him to resign. Gen Z Madagascar, a youth-led group that has been coordinating some of the protests, called for civil servants to join the demonstrations. The organization has drawn on the playbook of recent youth-led movements in Nepal, Indonesia and the Philippines, even using the same grinning skull symbol . The frustration among young people in Madagascar is akin to challenges to governments elsewhere in Africa, in part because of the continent’s demography. Africa’s median age is 19, so young people are entering the workplace and the political process in large numbers. How did the government respond? Initially, security forces cracked down hard in an effort to control the protests. The United Nations said that at least 22 people had been killed and more than a hundred injured, figures that officials in Madagascar have disputed. On Sept. 29, Mr. Rajoelina dissolved the government and said he would fire his cabinet, in an apparent effort to appease the protesters. But instead Mr. Rajoelina’s move seemed to deepen their resolve in calling for his resignation. “He’s changed nothing,” Rovatanjoniaina Valisoa Tsimaniva, 21, a university student, said early this month. “It’s like everything he said was just a drunk man’s promises. And we’re sick of it.” Some of Madagascar’s security forces began turning against Mr. Rajoelina on Saturday and joined the protesters. But the president was defiant. He said in an address on Monday that he had gone into hiding because of threats to his life, but he pledged to continue working to save the country. On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers voted to impeach Mr. Rajoelina. He called the impeachment process unconstitutional and tried to stop it by dissolving the National Assembly. The assembly went ahead with the vote, and the military announced that it would be taking charge of Madagascar’s government. Who is in charge now? A unit of the military said on Tuesday that it would form a transitional government, to last for no more than two years. The transitional government is supposed to include civilians, and will arrange a referendum for a new constitution and new institutions. Mr. Rajoelina first came to power through a coup in 2009. He lost power after a 2013 election and then won office again in 2018 and 2023. Many of Mr. Rajoelina’s opponents boycotted the election two years ago, accusing him of manipulating the race in his favor by using state security forces to intimidate voters and stacking the national election commission with his allies. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, Madagascar, a country of nearly 32 million people, has struggled with political instability. Much of the population is poor, and the economy, which relies on agriculture, has been set back in recent years by a series of weather-related shocks .

4a88cc07c9a6,"Zelensky Revokes Odesa Mayor’s Citizenship, Amid Feud With Local Leaders","russian invasion of ukraine (2022), mayoral races, petro poroshenko, volodymyr zelensky, odessa ukraine, ukraine, citizenship, martial law","President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday revoked the Ukrainian citizenship of the mayor of Odesa, the country’s third-largest city, on the ground that he was a citizen of Russia, according to the country’s security services . The move, which effectively pushes the mayor out of office, marks the most dramatic escalation yet in a feud between the national authorities in Kyiv and local leaders across Ukraine. These local officials say that Mr. Zelensky is using wartime powers to tighten his grip on cities and regions governed by opposition politicians. The Odesa mayor, Hennady Trukhanov, who has been in office since 2014, denied in a statement that he held Russian citizenship and said he would appeal the decision before Ukraine’s Supreme Court. Ukrainian law bars the country’s citizens from holding Russian citizenship. Accusations that Mr. Trukhanov, a former member of a now-banned pro-Russia party, was a citizen of Russia have circulated for years. Ukraine’s security services said in 2016 that they had found no proof. Mr. Trukhanov has also been accused by Ukraine’s anti-corruption authorities of embezzling public money . Mr. Trukhanov has largely restrained his criticism of Mr. Zelensky during the war. But he has opposed certain policies, such as renaming streets and removing statues associated with imperial Russia . Odesa, a city heavily shaped by the Russian Empire, is full of such symbols. Mr. Zelensky’s action against Mr. Trukhanov comes amid rising tensions with mayors of other large cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv. Mr. Zelensky and his allies have accused the local leaders of mismanaging public services and failing to protect their cities from Russian air attacks. The mayors say that efforts to curtail their authority are aimed at concentrating power in Mr. Zelensky’s hands, and weakening his opponents as potential candidates in elections that he says will resume once the war is over. “Our president has been in power for six years, and only now he has suddenly discovered that Mr. Trukhanov allegedly has Russian citizenship,” Oleksii Potapskyi, head of the opposition party European Solidarity in the Odesa City Council, told a local news outlet . “You know, this is more of a political crackdown. It has nothing to do with democracy.” Earlier this year, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, accused Mr. Zelensky of abusing martial law powers to overrule the City Council. Around the same time, Ukraine’s national security council froze the bank accounts of former President Petro O. Poroshenko , whom Mr. Zelensky defeated in 2019 , without leveling any specific accusations. In late September, a petition was launched urging Mr. Zelensky to revoke Mr. Trukhanov’s Ukrainian citizenship. It quickly reached the 25,000 signatures required for the president to consider it. In recent days, Mr. Zelensky had publicly criticized the mayor, saying that efforts to restore power to Odesa and surrounding areas after Russian attacks had failed and that “there have been many mistakes by local authorities.” On Tuesday, Ukraine’s security services published a document resembling a Russian passport that bore Mr. Trukhanov’s name and face. They said that Mr. Trukhanov had received the document on Dec. 15, 2015, and that it was valid for 10 years. While stripping Mr. Trukhanov of his citizenship effectively ousts him from his position, he said he would continue to perform his duties until the City Council dismissed him. The national authorities did not say if they would move to expel Mr. Trukhanov from Ukraine or, if they did so, where he would be sent. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Zelensky, pointing to “security issues” in Odesa that he said had remained unaddressed, announced that he would establish a military administration for the city and would appoint its head shortly. Civil society groups in Ukraine have long raised concerns that the central government uses military administrators to consolidate authority, even on matters unrelated to defense. “Revoking Trukhanov’s citizenship and establishing the Odesa military administration is an open signal to every mayor that everyone is under scrutiny and, when the time comes, they’ll get to each of them,” Oleksii Honcharenko, a lawmaker from Mr. Poroshenko’s party, wrote on social media.

8c52a8298e3f,Newsom Vetoes California’s Ban on ‘Forever Chemicals’ in Cookware,"cookware and bakeware, hazmat, legislation, pfas, regulation and deregulation, cooking, water pollution, gavin newsom, david chang, rachael ray, marcus samuelsson, california","Gov. Gavin Newsom of California vetoed a bill that would phase out harmful “forever chemicals” used in nonstick cookware, saying he was worried it would make pots and pans more expensive for Californians. The veto, announced late Monday, is a victory for the cookware industry as well as for celebrity chefs and cooks who had defended the chemicals’ use, saying that nonstick pans are safe when used responsibly. Rachael Ray, David Chang and Marcus Samuelsson had all opposed the bill. Forever chemicals, also called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, have been widely used to coat nonstick cookware. The chemicals are also used in many other products, including waterproof boots and jackets, stain-proof carpets, dental floss and firefighting foams. The synthetic chemicals, which can accumulate in the body, have been linked to low birth weights, birth defects and developmental delays in infants as well as an increased risk of some prostate, kidney and testicular cancers. And when they end up in the environment — either during the manufacturing process, or from the products themselves — they can contaminate drinking water, agricultural land and even the air. The term “forever chemicals” comes from the fact that they don’t easily break down over time. The California bill would have phased out the use of PFAS chemicals in six product categories, including cookware; food packaging; dental floss; cleaning products; ski wax; and children’s products like crib mattresses, playpens and strollers. Mr. Newsom said that while he shared the bill’s goal to protect human health and the environment, he remained “deeply concerned about the impact this bill would have on the availability of affordable options in cooking products,” he said in his announcement. He encouraged backers of the measure to “continue discussions in this space, while ensuring that we are not sacrificing the ability of Californians to afford household products like cookware.” Steve Burns, president of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, which represents manufacturers, thanked Mr. Newsom “for recognizing and emphasizing the significant economic hardships this bill would have caused to millions of working Californians.” Environmental groups condemned the move. “Governor Newsom failed to protect Californians and our drinking water from toxic ‘forever chemicals,’” said Anna Reade, director of PFAS advocacy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. She pointed out that several other states had already passed laws to phase out PFAS from consumer products. “California is a laggard,” she said. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Ben Allen, Democrat of Santa Monica, said the veto meant Californians would ultimately shoulder the cost of cleaning up the chemicals. He also said that safer alternatives, such as pans made of cast iron or carbon steel, were available at reasonable prices. “While the manufacturers escape accountability, ratepayers and local governments have been struggling to keep up with the ballooning costs of cleaning these ‘forever chemicals’ from our water infrastructure,” he said. The debate over the bill garnered attention because several celebrity chefs and cooks, each with their own cookware lines, had come out in opposition, submitting letters to lawmakers urging them to vote against the bill. In a text message last month, Ms. Ray said she stood by her letter, which she had sent “after giving the issue much thought.” Nonstick pots and pans, she said in her letter to lawmakers, “are a key component of durable, affordable nonstick cookware used by millions of home cooks across the country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/climate/pfas-forever-chemicals-california-cookware-ban.html,World,Washington Post,By Hiroko Tabuchi,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14cli-chemicals-pans-hfkw/14cli-chemicals-pans-hfkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T16:47:58+00:00,7a23fffabcc8e5217462d25bc64ba71fa645bf69

Lt. Col. Tajul Islam Chowdhury, the director of the fire service, said that the fire broke out in Dhaka, the capital, around 11 a.m. on Tuesday. Sixteen dead were recovered from the garment factory, he said, but there could be more casualties at the nearby chemical warehouse, where the blaze was not yet under control. He said it was unclear how many people had been inside at the time. Bangladesh is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of ready-made garments. The industry employs millions of workers, most of whom are women. Working standards have improved since the collapse in 2013 of Rana Plaza , a building that housed several factories, killed more than 1,000 workers , but deadly fires are still reported frequently. Outside the buildings in Dhaka’s Mirpur area where the disaster occurred, anxious family members had gathered hoping for any information about their loved ones. Many of them were holding photos of young women outside the cordoned-off area. Mohammad Nayeem said that he was searching for his wife, Samia Akter, who worked at the garment factory and that officials had told him to look in area hospitals. “I went twice to Dhaka Medical, but couldn’t find her,” he said. “I still don’t know where she is.” It was unclear what chemicals were housed in the warehouse, and firefighters were proceeding with caution. In 2022, several firefighters died after they rushed into a similar facility housing chemicals. This time, the fire service was relying on drones and other technology to find the source of the blaze inside the warehouse.

4918f9a2ddc0,‘A Big Day’: How the U.S. and the Arab World Teamed Up to Seal the Gaza Deal,"israel gaza war, peace process, us foreign policy, international relations, politics, arabs, israel, hamas, ron dermer, jared kushner, benjamin netanyahu, steven witkoff, donald trump, egypt, qatar, gaza strip, kidnapping and hostages, internal-open-access-from-nl, military, terrorism","The Egyptian intelligence chief was briefing a roomful of negotiators on the state of play in the Gaza cease-fire talks when the prime minister of Qatar quietly slipped a handwritten note to Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. The note urged the two Americans to push the Israelis to compromise. It was the morning of Wednesday, Oct. 8. Mr. Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, and Mr. Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, had just arrived on a private plane in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for what they hoped would be a breakthrough, at last, in the negotiations to bring an eventual end to Israel’s two-year war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They had reason to be optimistic. For the first time, Hamas had signaled its readiness to release all the Israeli hostages without a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and as long as it received assurances Israel would not return to war. Giving up the hostages could deprive Israel of a reason to carry on the war. And Israel was ready to free thousands of Palestinians from its prisons, including 250 serving life sentences. But the talks were jammed. Negotiators who had been meeting for two days at the resort town’s international convention center had shied away from pressing Israel and Hamas on a thorny question: how much territory in Gaza the Israeli military would leave before the hostage and prisoner exchanges. They feared that getting into the details of the map could derail the talks altogether. This account is based on interviews with 15 officials from the United States, Israel and Arab governments involved in or briefed on the negotiations, all of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations and sensitive diplomacy. Both Israel and Hamas had taken maximalist positions. Hamas wanted Israel to pull out of Gaza entirely except for a narrow buffer zone along its border. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted Israeli troops to stay entrenched in some cities in Gaza to show his public and his hard-line ministers that he was making few concessions. Bridging that gap last Wednesday required steady American pressure on the lead Israeli negotiator, Ron Dermer, officials said, as the Qatari premier’s note had urged. It also took three calls to the mediators from Mr. Trump himself, U.S. officials said. Mr. Dermer’s office declined to comment. Hamas did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, the two sides more or less split the difference, Arab officials said. Israel would hold onto much more territory than Hamas wanted it to, but it would pull out of many built-up areas. Hamas grudgingly accepted the compromise, Arab and Israeli officials said. The mediators also knew that negotiating an agreement focused on the narrower issues of a cease-fire and hostage and prisoner exchange was more attainable than pushing for a grand deal that dealt with difficult questions around Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza and Hamas’s disarmament. The success of Wednesday’s talks, where earlier attempts had failed, reflected how, once enough pressure had been applied, seemingly huge impediments could be overcome, or at least set aside for later. In the past, the two sides had fallen back on absolutes. Israel insisted on “total victory,” and Hamas on a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza., A big complaint from mediators about Israel in prior talks was that its negotiators never really had a mandate from Mr. Netanyahu to make a deal. This time, the leaders of both delegations — Khalil al-Hayya, the top Hamas negotiator, and Mr. Dermer — came with a mandate to reach a deal, Arab and Israeli officials said. The talks were the culmination of dizzying weeks of diplomacy that began after the fallout over Israel’s botched strike against Hamas officials meeting in Qatar. By late September, Mr. Trump had announced a 20-point plan that, while short on many details, specifically called for the release of all hostages in exchange for an Israeli pullback in Gaza. Crucially, on Oct. 3, Mr. Trump chose to embrace Hamas’s statement on his Gaza plan, even though it only offered support for part of his proposal, namely the exchange of hostages and prisoners. At the same time, he made clear that Israel would need to cooperate with his effort to strike a deal or risk facing his wrath. Israel’s botched strike in Qatar had created an opening to apply such pressure. But a senior U.S. administration official credited Mr. Trump’s long-term approach to Mr. Netanyahu with allowing him to prod the Israeli leader in the direction of a deal. His staunch support gave Mr. Netanyahu confidence, the official said, that Mr. Trump would not ask him to do anything that would compromise Israeli security. As for Hamas, two years of the Israeli military’s offensive had left it severely weakened. Much of the Arab and Muslim world was now pressing Hamas, including a key patron, Turkey, whose intelligence chief was participating in the talks. And the militant group took seriously the threat that if it were seen as responsible for sinking Mr. Trump’s plan, Israel would have a free hand from Washington to carry on attacking Gaza, Arab officials said. In the past, Hamas had insisted on holding onto some Israeli hostages as leverage unless Israel fully withdrew from Gaza and ended the war. But the group came to believe that holding the hostages was giving Israel legitimacy to continue fighting the war, according to senior U.S. officials. “They were almost looking at the hostages less as an asset and more as a liability,” Mr. Witkoff said. By Wednesday afternoon in Sharm el-Sheikh, mediators felt they were finally getting close as they shuttled between Israeli and Hamas delegations. Under pressure from Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner, Israel was showing more willingness to accept a middle ground on the withdrawal. The Israeli negotiators came around to thinking that while they would effectively be giving up control over half of Gaza, they could keep the other half to pressure Hamas to make more concessions in future talks about postwar governance, Israeli and Arab officials said. Mr. al-Hayya, who had survived an Israeli assassination attempt weeks earlier in Doha, said he needed to consult with other members of Hamas’s leadership. A convoy of black S.U.V.s brought him and three other officials in the militant group back to their residence, Arab officials said. The Hamas officials were gone for so long that the Qatari prime minister instructed a top aide, Abdulla al-Slaiti, to chase them down at their residence, officials said. Mr. al-Hayya was only ready to inform mediators of Hamas’s decision at 10 p.m. — five hours after they left the talks. By then, the Israeli, American, Turkish, Qatari and Egyptian teams had already dispersed to their villas at the Four Seasons in Sharm el-Sheikh, a sprawling beachside resort. The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and the Egyptian intelligence chief, Gen. Hassan Rashad, were sitting in General Rashad’s villa when Mr. al-Hayya approached, officials said. Mr. al-Hayya told the mediators that even though Hamas considered the deal unfair, its priority was to stop Israel’s bombings in Gaza, according to officials. Hamas, he said, still hoped the mediators would do everything they could to improve the deal for Palestinians. Though cloaked in dissatisfaction, Mr. al-Hayya’s response was nonetheless clearly a yes. Both Mr. Al Thani and General Rashad began to sense that the longest war between Israelis and Palestinians might be edging toward an end. Minutes later, Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner came to General Rashad’s villa to hear the positive response and quickly relayed it to the White House, Arab officials said. Around that time, Mr. Witkoff held a quick but rare meeting with Mr. al-Hayya, in which he said the United States would ensure that Israel upheld its commitments, if Hamas followed through with its own, officials said. Axios first reported on the meeting. Some issues were still unresolved, like the names of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel, and mediators debated the merits of announcing the deal right away. But the mediators concluded that the outstanding issues were not deal-breakers, and said that Mr. Trump could issue a statement announcing an agreement. In Washington, Mr. Trump was hosting an event at the White House when Secretary of State Marco Rubio passed him a note. “Very close,” the note read. “We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.” Egyptian officials, sitting alongside an Israeli intelligence official, had finished making the final edits to the agreement’s text. Mr. Al Thani signed the agreement first, before approaching Mr. Dermer with an English copy and, separately, Mr. al-Hayya with an Arabic one, officials said. At 1 a.m., one of the American negotiators took a call from Mr. Trump and put him on speaker so the president could address the room. “It’s a big day,” the president said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/middleeast/us-arab-gaza-deal.html,World,Washington Post,"By Adam Rasgon, David M.

Gianni Infantino, the president of global soccer’s governing body, FIFA, was the only sports official at Monday’s summit and the only dignitary without a political role. He posed for photos with President Trump and with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. He promised to help reconstruct sports fields destroyed in Gaza and said he traveled to Egypt at Mr. Trump’s invitation. “It’s something that is really important for FIFA to be here,” Mr. Infantino said on Instagram in a polished highlight video showcasing his interactions with world leaders. Mr. Infantino has made it his business to be where Mr. Trump is, no matter the agenda of the day. Mr. Infantino gave remarks at a 2020 dinner for business executives hosted by Mr. Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. During the Covid pandemic that year, he traveled to Washington for the signing of the Abraham Accords that established diplomatic ties between Israel and multiple Arab nations. He also secured a prominent seat this year at Mr. Trump’s second inauguration and has appeared in the Oval Office many times since. Mr. Infantino has been one of Mr. Trump’s biggest boosters since his first term, when the United States secured co-hosting rights to the 2026 World Cup. FIFA opened an office in Trump Tower this year. He has talked up Mr. Trump in glowing terms — last week, he called for him to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in Gaza — and in return has been rewarded with the sort of attention and access that Mr. Trump reserves for his top aides and allies. The closeness of their relationship has prompted criticism , including from other soccer officials, over whether Mr. Infantino should be forming such a close public bond with one global leader. FIFA has strict rules on political interference in soccer, and FIFA executives and other soccer officials have privately expressed concern about Mr. Infantino’s behavior around Mr. Trump, according to some of the officials. Mr. Trump has called Mr. Infantino “the king of soccer.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

The Socialists do not want to be a crutch for an unpopular Mr. Macron, which could harm their standing ahead of municipal elections in 2026 and the presidential elections in 2027. But neither do they want a budget crunch and snap elections that polls show are likely to favor the nationalist, anti-immigration National Rally party. “Let us not pretend that the greatest crisis threatening us is not, first and foremost, that of a far right at the gates of power,” Mr. Vallaud said in the lower house on Tuesday. Some Socialists are tempted to use their leverage to wrest still more concessions from Mr. Lecornu. In his speech, Mr. Lecornu beseeched divided lawmakers to end the political turmoil and work with the government. He said he aimed to keep the budget deficit below 5 percent in 2026, including by fixing “anomalies” on taxes for the very wealthy.

The Public Says No, Thanks.","international relations, foreign workers, us foreign policy, communist party of china, people's daily, hu xijin, xi jinping, donald trump, china, us, india, internal-open-access-from-nl","When the Chinese government announced a new visa to attract young science and technology talent , it advertised the move as another step toward becoming the leading scientific power, one to which people from around the globe would flock. To many in China, it was a gross mistake. In the days before and since Oct. 1, when the visa was supposed to come into effect, commenters have accused the government of inviting foreigners to steal jobs from Chinese people, at a time when young people are finding it harder than ever to land work. They have suggested that foreigners are being blindly worshiped, a longstanding national sore point. Prominent influencers have also stoked nationalism or xenophobia, claiming that China will be overrun by outsiders. After Henry Huiyao Wang, the president of the Center for China and Globalization, a research group in Beijing, praised the new visa, people on social media called him a race traitor, and their posts were shared thousands of times. Platforms have been especially flooded by racist comments about Indians, after Indian news outlets reported on the Chinese visa as a possible alternative to the highly popular H-1B visa in the United States, which now comes with a $100,000 fee. The backlash grew so fierce that the Chinese Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, People’s Daily, published an editorial calling criticisms of the visa “outlandish” and accusing opponents of misleading the public. Hu Xijin, the former editor in chief of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, defended the policy, saying in a video that he saw fewer foreigners in China than in Japan or South Korea. “To be honest, it’s not that there are too many foreigners coming to China right now,” he said, “but rather that there aren’t enough.” The public outcry suggests that China may still struggle to attract the world’s best and brightest scientists, even as the United States has cut research funding and pushed many prominent scholars to consider leaving. Anti-foreign sentiment has grown in China in recent years, as the government has warned of hostile overseas powers and urged people to report potential spies . China has historically had minuscule levels of inbound immigration, and many cultural and legal barriers remain for foreigners seeking to remain long-term. When the government proposed slightly loosening permanent residency requirements for foreigners in 2020, it eventually retreated in the face of a similar backlash . (China granted fewer than 5,000 permanent residency cards between 2004 and 2014, according to People’s Daily .) Even in defending the policy, the People’s Daily editorial assured readers that the visa would make it easier for young scientists to come to China, but that it “cannot be equated with immigration.” It is unclear whether the visa would even grant the right to work, as opposed to simply allowing people to conduct business and educational “exchanges,” as state media said after the visa was announced. Eligibility details have not yet been released, even though the launch date has passed. Officials have said only that applicants would need to have obtained a bachelor’s degree in science, technology, math or engineering from a top university. The difficult job market for young people has been a potential flashpoint for years, as China grapples with slowing growth. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has said that ensuring employment is key to preventing social unrest. The latest jobs figures, released in August , show youth unemployment at a new high. “Among people from every walk of life, educational background and age group I’ve met, everyone says: Work is hard to find,” a popular manga author who uses the pen name Feng Xi Shen Lei wrote on social media . “Given the talent pool in China, I don’t believe that there’s any position in any field that must be filled by a foreigner.” Commenters also attacked the requirement that applicants need only a bachelor’s degree. Many young Chinese say that they need advanced degrees to find jobs, because of stiff competition. In reality, foreigners who enter on K visas may not directly be competing with most of the unemployed young Chinese. That is in part because of a mismatch between supply and demand in China’s job market. Many recent graduates are struggling to find jobs because the sectors that have historically employed most of them, such as real estate or education, are suffering. But in fields such as advanced manufacturing or artificial intelligence, China needs tens of millions more qualified candidates than it has, according to the Ministry of Education . Though China produces the most science and technology graduates in the world by numbers, those graduates make up a smaller proportion of the total work force than in many Western countries. Denis Simon, the former executive vice chancellor of Duke Kunshan University and an advocate for more scientific cooperation between the United States and China, said that greater transparency about how the visas will be granted could help ease people’s concerns. But he said Beijing was sending a clear signal that it wanted to bring in more foreign expertise. “This is part of the longer-term reforms needed to attract high-end talent,” he said.

The strike was led by the country’s major trade unions, who object to proposed changes in laws that affect pensions, working conditions and salaries. The strike is the latest in a series organized by the trade unions since a new federal coalition government took office earlier this year, vowing to put Belgium’s ailing budget in order. The police estimated that 80,000 people protested on Tuesday. At Brussels Airport, Belgium’s largest, all departing flights and around half of incoming flights were canceled as security staff and baggage handlers joined the strike, an airport official said. More than 300 flights and 48,000 passengers were affected. All flights were canceled at Charleroi Airport, the country’s second largest, an official there said. Trains within Belgium ran as usual, but public transit was disrupted in Brussels and elsewhere. In the region of Flanders, four out of 10 buses and trams were not in service, an official there said. Protesters gathered at Brussels North Station in the morning, with some setting off firecrackers and flares, and marched through the city center to Brussels South Station. At around noon, the police arrested several dozen protesters after a government building on Pacheco Boulevard was vandalized with projectiles, paint bombs and firecrackers, the police said in a statement. In July, the government proposed changes in laws governing pensions, the labor market, health care and taxation in what Prime Minister Bart De Wever called “the biggest socio-economic reforms of the century.” Unions and opposition parties criticized the proposals as eroding the country’s welfare system.

The agency, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., said that it suspected a group called the Russian Antiwar Committee of plotting to overthrow the government. The committee, which was founded by the anti-Kremlin tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, includes exiled politicians, law professors and other prominent professionals. The F.S.B. accused Mr. Khodorkovsky, who was imprisoned for 10 years in Russia on what his lawyers called politically motivated charges, of setting up a “terrorist organization.” In a statement , the agency said that the committee aimed to “seize power by force and change the constitutional order in Russia” by funding Ukrainian Army units and recruiting individuals inside Russia. The criminal case signals how closely President Vladimir V. Putin is watching anti-Kremlin activity abroad as Russia pursues its perceived enemies across international borders, including in some cases with poisonings and shootings . The Russian authorities appear to be particularly concerned with recent moves in Europe. The Council of Europe, an intergovernmental organization that is dedicated to upholding democracy, human rights and the rule of law on the continent, adopted a resolution to create a “platform for dialogue with Russian democratic forces.” That forum would help exiled Russians engage with Europe on their opposition to the Putin government, as well as on issues faced by the hundreds of thousands of anti-Kremlin exiles abroad. Participants are expected to include those who signed a 2023 declaration by the Russian Antiwar Committee condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In its statement on Tuesday, the F.S.B. referred to the actions of the Council of Europe as setting up an “alternative to power structures” in Russia. Mr. Khodorkovsky, in a social media post , linked the terrorism accusations to the antiwar committee’s efforts to set up the democracy forum. The Kremlin sees his committee’s cooperation with the Council of Europe as “a big problem,” he said. “That’s why we have this new investigation into an ‘overthrow of the government’, and lies about ‘recruitment’ or ‘weapons for the Ukrainian Army,’” he noted. Most of the 23 suspects named by the F.S.B. are Russian professionals who have not declared any political ambitions. Some of them once sat on Mr. Putin’s council for human rights or advised the government in an independent capacity before the war. The Russian Antiwar Committee brings together a wide variety of Russian civil society. Its members include Mikhail M. Kasyanov , Mr. Putin’s first prime minister; Sergei Guriev , who is now dean of the London Business School; and other prominent academics such as the political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. The group, which was set up by Mr. Khodorkovsky shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion to “help address the consequences of Putin’s aggression,” has not made any public calls for violence.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/europe/russia-antiwar-ukraine-terrorism.html,World,Washington Post,By Nataliya Vasilyeva,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/world/14intl-russia-antiwar-committee-Khodorkovsky/14intl-russia-antiwar-committee-Khodorkovsky-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T12:48:14+00:00,6cc8ff20c472615384e8651cfd5833c381eb5490

But for all the celebrations over his removal, there were also big questions on what comes next. After Parliament voted overwhelmingly to impeach Mr. Rajoelina on Tuesday, soldiers quickly entered the presidential palace and announced they would be dissolving all of Madagascar’s major institutions — including the highest court, the electoral commission and the Senate — but leaving in place the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. Mr. Rajoelina, who just a day earlier said he had gone into hiding because of threats on his life, swiftly issued a statement condemning “the illegal declaration made today by a faction of renegade military” and insisted that he “remains fully in power.” The developments capped a turbulent 24 hours of political maneuvering and left Madagascar’s future leadership in question at a time the country relies heavily on foreign aid and instability could lead to international isolation. The country had been roiled by protests for weeks over the government’s failure to provide basic needs, including reliable water and electricity. But the immediate aftermath of the impeachment and military takeover was euphoria in Antananarivo, the capital. Thousands gathered at a plaza in the center of the city to celebrate what they believed was Mr. Rajoelina’s ouster. Led by young people who have taken inspiration from Gen Z protest movements worldwide, the revelers danced to reggae, waved Malagasy flags and chanted expletives to let Mr. Rajoelina, 51, know that he must go. Some of the president’s detractors say that he is too beholden to France, Madagascar’s former colonial ruler, and that he has squandered the country’s potential. Madagascar, with a population of 32 million, is rich in mineral resources and biodiversity, and is the largest producer of vanilla in the world. “He is the reason why we suffer,” said Eddy Bessa, a 35-year-old artist, celebrating with the crowd with a Malagasy flag tucked into his dreadlocks. “He is the reason for the corruption. He is the reason for jobless people. And he is the reason why our country lost our own culture.” Despite the joy, it was far from certain that the military takeover would end the corruption that had ignited the protests. Mr. Rajoelina (pronounced rah-JOE-el) himself came to power in 2009 through a coup in which he was assisted by the same military unit, CAPSAT, that is now leading the takeover. And across Africa, military control following youth-led movements has often led to more upheaval. Speaking in front of the presidential palace in Antananarivo, Col. Michael Randrianirina, who is serving as the country’s interim leader, announced the formation of a transitional government that he said would last for no more than two years. The transitional government would include civilians, and would arrange a referendum to create a new constitution and new institutions, said Colonel Randrianirina. When Madagascar’s security forces turned against Mr. Rajoelina and joined the protesters over the weekend, it sparked rumors that the president had fled the country. He announced in an address posted on social media Monday night that he was in a safe place on a mission abroad, but did not confirm his location. He defiantly bucked expectations that he would resign, saying that he would stay in power and named a litany of measures he was undertaking to address protesters’ concerns, particularly frequent electricity and water outages. In response to Mr. Rajoelina’s resistance, opposition lawmakers led an effort to hold an impeachment vote in the National Assembly. Before they could do so, Mr. Rajoelina dissolved the body, posting on social media that the decision was “necessary to restore order within our nation and strengthen democracy. The people must be heard once again.” Members of Parliament dismissed the move to dissolve the body as unconstitutional because it had been posted it on social media and was not formally signed or stamped. During the vote, lawmakers read a list of allegations against Mr. Rajoelina, including abuse of power, illegal commercial transactions and giving improper gifts. Lawmakers then approached the front of the chamber one by one, putting paper ballots into a cardboard box. When the voting was completed, a speaker read the ballots one at a time. Once he reached the 105-vote threshold needed to impeach, many lawmakers stood and cheered. The vote was the first presidential impeachment in the country since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960. “I am free from my chains,” several lawmakers chanted as they waved their arms. “I was a slave, but now I am free.” Alban Menavolo, an independent member of Parliament, said the Gen Z protesters did the right thing by taking their grievances to the streets, and that now lawmakers were doing their part. “The international community needs to recognize what the military does now because they are really thinking about the Malagasy people’s future,” he said. Mr. Rajoelina issued a statement saying that the impeachment process was unconstitutional because the meeting of Parliament did not receive the proper decree. Even though he has questioned the legality of his ouster, Mr. Rajoelina appears to have few options to cling to power. As cars and motorbikes honked their horns in celebration along Independence Avenue in Antananarivo after sunset, the masses of screaming young people appeared certain that the days of Mr. Rajoelina, who was in his third term, were over. Several people said they trusted that the military would steer the country in the right direction, but did not want to dwell too much on what lies ahead. That was for another day. “Today,” said Sandy Rasoarimalala, 33, “is a victory.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/africa/madagascar.html,World,Washington Post,By John Eligon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14int-madagascar-new1-tbzw/14int-madagascar-new1-tbzw-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-14T12:12:43+00:00,973150f3ade179450854e2748771f02a85082eca
6665e7acba1d,"To Meet Pledges to Save Forests Spending Must Triple, U.N. Report Says","climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, forests, conservation of resources, un, foreign aid, agriculture","Nations are not spending enough to ensure that the forests that cover nearly a third of the planet remain healthy, according to a new United Nations report . To meet various international climate, biodiversity and land restoration goals, annual global spending needs to triple to $300 billion by 2030, the report found. Forests are the “quintessential definition of a public good,” because of the benefits they provide, said Gabriel Labbate, who leads the climate mitigation unit at the U.N. Environmental Program and is one of the lead authors of the analysis. By providing habitat to more than 80 percent of all animals, plants and insects on land, healthy forests are key to sustaining life on Earth. They also help regulate weather patterns and the global climate. Trees and other plants absorb atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide as they grow, which offsets some of the greenhouse gases that are emitted from the burning of fossil fuels and are dangerously heating the planet. The report estimated that roughly 25 million acres are destroyed each year for human industries and extreme wildfires, which are increasing in frequency and intensity as the planet warms. In 2023 and 2024, wildfires consumed some 78 million acres — an area roughly three times the size of Iceland — worldwide. As a result, during those years forests absorbed only a quarter of the carbon they captured 100 years ago. Governments from more than 140 countries signed a declaration at a U.N. climate conference in Glasgow in 2021 agreeing to halt or reverse deforestation by 2030 . In 2023, the world spent some $84 billion protecting forests. The new report used a wide range of data to analyze as many sources of funding as possible, from governments and private institutions, that protect all forest types, from tropical rainforests to boreal forests in the Arctic. There are many ways money can help a forest. For example, governments, aid programs or conservations groups may pay to protect wilderness areas from logging or to support tree-planting efforts. The report found that private institutions, like banks, venture capital firms and corporations, contribute less than $1 out of every $10 that goes toward protecting or restoring forested areas. Governments provide all the rest. This means forests depend on “a lot of taxpayer money,” Mr. Labbate said. Most money for forest conservation and restoration comes from wealthier countries, with China and the United States accounting for nearly half of all funding, according to the report. Tropical countries, which tend to be less wealthy but harbor some of the world’s most vulnerable forests, spent the least. Many are burdened by debt and can’t invest in conservation, said Frances Seymour, a senior policy adviser with the Woodwell Climate Research Center, a nonprofit organization. Farmers trying to make a living or politicians trying to stimulate the economy may end up supporting industries that cut down trees. “It is in everybody’s interest to protect the forest,” said Ms. Seymour. “But nobody gets paid for protecting a forest.” International aid to help tropical countries is also lacking, the report found. Tropical countries spend on average 36 times as much money as they receive from the World Bank and various other global programs to save forests. The report found governments tend to spend within their borders, meaning countries prioritize conservation at home. In the private sector, companies that the U.N. considers likely to increase deforestation attract nearly $9 trillion in investment annually, more than 1,000 times the amount of private money spent protecting forests, according to the report. Agriculture, for instance, received some $400 billion in subsidies in 2023, but causes a lot of deforestation. In the Amazon rainforest, the equivalent of a football field is lost every six seconds to make room for expanding cattle ranches and soy farms. Carbon markets have emerged as a potential way to fund conservation. These are unregulated systems that let businesses offset a portion of their greenhouse gas emissions by paying for projects that protect or restore natural areas. But carbon credits represent only less than 2 percent of the money spent on forests, the report found. At the end of September, a coalition of 34 governments released a plan for financing forest conservation, meant to steer conversations at next month’s U.N. climate conference in Brazil, known as COP30. The plan includes recommendations for improving carbon credits. The same week, Brazil announced it would invest $1 billion into the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a fund that would compensate countries for preserving tropical forests setting aside 20 percent of the money for Indigenous groups. The U.N. report found Indigenous and local groups have been the most effective at protecting the world’s forests, managing over a third of them. But they have received only 13 percent of global money for forest conservation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/climate/deforestation-united-nations-report.html,World,Washington Post,By Sachi Kitajima Mulkey,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14cli-forest-finance-wczt/14cli-forest-finance-wczt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T12:00:06+00:00,1c2db903bcc9efa2b075e568eeb3a5736f85adc0

Ms. Machado was awarded the prize for what the Norwegian Nobel Committee said was “her tireless work promoting democratic rights,” putting attention on the government of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela did not attribute the closure to the peace prize selection, saying it was part of a wider realignment of its diplomacy. In a statement posted on social media, Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said it was reallocating resources to focus on establishing alliances with the Global South. The statement added that Venezuela would also close its embassy in Australia and open new ones in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso. The moves were meant to “defend national sovereignty and actively contribute to the construction of a new world order based on justice, solidarity, and inclusion,” officials said in the statement.

662d0febb076,"Israel Pressures Hamas to Return Bodies, but Gaza’s Destruction Poses Challenge","israel gaza war, hamas, kidnapping and hostages, israel, gaza strip, internal-open-access-from-nl","Israeli officials and hostage families have accused Hamas of violating the new cease-fire deal by failing to immediately return the remains of many of the former captives still in Gaza. The truce agreement called for the immediate handover of all remaining bodies in Gaza, but acknowledged that some could be difficult to locate and may take more time to retrieve because of the destruction. Gaza was highly urbanized before the war, but two years of Israeli strikes have turned large parts of it into a flattened landscape of cement rubble. On Monday, Hamas returned only four bodies out of the roughly two dozen remaining, angering Israelis who had been expecting many more to come home. But late Tuesday night, the Israeli military said it had been informed that the Red Cross received four more coffins with the remains of hostages. A statement from the prime minister’s office around midnight said that Israeli forces had received those remains and that they were being transferred to Israel for identification. After the identification process, families will be notified, it said. The Israeli government has been weighing measures to penalize Hamas for not turning over more bodies, according to two diplomats briefed by Israeli officials and three Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics. Those steps could include limiting the number of trucks carrying supplies into Gaza and suspending the import of fuel and cooking gas, the two diplomats said. Other officials said Israel was also considering keeping the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed for the same reason. Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, accused Hamas of failing “to uphold its commitments” but stopped short of threatening any immediate military action, suggesting the cease-fire may hold. “The urgent task we are all committed to now is ensuring the return of all the bodies of the hostages home,” he said on social media . “Any deliberate delay or refusal will be considered a blatant violation of the agreement and will be met accordingly.” President Trump also criticized Hamas on Tuesday, saying in a post on Truth Social that “the job is not done.” “The dead have not been returned, as promised,” he wrote. Mr. Trump also claimed that Hamas had agreed to disarm, though the group has not publicly confirmed that it would. “They said they’re going to disarm and if they don’t disarm, we will disarm them,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he believed it would happen in a “reasonable time.” On Tuesday night, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a video statement that he expected more bodies to be released “in the next several hours.” A Hamas official said Tuesday that the group was committed to releasing all the bodies, as agreed in the cease-fire reached last week. But the widespread devastation in Gaza was making it difficult to retrieve all remains quickly, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Under the truce deal, Israel is required to release the bodies of 15 deceased Palestinian prisoners in exchange for every deceased hostage returned by Hamas. It began to fulfill that pledge on Tuesday by releasing 45 bodies to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. But an official at the hospital, Dr. Mohammed Zaqot, said that Israel had handed over the bodies with no identification, only a number that had been assigned to each one. The truce deal outlined how the remains of former hostages in Gaza might be located and returned if Hamas was unable to do so right away. It calls for the establishment of a joint task force, to include the United States and other mediators, that would share information and help find the remaining bodies, according to three Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak publicly. These officials said Israel believed that Hamas knew the location of many, but not all, of the bodies. The group will need to conduct its own investigation to find some of them, one of the officials said, and will need to speak with other militant factions in Gaza, clear rubble and inspect collapsed tunnels. For the families who did not receive the remains of their loved ones on Monday, it was a bitter coda to an otherwise joyous day, when the country celebrated the release of the last 20 living hostages from Gaza and Palestinians welcomed home nearly 2,000 prisoners freed by Israel in exchange. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main advocacy group for the hostages and their relatives, said on Monday that it was “calling for the immediate suspension of all agreement implementation until every deceased individual is returned.” It said the return of only four bodies was a “violation of the agreement” that must be met with a serious response from the government and the mediators. “If Hamas does not fulfill their part, Israel should not fulfill its part either,” the group said. Mr. Netanyahu’s office identified the four bodies returned by Hamas as those of Guy Iluz, Yossi Sharabi, Daniel Peretz and Bipin Joshi, a citizen of Nepal. Mr. Illouz was kidnapped from the Nova music festival and died in captivity at age 26 after not receiving adequate medical care for injuries he sustained during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Israeli military said. The attack ignited the war in Gaza. Mr. Joshi was killed in captivity in the early months of the war after he was abducted at age 23 from a shelter in Kibbutz Alumim, the military said. The Hostage Families Forum said Mr. Peretz had been a tank platoon commander who immigrated to Israel from South Africa at age 13. He died on Oct. 7 at the age of 22, and his body was taken to Gaza. Mr. Sharabi was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri and died in captivity several months later at the age of 53, the forum said. It said he moved to the kibbutz decades ago to be with his brother, Eli, who was also kidnapped but was released earlier this year. Gal Hirsch, the coordinator for hostages and missing people in the office of Mr. Netanyahu, told the families of the hostages whose bodies had not been returned that the government was committed to bringing their remains home and applying pressure on Hamas. “The mission is not yet complete,” he said on Tuesday. “We are absolutely determined and fully committed — we will not stop until all the fallen hostages are located and brought home.” On Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was assisting with the “dignified” handling of the deceased, including by providing body bags and refrigerated trucks and by deploying personnel to assist the authorities in Israel. “Families grieving the loss of their loved ones have already endured unimaginable pain,” the group said. “All parties must ensure that the return of human remains is done under dignified conditions.” Ameera Harouda and Natan Odenheimer contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/middleeast/israeli-hostages-bodies-hamas.html,World,Washington Post,By Liam Stack and Aaron Boxerman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14int-israel-gaza-remains-top1-qhcf/14int-israel-gaza-remains-top1-qhcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T11:27:10+00:00,33c194c9047fc28031f25830b2e894ebe3186fbb
8ec2c537afa5,"Trump Dangles $20 Billion Lifeline for Argentina, With Strings Attached","argentina, us, us economy, foreign aid, foreign investment, treasury department, scott bessent, javier milei, donald trump, internal-open-access-from-nl","President Trump said on Tuesday that Washington’s $20 billion bailout for Argentina comes with strings attached — namely, that the ruling party of his ally, President Javier Milei of Argentina, must prevail in the country’s legislative elections this month. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, where he was meeting with Mr. Milei. Just minutes earlier, Mr. Trump had denied the economic lifeline was meant to help Mr. Milei’s party in the elections. “I think he’s going to win,” Mr. Trump added. “And if he wins, we’re staying with him, and if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.” Mr. Trump’s comments made clear that he viewed the financial support for Argentina as a lifeline not just for the country’s economy, but also for a leader willing to spread his pro-capitalist — and pro-Trump — ideology in Latin America. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” Mr. Trump said, adding that financial success of Argentina would be a “great feather in the cap of the U.S.A.” Mr. Trump’s bailout of Argentina has come with political blowback at home. Democrats have seized on the bailout to accuse Mr. Trump of helping out a foreign government and wealthy investors while the U.S. government remains shut down because of a dispute over extending health care subsidies. Major hedge funds, including those led by friends of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, could benefit financially from the bailout. Funds at investment firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco are heavily invested in Argentina, as are investors who worked with Mr. Bessent when he was an investor for George Soros. “President Trump seems to think it’s more important to offer $20 billion to bail out Argentina than it is to make a bipartisan deal to prevent health insurance premiums from spiking for over 20 million Americans in a matter of days,” Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. American farmers have also criticized the move, given that China has been buying soybeans from Argentine farmers instead of American growers this year. Mr. Trump on Tuesday said he believed China was trying to drive a wedge between the United States and Argentina by buying soybeans from Latin America. Mr. Bessent has defended the administration’s economic support for Argentina, arguing that it could help stabilize the Western Hemisphere and that it is an investment that U.S. business leaders have sought to deepen ties with Argentina. He added that providing U.S. support to Mr. Milei’s opponents, who are not willing to enact a suite of economic changes, would be a waste of money. The face-to-face meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Milei comes after the Trump administration agreed to provide Argentina a $20 billion lifeline that would come in the form of a currency swap with the nation’s central bank. The details of the bailout remain unclear, but it could provide a political boost for Mr. Milei, who is hoping to stave off a financial crisis and a political disaster for his party . The conditioning of the U.S. support on the electoral success of a political ally, rather than strictly the risk of a financial collapse that could hurt an economic partner, was highly unusual, according to economists. Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Clinton administration had stepped in to help Mexico avoid a financial crisis, but the motivation then was to help stabilize the economy of a trading partner. When that administration provided an emergency loan to South Korea in 1998, it was meant to prevent the collapse of a financial system, not to influence the outcome of an election. “In both cases, there was a significant risk of financial contagion to other countries, which is not the case of Argentina today,” Mr. Eichengreen said. “In both cases, the U.S. was significantly exposed to instability in the subject country either economically or financially. Neither condition applies today in Argentina.” In Argentina, however, Mr. Trump has found a leader that amounts to a political kindred spirit. He has described the Argentine leader as his “favorite president,” and Mr. Milei was one of only two world leaders onstage at Mr. Trump’s inauguration. A government bailout would typically be handled through the International Monetary Fund, which would establish a framework for the nation in financial duress. The I.M.F. has provided Argentina with more than 20 economic support packages since the 1950s, including as recently as this April. However, its economy has continued to lurch from crisis to crisis.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/trump-argentina-leader-bailout.html,World,Washington Post,By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Alan Rappeport,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14dc-prexy1-cmbq/14dc-prexy1-cmbq-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,2025-10-14T10:01:26+00:00,199b9ce809934a1bae862fba8befff949caa95cd
d312464192fb,Now Comes the Hard Part for the Gaza Cease-Fire Plan,"israel gaza war, peace process, palestinians, hamas, donald trump, benjamin netanyahu, gaza strip, israel, international relations, war;armed conflicts","Getting Israel’s hostages released from Gaza and stopping the war may have taken two years and the direct efforts of the American president and the leaders of several Arab and Muslim nations. But that was almost certainly the easy part. Getting Hamas to give up its weapons, and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip — key preconditions for Israel to pull out of Gaza fully, as both President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Monday — could prove a lot harder. Then there are the other issues in Mr. Trump’s 20-point plan, which outlined a comprehensive solution for Gaza. In full, it also called for the establishment of an international force to help maintain security in the territory, an ambitious effort to rebuild Gaza’s economy and infrastructure, and the creation of a temporary Palestinian governing committee, whose work would be overseen by an international board. During the talks leading up to the cease-fire in Gaza, provisions for who would run the enclave on “the day after” the war was over were among the most complicated and vexing — so much so that they were eventually severed from the cease-fire talks and put off until a second phase of negotiations. That phase had at least an air of auspiciousness on Monday evening in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where Mr. Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt gathered dozens of leaders to try to build on the momentum created by the truce and the exchange of 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of others for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. “Phase 2 has started,” Mr. Trump said. He predicted “tremendous progress.” “It’s peace in the Middle East,” he said. “Everyone said it’s not possible to do. And it’s going to happen.” Yet, Monday’s kickoff in Sharm el-Sheikh aside, it is unclear even when Phase 2 talks will formally begin and where they will be held. And both Israeli and Palestinian analysts said it was easier to imagine things going sideways than to imagine Mr. Trump’s plan being fully realized. “The main issue still hasn’t been solved: Hamas’s weapons,” said Akram Atallah, a London-based Palestinian columnist originally from Jabaliya, in the northern Gaza Strip. “The Israelis are demanding Hamas disarm, which is not a simple administrative measure. Hamas was founded on the basis of bearing arms.” Hamas, he said, is effectively being asked to “dismantle its ideology.” With the halt to a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and lain waste to much of Gaza, Mr. Atallah said that the current atmosphere was more optimistic but that it was uncertain how long that would last. “It feels good right now,” he said, “but I can see dark clouds in the distance and I don’t know what they’re carrying.” Israeli analysts and officials said the likeliest outcome was that Phase 2 of the talks would become bogged down. They envisioned the status quo lingering for so long that it takes root, with Hamas still armed, and the Israeli military refusing to withdraw fully from Gaza. In that circumstance, they also foresaw the Israeli military treating the group much as it now treats Hezbollah in Lebanon: occasionally striking Hamas militants or their weapon depots from afar. Despite Mr. Trump’s repeated, unqualified declarations that the war is over, backsliding on either side could threaten a renewal of fighting, analysts said. “If there’s a terrorist attack against one of our posts right now, God forbid, and we have casualties, after a minute, it’s over,” said Zohar Palti, a former senior Mossad and Ministry of Defense official. Nimrod Novik, a former Israeli envoy and distinguished fellow at the Israel Policy Forum, warned of the influence of domestic politics. “If it turns out in four or five weeks that the general mood in the country is that this war was an awful round, but only another round, and Hamas is back, I can see Netanyahu trying to correct that,” Mr. Novik said, alluding to the possibility of a resumption of hostilities. “All you need is a Hamas provocation and a disproportionate Israeli reaction, and you can have a spiral.” It was up to Qatar, Turkey and Egypt — the three Muslim-majority countries that played major roles in mediating the Hamas-Israel cease-fire — “to pressure Hamas not to provoke,” Mr. Novik said. To members of Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, the onus is squarely on Hamas. Several officials described the cease-fire agreement so far as amounting to a simple trade in which Israel gave away roughly half of Gaza in exchange for its hostages. To get Israel to leave the rest of Gaza’s territory, they said, it will need to give up its arms and let another entity step in to govern the enclave. “Things are very straightforward,” said Boaz Bismuth, a Netanyahu ally who heads the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee. “If you don’t want Israel to be there, you know exactly what you have to do. It’s easy.” But saying so doesn’t make it so. Hamas, experts close to the militant group said, is willing to make certain moves to enable the reconstruction of Gaza, but it still wants to retain some influence over the territory’s future. “Hamas is willing to offer some concessions to enable the rehabilitation of Gaza, but it will not evaporate,” said Ibrahim al-Madhoun, a Palestinian analyst close to Hamas. “Its focus is on quiet. It wants to be part of the solution, and it won’t be an obstacle to stability.” Mr. Palti, the former Israeli intelligence and defense official, expressed skepticism over the Trump plan’s prescription that Hamas be barred from either a military or civilian role in governing Gaza. “Who’s going to do it?” he said. “If somebody thinks that with a magic stick you’re achieving this revolution in hours or days, forget about it. It’s not going to happen. Not because I’m pessimistic; because I’m realistic.” The deployment of an international stabilization force, as the plan suggests, could lead the Israeli military to withdraw further. But it is still largely unknown which countries would contribute to the force, how it would be funded and trained, and when it would deploy. And the Palestinian Authority, which previously governed Gaza and still has employees on the ground, appears to be largely excluded from Mr. Trump’s initiative, barring the completion of unspecified reforms. All of which is not to say that Phase 2 is doomed from the outset. Mr. Bismuth, the lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s party, took great encouragement from the participation of Arab countries in the peace talks, and even more from Monday’s release of 20 Israelis held in Gaza since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. “I do believe that those who have to do the specific moves expected from them will do them,” he said. “When you have such results like today, you can believe in the optimistic scenario.” Natan Odenheimer contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/middleeast/gaza-talks-phase-two.html,World,Washington Post,By David M.

Still, eager to cater to President Trump’s push for a diplomatic solution, Ukraine sent its diplomats into round after round of meetings with American and Russian counterparts, even as the talks yielded scant results . Now, with Mr. Trump growing increasingly frustrated with Moscow’s refusal to compromise , let alone agree to a cease-fire, Kyiv sees an opening to push for what it has long sought. It wants fewer talks and more weapons to strike Russia, as well as tougher sanctions, to force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in earnest. On Tuesday, a high-level Ukrainian delegation began a multiday visit in Washington to discuss deals to buy American weapons intended to hit deep inside Russia and shield Ukraine from air attacks. President Volodymyr Zelensky plans to follow with a White House visit on Friday, possibly to finalize agreements. He has been beating the drum for American-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, which would bolster Kyiv’s ability to conduct long-range strikes. Mr. Trump hinted on Sunday that he might use the possibility of sending the powerful missiles to Ukraine to pressure President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into laying down arms. “I might say, ‘Look, if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,’” Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One. The Trump administration’s willingness to discuss the delivery and use of such weapons, something the Biden administration flatly refused , marks a shift in Washington’s approach to ending the war, analysts said.

17b5f84b1114,Explosion at Italian Farmhouse Kills Three Military Police Officers,"attacks on police, fatalities;casualties, bombs, eviction, fires, verona, castel d'azzano","A raid on a farmhouse in northern Italy whose occupants had been resisting eviction turned deadly on Tuesday when the building exploded, killing three military police officers, Italian officials said. At least 13 other officers were injured, along with two of the people living in the house. The blast occurred shortly after officers from multiple agencies and firefighters arrived at the dilapidated farmhouse in Castel d’Azzano in the province of Verona, acting on a search warrant, according to Raffaele Tito, the chief prosecutor of Verona. The occupants, three siblings in their 50s and 60s, had been served an eviction order and had threatened to blow up the home, Mr. Tito told reporters on Tuesday morning. The warrant had been issued to search for flammable materials, he said. The farmhouse had been put up for sale on a judicial auction, a sale of property to pay off debts. Mr. Tito said that a judge had ordered the family of farmers who lived there to vacate the property but that they repeatedly refused. Antonello Panuccio, the deputy mayor of Castel d’Azzano, said in a telephone interview that various options for lodgings had been offered to the family members, “but they had refused them.” Officials were investigating the details of the explosion. Mr. Tito said that several gas cylinders had been in different rooms but that it was unclear whether they were open when the explosion occurred. The two-story building collapsed, trapping officers inside, according to a spokesman for the Carabinieri, Italy’s military police. Mr. Panuccio said that two attempts to evict family members last year had been thwarted after they threatened to blow up the home. A brother and sister were arrested at the home on Tuesday, and the woman was hospitalized for her injuries, officials said. A third sibling was arrested in a nearby field shortly after, according to Italian officials. “It’s an incredible tragedy, absurd behavior,” Mr. Tito said from the site of the explosion, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. “The Carabinieri and police tried to act with maximum safety and with all the necessary equipment. But the outcome was unexpected and very painful.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/world/europe/italy-carabinieri-explosion-verona.html,World,Washington Post,By Elisabetta Povoledo and Daniel Victor,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14xp-italy-blast-tqcp/14xp-italy-blast-tqcp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-14T06:10:15+00:00,e4b5e9f9a3e83a983158c65df0557e07685937f8
485d97da818c,Trump’s Two Minds on China Sow a Chaotic Few Days,"us politics, us foreign policy, tariff, rare earths, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us","Just days ago, President Trump indicated his trade war with China was entering a more belligerent phase. China’s new, “unheard of” controls on rare earth minerals were “sinister and hostile” and a “moral disgrace,” he fumed, vowing to hit back with 100 percent tariffs on all products from China. “The rest is History,” he said in a social media post. Just 48 hours later, Mr. Trump appeared eager to rewrite that history. President Xi Jinping of China was only having a “bad moment,” Mr. Trump said on social media on Sunday. “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” He reassured his followers that the United States “wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” The dueling messages appeared to provide a window into an internal tug of war for Mr. Trump over the best way to approach China on trade issues. He has repeatedly seesawed between retaliation and reconciliation, rattling markets, sending businesses scrambling and leaving questions about whether he has a larger strategy. At times, Mr. Trump has taken steps to “decouple” the United States from China, threatening severe tariffs, moving to suspend sales of critical technology and even revoking the visas of Chinese students. But with a potential meeting with Mr. Xi expected this month, Mr. Trump and his aides have also struck a conciliatory tone in hopes of reaching a trade agreement and cementing Mr. Trump’s self-described role as a master deal maker. Both approaches were on display in recent days. Markets in the United States plunged on Friday amid Mr. Trump’s threats, and then rebounded some on Monday as he seemed to back off. Stocks in Asia, which had closed for the week before Mr. Trump’s bellicose turn, fell on Monday amid fears of an intensified trade war. Mr. Trump most likely saw China’s curbs on rare earth minerals, which tighten its grip over global manufacturing, as a personal slight, particularly after the two sides agreed to defuse tensions and scale back tariffs in the spring, said Josh Lipsky, the senior director of the Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center, a think tank. At the same time, the administration wants to keep a summit with Mr. Xi, and a broader trade agreement, on the table, particularly as American farmers begin to feel the trade war’s toll. Mr. Trump raised the possibility on Friday of canceling the meeting, a threat his Treasury secretary backpedaled on Monday. China has halted purchases of American farm products such as soybeans, using U.S. growers to gain leverage in the talks. “We know the pressure the administration’s facing on that front,” Mr. Lipsky said. “So it’s competing priorities, and at any given moment one might win out.” Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said Mr. Trump most likely had two different audiences in mind. “The initial threats were meant to show resolve and punish Beijing’s overreach; the softer tone since is aimed at calming markets and reassuring allies,” Mr. Singleton said. “Trump and his team seem to believe Beijing miscalculated — and they’re leaving room for Xi to walk it back without escalating further.” White House officials did not respond to questions about what prompted Mr. Trump and his aides to change their tone over the weekend. Rare earth minerals are crucial for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets. China controls much of the world’s supply, and the minerals have become one of the more pressing sticking points between U.S. and Chinese negotiators. China’s new restrictions would require companies anywhere in the world to obtain licenses if they were exporting products containing even a minimal amount of Chinese-produced rare earths minerals, including for chip manufacturing. Those exports would also be controlled if the minerals were produced using Chinese mining, processing or magnet-making technologies. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be denied licenses. The restrictions came after the Trump administration took steps to expand its global technology restrictions, and Chinese officials have accused the administration of undermining progress between the two nations. On Sunday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry pointed to the U.S. Commerce Department’s expansion of the companies subject to sanctions when included on a government “entity list,” a move that would affect many Chinese and Russian firms. “It’s pretty clear to me that China does not put out the new rare earth restrictions in the absence of the commerce rule,” Mr. Lipsky said. “We had what I would call a kind of temporary truce between the sides over the summer, where neither side wanted to escalate in advance of the two leaders meeting. That was pretty clear on all sides. And the commerce rule was seen by the Chinese as a violation of that, just as what China did on rare earths was seen by the U.S. as a violation.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to calm markets on Monday, saying on the Fox Business Network that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi could work out their differences before the Nov. 1 deadline that Mr. Trump set for his 100 percent tariffs. Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration was working to find a way to stabilize the finances of farmers. “The Chinese have unfortunately turned our soybean farmers into pawns,” Mr. Bessent said. “They’re trying to manipulate them, and our farmers overwhelmingly back President Trump.” Vice President JD Vance also appeared to leave a door open to a deal with China during an appearance on Fox News on Sunday. Mr. Vance reiterated that Mr. Trump appreciated the friendship he had developed with Mr. Xi. But he also warned China not to “respond in an aggressive manner.” “I guarantee you the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China,” Mr. Vance said. Whether the administration will have the same leverage in the months to come is uncertain. Mr. Vance noted that the Supreme Court was scheduled to hear arguments over the administration’s use of emergency authorities to impose tariffs. “Unless we have access to this tariff authority, it’s going to be very hard to negotiate with China,” Mr. Vance said.

But what is actually demanded from its signatories in the document they signed remains unclear, despite the very public ceremony. “We’re going to be signing a document that’s going to spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things,” Mr. Trump said just before the signing. “It’s very comprehensive.” Mr. Trump offered no insight on the substance of their agreement and he barely mentioned the two warring parties, Israel and Hamas. Neither were represented at the conference. The signatories were the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, all of whom played a role in brokering a cease-fire and hostage-for-prisoners exchange last week. “We’ve already signed documents in the Middle East having to do with Israel and Hamas and just about everything else,” Mr. Trump said. Seated at a table along with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan; and the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Mr. Trump was effusive in his praise of these leaders and their efforts to broker a truce in the two-year war in Gaza. Behind the table with the signers sat other world leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and his Canadian counterpart, Mark Carney. Green folders with the document had been placed in front of the heads of state at the table, and a hush fell over the room. Momentarily, only the sound of pens on paper could be heard.

adde1e2d274d,Trump and Abbas Share Moment of Rapprochement in Egypt,"mahmoud abbas, donald trump, massad boulos, palestinians, international relations, palestinian authority, un general assembly, gaza strip, sharm el sheikh, israel gaza war, west bank, tiffany trump","More than 20 world leaders met in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for a summit to end the war in Gaza on Monday, but one of the most remarkable public exchanges there was the greeting between President Trump and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abbas shook hands warmly and at length, chatting intensely all the while. As the two men posed for the camera at the end of their hushed chat, Mr. Trump took Mr. Abbas’s hand, patting it twice as the Palestinian leader smiled. Mr. Trump gave a thumbs-up sign and presented his own big smile. It was not the first time that Mr. Abbas and Mr. Trump had shaken hands, and their conversation could not be heard. But their body language suggested that they had reached some kind of rapprochement in what has at times been a tense and strained relationship. Just recently, Mr. Abbas was denied a U.S. visa , preventing him from traveling to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. That meant he had to address the assembly by video link, and he missed a conference on Palestinian statehood hosted by France and Saudi Arabia — and about a dozen nations’ recognition of the state of Palestine . The Trump administration cited national security concerns in denying Mr. Abbas and his delegation visas. The State Department, in its announcement of the denials, said it acted on the ground that the Palestinian Authority was “undermining the prospects for peace.” It accused the group of waging “international lawfare campaigns” by filing cases against Israel at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice and of trying to bypass negotiations for peace with “efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state.” Those tensions were not in evidence in the exchange between Mr. Abbas and Mr. Trump on Monday, or in the American president’s address to leaders at the summit in Egypt. As Mr. Trump spoke at Sharm el-Sheikh, he pointed to Mr. Abbas and noted his presence at the summit, drawing a round of applause from the audience. “It’s good to have you,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Abbas has made a concerted effort to repair his relationship with Mr. Trump, which frayed during the U.S. president’s first term in the White House. In that period, Mr. Trump advanced policies that infuriated the Palestinian Authority, which Hamas forced out of Gaza in 2007 but still administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , cut off aid to the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees, presented a peace plan that favored Israel and helped forge agreements between Israel and Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords , that sidestepped Palestinian ambitions to establish an independent state. Mr. Abbas barred senior Palestinian officials from contact with the first Trump administration. But he took steps to sway Mr. Trump in the run-up to his re-election last year. Massad Boulos, a Lebanese-American businessman and the father-in-law of Mr. Trump’s daughter Tiffany Trump, had served as an unofficial emissary of the 2024 Trump campaign to Arab American voters. Mr. Boulos helped Mr. Abbas communicate with Mr. Trump in the months before the election, as did Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian American Trump backer, according to people involved in those contacts. Mr. Boulos and Mr. Bahbah said they helped facilitate the delivery of a letter from Mr. Abbas to Mr. Trump in July, in which the Palestinian leader condemned an assassination attempt against Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump posted the letter on his social media platform . In the letter, Mr. Abbas expressed “grave concern” about the assassination attempt, condemned “acts of violence” and called for differences to be resolved through communication. Mr. Trump replied on the posted letter itself, in his distinctive handwriting with a thick black Sharpie marker, addressing Mr. Abbas by his first name, saying the letter was “so nice” and declaring that “everything will be good.” A 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza that Mr. Trump unveiled last month calls on the Palestinian Authority, which has been accused of corruption, to undergo a period of reform before it can play a role in governing the enclave. The plan does not guarantee the establishment of a Palestinian state. It says only that as the rebuilding of Gaza advances and reforms to the Palestinian Authority are carried out, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.” Adam Rasgon, Charles Homans and Erika Solomon contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/middleeast/trump-abbas-handshake-egypt.html,World,Washington Post,By Ephrat Livni,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12gaza-abbass-trump1-pwtk/12gaza-abbass-trump1-pwtk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T21:53:32.067000+00:00,8a0af614762c010178d5dd2e74f32666fb33f1c1
c10dbe42ac40,Cuban Dissident Leader Leaves Prison for Exile in the U.S.,"jose daniel ferrer, cuba, political prisoner, us foreign policy, politics","One of Cuba’s most prominent dissidents, José Daniel Ferrer, who has challenged his country’s Communist regime for years, was released from prison on Monday and immediately left the island for exile in the United States with his family. The Cuban foreign ministry said Mr. Ferrer had been freed because of a formal request from the U.S. government following a letter made public this month in which Mr. Ferrer said he wanted to leave the country because of harsh prison conditions and threats against his family. “The dictatorship’s cruelty against me has surpassed all limits,” he wrote last month. “I have suffered beatings, torture, humiliation, threats and extreme conditions.” Mr. Ferrer’s departure represents a blow to Cuba’s opposition at a time when the country is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades and many younger Cubans are abandoning the country. But his arrival in Miami was welcomed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is the son of Cuban migrants. Mr. Ferrer’s “leadership and tireless advocacy for the Cuban people was a threat to the regime, which repeatedly imprisoned and tortured him,’’ Mr. Rubio said in a statement. “We are glad that Ferrer is now free from the regime’s oppression.’’ Mr. Ferrer, 55, has been at the forefront of the Cuban opposition movement for two decades. While most opposition leaders were based in Havana, the capital, Mr. Ferrer’s movement was centered in Santiago de Cuba, the country’s second-largest city, in the eastern part of the country. He was arrested during a protest there that was part of island-wide demonstrations in July 2021 that rattled the government and were brutally put down. Mr. Ferrer had been in prison before, one of a group of 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 and considered “prisoners of conscience” by international human rights groups. Cuba denies that it holds political prisoners, citing laws that prohibit anti-government activities. Mr. Ferrer was released in 2015 along with 52 other prisoners as part of a landmark agreement between Cuba and the United States under President Barack Obama. That agreement led to a fleeting moment of hope that the relations between the two countries might be on the mend after decades of hostility. But the détente was short-lived and hostilities have ratcheted back up. After Mr. Ferrer joined mass anti-government protests in 2021, he was quickly arrested and ordered to prison for four years. He was released in January in a deal brokered by the Vatican, as part of a last-minute agreement in the final days of the Biden administration to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism. That deal was torn up immediately after Mr. Trump took office. Cuba was put back on the terrorism list and Mr. Ferrer was sent back to prison, where his health is reported to have suffered. Mr. Ferrer had been one of the few remaining opposition figures not in exile. “It is a sad day for all Cubans when the only solution to political problems is exiting the country,” said Joe Garcia, a Cuban American and former member of Congress from Miami. But few will begrudge Mr. Ferrer his decision after so much personal sacrifice, Mr. Garcia said. “You can’t blame him. It’s the product of impossible expectations and overwhelming pressure.” Though Mr. Ferrer was long considered resolute in his determination to never abandon Cuba, his decision to leave was not entirely unexpected. It follows a steady stream of dissidents and journalists who have chosen the same path, as well as an exodus of several million ordinary people since Communist rule was established following the Cuban revolution in 1959. Migration has surged to it highest levels in recent years as the country’s economy has cratered. Among those still detained and considered political prisoners are Maykel Castillo, a rapper who featured in an opposition anthem, “Patria y Vida” — “Homeland and Life’’ — and Luis Manuel Otero, an artist and activist who has publicly denounced the government. Mr. Ferrer, in a letter to family and friends from prison last year, complained of being held in solitary confinement for long stretches and not being permitted family visits or telephone communication for over a year and a half. “The dictatorship has buried me alive; they want to silence me at all costs,” he wrote. “I hope I am wrong, but when so many flee from terror and horror, those who remain suffer serious consequences.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/americas/jose-daniel-ferrer-cuba.html,World,Washington Post,By David C.

fdc6d0c81538,A Reality Check on Peace,"us foreign policy, israel gaza war, donald trump, israel, peace process","How close is peace in the Middle East? President Trump was effusive in his assessment of the cease-fire deal that, so far, has brought 20 hostages back to Israel and freed some 2,000 Palestinians from Israeli prisons: “ It’s peace in the Middle East .” When Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it “one of the most important days for world peace in 50 years,” Trump retorted, “Only 50?” “Maybe 100,” Rubio said. The reality on the ground is a little more complicated. I wanted to understand how close the hostage-prisoner exchange has brought the region to a lasting peace. (After all, we’ve seen something like this before .) So I called up my colleague David Halbfinger, who is in Jerusalem and covering the cease-fire closely. Is everything going according to Trump’s plan so far? Everything has happened according to plan in Phase 1. But Phase 1 is really the low-hanging fruit of this plan. There’s a good chance that this could be the high-water mark of this whole process. What are the potential sticking points in the next phase? Hamas has said it wants a full Israeli withdrawal. The Israelis are saying they’re not pulling out until they get everything that was in the Trump plan. So we have the ingredients for a standoff. Israel and Trump both want Gaza to be run by someone other than Hamas. But Hamas hasn’t agreed to lay down its weapons. So who steps into that breach? Israel refuses to entertain the idea of letting the Palestinian Authority go into Gaza. But then where will the Palestinian technocrats who are supposed to take charge under Trump’s plan come from? What is the security situation in Gaza at the moment? Who is maintaining order? We’ve seen what looks like Hamas beginning to reassert itself on the ground in Gaza. I think they’re trying very hard to show that there is no vacuum. What about this idea of international troops securing the cease-fire? That is one of the most interesting ideas in the Trump plan: bringing in an international stabilization force from a number of countries, including from the Arab world. We’ve heard of everybody from the Emiratis to the Indonesians, the Turks, even the E.U., being willing to take part. But will any of those countries want to come in and have to play the role of getting Hamas to turn over its weapons? Or are they going to wait for disarmament before they step in? And, how long will it take to train up this kind of force? Everywhere you turn, there are these unresolved issues . And yet some people describe this as the best hope for peace since the Oslo accords . The fact that you have so many countries in the Arab and Muslim world backing the U.S. and its push not just for a cease-fire, but for a greater peace, is enormously promising. So there’s reason to see this as a promising moment. It’s just, again, easier to see this running into great difficulty than it is to see it accelerating from here. All parties have a way to claim victory from this deal. Does that help improve the chance that it holds? You’re right, everybody is declaring victory. Hamas certainly is. They’ve claimed they put the issue of Palestinian statehood back at the top of the international agenda, that Israel is isolated, that they have survived the war, that they returned nearly 2,000 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. And all of those things are true. Israel can point to the fact that it has brought home the hostages and severely weakened Hamas. I don’t know how much Israel’s isolation on the world stage is also motivating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do what he’s doing. But when the U.S., which is perhaps its last and certainly its most important ally, applied pressure, Israel came to the table. And if the fighting pauses and worldwide attention turns elsewhere, I think Israelis will have a chance to assess just how much damage has been done to their country’s reputation. And they’re going to want to address that isolation. I mean, you heard Netanyahu talk about making peace in a way he hasn’t ordinarily done. So some cause for hope? Yes, some cause for hope.

Officials said Monday that 64 people had been killed and 65 were missing across five affected states near the Gulf of Mexico. The toll is expected to increase in the coming days as search and rescue teams continue to reach areas cut off by landslides. President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday morning that her administration estimated that roughly 100,000 homes were affected by flooding and landslides. Dozens of communities remained isolated, and the president said food and water would need to be flown in. “There were no scientific or meteorological conditions that could have indicated to us that the rainfall would be of this magnitude,” Ms. Sheinbaum told reporters, adding that the government’s eyes were mostly on the Pacific, where two storms, Priscilla and Raymond , had formed off western Mexico last week. But it was in the central and eastern parts of the country — in the states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro and Puebla — where extremely intense and localized downpours caused the most destruction, overflowing rivers and setting off landslides.

When Mr. Rajoelina, 51, announced Monday morning that he would address the nation later that evening, thousands gathered in a festive rally in the capital, Antananarivo, anticipating that he was going to step down. Now, the mineral-rich country of 32 million people, gripped by chaos, faces an uncertain path forward. Military leaders who have broken from the president have been careful not to actively seize power, seemingly to avoid the appearance of a coup. Such a move would likely draw condemnation from the international community, and Madagascar, which is heavily reliant on foreign aid, could ill afford such isolation. It is unclear what steps the breakaway security forces will take now. Speculation is rampant that Mr. Rajoelina is no longer in Madagascar, but he has refused to give any indication of his whereabouts. He was forced into a corner in recent days when some members of the security forces, which initially engaged in a violent crackdown on the protests, joined the youth-led demonstrators and said they would no longer take orders from their superiors. Mr. Rajoelina’s speech on Monday was delayed several hours because some of the dissident military forces tried to take over the state-run television station that was supposed to broadcast his remarks, according to a post on the presidency’s Facebook page.

Mr. Trump proclaimed “the end of the war” in Gaza. And deploying a line presidents before him have reached for, only to be later disappointed, Mr. Trump declared a new era for the region. “This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East,” he said. By the end of the day, Hamas had freed 20 living hostages and Israel had released some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, part of the 20-point peace plan announced by the Trump administration after weeks of cajoling and courting major players in the Middle East, and the mediation of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. The guns and artillery in Gaza were silent on Monday and the aerial bombings that have killed so many thousands of Gazans had ceased. And for the first time since the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on Israel, Hamas no longer held any living Israeli captives. “Our nightmare is finally over. He’s almost here,” said Ilan Gilboa-Dalal, the father of Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. “I’m going to tell him: ‘My son, the nightmare is over,” Ilan said by telephone after the news of his son’s release. “You’re finally safe, you’re with us. We’re never leaving you again.” In the West Bank city of Ramallah, families broke into trills as buses carrying scores of released prisoners and detainees approached, with people rushing forward to greet the men as they stepped off. “This feeling is indescribable,” said Nasser Shehadeh, who was released after serving three years of a 17-year sentence for a car ramming attack on two soldiers, who survived. He was told he would be freed three days ago, and said the news came as a surprise. “I haven’t slept since that moment,” he said. Yet even as Israelis and Palestinians reveled in split-screen scenes of tearful reunions with pale and frail-looking loved ones, many pitfalls and questions remained over the future of the Gaza Strip and the tenuous ties between Israel and its neighbors. For all of the superlatives that Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, heaped on Mr. Trump on Monday — “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the State of Israel has ever had in the White House,” he said with the American president at his side — Mr. Netanyahu did not join Mr. Trump in declaring that the war in Gaza was over. Mr. Netanyahu was also absent from a high-level regional summit in Egypt that was meant to discuss the future of Gaza. In attendance were Mr. Trump and more than 20 leaders from across Europe and the Middle East and the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. The Egyptian government had earlier said that both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas would participate. But in a statement late on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said he could not accept the invitation to attend because of the Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret, which begins on Monday evening. Mr. Netanyahu said he had thanked Mr. Trump for the invitation to the conference. Members of Mr. Netanyahu’s government also expressed their anger that the remains of many Israeli hostages were not handed over on Monday. The agreement between Hamas and Israel calls for Hamas to turn over the bodies of at least 26 other hostages. But Hamas said it would deliver only four coffins of remains on Monday. Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, wrote on social media that Hamas’s announcement was “a violation of its commitments.” “Each delay or intentional avoidance will be considered a blunt violation of the agreement and will be answered accordingly,” he wrote. In Gaza, where 24 months of war set off a humanitarian catastrophe and widespread hunger, Palestinians expressed relief that the Israeli military had halted its two-year military offensive. But they said there was little to celebrate. The war has left Gaza in ruins: cities reduced to rubble, tens of thousands killed and the health system devastated. “It’s important the bombing has stopped, but there’s nothing to be happy about,” said Saed Abu Aita, 44, who is displaced in central Gaza. “My two daughters were killed, my home was destroyed and my health has deteriorated.” About 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and about 250 people taken hostage. Israel’s devastating military response has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, including civilians and combatants, according to the Gaza health ministry. Palestinians in Gaza said they hoped the cease-fire would bring desperately needed food. The United Nations said on Sunday that “ real progress ” was being made in delivering aid to Gaza. An Israeli military official said that, starting on Sunday, about 600 humanitarian aid trucks operated by the United Nations would be allowed to enter Gaza every day. That would be about twice as many trucks entering daily as in previous weeks, the official said. Footage from Gaza on Sunday showed men storming a moving truck and stripping boxes of supplies, scenes of desperation that have been common throughout the war. One crucial question that remains is the future of Hamas. In agreeing to release the hostages, the militant group gave up much of the leverage it has had with Israel. But for Mr. Trump’s full peace plan to work, diplomats and negotiators will probably need to resolve whether Hamas agrees to give up its weapons. Mr. Netanyahu long insisted that he would not accept an agreement in which Hamas refused to disarm. Hamas publicly rejected his demands that it do so. But for the families of Israeli hostages who returned home alive, Monday was a day of jubilation. All 20 hostages released were men — women, children and elderly hostages had come home during previous cease-fire deals. Those released on Monday included Alon Ohel, 24, a pianist from northern Israel, who was seized from a roadside bomb shelter after fleeing the Nova music festival; Avinatan Or, 32, abducted alongside his partner, Noa Argamani, who was rescued in Gaza by Israeli forces in June 2024; and Matan Angrest, 22, a soldier in the Israeli Army who was taken captive from his tank during a battle with Hamas fighters near the Gaza border. Videos circulated on social media of mothers and fathers reunited with grown children they had not been able to embrace for two years. “You are coming home!” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, 25, said on a video call with her son in Gaza, their first conversation since he was abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

608050d2d91a,Trump Calls for Israel’s President to Pardon Netanyahu. Could It Happen?,"gaza strip, israel, isaac herzog, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, us politics, us foreign policy, israel gaza war","President Trump was addressing a grateful Israeli Parliament on Monday, after the first of 20 hostages were released by Hamas in a deal he helped broker, when he made an unexpected suggestion: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, currently on trial for corruption, should be pardoned. “Hey, I have an idea,” Mr. Trump said to the holder of Israel’s largely ceremonial presidency, Isaac Herzog. “Mr. President, why don’t you give him a pardon?” Since 2020, Mr. Netanyahu has been on trial for corruption in three separate but related cases. He is accused of receiving cigars, Champagne, bracelets, bags and luxury clothes; disrupting investigative and judicial proceedings; and demanding fawning coverage by two leading Israeli news outlets . He has long denied the charges. But legal experts in Israel questioned whether Mr. Netanyahu could actually be pardoned at this stage in his trial. While Israel’s president clearly has the power to pardon someone convicted of a crime, the country has seen just one notable case of a pre-emptive pardon, in 1986, and its value as precedent is uncertain. “That was a very unusual case,” said Suzie Navot, a constitutional law expert and the vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute. The case, Barzilai v. Government of Israel, stemmed from a cover-up by Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security agency, after its agents executed two Palestinian militants involved in a 1984 bus hijacking . The security forces originally claimed that all four of the hijackers were killed in a takeover of the bus, but it later emerged that two of the hijackers had been taken alive and were then beaten to death . That prompted a scandal, much public turmoil and widespread calls for investigations in Israel, Ms. Navot said. Israel’s president at the time, Chaim Herzog — the father of the current president — issued a “pre-indictment pardon” for the head of Shin Bet and several of his assistants , citing national security concerns, when their roles in the cover-up emerged in a trial of other officials in the case. The pardon was challenged, and Israel’s Supreme Court ended up weighing whether presidential pardon powers extended to those not yet charged with or convicted of a crime. The court’s majority concluded that an expansive view of the pardon power was appropriate given the specifics of the case — a ruling that may not lend itself to a blanket interpretation of the reach of presidential clemency. “It’s a precedent that is difficult to apply in a typical criminal case,” Ms. Navot said. Although a president could point to the Supreme Court’s 1986 ruling, the underlying facts in Mr. Netanyahu’s trial are different, she said. The charges against Mr. Netanyahu are related to his conduct, not national security, and are of a kind that numerous Israeli leaders have faced before, Ms. Navot said. As a result, she added, a pardon at this stage could be seen as undermining the concept that “all men are equal before the law.” Israeli criminal courts have convicted chief rabbis, a former president and a former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, multiple times . In 2010, an Israeli court convicted a former president, Moshe Katsav, on rape charges related to actions earlier in his career, as well as lesser charges from actions while he was president. Following Mr. Katsav’s conviction, his successor to the office, Shimon Peres, said, “Citizens of only one kind exist in Israel — and all are equal in the eyes of the law.” Mr. Trump has railed against the case Mr. Netanyahu faces before. In June, he posted on social media that the trial would get in the way of negotiations over ending the war with Hamas, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname, Bibi, and writing, “LET BIBI GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!” Mr. Trump has likened the criminal charges against Mr. Netanyahu to the accusations he himself has faced in the United States, and has dismissed both as political witch hunts. Mr. Trump wields significant influence in Israel, particularly now that he has helped to broker a cease-fire that secured the release of hostages in Gaza and could be a crucial step in ending the war there. Mr. Herzog could choose to pardon Mr. Netanyahu if he is convicted at trial. But any pardon while the legal process is still underway could be interpreted as an attack on the rule of law, Ms. Navot said, and virtually any Israeli could claim the legal standing to contest it. Originally expected to last a year or more, the criminal proceedings against Mr. Netanyahu have been delayed several times, including by coronavirus restrictions. It was only in December 2024 that Mr. Netanyahu finally took the stand. “I am shocked by the magnitude of this absurdity,” he said then. “I am the prime minister, I am running a country, I am running a war,” he added. “I am not occupying myself with my future, but rather with that of the state of Israel.” And he has, on occasion since then, sought delays and extensions, citing his schedule and diplomatic developments .

765734aac48d,A Divided Israel Unites in Joy as Hostages Come Home,"israel gaza war, kidnapping and hostages, peace process, us foreign policy, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, israel, gaza strip","Many of them had become household names, their faces familiar from posters all over the country: Israelis snatched two years ago from their homes in pastoral border villages, from a music festival rave and from army bases and then secreted into Hamas’s tunnels deep under Gaza. When they finally emerged on Monday as part of a cease-fire deal reached between Israel and Hamas, they were thinner, wan, but alive and on their feet. And Israelis basked in a joyous moment of unifying national redemption after years of agonizing, polarizing war. The 20 living hostages who had remained in Gaza, along with the remains of 28 deceased ones, remained an open wound, with the fate of the hostages tearing at the country’s soul. A majority of Israelis had long wanted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize their release with a deal to end the war, polls showed . But Mr. Netanyahu accused protesters of “hardening Hamas’s stance” while critics of the prime minister accused him, in turn, of prolonging the war to appease his far-right political allies on whose support he relies to stay in power. Now, many Israelis said, with an open-ended cease-fire in place and all the living hostages back home, it was time for the country to heal. “This is a momentous day, a day of great joy,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an address in the Knesset, or Israeli Parliament, on Monday alongside President Trump.

6e0835c34ce1,Palestinians See Little to Celebrate Even Though the Bombs Have Stopped,"israel gaza war, food aid, palestinians, humanitarian aid, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, internal-open-access-from-nl","Palestinians in Gaza expressed relief on Monday that Israel had halted its two-year military offensive in the territory, and that hostages and prisoners had been exchanged. Still, many felt there was little to celebrate. Two years of war left the enclave in ruins, its cities reduced to rubble, tens of thousands dead and the health system devastated. Despair and hopelessness are pervasive and many no longer see a future. “It’s important that the bombing has stopped, but there’s nothing to be happy about,” said Saed Abu Aita, 44, who is displaced in central Gaza. “My two daughters were killed, my home was destroyed and my health has deteriorated.” Israel’s military campaign against Hamas killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials. Their tolls do not specify the number of combatants, but they say thousands were children. Some in Gaza said they do not see the release on Monday of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners — one of Hamas’s stated reasons for launching the war in the first place — as an achievement worth the cost. Hamas secured the exchange by trading the remaining hostages out of the some 250 seized during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war. Mr. Abu Aita said that a fragment of shrapnel penetrated his rib cage when an Israeli airstrike hit his hometown, Jabaliya, in northern Gaza in October 2023, soon after the war began. For more than a year, he said, he has not been able to find a doctor who could remove the fragment. He said he hoped that the return of the last 20 living hostages to Israel on Monday — a crucial element of the cease-fire that went into effect last week — would pave the way to an end to the war. “They needed to go home a long time ago,” he said. “Holding them in Gaza gave Israel a pretext to continue its bombing.” Palestinians in Gaza have lived through hunger, fear and bombardment. With a cease-fire now in effect, aid groups say they are attempting to scale up relief as much as possible to blunt the humanitarian catastrophe and allow people to rebuild their shattered lives. Many relief officials blamed Israeli restrictions for shortages that led to hunger and malnutrition throughout the enclave. While Israel blocked all supplies entering Gaza for nearly three months earlier in 2025, Israeli officials have recently said they were no longer limiting the amount of aid that can go into the territory. Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel committed to allowing a surge of desperately needed supplies into the enclave. On Sunday, the United Nations said it was working to boost its aid to Gaza, including by bringing in cooking gas for the first time since March. Many in Gaza have had to resort to making bread with firewood, because there was little gas or electricity available. “For two years, we’ve dreamed of this moment,” said Amani Nasir, 30. “We’ve had enough of tents, fire, displacement and thirst.” Under the deal, at least 600 trucks of supplies will enter Gaza per day, and Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt will be reopened. Abdel Nasser al-Ajrami, the head of Gaza’s Bakers’ Union, which works with the World Food Program to distribute subsidized bread, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza has been steadily improving since the announcement of the cease-fire last week. “Today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow will hopefully be better,” he said, adding that 17 bakeries were now operating across central and southern Gaza. But there is some skepticism that the cease-fire will hold. The deal clinched last week by U.S., Qatari, Turkish and Egyptian mediators did not resolve some of the toughest sticking points between the warring sides and left Hamas still armed and the dominant force in parts of Gaza for the time being. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said his government will not agree to end the war until Hamas’s government and military wing in Gaza are dismantled. While Hamas has expressed willingness to hand civilian rule over Gaza to another Palestinian entity, it has not committed to giving up its weapons. Since Israel halted its military offensive and pulled back from parts of Gaza in the past few days, Hamas has begun reasserting itself on the streets of the territory. Witnesses in Gaza said they had begun to see small groups of Hamas’s internal security fighters standing guard at some intersections. On Sunday night, Hamas fighters clashed in Gaza City with a rival gang of gunmen and attempted to capture its members, according to the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. During a visit to Israel on Monday to coincide with the hostage release, President Trump was asked by a reporter what he thought about the possibility of Hamas reasserting itself as a police force and shooting rivals. He replied that this was because “they do want to stop the problems” and suggested the United States was not opposed, temporarily. “They’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump’s ambitious vision for Gaza includes bringing in a postwar security force to stabilize the enclave, as well as training a new Palestinian police force to maintain law and order. But that prospect will be difficult should Hamas insist on continuing to play a dominant role in the enclave. Abdullah Shehab, 32, said he was worried that the respite in fighting would only be temporary because Hamas had not agreed to Israel’s conditions for ending the war. In recent days, Mr. Shehab said, Hamas was trying to show that it “hasn’t given up its rule” in Gaza. On Sunday, he said, masked gunmen who he believed were members of Hamas stopped him on the way to the dentist and inspected his car. “The situation is very fragile,” he said. “The weak party, Hamas, hasn’t been convinced to accept the strong party’s demands.” Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/gazans-ceasefire-relief-gloom.html,World,Washington Post,"By Adam Rasgon, Bilal Shbair, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad and Saher Alghorra",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13int-gaza-ceasefire-promo/13int-gaza-ceasefire-jltz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T18:25:00+00:00,872a7af046e222ede2b550a8025af87888d5dea1
a8be045e7d52,Hostages and Palestinian Prisoners Are Freed as Trump Hails ‘Historic Dawn’ in Mideast,,"Newly released Palestinian prisoners flashed victory signs to cheering crowds who gathered on Monday to watch them step into freedom under the new cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Families waited at dawn in the West Bank city of Ramallah and broke into teary-eyed trills as buses carrying some of the nearly 2,000 released prisoners and detainees approached. They rushed forward to greet the men as they stepped off. Many of the men looked haggard and exhausted. “This feeling is indescribable,” said Nasser Shehadeh, who was released after serving three years of a 17-year sentence for a car ramming attack on two soldiers, who survived. He was told he would be freed three days ago, and said the news came as a surprise. “I haven’t slept since that moment,” he said. On Monday afternoon, the Israeli prison service said it had freed all of the 1,968 Palestinians slated for release in an exchange for all the remaining hostages in Gaza. They were sent to the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Credit Credit... By Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times Among those freed were 250 Palestinians convicted of terrorism offenses or acts of violence against Israelis and roughly 1,700 more who were detained in Gaza without charge during the war. The 250 convicts were mostly affiliated with Fatah, a rival Palestinian faction to Hamas, and were serving life sentences for attacks in the 1980s or 1990s. More than 150 of them were sent into exile. The Gaza residents among them were taken through the Rafah border crossing which links Gaza to Egypt, according to the Hamas Prisoners’ Media Office. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said one prisoner was transferred to Ramallah Hospital from Ofer Prison, while seven others were hospitalized after they were dropped off in Ramallah. Mr. Shehadeh’s father, Bilal, said he was disturbed by his son’s condition. They had not seen each other since the war began more than two years ago, and in that time, his son had lost roughly 100 pounds. “They were not just deprived of food. They were not even allowed to clean themselves or to have soap,” the father said. “Our priority now is to make sure Nasser gets the medical attention he needs.” Halima Abu Shanab, 53, said she was both overjoyed and alarmed by the sight of her brother, Kamal Abu Shanab. The Israeli authorities said he was convicted of murder and membership in a terrorist organization. “We’re happy, truly happy, that he’s home,” she said. “But his health, it’s really bad. I was not prepared to see him like this.” Mr. Abu Shanab, 51, had spent 23 years in prison. When he emerged from the bus on Monday, he was covered in bruises, Ms. Abu Shanab said. She added that he had a shoulder injury that had not been treated in eight months. His family took him directly to a hospital. “He was beaten badly and humiliated,” she said. “And left with wounds on his knees and body.” The Israel Prison Service said it was not aware of the family’s claims of mistreatment made by the released prisoners and detainees on Monday. “The Israel Prison Service operates in accordance with the law,” a spokesman for the agency said. “We are not aware of the claims described, and to the best of our knowledge, no such incidents occurred under I.P.S. responsibility.” A family disappointed after waiting for a loved one to be released from prison, then finding out that their relative was not among those freed. Credit... Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times This is not the first time Israel has released prisoners or detainees who killed Israeli civilians in exchange for hostages, but it is nevertheless difficult for many in Israel. In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners and detainees for Gilad Shalit , a soldier who had been held captive in Gaza for five years. Several of those released prisoners and detainees — including Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed last year — would go on to plan the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. One of the prisoners and detainees released in 2011 was Murad Abdallah Adais, who was convicted of killing Dafna Meir in 2016. Her daughter, Renana Meir, criticized his release in an anguished essay in an Israeli newspaper. “When the terrorist is let out of prison in the coming agreement, you will pay the price,” she wrote. “Every Israeli in every house in Israel will be less safe.” Others had more mixed feelings. Abraham Moses, 75, the chairman of Israel’s National Organization of Victims of Terror, said he and his children wept when they learned that Muhammad Adel Daoud would be freed. He was convicted in 1989 of killing Mr. Moses’s wife, Ofra, and 5-year-old son, Tal, in 1987. But then Mr. Moses decided that if seeing Mr. Daoud go free could save the families of hostages from that same pain, then his release might be worth it. “Imagine the feeling of families who would embrace their loved ones returning from hell,” he said. Some of the families who were waiting in Ramallah for their imprisoned loved ones left despondent on Monday after learning that their relatives were not among those released. Nuhad Hammami waited anxiously in Ramallah for her brother, Mohammed, who was convicted of murder, according to the Israeli authorities . She stood on her toes to see over the crowd. Then tears began to stream down her face. “His name was on the list of prisoners returning home until this morning,” she said. “Then the list changed, and now we don’t know if we’ll ever see him again.” She was worried that he might have been released and sent to Gaza instead of the West Bank. “Where would he sleep in the winter?” she said, her voice trembling. “Gaza is destroyed.” Most of the released prisoners were residents of Gaza who were detained without charge during the war, including women and children. They were brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where such large crowds gathered that the buses could barely move down the street. Palestinian prisoners arriving in a bus, surrounded by crowds, at Nasser Hospital in the Gaza Strip. Credit... Saher Alghorra for The New York Times The area around the hospital swelled with thousands of people and coursed with waves of joy, grief and disbelief. Armed men, some of them masked, tried in vain to keep order in the crowd, occasionally firing into the air. Many in the crowd pushed toward the arriving busloads of detainees and shouted the names of their missing loved ones. Others packed the balconies of half destroyed buildings to cheer and wave. Inside the buses, detainees pressed against the windows or waved back. Israel has detained several hundred Palestinians during the war on suspicion of direct involvement in the Oct. 7 attacks. It has detained thousands more who are suspected of links to Hamas and other groups but not of involvement in the attack. Most were designated as “unlawful combatants,” which means they can be held without charge or trial under Israeli law. Some of these detainees were released in earlier prisoner-hostage swaps during the war. When the Israeli government agreed to the exchange, it stipulated that no detainees suspected of involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks would be released. Rozan Naif Adwa, 23, came to find her fiancé, Mohammed Khalil, who was detained at a checkpoint in northern Gaza 11 months ago. They had planned to distribute their wedding invitations on Oct. 7, 2023, and had spent the last two years watching the destruction of their homeland. “He came out of one small prison to a bigger one, a devastated prison,” she said, referring to Gaza. “But he will rebuild his home and his life from the beginning.” Earlier in the day, Amani Nasir, 30, joined a crowd in southern Gaza to watch Red Cross vehicles take some of the freed hostages back to Israel. She knew their release meant that Palestinian prisoners and detainees would be coming home soon. “Today feels like the happiest day of our lives,” said Ms. Nasir, who fled her home in northern Gaza during the two-year war. Since then, she said, she had been displaced 19 more times to flee fighting. “We were happy for our prisoners — and for the Israelis, too,” she said. “We love peace and the truce.

Mr. Trump seized on the moment to tell the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, that this is “not only the end of a war, this is the end of the age of terror and death.” Using a line that other presidents have reached for — and often been disappointed — he added: “This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.” He then traveled to Egypt, where dozens of world leaders awaited his arrival for a “peace summit” that offered the pomp and circumstance Mr. Trump is known to enjoy. Banners adorned with his face were dotted along the streets of a Red Sea resort. “From the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, the will of the people meets the resolve of world leaders to end the war in Gaza,” President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said. “They all carry a single message to mankind: Enough war. Welcome to peace.” But at the Egypt summit, neither Israel nor Hamas were participants. And although the White House released what appeared to be a document signed by the countries that did attend, it did not commit the signatories to any specific action. Rarely has an American president, particularly one as divisive at home as Mr. Trump is, been met with such adulation abroad. In Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, tens of thousands yelled, “Trump, Trump,” and in the Knesset some members wore red MAGA-style hats. Mr. Netanyahu, whose name was booed in the same square on Saturday night, declared the president was “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.” There was more talk of nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize and the Israel Prize. And Mr. Trump himself surprised Israeli lawmakers when he twice made an offer to Iran — a country that Israel and the United States bombed only four months ago — to enter talks that could end decades of enmity and isolation. “You know what would be great, if we could make a peace deal with them,” he said. “Would you be happy with that?” He added, “I think they’re tired,” but the offer did not elicit an enthusiastic response. There was more enthusiastic applause when Mr. Trump described Israel’s assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists during the 12-day bombing of the country, or when he detailed the number of B-2 bombers, re-fuelers and support aircraft that dropped bunker-busters on Fordo, Natanz and Esfahan, the major Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. And just beneath the surface, there were obvious differences over the future of Gaza, and even over whether the cease-fire that is finally allowing food and medicine to flow into the territory would necessarily lead to a lasting peace. “The war is over,” Mr. Trump told reporters, both on Air Force One on the way to Israel and in the hallways of the Knesset. Mr. Netanyahu was far more cautious, welcoming the release of the hostages, and the fact that no living Israelis were being held in Gaza for the first time in years, while refusing to discuss whether Israel would resume hostilities if Hamas does not disarm or leave the territory. Hamas never agreed to that part of Mr. Trump’s 20-point plan, and its militias were already moving into neighborhoods from which Israel had withdrawn in recent days. And even while Mr. Trump was in Jerusalem, Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, declared that Hamas had released the remains of only four out of 28 hostages who had died in captivity. “Each delay or intentional avoidance will be considered a blunt violation of the agreement and will be answered accordingly,” he posted on X. Mr. Trump chose to ignore the possible roadblocks ahead. In his speech to the Knesset, he wandered off text to assess Mr. Netanyahu’s personality: “He’s not the easiest guy to deal with, but that’s what makes him great.” He talked at length about the hours of conversation his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, held earlier this year with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Witkoff, a real estate investor from New York, was described by Mr. Trump as “Henry Kissinger who doesn’t leak.” Mr. Kissinger, the national security adviser and then secretary of state under Nixon and Ford, was a master of the self-serving Washington leak. Except for brief references, Mr. Trump did not talk about what it would take to rebuild Gaza, or the future of the Palestinian people, or the trade-offs between creating a Palestinian state and its alternatives. In fact, there was almost no public discussion of the implementation of his 20-point plan at all, save for the fact that he was meeting wealthy Arab states and European governments to form an international stabilization force or fund the rebuilding of the devastated territory. In that regard, elements of Mr. Trump’s speech gave another glimpse of his foreign policy. He praised countries for their military strength, especially Israel, which he said emerged “stronger, more respected” than before. Two years of conflict with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran certainly did prove that Israel was the strongest power in the region. But Mr. Trump did not discuss its diplomatic isolation, as European powers embraced the idea of a separate Palestinian state partly because of the huge civilian casualties caused by Israeli attacks. As usual, Mr. Trump argued that countries would make decisions based on their economic interests — that joining the Abraham accords, for example, would enhance trade. But of course the Middle East is filled with nations, religious groups and terror organizations that have gone to war even when it risks all economic progress. Russia did the same in invading Ukraine. There were departures from the norm. Mr. Trump is not known for nurturing alliances, but he expressed gratitude “for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas.” Yet he said little about how to build on the momentum of that new cooperation. In Sharm el-Sheikh, Mr. Trump marveled at just how quickly the hastily planned summit came together, and how many people had come: Leaders from more than 20 nations flocked to join him on a stage adorned with the words PEACE 2025. “These people all came in like 20 minutes notice,” Mr. Trump said. Most of the summit consisted of Mr. Trump effusively praising the other world leaders in attendance. Mr. Trump signed a document at a table alongside the leaders of the three other mediating countries — Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. Before signing the paper, Mr. Trump said it was “going to spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things,” he said. “It’s very comprehensive.” But the version of the document released by the White House did not include substantive details, instead alluding largely to vague principles instead. “We hereby commit to the resolution of future disputes through diplomatic engagement and negotiation rather than through force or protracted conflict,” the document said in part. There were scattered protests in Israel against Mr. Trump’s visit, and two left-wing lawmakers belonging to a joint Palestinian-Israeli political party were escorted out of the Knesset for displaying signs that said “Recognize Palestine!” They were quickly seized, and Mr. Trump pursed his lips before saying: “That was very efficient.” Ayman Odeh, one of the two lawmakers, wrote on social media that the speeches in the Knesset would not absolve Mr. Netanyahu “of the crimes against humanity committed in Gaza.” He later added: “There are two peoples here, and neither one of them is leaving.” Trump made the argument that if he had not destroyed Iran’s three major nuclear sites , the agreement to get the hostages out of Gaza would not have been possible. Arab states would not have taken the risk of pressuring Hamas, an Iranian proxy. “We took a big cloud off of the Middle East and off of Israel,” he said, rejecting predictions that Iran would try to restart its nuclear program. “The last thing they want to do is start digging holes again in mountains that just got blown up. They are not doing that. They want to survive.” But there were signs of stumbling blocks ahead. Arab leaders have been particularly wary about the commitment of Mr. Netanyahu, who told Israelis this week that the military campaign in Gaza is “not over.” Mr. Netanyahu underscored their anxieties with a last-minute plan to attend the peace summit. Egypt’s presidency quickly announced what would have been a major symbolic moment for the event. But it was then forced to backtrack shortly after, when Mr. Netanyahu canceled his plans, citing a Jewish holiday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/middleeast/trump-victory-lap-whats-next.html,World,Washington Post,By David E.

Warns of Sharp Increase in Drug-Resistant Infections,"antibacterial, drug resistance, bacteria, infection, disease rates, e coli, developing countries, pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, who","Across the world, the spread of dangerous infections that do not respond to antibiotics has been increasing by as much as 15 percent a year, affecting treatment for urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, E. coli and other pathogens that kill millions of people annually, according to a report released Monday by the World Health Organization. The report documents how countries are grappling with the challenge of so-called antimicrobial resistance. It found that one in six infections in 2023 was resistant to the current roster of antibiotic drugs. The drug resistance involves 40 percent of the most common antibiotics used against these infections. Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean had the highest rates of resistance, with one in three infections resistant to antibiotics. That is roughly double the worldwide average and more three times the rates in Europe and the Western Pacific. Overall, antimicrobial resistance was more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, especially those with weak health care systems. “Antibiotic resistance is widespread and threatening the future of modern medicine,” Dr. Yvan Hutin, director of the W.H.O.’s department of antimicrobial resistance, said in a news conference announcing the surveillance results. “Simply put, the less people have access to quality care, the more they’re likely to suffer from drug-resistant infection.” Drug-resistant bacterial and fungal infections kill more than one million people around the world each year and contribute to the deaths of nearly five million others, according to the health agency’s estimates. A study published in The Lancet estimated that more than 39 million people would die from antibiotic-resistant infections in the next 25 years. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The moment carried strong echoes of another speech that Mr. Trump gave in 2020, announcing the Abraham Accords — a series of diplomatic deals that saw Israel establish relations with several Arab countries. On Monday, Mr. Trump praised the accords, saying that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, “did something very special” when he helped to broker them. He also hinted at his longstanding wish to expand them, suggesting that Israel could even make a deal with Iran, its archenemy in the region. Though a comprehensive end to the war between Israel and Hamas has yet to be hammered out , Mr. Trump said the cease-fire meant “the historic dawn of a new Middle East.” What are the Abraham Accords? Signed in 2020 on the White House lawn, the first of the deals known as the Abraham Accords established diplomatic ties between Israel and two Gulf Arab states, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

6d4d557f3e65,The AI Industry’s Scaling Obsession Is Headed for a Cliff,"ai lab, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, ai, algorithms","A new study from MIT suggests the biggest and most computationally intensive AI models may soon offer diminishing returns compared to smaller models. By mapping scaling laws against continued improvements in model efficiency, the researchers found that it could become harder to wring leaps in performance from giant models whereas efficiency gains could make models running on more modest hardware increasingly capable over the next decade. “In the next five to 10 years, things are very likely to start narrowing,” says Neil Thompson, a computer scientist and professor at MIT involved in the study. Leaps in efficiency, like those seen with DeepSeek’s remarkably low-cost model in January, have already served as a reality check for the AI industry, which is accustomed to burning massive amounts of compute. As things stand, a frontier model from a company like OpenAI is currently much better than a model trained with a fraction of the compute from an academic lab. While the MIT team’s prediction might not hold if, for example, new training methods like reinforcement learning produce surprising new results, they suggest that big AI firms will have less of an edge in the future. Hans Gundlach, a research scientist at MIT who led the analysis, became interested in the issue due to the unwieldy nature of running cutting edge models. Together with Thompson and Jayson Lynch, another research scientist at MIT, he mapped out the future performance of frontier models compared to those built with more modest computational means. Gundlach says the predicted trend is especially pronounced for the reasoning models that are now in vogue, which rely more on extra computation during inference. Thompson says the results show the value of honing an algorithm as well as scaling up compute. “If you are spending a lot of money training these models, then you should absolutely be spending some of it trying to develop more efficient algorithms, because that can matter hugely,” he adds. The study is particularly interesting given today’s AI infrastructure boom (or should we say “bubble”?)—which shows little sign of slowing down. OpenAI and other US tech firms have signed hundred-billion-dollar deals to build AI infrastructure in the United States. “The world needs much more compute,” OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman, proclaimed this week as he announced a partnership between OpenAI and Broadcom for custom AI chips. A growing number of experts are questioning the soundness of these deals. Roughly 60 percent of the cost of building a data center goes toward GPUs, which tend to depreciate quickly. Partnerships between the major players also appear circular and opaque .",https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-industrys-scaling-obsession-is-headed-for-a-cliff,Technology,Washington Post,Will Knight,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68efda5ae7f63deb0177e5c2/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/101525_AI-Lab-AI-Scaling-Obsession-5.jpg",2025-10-15T18:00:00+00:00,b256a2f375d6ade3e35121e8e09a56042ef050c8
e67753725be1,These Comfortable Luxury Earbuds Are $100 Off,"shopping, deals, headphones, wireless earbuds, audio, earbuds","Looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds that pack a little more oomph than your average AirPods? The Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 (8/10, WIRED Review) are currently marked down to just $180 at Amazon , a full $100 off their list price, and the lowest price we've seen yet for these upgraded earbuds. The Amiron 300 have a classic Beyerdynamic sound profile, which is delightfully rich and smooth, with a mostly neutral base that has good definition at the far ends of the spectrum. Reviewer Parker Hall was particularly impressed with the vocal quality , which he called “clear and dynamic” and didn't get “overwhelmed by such a well-defined low end.” These are particularly good for jazz and vocal-heavy acoustic music, but anyone with good ears will be impressed with the performance. They also come with five different ear tips, so most people shouldn't have any trouble finding some that are a good fit, which also helps provide excellent sound isolation. That helps make up for the fact that the active noise canceling isn't quite as sharp as it is on earbuds from the likes of Sony or Bose. They do have excellent pass-through audio though, which could trick you into thinking there isn't any noise canceling on at all. There's a mobile app that's non-intrusive and useful, letting you change the functions of the buttons on the outside. As someone who constantly skips tracks by accident when pulling my hood up, I can appreciate the ability to tweak these settings. There are a variety of other options too, including an EQ to adjust, and a low latency mode if you want to use them to catch up on your favorite shows while riding the bus to work. Overall, these make for a nice upgrade from more budget-friendly true wireless earbuds, particularly for those with discerning ears and a penchant for vocal music or podcasts. Their understated design and great compatibility help round out an otherwise appealing package, and the lower price helps seal the deal.

fc670eac7d15,The Best Travel Tote for Digital Nomads Who Never Log Off,"bags, travel, air travel, shopping, buying guides, accessories and peripherals","Compare Top 6 Travel Totes More Travel Totes to Consider Aer Simple Tote for $139: Have you ever hefted a nylon or leather tote in your hand and realized that slinging it over your shoulder would give you immediate scoliosis? Then you want Aer’s ultra-lightweight, simple sailcloth tote, which weighs less than a pound. Its 15 liters felt surprisingly capacious. I fit two jackets inside on a walk with my kids, and the 3-inch-wide bag tucked neatly under my arm. The two exterior drop pockets fit my Nalgene and Kinto mug , and my phone fits neatly in the exterior zip pocket. The Fidlock closure, in addition to being pretty to look at and use, provided a bit of security but was much less, er, fiddly (sorry) than having to close the bag with a zipper. This is a great upgrade if you are getting tired of carrying everything in your shredded canvas tote from Umami Mart and want a bag that’s not going to get soaked in something questionable if you put it down in the wrong place on the subway. It is a little more expensive, though. —Adrienne So Cuyana System Tote 16-Inch for $358 : The Cuyana System Tote is a modular gear-hauler that shape-shifts with your itinerary. Designed to outlast the churn of fast fashion, this travel tote starts minimal, but the genius lies in its add-ons. A laptop sleeve or insert organizer creates a structure on the go, with dedicated slots for your computer, water bottle, and other work essentials. A System Flap Bag insert doubles as a clutch or in-bag organizer, and a detachable, adjustable strap (also available in a wide model ) converts the tote into a crossbody, perfect for hands-free airport sprints if you're unintentionally trying out airport theory . Instead of stitched-on straps prone to failure, the System Tote's handles are cut directly from its leather body, minimizing points of wear. The main compartment snaps shut rather than zips, something to know if you're the spill-averse type. Avoid This Tote Calpak Diaper Tote Bag with Laptop Sleeve for $195 : This bag was really puffy, but felt bulky, and space was lost to give the puffiness to the bag’s layers. It was somehow too big for everyday use, but not big enough when I needed a lot of stuff brought along for a day trip or long outings. It also didn’t really feel that diaper bag-centric; the only thing “diaper” about it was the baby wipe compartment on the outside, but I would have preferred an exterior pocket to store actual diapers along with it. You could stuff a couple of diapers in the flat front pocket, but it’s not as ideal as other designs I’ve tried. The insulated bottle pockets are handy if you travel with bottles, but feel useless after your baby graduates from bottles (which they graduate much earlier than diapers!) It’s not a bad bag, but I'd recommend a different design for parents and travelers alike. — Nena Farrell AccordionItemContainerButton To determine the best travel tote, we put each bag through real-world travel scenarios to see how it performs. That means packing it with laptops, chargers, clothes, and toiletries, testing comfort when worn over the shoulder or carried by hand. We'll overstuff the totes to check durability, organization, and accessibility. We'll evaluate how it fits under airplane seats, protects tech gear, and resists wear and weather. If it's supposedly water-resistant, we'll take it out in the rain to determine whether it survives without soaking its contents. We scrutinized every pocket, compartment, and zipper for usability. When it comes to design, we paid attention to the details: interior fabric choices that make contents easy to see, convenient pocket placement, and hardware choices like zippers and zipper pulls. We also paid attention to key design elements, such as the handle length and overall structure. We prioritized quality and sustainability, and we included eco-friendly brands for environmentally conscious consumers. We also made sure to include an array of fabrics for stylistic variability. Lastly, we considered how each bag stacked up against its price point, ensuring that the quality justified the cost. What Are We Testing Next?

34ce8c8b2ac8,The Best Noise-Canceling Headphones,"shopping, buying guides, headphones, wireless headphone, noise-canceling","Honorable Mentions Now that the majority of new headphones and earbuds offer at least a modicum of noise canceling, it'd be impossible (and unproductive) to list everything we like above. If you haven't yet found your fit, here are more favorites worth considering. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $180 : These simple-looking earbuds are a great way to experience quiet luxury. They have 10 hours of battery life with noise canceling engaged, and they have some of the best-sounding drivers for vocals I’ve heard in any earbuds. Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds for $328 : Sony's fifth-generation flagship earbuds slim down while stepping up. These buds are smaller and slicker (maybe too slick when it comes to grabbing them) than the previous XM4 buds. As before, they provide great sound and noise canceling that outduels plenty of options, with a cost to match. In true Sony style, they serve up a truckload of adaptive features and EQ controls while retaining a solid eight hours of playback time per charge with ANC and 12 hours without it. —Ryan Waniata Soundcore Life Q30 for $60–$85 : Anker's Soundcore line is nothing if not value-conscious, and the Life Q30 provide an embarrassing list of extras for their bargain-basement pricing. You'll get clear and warm sound, great features, tons of battery life, and noise canceling that gets the job done even on a long flight, though it can't keep up with flagship pairs. It's hard to complain when they cost hundreds less, especially with sale pricing that sometimes drops to around $50. Sony WH-1000XM4 for $195 : Sony's WH-1000X lineup has produced some of the best noise-canceling headphones for nearly a decade, and the aging WH-1000XM4 are no exception. They periodically go on sale for under $300, but it's getting harder to find them below full price, which is tough for a five-year-old model. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 Earbuds for $400 : Bowers & Wilkins' Pi8 offer a sleek, comfortable design, solid (albeit not Bose-beating) noise canceling, and great sound. Call quality is also excellent, which makes these perhaps the perfect business-class earbuds, though their hefty price won't appeal to everyone. Bowers and Wilkins PX7 S2e for $400: The Px7 S2e feature upgraded audio quality for fantastic sound in stylish and sophisticated design. They're also among the most comfortable headphones we've tested, but their noise canceling doesn't rise to the level of the top players for the money. Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 for $280 : These over-ears from Beyerdynamic have the brand's classic studio sound, with a tight crisp high range and punchy lows. The downside is that they don't cancel noise quite as well as models from Sony, Bose, and others above. Still, they sound great and are worth considering, especially if you can snag them on sale. Soundcore Space A40 for $60 : Another top value buy from Anker's Soundcore brand, the Space A40 are some of our favorite cheap earbuds, especially as their price continues to fall. You'll find a classy design, lots of features, quality sound, and great noise canceling for their class. Apple Beats Fit Pro for $170 : The Beats Fit Pro are an aging but still knockout pair of wireless buds, with great sound, easy-access physical buttons, and solid noise canceling to boot. Add to that six hours of battery life, spatial audio compatibility with Apple Music and other services, and you've got one of the best pairs of earbuds ever “designed in California.” Epos/Sennheiser Adapt 660 for $301 : Want excellent sound, a comfortable fit, and high-quality noise-canceling tech for less than what you'd pay for Sony or Bose headphones? Check out this collaboration between Epos and Sennheiser. The Epos/Sennheiser Adapt 660 sound fantastic and are some of the lightest noise-canceling headphones I've ever worn. They also feature excellent microphones for great silence on calls and Zooms. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

You'll see similar speed increases like on the iPad Pro M5—3.5X faster AI performance, 1.6X faster graphics over the prior M4-powered MacBook Pro, and 2X faster SSD performance. Otherwise, this is the same 14-inch MacBook as before, with the claimed “24-hour” battery life, mini-LED display with the nano-texture glass option, a six-speaker system, and a 12-MP webcam. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an SDXC slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port. COURTESY OF APPLE The New Vision Pro Widely regarded as a miss with consumers, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is back but with no major changes to the hardware. Well, there's a new head strap: the Dual Knit Band. It's included in the box, and Apple says it's soft and cushioned, allowing for a comfier fit. The headset is now powered by the M5 chip, which enables faster performance, sharper details throughout visionOS 26, and better battery life. Specifically, Apple says the M5 renders 10 percent more pixels on the micro-OLED displays than before, and the refresh rate can also jump up to 120 Hz . Battery life is now two and a half hours of general use, as opposed to just two hours on the original Vision Pro . That extends to three hours with video playback. Unfortunately, the price remains firm at $3,499.

a71f7c635106,Federal Workers Are Being Used as Pawns in the Shutdown,"inner loop, politics, government, doge, donald trump, republicans","Federal workers have grown accustomed to a specific kind of dread over the past year . 2025 has been nonstop: First came the “ fork ” email from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, followed quickly by numerous layoffs from the Trump administration. As of July, more than 150,000 federal workers had resigned from their roles since president Donald Trump took office for the second time, according to The Washington Post . Tens of thousands were also fired. For the past few months, it seemed like this bloodletting was over—but that all changed on Friday. Thousands of employees at eight government agencies were subjected to RIFs, or reductions in force—the government’s formal process of laying off federal workers. According to a court filing from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on Friday, this latest round of firings has affected more than 4,000 federal employees. The court filing also claimed that the administration targeted the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services the hardest, hacking away at a combined 2,500 jobs across the two agencies and the entire Washington, DC, office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The Department of Education culled nearly its entire team handling special education, CNN reported on Tuesday . At the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, cuts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred jobs , according to the same filing. Every Day Is an Adventure “People are scared. Who says their goal is to traumatize people?” says one IRS worker, referencing private speeches given by Russell Vought , the head of OMB and a key architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 who has been the public face of the job-cutting. ”If any normal human said ‘My goal is to traumatize families’ there should be police at that person's doorstep.” “It’s pretty demoralizing,” a Food and Drug Administration employee tells WIRED. “It’s clear this admin will act illegally to try to make agencies or offices they don’t like suffer more.” (The Trump administration has used government resources, like websites, to place blame on Democrats for the shutdown in what critics claim is a violation of the Hatch Act , a law forbidding the use of public assets for political messaging.) “Every day is an adventure: new EOs, new memos,” says one Department of Homeland Security worker. “It’s constantly being on watch on where to pivot and what to stop, start, and sustain.” (All of these employees have been granted anonymity so they can speak candidly about their experiences.)",https://www.wired.com/story/federal-workers-are-being-used-as-pawns-in-the-shutdown,Technology,Washington Post,Makena Kelly,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eec7721c48a61c72f2c125/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/politics_federal_layoffs_pawns.jpg",2025-10-15T13:31:57.508000+00:00,7aea35505ef693fd2f9350966ad13709a9a2bec9
2ca15e1e9709,Review: SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Gaming Headset,"shopping, review, video games, reviews, headphones, gaming, online gaming","There's a downside, though, and it isn't minor: Once Sonar is running, you’ll need to keep your system’s default audio device set to one of the new outputs the app creates during installation. If you switch between speakers and headphones, changing the device in your system tray won’t work anymore, you can only do it in the GG app. There’s also no main Sonar output, so you’ll have to choose one of the groups as your default system output, and then your system volume controls will only affect programs assigned to that category . To make matters more confusing, there’s a volume wheel on the Nova 3 that runs independently of everything else. I’m really impressed with how much practical value the app offers, but I’m more than a little frustrated with how my system audio settings look, even when I’m using my desktop speakers. I've been able to find some workarounds to keep my main volume knob working, but it feels like it shouldn't need to be this complicated. It’s a shame, because I've grown really fond of the app, but having to navigate into a specific piece of software to change my speaker volume is a little annoying. Conclusion Photograph: Brad Bourque The Arctis Nova 3 are one of my favorite gaming headsets, but the software is going to be a deal-breaker for some folks. They provide an awesome amount of practical value, but you have to make some concessions. I know how much people don't like their system settings screwed with, something I think I'm more tolerant of than average, and it still bothers me. Just know the mobile app has a subset of features, and it's all upside for console gamers. I find the Nova 3 so comfortable and their sound so impressive for the price that I’m willing to overlook the loss of my mute button. They have a great sound profile that’s only improved by the equalizer profiles, long battery life with quick charging, and excellent system compatibility, all at a very reasonable price. Even with the much more premium Arctis Nova Pro at my desk, I often find myself reaching for the Nova 3, and that says a lot.",https://www.wired.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-3-review,Technology,Washington Post,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eece76eadc50eb0ecc741e/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20SteelSeries%20Arctis%20Nova%203%20Gaming%20Headset.png",2025-10-15T10:33:00-04:00,688916e8685e5d7ba5bba6e935c248f7bc8cbb6e
69ce28f924c1,The Best Swimming Headphones,"fitness, health, wearables, sports, swimming","Most, if not all, swimming headphones play music through streaming audio files from a built-in music player. Some also offer the option of streaming over Bluetooth, which is mainly present to make the headphones more useful when you’re back on dry land. You have to store files on the headphones themselves, because Bluetooth and water don’t really mix. The frequency on which Bluetooth operates is absorbed by water, which in turn impacts signal strength. If you've ever attempted to stream music with swimming headphones, this is why you probably got regular connection dropouts. You will typically be able to send music to your headphones by using the same cable that you use to charge it. You will have to plug it into your computer to send files to your headphones, unless the headphones offer the ability to sync files from a companion smartphone app. You’ll then need to drag and drop audio files into folders; audio file format support can vary by headphone. Make sure you check which formats the headphones support before you hit the Buy button! To use swimming headphones, you should already own audio or be able to download it legally. This could apply to some podcasts and audiobooks. Can swimming headphones let you play music from streaming services like Spotify? Well, not really, That’s because most audio on streaming services is protected by DRM (digital rights management). Some headphones do offer some workarounds, with some solutions working better than others.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-swimming-headphones,Technology,Washington Post,Michael Sawh,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eeab650f54bf28d8db74ff/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Best%20Swimming%20Headphones.png",2025-10-15T14:00:00+00:00,54f1f7679ecf21b997702521b2f2ffa9bdc99840
0b9d782f78bd,Everything You Need to Know About MVNOs and Prepaid Phone Plans,"shopping, phones, smartphones, wireless, mobile, verizon, t-mobile, at&t, telecoms, networks","MVNOs aren’t forthcoming about these limitations, but you can find them spelled out in policy documentation. Let’s look at Mint Mobile’s network management policy as an example. The first hurdle is deprioritization. “Other brands may be prioritized higher on the T-Mobile network,” reads Mint’s network management policy. “For all Service plans, T-Mobile may also reduce speeds during times of network congestion.” These policies aren’t clear about how severe the slowdown is, but generally, if a network has a lot of congestion, MVNOs will see slower speeds before those on major carriers. In most parts of the country, this isn’t a problem. However, you’ll likely experience slower speeds in major cities and at large events. If you're at a concert and everyone is trying to post Instagram stories and TikToks, you'll probably notice a significant slowdown. Another downside with most MVNOs is throttling. You’ll be able to purchase an “unlimited” data plan, but there are usually soft caps to the amount of data you can use before speeds slow. Again using Mint as an example, it classifies “heavy data users” as those who use more than 35 GB of data in a month, and it says these users will “have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.” Those are the two big drawbacks, but some smaller limitations pop up depending on the provider you look at. Mint, for instance, uses “video optimization,” which basically means video streams are capped at standard definition when using mobile data (480p). This happens automatically on the network, even if you’re trying to stream a higher resolution. I’m using Mint as a touchstone here, but these practices are common among most MVNOs. Cricket has similar data restrictions and video limitations as does Optimum Mobile . Major carriers that have direct prepaid plans, like T-Mobile, generally have higher data limits before reducing speeds. Outside of those limitations, some MVNOs don’t offer additional cellular features like roaming or a mobile hot spot. Those limitations aren’t universal, but they’re some good things to look out for when you’re looking at providers and plans. Can You Use the Same Number With a Prepaid Mobile Plan? The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determined decades ago that phone providers don’t own phone numbers. Broadly, you’re allowed to keep your number when transferring to a new carrier, regardless of whether that’s a prepaid or postpaid carrier. In fact, since 2009, the FCC requires carriers to transfer—or, more properly, “port”—your number within one business day. Under the FCC’s rules , a carrier can’t deny porting your number, even if you refuse to pay a porting fee. However, porting fees are allowed. Some carriers, such as T-Mobile, don’t have any fees for porting your number. Others charge anywhere from a few dollars to $20.",https://www.wired.com/story/prepaid-phone-plans-and-mvnos,Technology,Washington Post,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eecb0a0f54bf28d8db7501/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/visible-Credit-Jacob-Roach.jpg",2025-10-15T13:30:00+00:00,29198654201008457213ee271014617a50417d1f
7580a81aaf79,Review: ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X,"video games, console games, xbox, reviews, shopping, microsoft, asus, review, gaming, portable gaming","However, because the X-ROGs are fundamentally regular PCs, they’re a lot more versatile than Nintendo or Valve’s efforts. Not only can you play media, browse, or do anything else you might do on a PC (even Office tasks, if you hate joy), but you can install any other PC gaming client—Steam, Epic, GOG, and more are all available. Better still, the Xbox app aggregates all games installed on the system into one library view, regardless of where they originate. You can even turn your ROG Xbox into an ersatz Steam Deck by running Steam in Big Picture mode (although some of its controller keybindings may not work). The big win—pardon the pun—is that you can install mods with ease. While I’ve gotten a few mods running on my Steam Deck over the years, its Linux underbelly makes things trickier. On the X-ROGs, I’ve been able to use mods as easily as on my main gaming desktop, with no second-guessing if they’ll actually work. It’s a great feature that’s facilitated by having standard Windows as the base. Soft Where? But wait, there’s a third UI player in the mix: Asus’ own Armoury Crate SE software. Broadly, this is more of a device manager, with a dedicated button on both consoles to bring up a Command Center quick menu. This allows you to instantly switch power profiles, create custom control inputs, or set frame rate limits. It also offers a real-time monitor displaying useful system information like temperature, CPU and GPU performance, battery level and power drain, and the current frame rate. However, fully open Armoury Crate and you’ll find an array of far deeper controls, from granular system settings to tweaking color profiles of the LED rings that sit under each thumbstick. It also has its own Update Center—yet another to check—and its own unified library, distinct from the Xbox app’s. After a week with the X-ROGs, I’m finally familiar with where functions live, but the learning curve is steep, and having essentially three central interfaces—Xbox, Windows, Armoury Crate—for a single device is ridiculous.",https://www.wired.com/review/review-xbox-rog-ally-and-rog-ally-x,Technology,Washington Post,Matt Kamen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eec838eadc50eb0ecc7418/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20Xbox%20ROG%20Ally%20X.png",2025-10-15T09:00:00-04:00,2da30c7d915a42349083b0636a054e724fb33766
26ef4302c103,The Best Résumé Builders to Land a New Job,"buying guides, shopping, software, jobs, work, office, how-to","I knew almost immediately after I started using FlowCV that it’d earn a spot on this list. It’s everything you want out of a résumé builder. It has excellent templates, plenty of customization, tools for tracking and modifying existing CVs, and a web application that doesn’t chug or sputter out when you’re working on a design. And, unlike a lot of résumé builders, FlowCV lets you design, download, and print a résumé and cover letter for free. You can start from scratch or upload an existing résumé (either PDF or raw text), and from there, FlowCV will walk you through each section of your CV. These sections are customizable, and they don’t lock you into a particular template. Some résumés may want a section for languages, while others want you to list awards. You can add or remove sections as needed, and you won’t break the formatting on the template (it happens more often than you think). Managing everything from sections makes customizing your résumé much easier. Instead of sliding around disparate text boxes and trying to line everything up perfectly, FlowCV will automatically update the layout as you change sections. For instance, I was using a two-column template for my résumé, but there was way too much information in the right column, causing my résumé to sprawl out across two pages. I was able to drag some sections over to the left column to balance the layout, and FlowCV automatically ensured everything was lined up and spaced properly. It’s this high-level customization that makes FlowCV so great. You can easily make broad changes without getting into specific text boxes or design elements. For example, there’s an option to automatically flip your job title and employer based on what you want to list first. FlowCV is my favorite résumé builder, but customizing a CV is only scratching the surface of what it can do. There are also templates for cover letters, email signatures, and online résumé websites. My favorite addition is a Kanban board. It's like Trello , but built directly into FlowCV, and it allows you to track jobs and their status as you move through the process. You get one résumé and one cover letter for free, no strings attached. However, I recommend the Basic plan for most people, which includes three résumés, 20 cover letters, along with the online résumé feature and Kanban board. FlowCV doesn’t focus on AI writing as much as other résumé builders, but if that’s something you’re after, you can unlock AI features with the Pro+ plan, which also includes unlimited résumé and cover letters.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-resume-builders,Technology,Washington Post,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eeae717c200f52288c73c6/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/W1102806-Credit-Jacob-Roach.JPG",2025-10-15T12:30:00+00:00,4f9b18324de643c80a4a023a461ed9fe76639687
570e27b89a40,The Best Pet Cameras,"buying guides, shopping, privacy, smart home, home, pets, cats, dogs, security camera, cameras, camera","Compare Our Picks Others Tested Photograph: Molly Higgins Enabot Rola PetPal Robot Pet Companion for $199 (with no attachments) : This rolling pet camera has the best of intentions, but the sometimes glitchy app makes the combo pet camera/toy/feeder a little unpredictable. Through the app, you can watch your pets on the security cam and drive the robot around, pressing buttons to do tricks and dispense treats. You can watch the camera feed live from the app, but you can also schedule recordings, which are viewable via Cloud Playback, and it compiles a 30-second “day in the life” compilation. The robot is also supposed to detect abnormal movement or sounds, like barking or broken glass, and send a smart alert to the owner with a timestamp while away from home. Through AI-powered pet recognition, the bot can also snap a picture of your pet, but the AI features were unreliable. Petcube Cam for $32 : This simple, compact camera doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it’s a great price for being a reliable, basic pet camera. Like others in Petcube's lineup, it has a 1080p HD camera, night vision, and two-way audio. It sits on hinges and can angle upward and downward, with the option to flip the video feed in-app if you want to lay it horizontally. You'll need the brand's subscription Care plan to get any features beyond live feed. You can set a “motion zone” to only get notifications in a specific area, and you connect your phone's location to the app, so that you're alerted more often when away. You can also share the camera feed with others so they can watch remotely and only specify certain times you want shared. This camera is basic, but it has a high-quality camera feed and advanced extras that make it a steal at this price. Photograph: Molly Higgins Catit Pixi Smart Mouse Camera for $90 : This cutie looks like a miniature mouse with oversized, magnetic feet that attach to a metal stand, and the mouse legs hinge so you can adjust the camera's height and angle. It's cute but expensive for what it is—the lens doesn't move and requires microSD to get video footage beyond a live feed (with the SD card, you can scroll through the video to see the goings-on from past days, record live footage, and save photos and videos to your smartphone’s camera roll). Although it was hard to pinpoint exactly which time you're looking at when reviewing footage, video feed can be laggy, and there were connectivity issues a few times. It's a tad expensive at this price point for its (lack of) capabilities. Closer Pets TreatView with Pet Camera for $100 : This solid pet cam features an HD camera, two-way communication, motion detection, a built-in memory card, and 1-cup storage for kibble or treats, which can be scheduled or given at random. The video feed was always crystal clear, although sound was a bit laggy and hard to hear well. The treat portions were huge, dispensing a heaping handful of kibble at even the lowest setting. The alert sound when dispensing is super jarring, and my pets were scared of it—there was no way to silence it. Because of the placement of the hole for dispensing kibble, the camera is angled low, which made it hard to see the area I wanted. This is a solid pet camera whose additional features become a burden rather than an asset. AccordionItemContainerButton Keeping the criteria in mind above, I looked for security cameras that had extra pet-specific features. I set up each camera individually, noting any difficulty or issues with initial setup, configuration with Wi-Fi, and speed and reliability of the camera feed. I tested each camera for at least a week (most, much longer) in various spots around my house and rigorously tested the extra features available on most of the cameras, like scheduled feedings, food-dispensing, playtime, and scheduled recordings, and I noted any issues. Over the months of testing, I went out of town several times and completely relied on these cams to keep an eye on my two children—I mean, cats. So, Is There Really a Difference Between Security Cameras and Pet Cameras? Sort Of AccordionItemContainerButton Security cameras enable you to watch your house (and pet) while you're away, but pet cameras often have a few more pet-specific features, like dispensing treats or abilities to interact with your pet via two-way speaker. These cameras with special features can help ease common issues like separation anxiety or boredom. The Enabot Rola PetPal Robot Pet Companion , for example, has attachments so you can remotely give your pet a treat or engage in “playtime."" That's not to say that you can't use a security camera as a pet cam, but like any other smart home device that connects to Wi-Fi, there's a chance it can be hacked and compromise your privacy. Make sure your Wi-Fi password is strong, set up two-factor authentication with your camera's app, and it's not a bad idea to keep it turned off when you're home, as an extra precaution.

7a865c9ea808,A New Road Safety Group Targets Self-Driving Cars,"tesla, robotaxis, self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, policy, traffic","A new advocacy group is pushing state lawmakers to pass more stringent autonomous vehicle regulations. The group, Safe Autonomous Vehicles Everywhere in the United States (SAVE-US), says its goal is to ensure that new self-driving technology will save lives instead of doing harm. Its work has a clear target: Tesla . The campaign , announced on Wednesday, counts among its goals passing legislation that would require tech developers to be clearer about the limits of their driving technology; report more specific and public crash information to states; and use multiple sensors on their vehicles. In the US, regulations governing autonomous vehicles are generally handled by the states, whose laws range from stringent (California) to relatively permissive (Arizona, Texas). Fourteen US states don’t have autonomous-vehicle-related laws at all. The group will initially target lawmakers in large states, including Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, says Shua Sanchez, the group’s national campaign director. Sanchez and Bob Somers, SAVE-US’s technical adviser, met this summer outside an administrative hearing in Oakland, California. Inside, attorneys for California's Department of Motor Vehicles argued that Tesla should temporarily lose its license to manufacture and sell vehicles in the state because, they alleged, the electric automaker had falsely advertised its Full Self-Driving and Autopilot driver assistance features. Sanchez, a physicist, had been following Tesla closely since he got involved in the Tesla Takedown movement earlier this year, leading demonstrations outside of a showroom in Boston to protest CEO Elon Musk’s involvement with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency . Somers had worked as an engineer at the self-driving vehicle developer Zoox for half a decade. (He’s since left the autonomous vehicle industry.) In Oakland, they agreed: Autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to save lives. But rushing the technology, or confusing customers about its limits, is unsafe and could doom the whole project. (An administrative judge is due to decide on the Tesla case later this year.) ""It's fair to say that Tesla is the worst actor in this space, but that definitely doesn't mean every other company is a perfect actor either,” says Sanchez. “If we don't have good regulations in place, we leave the door open for any company to pursue an unsafe path.” Unlike many of its competitors, which use pricier radars and lidars plus cameras, Tesla depends on vision-only software, arguing that more effective cameras and AI-trained software alone can safely pilot its vehicles. The tech strategy is at the center of one of Tesla’s chief promises: That one day, the cars it has already manufactured will be able to completely drive themselves thanks to a quick software update. Competitors, including Waymo and Zoox, use more expensive and purpose-built robotaxis to pull off their autonomous rides. Last week, the US federal government said it had opened an investigation of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software following reports that the feature, which is not autonomous and must be supervised by a driver behind the wheel, ran red lights and drove on the wrong side of the street.",https://www.wired.com/story/road-safety-group-save-us-targets-self-driving-cars,Technology,Washington Post,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed64b64991e2f0569dd36d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/gear-tesla-robotaxi-2220873143.jpg",2025-10-15T11:00:00+00:00,f879094fac1b9857b3389962aea0e5e812f4538c

d8c1fa142a08,When Face Recognition Doesn’t Know Your Face Is a Face,"artificial intelligence, algorithms, machine learning, privacy, ethics, regulation, face recognition","“If you don’t include people with disabilities or people with facial differences in the development of these processes, no one’s going to think of these issues,” says Kathleen Bogart, a psychology professor at Oregon State University who specializes in disability research and lives with a facial difference. “AI has amplified these issues, but it’s rooted in long-standing underrepresentation and prejudice towards people with facial differences that occurred long before AI was a thing.” Too Little, Too Late When face verification systems fail, it’s often hard to find help—piling more pressure on a stressful situation. For months, Maryland resident Noor Al-Khaled has struggled to create an online account with the Social Security Administration. Al-Khaled, who lives with the rare cranio-facial condition Ablepheron Macrostomia , says having an online account would allow her to easily access SSA records and quickly send documents to the agency. “I don’t drive because of my vision; I should be able to rely on the site,” Al-Khaled says. “You have to take a selfie, and the pictures have to match,” Al-Khaled says. “Because of the facial difference, I don't know if it’s not recognizing the ID or the selfie, but it’s always saying images don’t match.” Not having that access makes life harder. “On an emotional level, it just makes me feel shut out from society,” she explains. Al-Khaled says that all services should provide alternative ways for people to access online systems. “The lack of other fallback options means that sometimes people get trapped in these labyrinths of technological systems,” says Byrum from Present Moment Enterprises. An SSA spokesperson says alternative options to face verification are available, and it is “committed” to making its services accessible to everyone. The agency, the spokesperson says, does not run facial recognition systems itself but uses Login.gov and ID.me for verification services. The General Services Administration, which runs Login.gov, did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. “Accessibility is a core priority for ID.me,” a spokesperson for ID.me says, adding it has previously helped people with facial differences and offered to directly help Al-Khaled after WIRED was in touch. “There are few things more dehumanizing than being told by a machine that you’re not real because of your face,” says Corey R. Taylor , a New York–based actor and motivational speaker who lives with a craniofacial anomaly. Last year, Taylor says, he was using a financial app to access a small amount of money; as he tried to complete the payment processes, he found that the face verification system could not match his selfie to the image on his ID. To get the system to work, he had to move into different positions. “I had to literally raise my eyes and contort my face,” Taylor says. When he emailed the company, he got what appeared to be a boilerplate response.",https://www.wired.com/story/when-face-recognition-doesnt-know-your-face-is-a-face,Technology,Washington Post,Matt Burgess,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68d2b8a6ec02cfea46385bf5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/FacialRecognition_Illo.png",2025-10-15T09:30:00+00:00,eb4d6e8eff3db862d28539fd415eac389af8efc2
1f046707f553,Waymo’s Robotaxis Are Coming to London,"self-driving cars, google, autonomous vehicles, uber, robotaxis, waymo","Waymo is expanding to London, the self-driving vehicle developer announced on Wednesday. The Google sister company aims to start service next year, when the UK government plans to allow autonomous vehicles to begin operating on its roads in limited pilot programs. Waymo says it’s working with the government to receive the necessary permissions for its launch. This is only Waymo ’s second venture outside the United States—though could be its first international robotaxi service. The company has been testing robotaxis in Tokyo since April , where it works with Japanese taxi company Nihon Kotsu, whose drivers are helping Waymo map and collect driving data from the city, and Japanese ride-hail firm GO. However, the company won’t say when it plans to launch autonomous taxis in Japan. London could prove the company’s biggest challenge yet. Unlike more car-oriented cities in the US, London’s streets are more winding and narrow, the city's layout a legacy of its pre-Roman and medieval history. “We will take the same rigorous approach to testing and deploying in London as we have in other cities before offering rides to the public,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher wrote in an email. He says Waymo’s experience in Tokyo will help its software drive in London. Waymo operates paid taxi service in five US cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. (It operates the latter two services through the Uber app.) It has announced plans to launch in Dallas, Miami, Nashville, and Washington, DC, next year. It has also received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in New York City, though it must do so with a safety driver behind the wheel. The company says it has provided more than 10 million paid rides since it picked up its first customers in 2020. Waymo’s move follows the UK government’s announcement this spring that it would accelerate by more than a year its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small numbers starting in 2026. Government officials intend to spend about a year studying the data those vehicles produce before allowing companies to more widely launch driverless taxi services in the second half of 2027. Homegrown British autonomous vehicle developer Wayve has already announced it will work with Uber to operate robotaxis in London. UK secretary of state for transport Heidi Alexander said in a statement that she was “delighted” about Waymo’s plans. “Boosting the [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment, and opportunities to the UK,” she said. Waymo says it will work with fleet-operations firm Moove to run an eventual London fleet. Moove will help manage and dispatch Waymo’s electric ride-hail vehicles, and will maintain and operate the service’s maintenance and charging depots. Moove is also working with Waymo in Phoenix, and eventually, Miami.",https://www.wired.com/story/waymos-robotaxis-are-coming-to-london,Technology,Washington Post,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed65faa996be3605822787/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/gear-waymo-2085252384.jpg",2025-10-15T09:00:00+00:00,362c6dadb800a0ddc1424f995c1873d6c2bd149d
74ac19053910,SpaceX’s Second-Gen Starship Signs Off With a Near-Perfect Test Flight,"ars technica, science, space, spacex, elon musk","In the closing moments of Monday’s flight, Starship flexed its flaps to perform a “dynamic banking maneuver” over the Indian Ocean, then flipped upright and fired its engines to slow for splashdown, simulating maneuvers the rocket will execute on future missions returning to the launch site. That will be one of the chief goals for the next phase of Starship’s test campaign beginning next year. Patience for V3 It will likely be at least a few months before SpaceX is ready to launch the next Starship flight. Technicians at Starbase are assembling the next Super Heavy booster and the first Starship V3 vehicle. Once integrated, the booster and ship are expected to undergo cryogenic testing and static-fire testing before SpaceX moves forward with launch. “Focus now turns to the next generation of Starship and Super Heavy, with multiple vehicles currently in active build and preparing for tests,” SpaceX wrote on its website. “This next iteration will be used for the first Starship orbital flights, operational payload missions, propellant transfer, and more as we iterate to a fully and rapidly reusable vehicle with service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.” Starship V3 will have larger propellant tanks to increase the rocket’s lifting capacity, upgraded Raptor 3 engines, and an improved payload compartment to support launches of real Starlink satellites. SpaceX will also use this version of the rocket for orbital refueling experiments, a long-awaited milestone for the Starship program now planned for sometime next year. Orbital refueling is a crucial enabler for future Starship flights beyond low Earth orbit and is necessary for SpaceX to fulfill Musk’s ambition to send ships to Mars, the founder’s long-held goal for the company. It’s also required for Starship flights to the moon. NASA has signed contracts with SpaceX worth more than $4 billion to develop a human-rated derivative of Starship to land astronauts on the moon as part of the agency’s Artemis program. The orbital refueling demonstration is a key milestone on the NASA lunar lander contract. Getting this done as soon as possible is vitally important to NASA , which is seeing its Artemis moon-landing schedule slip, in part due to Starship delays.",https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/after-year-of-hardships-spacexs-starship-finally-flirts-with-perfection,Technology,Washington Post,"Stephen Clark, Ars Technica","https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee74d35e55b3e41cfee209/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2240504914.jpg",2025-10-15T07:00:00+00:00,1cfbd3ee0ce97709e7b692301675de551e42cb76

217c3ad184f3,A Quarter of the CDC Is Gone,"cdc, robert f. kennedy jr., public health, government","After the latest round of mass firings at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend, the union that represents agency employees estimates that around 3,000 people this year—about a quarter of the agency’s workforce—have departed the agency. That number includes workers affected by layoffs earlier this year , as well those who have accepted the Trump administration’s “Fork in the Road” buyout program. The most recent cuts came down amid the ongoing government shutdown. On October 10, more than 1,300 CDC employees received termination notices. Soon after, however, about 700 of those people were told via email that they were mistakenly terminated and were not in fact subject to the reduction in force. An estimated 600 people remain terminated. An additional 1,300 CDC employees are, according to the union, on administrative leave and being paid but not working. The Trump administration has not shared official numbers of those targeted by the reductions. The estimate was compiled by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2883, which represents CDC workers. The current round of reductions affects the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the National Center for Health Statistics, the CDC library, the agency’s human resources department, campus safety staff, as well as the CDC’s office in Washington, DC, which acts as a liaison to Congress and provides public health information to policymakers. “All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated nonessential by their respective divisions,” Andrew Nixon, director of communication at the Department of Health and Human Services, told WIRED via email. Among those reinstated include staff that publish the agency’s flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, as well as leadership in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, according to AFGE. Members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, the CDC’s “disease detectives” unit, were also brought back. The CDC has been in turmoil since HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took office in February. In addition to carrying out mass layoffs, Kennedy is attempting to upend established vaccine policy. Earlier this year, he removed all 17 sitting members of a federal vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with members of his choosing. Several are vaccine skeptics and have been critical of public health measures taken during the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, Kennedy fired CDC director Susan Monarez, who had been in the position for just a month. Monarez told a Senate committee in September that Kennedy demanded she sign off on new vaccine recommendations “regardless of the scientific evidence” and dismiss career officials without cause. During her short time at the CDC, a gunman opened fire on the agency’s Atlanta campus and killed a police officer who responded to the shooting.",https://www.wired.com/story/cdc-terminations-workforce-shutdown-rifs,Technology,Washington Post,Emily Mullin,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee7c1021984a45f842f29d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1570746389.jpg",2025-10-14T21:51:41.513000+00:00,16c79e6e7a51dd8d5bce7f51e7f1f19bb342ff07
98d250a7e3fe,A New Attack Lets Hackers Steal 2-Factor Authentication Codes From Android Phones,"ars technica, cybersecurity, hacking, malware, vulnerabilities, security, hacks, android, google, samsung","Android devices are vulnerable to a new attack that can covertly steal two-factor authentication codes, location timelines, and other private data in less than 30 seconds. The new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed. Like Taking a Screenshot Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a side channel that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes. “Anything that is visible when the target app is opened can be stolen by the malicious app using Pixnapping,” the researchers wrote on an informational website . “Chat messages, 2FA codes, email messages, etc. are all vulnerable since they are visible. If an app has secret information that is not visible (e.g., it has a secret key that is stored but never shown on the screen), that information cannot be stolen by Pixnapping.” The new attack class is reminiscent of GPU.zip , a 2023 attack that allowed malicious websites to read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual data displayed by other websites. It worked by exploiting side channels found in GPUs from all major suppliers. The vulnerabilities that GPU.zip exploited have never been fixed. Instead, the attack was blocked in browsers by limiting their ability to open iframes, an HTML element that allows one website (in the case of GPU.zip, a malicious one) to embed the contents of a site from a different domain. Pixnapping targets the same side channel as GPU.zip, specifically the precise amount of time it takes for a given frame to be rendered on the screen. “This allows a malicious app to steal sensitive information displayed by other apps or arbitrary websites, pixel by pixel,” Alan Linghao Wang, lead author of the research paper “ Pixnapping: Bringing Pixel Stealing out of the Stone Age ,” explained in an interview. “Conceptually, it is as if the malicious app was taking a screenshot of screen contents it should not have access to. Our end-to-end attacks simply measure the rendering time per frame of the graphical operations to determine whether the pixel was white or nonwhite.” Pixnapping in 3 Steps The attack occurs in three main steps. In the first, the malicious app invokes Android APIs that make calls to the app the attacker wants to snoop on. These calls can also be used to effectively scan an infected device for installed apps of interest. The calls can further cause the targeted app to display specific data it has access to, such as a message thread in a messaging app or a 2FA code for a specific site. This call causes the information to be sent to the Android rendering pipeline, the system that takes each app's pixels so they can be rendered on the screen. The Android-specific calls made include activities , intents , and tasks . In the second step, Pixnapping performs graphical operations on individual pixels that the targeted app sent to the rendering pipeline. These operations choose the coordinates of target pixels the app wants to steal and begin to check if the color of those coordinates is white or nonwhite or, more generally, if the color is c or non-c (for an arbitrary color c).",https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/no-fix-yet-for-attack-that-lets-hackers-pluck-2fa-codes-from-android-phones,Technology,Washington Post,"Dan Goodin, Ars Technica","https://media.wired.com/photos/68eea04bb966a95f54c9f532/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1816802439.jpg",2025-10-14T21:40:00+00:00,51dada99fc28dc0e727984895d1fd4c4d19d8223
c228ce72cf99,A Plan to Rebuild Gaza Lists Nearly 30 Companies. Many Say They’re Not Involved,"israel, architecture, palestine, war, politics, donald trump, ikea, tesla","A sweeping plan to reconstruct Gaza, which has been shared with Trump administration officials, features the names and logos of more than two dozen companies—some of which tell WIRED they had no knowledge they were named or involved. The presentation outlining the plan was reportedly created by some of the businessmen who helped ideate what became the controversial nonprofit the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is currently leading aid distribution in Gaza, calling for the creation of a new entity called the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation (GREAT) Trust. In the presentation, logos from Tesla, Amazon Web Services, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) appear alongside bullet points about the benefit ""private industry investment” may have in Gaza in terms of building out ""key infrastructure"" like data centers and ""gigafactories."" On one slide, the logos of several companies, including Ikea, appear alongside descriptions of large-scale ""infrastructure rebuild"" and ""peacekeeping (optional)"" in Gaza. WIRED contacted the 28 companies shown alongside proposals for construction, security, and private-sector investment in postwar Gaza—sectors that would be among the first to mobilize if the plans were to be set in motion. Of the companies that responded, zero said they were aware of their names and logos being used in this proposal. Eight of those companies replied to WIRED and said that they had not been in contact with anyone who developed the presentation or made even informal plans or agreements with them. Some had absolutely no knowledge they were named in this plan. “This was surprising and new information for us,” Ikea spokesperson Arvid Stigland tells WIRED. “We have not approved the use of the Ikea logo in this context.” “TSMC is not associated with this proposal and did not consent to the use of its logo,” a company spokesperson told WIRED. InterContinental Hotels Group spokesperson Mike Ward tells WIRED that the company “has had no involvement in this document and is not pursuing any plans connected to it.” Tesla, Amazon, and Constellis did not respond to requests for comment. Of the security contractors mentioned in the presentation, only G4S responded to WIRED’s query. It denied any association with any current or future group called “the GREAT Trust.” “We have had no communications thus far and have no plans to participate in security services in Gaza,” a G4S spokesperson tells WIRED. A person with knowledge of the presentation, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said that it was created as a form of market research, demonstrating which companies could contribute to redevelopment rather than which ones had discussed or agreed to anything.",https://www.wired.com/story/a-plan-to-rebuild-gaza-lists-nearly-30-companies-many-say-theyre-not-involved,Technology,Washington Post,Caroline Haskins,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed4634d9a0d6c1df85c0c8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/biz-gaza-rebuild-2235033539.jpg",2025-10-14T20:13:09.074000+00:00,84a0dc5b5152e75f644cf8d8c79ef19bba9d91dc
803c299e78b3,Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Spewing Water Like a Cosmic Fire Hydrant,"science, comet, space, nasa, telescope","Comet 3I/Atlas continues to be full of surprises. As well as being only the third interstellar object ever detected, new analysis shows it is producing hydroxyl (OH) emissions, with these compounds betraying the presence of water on its surface. This discovery was made by a team of researchers at Auburn University in Alabama using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and was described in a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters . Hydroxyl compounds are detectable via the ultraviolet signature they produce. But on Earth, a lot of UV wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere, which is why the researchers had to use the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory—a space telescope free from interference experienced by observatories on Earth. Water is present in virtually every comet seen in the solar system, so much so that the chemical and physical reactions of water are used to measure, catalog, and track these celestial objects and how they react to the heat of the sun. Finding it on 3I/ATLAS means being able to study its characteristics using the same scale used for regular comets, and this information could in future be useful data for studying the processes of comets that originate in other star systems as well. “When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, an Auburn University physicist who collaborated on the research, in a press statement . “It tells us that the ingredients for life’s chemistry are not unique to our own.” Comets are frozen hunks of rock, gases, and dust that usually orbit stars (the exceptions being the three interstellar objects found so far). When they’re far away from a star, they’re completely frozen, but as they get closer, solar radiation causes their frozen elements to heat up and sublimate—turn from solid into gas—with some of this material emitted from the comet’s nucleus thanks to the star’s energy, forming a “tail.” But with 3I/ATLAS, data collected revealed an unexpected detail: OH production by the comet was already happening far away from the sun—when the comet was more than three times farther from the sun than the Earth—in a region of the solar system where temperatures normally aren’t sufficient to easily produce the sublimation of ice. Already at that distance, however, 3I/ATLAS was leaking water at the rate of about 40 kilograms per second, a flow comparable—the study authors explain—to that of a “hydrant at maximum power.” This detail would seem to indicate a more complex structure than what is usually observed in comets in the solar system. It could, for example, be explained by the presence of small fragments of ice detaching from the comet’s nucleus, and which are then vaporized by the heat of sunlight, going on to feed a gaseous cloud that surrounds the celestial body. This is something that has so far been observed only in a small number of extremely distant comets, and which could provide valuable information about the processes from which 3I/ATLAS originated. “Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, an Auburn University researcher and coauthor of the discovery, in a press statement . “‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it. Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.” This story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",https://www.wired.com/story/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-is-spewing-water-like-a-cosmic-fire-hydrant,Technology,Washington Post,Simone Valesini,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee73725e8cd475a202eac2/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/SPHERExImage1-ezgif.com-crop.jpg",2025-10-14T19:03:23.943000+00:00,f899c3c31cf0cbd23500ea96485d0fa21ad38e01
aabb687ba639,The 50 Best Shows on Hulu Right Now,"culture guides, hulu, tv","While Netflix seemingly led the way for other streaming networks to create compelling original programming, Hulu actually beat them all to the punch. In 2011, a year before Netflix ’s Lilyhammer and two years before the arrival of House of Cards , the burgeoning streamer premiered The Morning After , a pop-culture-focused news show that ran for 800 episodes over three years. Hulu has continued to make TV history in the years since, most notably in 2017 when it became the first streamer to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series with The Handmaid’s Tale (which recently dropped its long-awaited final season). In the years since, the streamer has continued to match—and often exceed—that high bar for quality entertainment with shows Shōgun , which set an Emmy record in 2024 with 18 wins in a single season, and The Bear . While more competition has popped up since Hulu started gaining critical credibility, the network has continued to stand out for its carefully curated selection of original series and network partnerships that make it the home of FX series and more. Below are some of our favorite shows streaming on Hulu right now. Not finding what you’re looking for?

Murdaugh: Death in the Family In February 2019, Lowcountry lawyer Alex Murdaugh brought his prominent South Carolina family’s name into spotlight when his 19-year-old son Paul, after a long night of partying, crashed the family’s boat into a bridge with five other people aboard. One of the teens—19-year-old Mallory Beach—was thrown from the vessel and did not survive. It was just the beginning of a bizarre, yearslong series of tragedies that struck the family, resulting in multiple arrests, murders, and ultimately two life sentences for Alex Murdaugh. Jason Clarke ( Zero Dark Thirty ) and Patricia Arquette ( Severance ) take on the role of Alex and Maggie Murdaugh in this dramatic retelling of the crimes that have rocked a nation. Abbott Elementary Quinta Brunson created and stars in this hit series, which follows the daily lives—in and out of the classroom—of a group of teachers at what is widely considered one of the worst public schools in America. Despite a lack of funding for even basic educational necessities and school district leaders who care only about the barest minimum standards, these educators are united by their drive to surpass expectations and encourage their students to do the same. The series has been a huge hit for ABC, which premieres its new episodes on Wednesdays, which then arrive on Hulu the following day. The show’s fifth season kicked off on October 1. Solar Opposites This animated sci-fi comedy, which premiered in 2020, is about a family of aliens from the planet Shlorp who crash-land on Earth—for better or worse. The show is rooted in the idea that humans are, well, weird. Which seems appropriate given this moment in time. Yet, in between the laughs and occasional threat to humanity, it maintains a positive outlook on the world and the people who inhabit it, which is something we could probably all use right about now. So it’s a good thing the show’s highly anticipated sixth season just arrived on October 13. The bad news, however, is that this season will be its last. Only Murders in the Building Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez make for a delightful trio of true-crime-obsessed podcast fans who, in season 1 of this original Hulu series, decide to join forces and create their own podcast while attempting to solve the mysterious death of a fellow resident of their Manhattan apartment building. From the very beginning of their odd alliance, it’s been clear that all is not what it seems, and everyone is keeping secrets. The show has also managed to attract an increasingly stellar list of guest stars, some of them recurring characters, that includes Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd, Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani, Tina Fey, Melissa McCarthy, Zach Galifianakis, Sting, Nathan Lane, and Jane Lynch. Season 5, which contains some fun nods to The Godfather , kicked off on September 9 and features Bobby Cannavale, Renée Zellweger, Christoph Waltz, Keegan-Michael Key, Téa Leoni, Logan Lerman, Beanie Feldstein, Dianne Wiest, and Richard Kind. Tempest This action-filled spy drama from South Korea is a thrilling—and timely—tale of global corruption at the highest levels. Jang Jun-ik (Park Hae-joon) is a presidential candidate who dreams of bringing peace to his people—a notion that doesn’t sit well with everyone. When he is assassinated just feet from his wife, Seo Mun-ju (Jun Ji-hyun), a former ambassador, she vows to get to the truth behind her husband’s murder. What she discovers is a chilling conspiracy that threatens world peace and leads all the way to the White House. Good thing she’s got mercenary Baek San-ho (Gang Dong-won) by her side. The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox In September 2007, Amanda Knox was just another American college student opting to study abroad for a year. Just weeks later, she was on the front page of newspapers around the world following the brutal murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, which Knox was eventually arrested for. Nearly 20 years—and one controversial murder conviction—later, Knox is reclaiming her own narrative to tell her version of events in this new Hulu series, which is based on Knox’s own memoir and executive produced by Knox and Monica Lewinsky. Though the series’ campiness doesn’t always land given the subject matter, star Grace Van Patten’s impressive performance helps to ground the story. Alien: Earth With Fargo , Noah Hawley proved that he could transform an iconic movie into a compelling TV series. Now he’s done it again with Alien: Earth , a prequel series that takes place just two years before the events of Ridley Scott’s original Alien movie . The series revolves around the Prodigy Corporation, a tech company that has come up with a way to transfer the consciousness of terminally ill children into the bodies of synthetic beings. Wendy (Sydney Chandler) is one of these “hybrids,” whose memory of her past turns out to be a complication, especially when she volunteers herself and her fellow hybrids to investigate the mysterious crash of a Weyland-Yutani research spacecraft, which houses all sorts of horrors—and creatures. King of the Hill Fifteen years after saying goodbye, Mike Judge and Greg Daniels’ beloved animated series is taking viewers back to Arlen, Texas, home of propane salesman Hank Hill (Judge), his wife Peggy (Kathy Najimy), and their son Bobby (Pamela Adlon). Hank and Peggy have been away for a while, living in Saudi Arabia while Hank saves for their retirement. But their return home is bittersweet, for as much as Arlen has remained the same, the world around them has changed. Dope Girls Though it’s not based on a true story, Dope Girls is inspired by a nonfiction book, Marek Cohen’s Dope Girls: The Birth of the British Drug Underground , and a very real part of British history. In the wake of World War I, Kate Galloway (Julianne Nicholson) is a widow and mom who needs to provide for her family. She ends up building one of London’s most popular underground nightclubs, and a drug empire that would make Walter White blush. Washington Black Esi Edugyan’s 2018 best-selling historical fiction novel gets the miniseries treatment via Hulu. Eleven-year-old George Washington “Wash” Black (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) flees from his native Barbados to Nova Scotia following a tragic incident at the plantation where he was enslaved. Once free, Wash meets Medwin Harris (Sterling K. Brown), who is impressed with Wash’s intelligence and determination, and sees a lot of himself in the youngster. So he takes him under his wing in order to help him make the most of the second chance at life he has been given. The Bear Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) is a superstar of the fine-dining world who has returned to his hometown of Chicago to save his family’s failing sandwich shop after his brother’s death by suicide. While Carmy initially struggles to acclimate himself to being home and to his inherited kitchen’s back-to-basics style, he eventually realizes that it’s not too late to change both himself and the restaurant. Anyone who has ever worked in a busy kitchen knows the stress that comes with it, and The Bear does an excellent job of making that tension palpable. While the plot sounds simple enough, much of Carmy’s previous life is a bit of a mystery, and it’s doled out in amuse-bouche-sized bits throughout the series with top-tier guest stars you may not have seen coming. (Fact: Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better, as evidenced by her very first Emmy win in 2024.) The Bear ’s fourth season answers viewers’ pressing questions about Carmy’s partnership with Syd (Ayo Edebiri) and what the future holds for their restaurant. Prepare to feast. Such Brave Girls Comedian/actress Kat Sadler created and stars in this deeply messy, darkly funny story of a totally dysfunctional family—mom Deb ( Sherlock ’s Louise Brealey) and daughters Josie (Sadler) and Billie (Lizzie Davidson, Sadler’s real-life sister)—attempting to pick up the pieces after their husband/father leaves them. It’s cringe-comedy at its finest, and the kind that will appeal to fans of Fleabag . The series’ second season arrived in July. Adults Though many have dubbed Adults a Gen Z version of Friends , the similarities begin and end with the fact that it’s about a group of twentysomething pals trying to find themselves in New York City. When Samir’s (Malik Elassal) parents take off traveling, he invites a few of his pals—Anton (Owen Thiele), Billie (Lucy Freyer), and Issa (Amita Rao)—to come crash with him at his childhood home in Queens. While they all see it as a chance to supercharge their jump into adulthood, complete with hosting dinner parties, they soon realize they’re each in over their heads in their own ways when it comes to taking on the responsibilities that come with being a part of the real world. Welcome to Wrexham In 2020, actor pals Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney (now legally known simply as “Rob Mac”) decided to take their friendship to the next level—by purchasing Wales’ Wrexham AFC, one of the world’s oldest football (aka soccer) clubs, which had long been struggling and was on the verge of possibly disappearing altogether. Enter the two Hollywood stars and their dreams of bringing the club back to its former glory. Like a real-life Ted Lasso , this docuseries follows the two as they begin to understand that what might have started as a lark is a literally game-changing turn for the players and people of Wrexham in reclaiming their storied sporting history. All four seasons of the series are streaming, with a fifth in the works. The Handmaid’s Tale When Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale in 1985, little did she know that its television adaptation would revolutionize the still-nascent world of original streaming content. And she may not have anticipated just how many parallels her dystopian classic would share with the real world at the time it was adapted into an award-winning television series. It’s set in an unnamed time in what is presumably the very near future, when the United States has been taken over by a fundamentalist group known as Gilead, under whose regime women are considered property and stripped of any personal rights. The most valuable women are those who are fertile, as infertility has become an epidemic, and they are kept as handmaids who are forced to take part in sexual rituals with high-ranking couples in order to bear their children. Recognizing the power she wields, Offred, aka June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss), is not content to remain enslaved and sets about changing the rules as she seeks to reunite with her lost husband and daughter, becoming romantically entangled with a Gilead Guardian (Max Minghella) in the process. The Handmaid’s Tale's sixth, and final, season is streaming in full now. Dying for Sex Five-time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams plays Molly Kochan, a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage who learns that she has terminal stage IV breast cancer. After revealing that she has never had an orgasm with another person, it becomes apparent to Molly and everyone caring for her that this should be at the top of her bucket list. Realizing she doesn’t have much time left, Molly leaves her husband and, with the help of her best friend Nikki (Jenny Slate), sets out to achieve the sexual satisfaction that has eluded her all her life—with unexpected consequences. New Girl creator ​​Liz Meriwether teamed up with Kim Rosenstock ( Only Murders in the Building ) to create this hit new series, which is based on the life of the real Molly Kochan, creator of the Dying for Sex podcast, which launched in 2020. It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia If you thought the characters on Seinfeld were terrible people, wait until you meet the gang from Paddy’s Pub. For 20 years, Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Robert “Rob Mac” McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) have unapologetically plotted against each other and total strangers in a series of completely self-centered schemes with absolutely no regard for the rules of civility. The show follows the “ no hugging and no learning ” rule Larry David established for Seinfeld , but elevates it to a new level of sociopathy. “Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,” “Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack,” “How Mac Got Fat,” “Dennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender,” “The Gang Turns Black,” and “The Gang Goes to a Water Park” are just some of the offbeat adventures awaiting viewers. In 2021, Sunny became the longest-running live-action sitcom in the history of television, and it shows no signs of slowing down—or taking it easy on its characters. It also happens to be one of the easiest shows to binge: Pop an episode on and, without even realizing it, you’ll be on to another season. Its 17th (!!) season wrapped in August with at least one more already confirmed. Big Boys Creator Jack Rooke won a well-deserved BAFTA Award in 2024 for this semi-autobiographical dramedy about a closeted 19-year-old—also named Jack (Dylan Llewellyn)—who, after a year of mourning the death of his father at home with his overprotective mom, leaves for university. There, he’s paired up with Danny (Jon Pointing), a 25-year-old more interested in meeting women than studying, as his roommate. As Jack struggles to become comfortable with his sexuality, he also comes to understand the truth behind Danny’s seemingly extroverted personality. Yes, it’s a coming-of-age story and one in which opposites attract (on a purely platonic level). But it’s also a laugh-out-loud funny series that shows there is life after death. Deli Boys Pakistani American brothers Mir (Asif Ali) and Raj (Saagar Shaikh) Dar have spent their entire lives wanting for nothing, thanks to the hard work of their father, who owns a chain of convenience stores. But after a freak accident kills dear old dad, the brothers are expected to take on the family business which, unbeknownst to them, is actually a front for a drug smuggling empire. While their antics are undoubtedly hilarious, the series does attempt to paint a truthful portrait of the immigrant experience—even if it’s often through an absurdist lens. In late August, almost six months after the series premiered, Hulu finally confirmed that a second season is on its way, with former SNL star Fred Armisen joining the cast. A Thousand Blows If Netflix’s Emmy juggernaut Adolescence has you seeking out more of Stephen Graham’s work, check out Steven Knight’s A Thousand Blows —the Peaky Blinders creator’s newest British historical drama in which crime and violence collide. In this case it’s an all-female crime syndicate, the Forty Elephants, who are at the center of the action, with Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) as their leader. When Mary’s crew crosses notorious kingpin Sugar Goodson (Graham), she turns to Hezekiah Moscow (Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), two young men who have recently emigrated from Jamaica in order to make a better life for themselves, to help her escape Goodson’s wrath. Paradise This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman reteams with that award-winning series’ star, Sterling K. Brown, for an intricate political thriller which plays with time to slowly reveal the details of a secret service agent (Brown) tasked with protecting the president (James Marsden) who ultimately becomes a suspect in the POTUS’ death. Expect many twists—including a massive one to kick off the series in episode 1. A second season is already in the works and will add Shailene Woodley, Thomas Doherty, Michael McGrady, and Timothy Omundson to the cast. It is expected to premiere in early 2026. Scamanda “Why would somebody fake cancer?” That’s the question asked—and that ABC News attempts to answer—in this true crime docuseries based on the podcast of the same name. The four-part special recounts the life and lies of Amanda C. Riley, a wife, mother, churchgoer, and popular mommy blogger who was celebrated for sharing her fight against Hodgkin’s lymphoma with the world … only to have it all blow up in her face. Accused Like a reverse engineered version of Law & Order , Accused —adapted by Homeland cocreator Howard Gordon from the acclaimed British series of the same name—follows the justice system from the perspective of the accused. Each episode begins with the defendant in the courtroom and recounts (via flashbacks) the circumstances that led them there. Like Dick Wolf’s iconic crime series, each episode is full of familiar faces, from Whitney Cummings and Wendell Pierce to Molly Parker and Margo Martindale. Say Nothing Fact and fiction combine in this historical drama based on Patrick Radden Keefe’s novel that follows the lives of a group of people growing up in Belfast during the Troubles and their dealings with the Provisional IRA. Much of the story focuses on the Disappeared—a group of 16 people who went missing during the Troubles and were believed to have been kidnapped and murdered. Jean McConville was one of these individuals, both the only woman among them and the only Irish Catholic convert. Nearly 50 years later, many questions remain about these individuals. While Say Nothing doesn’t attempt to answer all of these questions, it does add fascinating context to the events. Interior Chinatown Willis Wu (Jimmy O. Yang) is a waiter who attempts to escape his humdrum life by imagining that he is a background actor in a Law & Order -esque TV show called Black & White . After Wu witnesses a kidnapping, police detective Lana Lee (Chloe Bennet) enlists him to help investigate and take down the local gangs in Chinatown—where he discovers something about his own family in the process. Nothing is what it seems in this meta comedy-crime series, which Charles Yu adapted from his own National Book Award–winning novel. The Daily Show ’s Ronny Chieng ups the comedy as Wu’s coworker/BFF Fatty Choi, and Taika Waititi (one of the show’s executive producers) directs the pilot. What We Do in the Shadows If you are in need of a laugh-out-loud comedy (and don’t mind if it’s of the sometimes R-rated kind), there are few better than What We Do in the Shadows . In 2014, Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi cowrote, codirected, and costarred in a feature of the same name—a funny mockumentary featuring a group of vampires who share a home. This series, which premiered in 2019, moved the vampire action from New Zealand to Staten Island and brought in a whole new group of vampires—who struggle to even get up off the couch, let alone take over all of New York City (as they’ve been instructed to). After several years, they finally seem ready to get around to the task. All six seasons of the series, which wrapped up its run in late 2024, are available for streaming. La Máquina Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna have been close friends since childhood, and it shows in the work they’ve done together—most famously in Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-nominated Y Tu Mamá También (2001). More than two decades later, their onscreen chemistry is still potent, as evidenced by this Spanish-language boxing drama. Esteban (Bernal) is an aging boxer whose manager/BFF Andy (Luna) persuades him to step into the ring one last time before he officially retires. But as the match looms closer, the criminal underbelly of the sport rears its head—forcing Esteban to determine what parts of his life he’s willing to sacrifice. With just six episodes in all, La Máquina moves fast. Don’t flinch. How to Die Alone Former Saturday Night Live and Insecure writer Natasha Rothwell—whom you might know from her Emmy-nominated turn as spa manager Belinda in seasons 1 and 3 of The White Lotus —created and stars in this eight-episode series. Mel (Rothwell) is an employee at New York City’s JFK Airport who is content with the uneventful life she has built for herself. But when she has a sudden brush with death, she decides to take her life into her own hands. While it’s not the first series to explore matters of life and death, it does so in a way that is both beautifully nuanced and laugh-out-loud funny—all of it anchored by Rothwell’s performance. On February 4, Hulu announced that it had canceled the series after one season—a move that has Rothwell “baffled” and looking for a new network to produce season 2. English Teacher Television audiences are hardly lacking in high school–set comedies, or in really great high school–set comedies, and/or really great high school–set comedies that focus on the teacher perspective (see: Abbott Elementary ). English Teacher fits into that elite niche. Brian Jordan Alvarez—who was behind the award-winning 2016 web series The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo —both created and stars in the show, in which he portrays an English teacher in Austin, Texas, who is dedicated to making an impact on his students, even if he sometimes needs to depend on their teenage wisdom to figure out the right way to do that. While it doesn’t shy away from the politics that exist in the teaching profession, the series also presents the “adults” as often just as lost as the kids they teach. English Teacher ’s second season launched in September. Futurama Following a decade-long hiatus, Futurama —Matt Groening and David X. Cohen’s animated sci-fi comedy—made a triumphant return in 2023, complete with gags about Twilight Zone and “Momazon” drone deliveries. The show’s all-new 13th season arrived on September 15, with all 10 episodes dropping at once versus weekly, as has been the case in the past. And one more season has already been confirmed, making now the perfect time to dive back in—or watch it all for the first time. We Were the Lucky Ones In Radom, Poland, the Kurcs are a loving family who seem to have it all—until the horrors of the Holocaust invade the serenity of their everyday lives. As World War II arrives on their doorstep, the family is separated—escaping to France, Brazil, West Africa, and Russia. Some are in hiding, others in concentration camps. But they’re all focused on one goal: surviving the war and reuniting with each other. Queenie Queenie Jenkins (Dionne Brown) is a Jamaican-British twentysomething whose world is thrown into an upheaval following an ugly breakup with her boyfriend. That messiness follows Queenie into the next chapter in her life, when she attempts to pick up the pieces of her failed relationship while frequently butting heads with her family and trying to reconcile her dual cultures. Candice Carty-Williams adapts her own bestselling novel to create a poignant dramedy that’s ultimately about trauma and healing. Black Twitter: A People’s History In the late 2000s—back when Elon Musk was just that car-and-spaceship billionaire—Twitter was more than a social media network. It was a genuine gathering place for people to find their people, whether that was Film Twitter or Cat Twitter. For Black Twitter, it was a lot more. This three-part docuseries, based on WIRED senior writer Jason Parham’s 2021 cover story , recounts the most important moments and movements that helped solidify the Black Twitter community’s place as a cultural force in the world, from politics and beyond. Under the Bridge Riley Keough and Lily Gladstone (who earned an Emmy nomination for her work in the show) make a formidable duo as an author and a police officer, respectively, investigating the brutal murder of a 14-year-old girl in a small town in Canada. The limited series is based on Rebecca Godfrey’s award-winning 2005 book of the same name (with Keough portraying Godfrey), and is a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of. Shōgun Game of Thrones fans still lamenting the loss of one of television's great epics have found their new favorite binge-watch in Shōgun, which took home a record 18 Emmys (with 25 nods altogether) in 2024. This 10-episode series, based on James Clavell’s beloved novel (which was first adapted into a miniseries in 1980), is a brilliant and sweeping tale of political rivalry in feudal Japan where Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful warrior, has a target put on his back by his political rivals in the Council of Regents. Fortunately for Toranaga, he’s got Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a talented translator and fiercely loyal samurai, by his side. Shōgun was originally positioned as a one-and-done limited series, but FX and Hulu have already confirmed that two more seasons are in the works, with the next expected to arrive in 2027. Fargo Noah Hawley’s anthology series isn’t the first attempt to adapt the Coen brothers’ Oscar-winning crime-comedy to the small screen (Edie Falco starred in a previous version, which was a more straightforward adaptation of the movie), but his approach was clearly the smarter move. Fans of the Coens in general will find lots to love about the many nods to the filmmakers’ entire filmography, with each season covering a different crime and time period. Though the seasons do share connections, each one is a total one-off, and the show might boast the most talented group of actors ever assembled: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk, Oliver Platt, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Ewan McGregor, Michael Stuhlbarg, Carrie Coon, Scoot McNairy, Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Timothy Olyphant, and Ben Whishaw are just a few of the names who’ve found a home in Fargo . The fantastic fifth season—featuring Juno Temple, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Joe Keery, and Lamorne Morris (who won an Emmy for his role)—continued this tradition of exceptional acting, with all episodes streaming now. A Murder at the End of the World Darby Hart (Emma Corrin) is a talented hacker and armchair detective who is one of eight guests invited to spend a few days at the stunning yet remote home of a mysterious billionaire (Clive Owen). When one of the guests ends up dead, Darby must work quickly to prove that it was murder—and who did it—before the bodies start piling up. Fans of twisty true crime will appreciate this limited series, which comes from the minds of Brit Marling (who costars) and Zal Batmanglij— cocreators of the equally mind-bending The OA . The Other Black Girl Sinclair Daniel shines as Nella Rogers, an up-and-coming book editor—and the only Black employee at the publishing house where she works. While Nella is initially thrilled when another young woman of color, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), is hired as an assistant, she can’t help but notice that a series of bizarre events seems to follow. As Nella tries to suss out exactly what is going on, she uncovers some pretty damn disturbing skeletons in her employer’s closet. While horror-comedies are an increasingly popular movie genre, we don’t see them on the small screen quite as often—which, if this clever series is any indication, is a real shame. Also unfortunate: One season is all we’ll get of The Other Black Girl. The Full Monty Twenty-six years after a low-budget British comedy blew up at the box office, scored an Oscar, and introduced “the Full Monty” into the popular lexicon, the Regular Joes turned strippers from Sheffield are back to face largely the same issues they were lamenting in the original feature film (which is also streaming on Hulu ). Much of the main cast reassembled for this follow-up to Peter Cattaneo’s hit 1997 movie, including two-time Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson, who passed away in late December. Stripping is involved, as are other inevitables in life, including breakups, reconciliations, and death. For fans of the original movie—or the Broadway musical and stage play that followed—it’s a fun check-in with the characters who bared it all. The Office (UK) Years before there was Jim and Pam and Dwight and Michael, there were Tim and Dawn and Gareth and David. For lovers of cringe, it’s hard to do better than Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s workplace comedy. David Brent (Gervais) is the original boss from hell, whose office antics will have you covering your eyes and laughing out loud at the same time. Like many British series, there are just two seasons—each consisting of a mere six episodes—plus a two-part Christmas special. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to watch a single episode and binge it all in one go. Dopesick Back in 2021, Hulu went where Netflix’s Painkiller went in 2023: to the late ’90s and early 2000s, aka the beginning of America’s opioid crisis. Danny Strong created this retelling of the lengths to which Richard Sackler (played here by the always excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) and Purdue Pharma would go to sell doctors on the powers of OxyContin—all with the promise of no addiction. Michael Keaton won an Emmy for his portrayal of a widowed doctor in Appalachia who buys into the lies, and eventually becomes a victim of them. Reservation Dogs Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo cocreated this Peabody Award–winning series, which made history as the first mainstream TV show created by, starring, and crewed by an almost entirely Indigenous American team. It tells the story of four bored teens who are desperate to escape their lives on a reservation in Oklahoma. They decide that California is where they want to be and commit to a life of mostly petty crimes in order to save up enough money to leave. The full three seasons are available to watch now, including the brilliant series sendoff. The Great Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine in this witty, fast-paced, comedic retelling (but not really) of Catherine the Great’s rise to power. Created by Tony McNamara, who earned Oscar nominations for his writing work on both The Favourite and Poor Things , The Great offers the same combination of lush costumes and scenery mixed with a biting commentary on the world, and a woman’s place in it. A story that rings as true today as it did in the 18th century, when Catherine the Great became empress of Russia and brought about the Age of Enlightenment, this show chips away at notions of class, propriety, and monarchical rule in a way few others do. If it’s historical accuracy you’re after, look elsewhere; the series’ creators describe it as decidedly “anti-historical” (which is part of the fun). All three seasons are available to stream. Tiny Beautiful Things The reason to watch this eight-part limited series can be summed up in two words: Kathryn Hahn. A comedic juggernaut , Hahn can switch from funny to dramatic in the same scene, if not the same sentence. This talent is on display in Tiny Beautiful Things , where she plays Claire, a writer who takes up an advice column and pours all the traumas of her life into responding to her readers. Based on Wild author Cheryl Strayed’s collection of “Dear Sugar” columns, the vignettes here may be a bit out of sorts, but Hahn pulls them together. Dave Dave Burd is a comedian and rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky. In Dave , Burd plays a rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky and is attempting to raise his profile and make a much bigger name for himself. If only his many neuroses didn’t keep getting in the way. While Dave could have easily turned into some mediocre experiment in meta storytelling, Burd—who cocreated the series, stars in it, and has written several episodes—grapples with some surprisingly touchy topics, including mental illness. And he does it all with a level of sensitivity and honesty that you might not expect from a guy named Lil Dicky. Despite the show’s popularity and critical acclaim, the three seasons currently streaming may be all we get of Dave . In early 2024, Burd announced that he’d be pressing “pause” on the series in order to explore other creative ventures. (But never say never.) Atlanta Donald Glover proved himself to be a quadruple threat of an actor, writer, musician, and comedian with this highly acclaimed FX series about Earnest “Earn” Marks (Glover), an aspiring music manager who is trying to help his cousin Alfred Miles, aka Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), kick off his musical career. They’re surrounded by a supportive crew of friends, including Alfred’s BFF, Darius (LaKeith Stanfield), and Van (Zazie Beetz), Earn’s close friend and the mother of his child. This makes it all sound like a fairly straightforward buddy comedy, but Atlanta is so much more. Even better: It’s weird. Glover is not afraid to experiment with storytelling, which is part of what makes the show so compelling. Baskets Zach Galifianakis stars alongside Zach Galifianakis as twin brothers Chip and Dale Baskets in this unexpectedly moving family comedy about an aspiring clown (Chip) who fails to graduate from a fancy clowning school in Paris and is forced to return home to Bakersfield, California, where he lives with his mother (the late Louie Anderson) and is constantly belittled by his higher-achieving brother (Dale). Between the dual role for Galifianakis and Anderson as the mom, it may sound like a cheap bit of stunt casting that can’t sustain more than an episode, let alone multiple character arcs. But if you’re a fan of absurdist comedy, Baskets truly ranks among the best of them. And Anderson, who won his first and only Emmy for his role as Costco-loving Christine, is absolutely transcendent. While it received a fair amount of critical acclaim, Baskets could rightly be considered one of the most underseen and underappreciated series in recent memory. The Dropout Amanda Seyfried won a much deserved Outstanding Lead Actress Emmy for her portrayal of the notorious Stanford dropout turned health care technology maven Elizabeth Holmes, who tricked some of the world’s savviest business minds into investing in her company, Theranos. While Holmes’ goal was altruistic enough—making health care more accessible to the masses via a device that could detect any number of diseases with little more than a single finger prick of blood—the technology wasn’t able to catch up. Rather than admit defeat, she kept pushing, making business deals and promises she could never fulfill. Letterkenny What began as a web series is now a Hulu original that wrapped up its eleventh season in December. The show is a portrait of small-town Canada (the fictional Letterkenny of the title) and focuses on siblings Wayne (cocreator Jared Keeso) and Katy (Michelle Mylett), who run a produce stand with help from friends Daryl (Nathan Dales) and Squirrely Dan (K. Trevor Wilson). As is often the case in small-town series, many of the residents fall into specific categories—in Letterkenny , you could be a gym rat, a hick, a skid (their word for a drug addict), or a “native” (a member of the nearby First Nation reservation). But in contrast to many small-town series, these groups—and the individuals who comprise them—aren’t reduced to meaningless stereotypes. Pen15 Mining the awkwardness of one’s middle school years is hardly a new comedy concept. But being in your early thirties and playing yourself as a junior high school student and then surrounding yourself with age-appropriate actors who are actually going through that hellish rite of passage brings a whole new layer of cringe and humor. This is exactly what cocreators/stars Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle did for Pen15.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-tv-shows-hulu-this-week,Technology,Washington Post,Jennifer M.

827ced5e7e68,Do You Really Have to Stop Using Windows 10?,"windows, how-to, operating systems, microsoft, software","The end is here—at least, it is for Windows 10. Microsoft officially stopped supporting the decade-old operating system on October 14, 2025. There's one hiccup, though: Even though Windows 11 is a free update, more people still use Windows 10 than Windows 11, according to statcounter.com , a site that tracks operating system usage worldwide. Plenty of people, it seems, either don't want to upgrade to Windows 11 or are using devices that aren't supported . This means millions of people could be using an operating system that’s no longer receiving security updates. If you're one of them, it makes sense to learn what happens to your computer now—and what you should do about it. Here's a summary of what's happening with Windows 10 and four options you have to replace it. Windows 10 Will Keep Working (But It Will Be Less Secure) Nothing in particular is going to happen after October 14. Your computer will keep working the way it has, and you're unlikely to run into issues. That doesn't mean it's a great idea to keep using Windows 10, though. That's because the system will no longer receive security updates or patches from Microsoft. This won't matter much until a new Windows exploit is discovered. After that, though, your device will have vulnerabilities that will never be patched. At that point, you will be at increased risk of attacks like ransomware, where a virus encrypts all of your files and scammers demand a payment in order to decrypt them. Continuing to use Windows 10 long-term dramatically increases the odds of these and other attacks. There are other potential annoyances. Third-party developers, meaning the companies that make the software you use and the games you play, tend to stop providing updates for operating systems that are no longer officially supported. So, if a game adds new features in an update, you might not be able to install it. The same goes for the software you rely on to do your work: Over time, the latest versions of your desktop apps won't run on Windows 10, meaning you'll miss out on features. There's also a security angle. In addition to no longer receiving security updates for your operating system, you'll also eventually stop getting security updates for the tools you use. None of this will happen right away on October 14. But you can expect to start hearing about software makers dropping support for Windows 10 later on. It's a good idea, then, to be prepared. Microsoft has two official recommendations: updating your computer to Windows 11, which is free provided your computer supports it. The other recommendation is to buy a new device, presumably one already running Windows 11 . Those aren't your only choices, though. You could replace Windows with another operating system entirely, like ChromeOS or Linux. Let's talk through all four options. Option 1: Try to Install Windows 11 The simplest thing, for most people, is to upgrade to Windows 11 . Yes, this is annoying if you prefer Windows 10, but the good news is that Windows 11 is free, and the irritating AI features are easy to turn off. Find out whether your computer supports Windows 11 by opening Settings . Head to Settings > Privacy and Security > Windows Update. If your computer is compatible you should see an Upgrade to Windows 11 option. From there, you can click it to start the update procedure. Note that it's generally a good idea to back up your computer before upgrading your operating system.",https://www.wired.com/story/do-you-really-have-to-stop-using-windows-10,Technology,Washington Post,Justin Pot,"https://media.wired.com/photos/681cd21fc603f12b08e4fb28/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/windows-10-byebye-gear-1237969700.jpg",2025-05-09T11:30:00+00:00,6527400011a92046878045e564a8f6f6263cd774
25c79ec57769,A 4-Pack of Apple AirTags Is Just $65 Right Now,"shopping, deals, apple, accessories and peripherals","Picked up some fun new toys in the last few weeks that you need to keep track of? Amazon currently has Apple AirTags in a four pack marked down to just $65, an excellent price for these easy-to-use location tracking devices. While there are plenty of similar tracking tags on the market, Apple’s AirTags have some unique features that set them apart. Probably the most relevant is that they leverage Apple's entire network of devices for tracking, rather than just your phone, or other users who happen to have the company's app installed. That means they're more likely to show up as they get further away from you, and you can set them as lost in the system to notify you when they come within range of an iPhone or iPad. They're also extremely easy to set up and pair to your phone, thanks to the close pairing of Apple's hardware and iOS software. Just tap the AirTag to your phone to connect it to your account, and you're ready to go. They're compact enough that they can squeeze into basically anywhere, including on a keychain or tucked into a small purse. You can also share them with up to five family members, in case you need to help your significant other track down their keys. Apple has put a ton of work into making the AirTag super useful while also keeping an eye on safety and security concerns. Both Apple and Android phones will warn you if an AirTag not linked to your account is following you around, and they'll even beep occasionally when they aren't within range of any Apple devices on the Find My network. The biggest downside to the Apple AirTag is that it doesn't work with Android devices at all, except for the safety warning. If you aren't an iPhone owner, make sure to check out our other favorite tracking devices to keep your belongings safe . For everyone else, the AirTag is an excellent option, and for just over $15 a piece, can give you a lot of peace of mind when it comes to your most valued gadgets.",https://www.wired.com/story/apple-airtag-deal-1025,Technology,Washington Post,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee868e5ef7aed7dd9fd328/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Score%20a%20Four%20Pack%20of%20Apple%20AirTags%20for%20Just%20$65.png",2025-10-14T18:24:31.684000+00:00,44e6fb1e23d3096409d0e3424c158312e4622093
c852b5a6d050,Feds Seize Record-Breaking $15 Billion in Bitcoin From Alleged Scam Empire,"bitcoin, cryptocurrency, crime, blockchain, security, scams","Over the past five years, criminals behind widespread romance and investment scams—often inelegantly referred to as “ pig butchering ”—have stolen tens of billions from people around the world. Now law enforcement has carried out one of its biggest operations yet against that sprawling scam industry, targeting the operators of several modern slavery scam compounds in Southeast Asia—where, as a whole, hundreds of thousands of human trafficking victims have been forced to run the fraud operations on behalf of criminal gangs. On Tuesday, officials in the United States and United Kingdom took coordinated action against one giant Cambodian organization and its boss who has allegedly run a series of notorious scam centers in the country. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced it has issued financial sanctions against 146 “targets” linked to the newly designated Prince Group Transnational Criminal Organization. This action includes targeting individuals and shell companies linked to the alleged criminal enterprise. As part of the sweeping action also involving the FBI, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also seized almost 130,000 bitcoin worth around $15 billion at the time of the announcement—the largest US cryptocurrency seizure to date. This Prince Group organized crime entity, OFAC says, is made up of the Prince Holding Group, a Cambodia-based company, its chairman and CEO Chen Zhi, and his associates and business partners. Publicly, the company describes itself as “one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia” and says it is involved in real estate development and financial services. However, the DOJ alleges that “in secret” Chen and other executives “grew Prince Group into one of Asia’s largest transnational criminal organizations” and ran at least 10 scam compounds across Cambodia. “As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” said Joseph Nocella Jr., a US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a statement . “Prince Group’s investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world.” Chen has not been arrested and remains at large, the DOJ says. “The masterminds behind these horrific scam centers are ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money,” Britain’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said in a statement . The UK also placed financial sanctions on Chen, the Prince Group, and other linked entities. The UK’s sanctions also “freeze” businesses and properties allegedly linked to Chen in London, including a £12 million ($16 million) mansion in North London and a £100 million ($133 million) office building in the City of London.

960adcc108be,This Completely New Kind of Watch Strap Is Made Using Lasers,"apparel, watches, luxury, accessories","Want a watch strap that’s as comfortable as fabric, as light as rubber, as strong as a metal bracelet, and as tactile as a Milanese mesh? Any watch fan looking to tick all of the above boxes would normally expect to be a dab hand with a spring bar removal tool to experience all the above individually, but a new strap developed by Malaysian independent brand Ming appears to now offer the best of all worlds. Photograph: Courtesy of Ming The one strap to rule them all has been dubbed the Polymesh . It is 3D-printed from grade 5 titanium and comprises 1,693 interconnected pieces (including the buckle), held together without any pins or screws. The only additional parts requiring assembly are the quick-release spring bars at each end that attach it to the watch—the articulated pin buckle is also formed in the same process. Ming says the strap, made up of rows of 15 equilateral triangles meshed together and bookended by larger end pieces, “has more motion engineered into the radial axis than the lateral one,” leading to a supple end result that drapes like fabric yet retains the strength of titanium. It has taken the company seven years to develop, working with partners Sisma SpA in Italy and ProMotion SA in Switzerland. Ming says notable challenges included the risk of components fusing together, and the fact that powdered titanium—the raw material from which the strap is laser sintered—is highly explosive. Ming watches co-founder Ming Thein says the project used filament 3D printing initially, before settling on laser sintering, to create larger 5:1 and 3:1 models from plastic to determine if the developing design was valid. “After going through more than seven different topologies to figure out something that would both 3D print and [be] something that would feel right and have the right kinetic properties, we finally settled on the answer,” Thein says in a YouTube video . Amazingly, as the bracelet and buckle must be printed as one unit, Ming had to deal with producing a strap design that demanded clearances of less than 70 microns, the average thickness of a human hair. As a result, each strap takes several hours to produce, requiring hundreds of layers of additive manufacturing in an inert gas environment. The company is not the first to use 3D-printing techniques for final products in watchmaking (as opposed to prototyping), but it is the only one using it for straps or bracelets. British start-up Apiar has debuted a 3D-printed watch case, as has Dutch brand Holthinrichs , which has created versions of its Ornament 1 in both 18-karat gold as well as stainless steel. The Case for Straps To the extent that straps have been an area for innovation in the watch world, recent attention has tended to focus on brands’ development of proprietary mechanisms for swappable straps, to varying degrees of success and popularity. Sustainability programs have focused on leather alternatives such as reclaimed apple peel or mushroom-based material, or textiles woven from ocean plastic . Some have proven difficult to industrialize, and nearly all have been dogged by accusations of greenwashing.

aab6aaa1e3c5,‘Sovereign AI’ Has Become a New Front in the US-China Tech War,"model behavior, artificial intelligence, openai, deepseek, china, donald trump, open source","OpenAI has announced a number of projects this year with foreign governments to help build out what it has called their “sovereign AI” systems. The company says the deals, some of which are being coordinated with the US government, are part of a broader push to give national leaders more control over a technology that could reshape their economies. Over the past few months, sovereign AI has become something of a buzzword in both Washington and Silicon Valley. Proponents of the concept argue it's crucial that AI systems developed in democratic nations are able to proliferate globally, particularly as China races to deploy its own AI technology abroad. “The distribution and diffusion of American technology will stop our strategic rivals from making our allies dependent on foreign adversary technology,” the Trump administration said in its AI Action Plan released in July. At OpenAI, this movement has also meant partnering with countries like the United Arab Emirates, which is ruled by a federation of monarchies. OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, argues that partnering with non-Democratic governments can help them evolve to become more liberal. “There’s a bet that you make that engagement is better than containment,” Kwon said in an interview with WIRED last week at the Curve conference in Berkeley, California. “Sometimes that works, and sometimes it hasn't.” Kwon’s reasoning echoes what some politicians said about China more than two decades ago. “We can work to pull China in the right direction, or we can turn our backs and almost certainly push it in the wrong direction,” US president Bill Clinton said in 2000 when China was gearing up to join the World Trade Organization. Since then, many American companies have gotten rich by trading with China, but the country’s government has only become more authoritarian. Some people argue that true sovereignty can only be achieved if a government is able to inspect—and to some extent control—the AI model in question. “In my opinion, there is no sovereignty without open source,” says Clément Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, a company that hosts open source AI models. In this respect, China is already ahead, as its open source models are quickly becoming popular globally. What Is “Sovereign AI” Actually? Today’s sovereign AI projects range from giving countries partial to full control over the entire tech stack, meaning the government manages all of the AI infrastructure, from hardware to software. “The one common underlying thing for all of them is the legality portion—by having at least some part of the infrastructure tied to geographical boundaries, the design, development, and deployment would then adhere to some national laws,” says Trisha Ray, an associate director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoTech Center. The deal OpenAI announced in partnership with the US government in the UAE includes a 5 gigawatt data center cluster in Abu Dhabi (200 megawatts of the total planned capacity is supposed to come online in 2026). The UAE is also deploying ChatGPT nationwide, but it doesn’t appear that the government will have any ability to look under the hood or alter the chatbot’s inner workings. Only a few years ago, the idea of building AI infrastructure in authoritarian countries might have sparked worker protests in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Google employees pushed back against the tech giant’s plan to deploy a censored search engine in China, eventually succeeding in getting the project canceled. “What's happening with some of these LLM projects, it's quite similar, but there isn't as much of a backlash,” Ray says. “That notion of, ‘well, yes, if you're operating within a country's borders, you have to adhere to all laws of the land,’ that's become a lot more normalized over time.”",https://www.wired.com/story/openai-sovereign-ai-us-china-tech-war,Technology,Washington Post,Zoë Schiffer,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed60d1bfe13206c9ff9d9f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Biz-model-behavior-stargate-uae-2236543888.jpg",2025-10-14T16:00:00+00:00,4ce3081eedc484f9e178c9f26114969640647155

That said, these buds look and sound awesome, with a triple driver array (one dynamic for bass, two Knowles balanced armatures for mid and high end), which allows them to stand above many other earbuds. Sony WH-1000XM5 for $398 : Sony's XM5 remain a top headphone, even after being supplanted by the fancier XM6. For a fairly sizable price reduction, you'll get still-fabulous noise-canceling tech, great sound, and luxe comfort in a supremely portable package. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $280: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic are nondescript-looking and don't have noise-canceling to compete with Sony and Bose, but they do sound fantastic. If you're looking for a great-sounding pair that won't get you judged in public, these are a great option for quiet luxury. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 Earbuds for $467: Bowers & Wilkins brings its speaker prowess into the world if high-end earbuds. The Pi8 provide a premium and stylish build, excellent sound quality, and solid noise canceling, albeit at a very high price point. Like other earbuds we've tested lately, one of the Pi8's coolest features is the ability to stream audio from wired audio sources via the charging case, which can really come in handy on long flights. Edifier Stax Spirit S5 for $500: These high-flying headphones lack noise-canceling, but make up for it with fantastically clear sound from their advanced planar magnetic drivers that use specialized magnet tech for vividly clear delivery. If you can afford their high price, they're a fun investment that digs into the meat of your music like few headphones in their class. Soundcore Space A40 for $45 : Even though they've moved off our main list, the Space A40 are still among the best earbuds you'll find for the money. Their stylish, premium-looking design is bolstered by solid features, clear and detailed sound, and excellent noise canceling for the price. Sonos Ace for $399: The Sonos Ace are a pricey but impressive first effort from Sonos, with fantastic noise canceling, great sound, and one of the comfiest designs (if not the comfiest) you'll find in the game. A few initial software bugs hindered their performance upon release, including trouble with the TV Swap feature that lets you pass sound from a Sonos soundbar to the Ace, but that seems to be fixed, making these an excellent choice—especially for those already invested in the Sonos way. Beats Solo 4 for $150: We like Beats headphones these days, but this pair was just a bit lacking in features for us at its standard $200 price. Now that they've come down, we can heartily recommend them to folks who are looking for a pair of wireless headphones that don't have noise canceling. Technics EAH-AZ80 for $161 : The AZ80 are great earbuds. Their most noteworthy feature is conveniently pairing to three devices at once, but they finish strong with good noise-canceling tech, top-tier sound quality, and seven different ear tip options for a remarkably comfy fit. Beats Studio Pro for $250 : The Studio Pro offer quality performance, including surprisingly clear sound, good noise canceling, and refreshingly natural transparency mode. The design feels a bit cheap, and they skip features like auto-pause, but extras like Hands-Free Siri and head tracking with spatial audio help pad their value—especially since their sale price sometimes drops to around half of the original $350 MSRP. Sony WH-CH720N for $129 : These Sony cans may have a silly name, but their sheer value makes up for it. They're not as pliable as top options and don't come with a case, but their sound quality and noise-canceling are excellent for the money. They are also built to last and have battery life that goes on and on, making them a great option for prudent shoppers. Master & Dynamic MH40 for $399 : M&D's second-gen MH40 pack gorgeous sound into an equally gorgeous design, with luxurious trappings like lambskin leather and metal parts in place of plastic. Their lack of advanced features, excluding even noise canceling, makes them a pricey portal to minimalism, but they've got style for days. Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT for $219 : The original ATH-M50X provide balanced sound and great durability, making them ubiquitous in music and film studios. But what if you want to take them with you between takes? Enter the ATH-M50XBT, which partner a wired studio connection with Bluetooth for wireless freedom. They don't offer noise canceling or other advanced features but they're great for melding art and play. Sony Linkbuds for $128 : The Linkbuds have a neat trick: speakers with holes in the middle that let in the world around you for environmental awareness. They're not so hot for noisy environments, making them something of a one-trick pony, but they're among the best options in the growing open-ear trend. They've also been updated in the new Linkbuds Open , which are pricier at present but offer a few new features and a more stable fit. JLab Jbuds Mini for $40 : These micro-buds from JLab offer so-so sound, but their adorably teensy design that fits on a key ring makes them a fun accessory for those who need some cheap buds to take on the go. AccordionItemContainerButton If you're new to wireless headphones or need a refresher, here are some helpful pointers to know before you buy. Noise canceling is a technology that employs exterior microphones and digital processing to take in the sounds around you and flip their frequency polarity, essentially canceling them at rapid speeds to create an impression of silence. Transparency mode , aka ""hear-through"" or “ambient” sound mode, is the opposite of noise canceling, using your headphones' exterior microphones to bring in the sound around you. This can keep you aware of your surroundings, especially helpful when working out, walking in high-traffic areas, or just having a quick conversation. Bluetooth is the wireless format used by all portable wireless headphones to connect to and play sound from devices like a phone, computer, or tablet. Bluetooth multipoint connection allows Bluetooth headphones to connect to more than one source device (like a phone or computer) at a time. This helpful feature lets you seamlessly switch between your connected devices to do things like take phone or video calls or watch a video on your computer between Spotify sessions on your phone. Find My is an Apple feature that lets you track down devices like your AirPods from the web. Many non-Apple wireless headphones also have some form of Find My feature, though it's usually reserved for earbuds due to their small size. IP ratings are used to certify electronics are dust and water-resistant. Generally, the higher the IP rating a device has, the better the dust and water resistance. You can learn more in our IP-ratings explainer . EQ stands for equalization, which in the case of wireless headphones, uses digital processing to adjust parameters like bass, midrange, and treble. EQ presets are most common, but multi-band EQs are better for those who want advanced control over each sound register. Charging cases are included with virtually all fully wireless earbuds, letting you set the buds in the case for recharging on the go. Most charging cases offer two or more charges, and to recharge the case itself, you can usually use a USB-C cable or a wireless charger . AccordionItemContainerButton We test headphones and earbuds the way that we live. We take them to the gym, wear them around offices, travel with them, and generally try to use them as we anticipate potential buyers will use them. If a pair advertises dust or water resistance, we test that. We drop test cases, test cables, charging times, and battery life, and note everything we find exceptional to our readers. While we do not typically use a set playlist of music to test each pair, we aim to test acoustic, rock, hip-hop, pop, country, and a variety of other genres with every pair of headphones, ensuring offer a good perspective on sound signature across genres and volumes. For noise reduction, we test the headphones in real-world environments and note our findings. When possible, we attempt to have headphones worn by a variety of people with different head and ear shapes, to ensure we're thinking about the widest audience possible.

9b46d93f8b53,The Best Wireless Earbuds We've Tested,"shopping, buying guides, wireless earbuds, earbuds, headphones, audio","Other Earbuds We Like Every month seems to bring new sets of earbuds with longer battery life, new features, and more compact designs. As such, we can't list everything we like. But if you're still hunting, here are some other recommendations. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $180: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic look nondescript and sound fantastic, but they lack any of the superlative qualities of the buds on the list above. If you're after a clean-looking pair of headphones with fantastic vocal definition, they're worth considering. Soundcore Space A40 for $45 : While they're no longer on our main list, the Space A40 are still some of my favorite buds for the money, providing good features, clear sound, and excellent noise canceling for their price class. They also look polished, with only their lack of auto-pause sensors betraying their low price. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for $100–$200: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are getting older, but they're still among the best buds to pair with a Samsung phone . They don't have the multi-device connectivity of our top pick for Android users, and their five-hour battery is looking pretty short these days, but they provide excellent sound quality, IPX7 waterproofing, and a distinctive design that doesn't just ape the AirPods Pro. That makes them well worth considering on sale. Soundpeats Air4 for $90 : Soundpeats’ Air4 may be obvious AirPods Pro knockoffs, but they're very good knockoffs for the money. You won't get top-flight performance, let alone Apple exclusives like Find My support or iCloud sharing, but you will get good sound and features, including decent noise canceling, at a massive discount. While these aren't a top choice, they're a great budget buy, especially on sale. Sony Linkbuds Fit for $175 : Sony’s Linkbuds Fit offer rich and punchy sound, naturalistic transparency mode, and a light and comfy fit, helping them live up to their intent as a “wear anywhere” solution. They provide some solid features, but skimp on battery life with just 5.5 hours per charge, and their noise canceling is just OK. Their oddly unresponsive touch controls and reliance on flimsy silicone sleeves further diminish their value, but they're still Sony buds and could be worth nabbing on a good sale. Montblanc MTB 03 for $395 : These earbuds are priced out of reach for most buyers, but if you've got the cash, you'll be rewarded with a luxury experience worthy of the brand. Montblanc has called in some heavy hitters from the audio industry to design and voice these buds. The result is a small, comfortable, and quite flashy-looking pair of wireless earbuds that sound really impressive. Raycon Everyday Earbuds for $80 : These YouTuber-beloved earbuds are actually a decent cheap pair . They are small and light, and they come with an IPX6 rating, which makes them great for workouts. Master & Dynamic MW08 Sport for $399 : The Sport are a great option that come with active noise canceling and a striking design, but the high price keeps them out of the reach of most people. Earbuds to Avoid As a general rule, you should avoid earbuds that don't support the Bluetooth 5.0 standard (or higher) or don't offer at least five hours of battery life, and more like six these days. Batteries in wireless headphones degrade over time, so the better your battery life is at first, the more tolerable it will be in two to three years. Apple AirPods (Previous or Current Gen) for $119-$170 : These headphones do some things well, we just don't like them all that much. ( Read our latest review. ) They get OK battery life, come in a compact case, and work well for calls, but they don't fit all ears well, and since they don't have ear tips or wings, you're out of luck if they're loose. The priciest model adds noise canceling which works about as well as you'd expect for a pair that doesn't offer a proper seal. Want clear music, good noise canceling, and advanced features made for iPhones for less than the AirPods Pro 3? Get the AirPods Pro Gen 2 , which sometimes cost more (and sometimes less) but are legitimately great. Beats Solo Buds for $70 : These are lackluster in virtually every possible way , especially when it comes to features for the money. Their best traits are their micro-size and big battery, but that's about it. It's odd, because we like other headphones from the brand, but these just don't keep pace. The best we can say is they are cheap. Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 for $155 : A Cybertrucked pair of AirPods clones , the headphones in the new Galaxy Buds line work worse than they already look. With no eartips, these are uncomfortable to wear for long periods, and the noise canceling is all but useless. How We Define Wireless Earbuds AccordionItemContainerButton We've seen this category go by many names: true wireless earbuds, truly wireless earbuds, completely wireless earbuds, fully wireless earbuds, wirefree earbuds, etc . These days, if a pair of earbuds connects to your phone/computer via Bluetooth and has no cord that connects the left bud to the right, we just call them wireless. Wireless sets typically come with two popcorn-sized buds, each with a battery inside, and a charging cradle that carries extra battery power and keeps them safe when you're not wearing ’em. Some wireless earbuds have a cable or neckband that connects the two buds together, usually found on workout buds from brands like Shokz. Ridding yourself of all cords can feel liberating, but these do come with issues, such as limited battery life (don't buy any with less than five hours), confusing controls, and reliance on a charging case. They're also easier to lose than traditional earbuds, and replacing one bud can be expensive. That said, this is one of the most innovative categories in tech, offering a flurry of new features from heart rate monitors to OTC hearing aid functionality , with more added in each new generation. These days features like noise canceling and transparency mode are standard, while the burgeoning open-ear category offers a more natural way to keep aware of your surrounding.

d1d9582c465c,Review: DJI Mini 5 Pro,"shopping, reviews, review, drones, dji, cameras, outdoors","I enquired about the weight, and a DJI spokesperson sent me the following statement: “The DJI Mini 5 Pro has a design weight of 249.9 grams. Due to manufacturing tolerances, the actual weight of the product may vary slightly within a range of ±4 g. Minor weight fluctuations are normal. We recommend that when UK users are operating the drone, local regulations are complied with, which can be found here .” The company refers to it as a “near-250g drone”—terminology I'd never encountered from DJI. Frankly, it feels a little evasive. This isn't just pedantic nitpicking over a few grams. I live in the UK, and the 250-gram threshold determines whether you can fly a drone in public parks, on beaches, in towns and cities, near people, and in countless other scenarios without additional certification. Previous Mini models have been just under this limit, and it seems like an oversight during the design process to not keep this one comfortably below it, too. There's good news, though: With UK drone rules set to change at the beginning of 2026, I don't have too long to wait until the Mini 5 Pro (and, interestingly, the much bigger DJI Air 3S ) becomes completely legal to fly in built-up areas, public parks, and close to people. The tidings for US-based pilots aren't so cheery, though. As with all of its recent products, DJI isn't officially launching the Mini 5 Pro in the US. You can blame the impending DJI ban , and it's a real shame, because, weight issues aside, this is a fantastic camera drone. Big Camera Upgrades Photograph: Sam Kieldsen The Mini 5 Pro's slight weight increase comes with genuine benefits. The main improvement is the camera, which now features a 12-MP (or 50 MP in Quad Bayer terms) 1-inch sensor, a significant upgrade from the smaller sensors in previous Mini models. The image quality is edging towards DJI's Air range, which is remarkable for a drone this size.

247191f43da4,Review: HP EliteBook 6 G1q,"shopping, laptops, computers, windows, hp, windows pcs, reviews, review","Benchmark scores were unsurprising, turning in slightly above-average numbers across the board when compared to other Snapdragon X Plus laptops. Even its battery life of just over 17 hours when playing a full-screen video via YouTube (over Wi-Fi, not HP Go) is about in the middle of all Qualcomm-based systems I’ve encountered—though that’s admittedly still an excellent mark compared to all laptops. The industrial design is utilitarian, though just shy of being completely boring. The silver machine, crafted from partially recycled aluminum and plastic, has a look that feels dated, and at 24 mm thick and 3.2 pounds, it’s also very heavy for a 14-inch system. (It feels heavy in the hand and on the lap as well.) Props, however, for the textured surface on the keyboard caps, which makes for a more pleasant typing experience than most laptops provide—though note it does not offer any backlighting. The trackpad is spacious without being obtrusive in size. Port selection is also solid, including two USB-C ports with USB4 support, two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI jack, and a drop-jaw Ethernet port. The SIM card slot is also accessible from the side of the device; users can bring their own data plan if they don’t want to use the multicarrier HP Go, which works via eSIM . Poor Value Photograph: Chris Null The G1q is a Copilot+ PC and, as with more general workloads, it turned in perfectly acceptable scores on AI-based jobs like image generation and computer vision tests. It’s plenty stable in daily use; in fact, the only trouble I encountered was during initial setup, when it lost its internet connection midway and forced me to start over from scratch—annoying, but a one-time problem that never cropped up again.",https://www.wired.com/review/hp-elitebook-6-g1q,Technology,Washington Post,Christopher Null,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eda149d38069fa305c069b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20HP%20EliteBook%206%20G1q.png",2025-10-14T08:00:00-04:00,d809f1f5910fb6bc71647937fd6276b82cb551ea
3a8795848753,The Best VPNs for iPhone,"shopping, iphone, ios, apple, vpn, buying guides, phones, smartphones","Other iPhone VPNs We Tested Surfshark : Surfshark was a strong contender for the main list. Even its Starter plan comes with extra features like a masked email generator. Features like ad and tracker blocking, as well as unlimited simultaneous connections, come standard across plans. However, it was a bit slower than my top picks, dropping around 20 percent of speed on average, compared to around 15 percent for the top options. Mullvad : Mullvad is a favorite among privacy enthusiasts, and for good reason. It doesn’t fuss with multi-year discounts or referral programs, and you don’t even need to provide an email to sign up for an account. You can even pay the static monthly fee by mailing Mullvad cash. It’s a great service if privacy is your top priority, but it trades speeds and features in the process. VPN services like Nord and Proton have quickly grown into full privacy and security suites, while Mullvad is more focused on making a robust VPN. In the context of an iPhone, the scales tip more toward those security suites, but Mullvad is still a great privacy-focused option to keep in mind. ExpressVPN : By the numbers, ExpressVPN should be at the top of the list. It has a ton of servers, a featureset that can go toe-to-toe with Nord, and speeds only a touch below Proton. However, ExpressVPN has found itself in a spiral of increasing controversies over the past four years, and the brand has yet to get back on solid footing. After being purchased by Kape Technologies—the company behind the infamous adware company Crossrider—former US intelligence official Daniel Gericke took over at CTO and continued in that role for two years, even after being fined over $300,000 by the US Department of Justice for hacking activities on behalf of a foreign government. Gericke left in 2023, but that same year, ExpressVPN experienced a large swath of layoffs, and Kape, its parent company, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. The vast majority of shares went to Unikmind Holdings Limited, a company owned by Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi, who got his start by creating gambling software Playtech. That’s an extremely condensed version of what ExpressVPN has gone through over the past few years. The company hasn’t done anything nefarious, but the revolving door of executive control tied to controversial names doesn’t inspire confidence. Private Internet Access : Private Internet Access, or PIA, is also owned by Kape Technologies, and it followed a similar playbook as ExpressVPN and CyberGhost, which Kape also owns. After the acquisition and community backlash, there’s been very little transparency about what’s going on in the company. A connection to Kape definitely raises questions, but that doesn’t immediately disqualify a service from being included. Unfortunately for PIA, it had much slower speeds than any of the other VPN services I tested, so regardless of ownership, it isn’t a top pick for iPhone VPNs. iPhone VPN Feature Comparison You might be surprised how similar the three VPNs I chose are when you break down their features, but that’s not an accident. Given how restrictive I was with who made the final cut, there’s a pretty high bar for inclusion. Although there are some minor differences, I designed this list in a way that you can choose one of my picks without reading a single word and still come out the other side with an excellent VPN for iPhone. How We Tested To earn the best iPhone VPN title, a service needs to satisfy three criteria. It needs to be secure, fast, and easy to use. That may seem straightforward enough, but there’s a little more that goes into it. For ease of use, I only looked at VPNs that offer a one-tap connection. If you need to configure anything, that’s a disqualification. That still encompasses a lot of the most popular VPNs on iPhone, so I narrowed the field further by focusing on apps that balance usability with power. You should have all the relevant features in the iOS app that are available in the desktop app, and organized in a way that they don’t disrupt that one-tap experience. Speed testing is where I focused a lot of my testing time. Speed testing is highly variable, and trying to come out with one singular number to encompass the speed of thousands of servers is a fool’s errand. The numbers I gathered for this guide are the result of 20 tests I ran for each VPN, then averaged. I tested five locations for each VPN, measuring my unprotected speed immediately before testing and running three passes before averaging. Each location was tested at a different time of day, and I removed any outliers before averaging. For this guide, that meant if there was greater than a 10 percent deviation between two of the three passes. After averaging the speed drop for each location, I gathered all of those numbers together and averaged them for a final speed drop. Finally, security. The traditional wisdom with a VPN is that you, at some point, have to put some faith in the company that its privacy policy is accurate and it isn’t lying about its logging practices. That didn’t do it for me. Again, I set a high bar for inclusion. Every VPN I’ve included here has not only been independently audited, but also been forced to uphold its no-logs policy in legal proceedings. You indeed need to put some trust that the VPN provider you’re using is telling the truth, but the options I included all have rock-solid track records when it comes to transparency.

4257a39666f8,Review: Google Pixel Buds 2a,"google, bluetooth, headphones, earbuds, wireless earbuds, reviews, review, shopping, pixel","As usual, I love the matte white case that comes with these buds; it feels less sticky than the shiny cases from Apple and others, and it makes it slide into pants pockets like a puck on ice. One thing the case doesn't come with is wireless charging; you'll have to stick to USB-C. Battery life is a pleasant seven hours, with a replaceable (!) battery in the case, combining for 20 hours with active noise canceling on and 27 with it off. I like the slimmer profile of the new buds, but I have to admit I didn't notice much of a difference in fit in my average-size ears. Google's app immediately asked me to do a fit test when I paired the headphones with my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra , and the already-installed medium eartips fit perfectly in my ears. If you have a Pixel phone , you won't even need to install the Pixel Buds app, as it comes preinstalled. App-based features allow you to adjust everything from EQ settings to what the buttons do on each side of the earbuds. It's all simple and intuitive, essentially identical to the experience Apple users have with AirPods, just on a different ecosystem. Touch controls on the outside of each bud are simple. I made one side of the buds call up the Gemini assistant, and the other work for playing and pausing tunes. One oddity is that there isn't a way to adjust volume on the buds themselves; you'll have to press the side buttons on your phone or the volume slider on your laptop to change volume. Depending on how much you like to adjust volume on the fly, this can either be a mild annoyance or a total deal-breaker. I personally find myself using my phone most of the time anyway, so it was merely a quirk. Great Sound Photograph: Parker Hall The Pixel Buds Pro 2 have long been some of my favorite headphones to take with me, thanks to the pebble-y charging case and excellent sound quality. The Buds 2a fit those much more expensive shoes quite well, with similar prowess in the bass and treble, especially.

556994566118,Mark Cuban Would Still Have Dinner With Donald Trump,"big interview, uncanny valley podcast, podcasts, business, pharmaceutical industry, health care, donald trump, silicon valley","Back in May, Mark Cuban appeared in his last episode of ABC’s Shark Tank after spending more than a decade on the show investing in—or deprecating—entrepreneurs’ big ideas. But that doesn’t mean the billionaire is going away. In fact, he’s arguably more everywhere than ever. He’s showing up on TV, posting on Bluesky , and yammering away on podcasts almost daily. Yes, Cuban loves to talk—about ideas, about the future, about what it takes to actually make America healthy again. Or, at least, to get Americans more affordable drugs, which Cuban is endeavoring to do with his startup, Cost Plus Drug Company. Nor does Cuban, like many billionaire businessmen, shy away from talking politics: Does he like President Trump? Doesn’t seem like it. But would he join the president for dinner like so many of his peers have in recent months? With enthusiasm, according to a conversation we had for this week’s episode of The Big Interview . Keep reading to find out why. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Just so you know—well it's too late now—we always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. Like a warm-up. MARK CUBAN: Let's warm up. I am ready. Alright. What is the smartest investment you ever made? Myself. What's the dumbest purchase you ever made? Um, a lot of alcohol. Do you still drink? No. Alright, one word to describe the startup pitches that you hate. Self-absorbed. Would you rather invest in passion or in numbers? Numbers. After health care, what's the next industry ripe for disruption, whether by you or somebody? Education. Tell me a little bit about why. The whole thing is built on accreditation, which is ridiculous in and of itself, as opposed to outcomes. And it's because those accreditation organizations have got so much power there. It influences the structure of universities in particular, and that structure has led to over-emphasis on administrative positions as opposed to actual teaching. It's also allowed cost creep, so that they become, rather than educational institutions, sports institutions that also happen to teach. I think that there’s a great way to teach kids that allows them to learn, that feeds their curiosity, without all the extraneous shit. So are you doing it or what? No. I mean, I've talked about it many times, but health care comes first.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-big-interview-podcast-mark-cuban-cost-plus-drug-company,Technology,Washington Post,Katie Drummond,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68d5b2c560ff0db556a23f67/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Big-Interview-UV-Solo-Mark-Cuban-2204471379.jpg",2025-10-14T10:30:00+00:00,20ef56e9bd001956e156fac1e1a9084a72d20403
ae467895a12d,"Satellites Are Leaking the World’s Secrets: Calls, Texts, Military and Corporate Data","surveillance, privacy, nsa, cybersecurity, security, satellites, t-mobile, at&t, walmart, military, military tech","“Generally, our users choose the encryption that they apply to their communications to suit their specific application or need,” says a spokesperson for SES, the parent company of Intelsat. “For SES’s inflight customers, for example, SES provides a public Wi-Fi hot spot connection similar to the public internet available at a coffee shop or hotel. On such public networks, user traffic would be encrypted when accessing a website via HTTPS/TLS or communicating using a virtual private network.” The researchers reported the swaths of unencrypted satellite communications from the Mexican government and Mexican organizations to CERT-MX, the country’s incident response team, which is part of the government’s National Guard, in April this year, before separately contacting companies. CERT-MX did not respond to WIRED’s repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for Santander Mexico says that no customer information or transactions were compromised, but confirmed that the exposed traffic was linked to a “small group” of ATMs used in remote areas of Mexico where using satellite connections is the only option available. “Although this traffic does not pose a risk to our customers, we took the report as an opportunity for improvement, implementing measures that reinforce the confidentiality of technical traffic circulating through these links,” the spokesperson says. “While we cannot share specifics, we can confirm that our communications lines have been evaluated and confirmed secure,” a spokesperson for Walmart says. (The researchers confirm that they observed Walmart had encrypted its satellite communications in response to their warning.) “The information of our customers and infrastructure is not exposed to any vulnerability,” a spokesperson for Grupo Financiero Banorte says. Banjercito could not be reached for comment. “SIA and its members remain diligent in monitoring the threat landscape and continue to participate in various security efforts with government agencies, industry working groups, and international standards bodies,” says Tom Stroup, the president of the Satellite Industry Association, adding that it does not comment on specific company issues. Time to Look Up The amount of Mexico-related data in the researchers’ findings is, of course, no coincidence. Although their satellite dish was technically able to pick up transmissions from around a quarter of the sky, much of that swath included the Pacific Ocean, which has relatively few satellites above it, and only a small fraction of the transponders on the satellites it did see were transmitting data in the direction of its dish. The result, the researchers estimate, was that they examined only 15 percent of global satellite transponder communications, mostly in the western US and Mexico. Geostationary satellites ring the Earth’s equator. The researchers’ satellite dish on the roof of their UC San Diego building was in a position to pick at least some signals from about a quarter of that ring. But because many of the satellites’ signals weren’t transmitted towards San Diego—and a large part of their coverage was over the Pacific Ocean, with relatively few satellites—they only received an estimated 15 percent of all geostationary satellite signals. That also means that other dishes placed elsewhere in the world would likely find entirely different signals transmitting different sensitive data.

8009715800da,Our Favorite Computer Monitor Is $75 Off,"deals, shopping, pcs, monitors, dell","If you're tired of staring a tiny laptop screen while working from home, consider scooping up our favorite desktop monitor for almost 25 percent off its normal price. The Dell 27 Plus 4K (8/10, WIRED Reivew) is currently marked down to just $228 on Amazon , the lowest we've seen yet for this smart and practical 4K screen. Dell 27 Plus 4K Monitor (S2725QS) You might be worried about poor panel quality or scarce features, considering the price point, but the Dell S2725QS is surprisingly well equipped for under $300. It has an IPS panel, which is one of the better non-OLED options, with thin bezels and a minimal stand that will fit right into any desk setup. It has 100 percent sRGB coverage, and 79 percent AdobeRGB, with good color accuracy to match, making it a nice choice for light creative work as well. It also has a 120-Hz refresh rate, so while you may want to consider a dedicated screen for gaming, you can certainly jam some weekend Fortnite rounds. AMD FreeSync Premium will help keep things smooth, since reaching frame rates that high will be tough for most systems. You might find that even scrolling the web is much better with a higher refresh rate, though. I know I have trouble going back to 60 Hz. Although it's a little short on ports, lacking any USB in particular, it is VESA compatible if you want to mount it or put it on a stand. It has internal speakers too, and our reviewer, Luke Larsen, was impressed with how they stack up against most built-in monitor speakers. That's not too tough considering they can often be thin and tinny, but it's a nice benefit for anyone lacking the desk space for a nicer, dedicated option. Overall, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is an excellent value, which makes it easy to overlook some of the smaller inconveniences. If you want to spend more for something nicer, make sure to check out the full roundup of our favorite desktop monitors , but most people just looking for a second screen for their work laptop will be exceedingly happy with this Dell.",https://www.wired.com/story/dell-27-plus-deal-1025,Technology,Washington Post,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed359505c586ea21db5bed/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Save%20Almost%20$75%20on%20our%20Favorite%20Computer%20Monitor.png",2025-10-13T20:35:08.255000+00:00,11b3edaa54ddfdb8c070ca4890fca641073be8c4
c3b78b6c379d,The Best Website Builders for Designing Your Own Site,"shopping, websites, buying guides, web design, how-to, design, software","Top Website Builders Best for Most People Squarespace Core Read More Best Cheap Website Builder Hostinger Website Builder Read More Best Free Website Builder Strikingly Website Builder Read More Publishing a website is still more complicated than it has any right to be, but the best website builders streamline the process. Instead of juggling a bunch of files on a server and learning the ins and outs of networking, website builders do exactly what's written on the tin. Piece by piece, using a drag-and-drop interface, you can design your website the way you want with immediate feedback, rather than spending time buried in code and hoping it comes out on the other end. There are dozens of website builders, and most of them range from decent to straight-up bad. Any web host with a bit of ambition has a website builder floating around, even if it's slow, clunky, and lacking features. I focused on finding the best tools for building your website that go beyond just an add-on, and these are my favorites. If you're after something simpler than a full-blown website, check out our list of the Best Portfolio Websites . Table of Contents AccordionItemContainerButton Best Website Builder for Most Squarespace via Jacob Roach You’ve heard of Squarespace over and over again, I’m sure, and that’s not an accident. It’s an inviting website builder that made a name for itself with bold, striking templates. Beneath the veneer of attractive, but seemingly simple, websites, you’ll find one of the most capable website builders on the market. That balance of power and usability is what sets Squarespace apart. It feels like a creative tool. Where other website builders lag and stutter to get a new element on your page, Squarespace feels fluid. Your dashboard gives you quick access to edit your site, and around every corner, Squarespace feels designed so you never have to look up a tutorial. I started a simple photography website, and within an hour, I had a custom course page set up, an appointment schedule with automated confirmation emails, and services (with pricing and the ability to accept payments) configured. Squarespace isn’t cheap, but it also doesn’t meddle in restrictive, low-cost plans. Even on the Basic plan, you have access to ecommerce tools and space for multiple contributors. Squarespace Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best Cheap Website Builder Hostinger via Jacob Roach Hostinger is better known as a web hosting provider, but it has a surprisingly robust website builder that you can use on its own or for free as part of a hosting package. You don’t get the same world-class template design and dense feature-set of a more expensive builder like Squarespace, but that’s OK. Hostinger’s website builder will run you just a few bucks a month, and based on my testing, it feels heavily angled toward newcomers. You sacrifice some power for convenience, but there’s an awful lot you can accomplish with Hostinger. Integrations with PayPal, Stripe, and Square allow you to quickly set up e-commerce. Add-ons with WhatsApp give you live chat capabilities, and Printful support means you can sell print-on-demand merchandise. And, if you outgrow the website builder, Hostinger allows you to export your website’s content to WordPress. Where Hostinger wins for me is through its AI tools. Just about every website builder these days has AI integrated in some way, but it’s around every corner at Hostinger. You need to pay extra for some of these AI features—the logo generator, for example, requires credits—but they give you a great starting point for mocking up the look, feel, and tone of your website. Hostinger Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best for Small Businesses Wix is undoubtedly the biggest competitor to Squarespace, and I had a hard time putting one above the other. Ultimately, Wix ended up in the backseat due to higher prices and a slightly less intuitive interface. That’s partly because of how powerful Wix is. Rather than corral you in an elegant (if restrictive) website-building workflow, Wix gives you a ton of options. First, templates. You get a few hundred elsewhere, but Wix offers over 2,000 templates. At the time of writing, there are 223 pages of them on Wix’s website. They aren’t all winners, but I was able to mock up a quick photography portfolio website within a few minutes by browsing the templates and uploading a few photos.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-website-builders,Technology,Washington Post,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e80dcb34a4e22944e3d3d0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Squarespce-source-Squarespace.jpg",2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,c333008476e595d879befe631a2946ba3fcf8940
d4f78cb22d7f,Our Favorite Smart Displays for Controlling Your Home,"buying guides, shopping, alexa, google, assistant, smart home","Comparing Our Favorite Smart Displays More Smart Displays We Like Echo Hub for $180 : The Echo Hub isn't exactly a smart display. It lacks powerful speaker capabilities and doesn't have a camera for calls or Amazon's Drop-In video call feature. Instead, it focuses entirely on being a smart home dashboard with built-in Alexa, plus features like widgets and the photo frame. I think it takes the best, most easily used features of a smart display and cuts out the rest. But if you want a good speaker, don't choose this one. Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023) for $90 : The smaller and cheaper third-gen Echo Show 5 has a 5.5-inch screen that works best on a desk or a bedside table. We think it's a bit too small for the kitchen or living room, but that depends on how you plan to use it. Echo Show 15 for $300 : This is the largest of them all, with a 15.6-inch display, and it has customizable widgets so you can have smart-home device controls and calendar reminders available whenever. It's made to be mounted on your wall like a TV (a stand is sold separately), and the Show 15 pairs with a Fire TV remote (you can use the app) to use the streaming features. With the new Alexa+ I've found myself liking it a lot more, and it's much less distracting than the rotating slideshows you get on smaller Echo Shows. It's a splurge, though, and I still wish the streaming capabilities were better. Google Nest Hub for $100 : Google’s second-gen Nest Hub is a great option if you don't need a camera and don’t mind a smaller 7-inch screen. It has a wake-up alarm that emulates the rising sun for gentler mornings, though it's not bright enough to qualify as a sunrise alarm clock. It also has sleep-tracking tech to track your sleep quality, though the quality of the results isn't great. It also supports gestures—like playing or pausing a video with a hand movement —by using unique radar tech . Google Pixel Tablet for $499 : This tablet doubles as a smart speaker when placed on its speaker dock. It works well, but it's not currently slated to get Google's new assistant, Gemini for Home. If that changes, we'll go back to recommending it. But we're not sure it will: availability has been limited for the speaker base, and could point to this device being discontinued altogether. Smart Displays to Skip We don't like every smart display. Here are the ones we're skipping after trying them out. Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen, 2021) for $250 : This smart display is situated on top of a large cylindrical speaker, which makes it sound great. The screen physically swivels to follow you around the room as you use it, keeping you in frame while you video chat or keeping your streamed workout video in your line of sight as you move about. Because the screen moves around so much, you may have trouble positioning it in tighter spaces—especially in corners. It's a unique model, and is still out of stock like it was this summer. I suspect the upcoming new Echo Show 11 ($220) might replace it, since it has a similar design (but leaves out the movement gimmick). Third-Party Google Displays: Google is no longer updating software for some of the third-party smart displays we used to recommend in this guide. If you have one, it will still work, but some features will likely suffer or disappear entirely as time passes. This seems to be the fate of most third-party Google smart displays, which is why we don't recommend them anymore. Google did say they'll be working with partners to bring Gemini for Home to third-party devices, so we'll see how that pans out. What About Alexa+ and the New Echo Shows? Amazon has been randomly rolling out its new version of Alexa, named Alexa+ , in early access since the spring. This second generation of the Alexa voice assistant is more conversational, able to execute complex tasks and learn new information, and can be much more personalized. That'll be due to its being powered by generative AI. Check out our hands-on with early access Alexa+ for more more about our experience. Unlike the current Alexa, once it's fully available, it'll cost $20 a month or be free if you have an Amazon Prime membership. This is a big jump from the free assistant, but you can keep the current Alexa for free if you don't wish for another subscription or have an Amazon Prime membership. Right now, it's also only available in early access for Echo Show devices. You can sign up here for the wait list. Alexa+ will be immediately available on its newest devices coming this fall, however. There will be two new smart displays, the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11 , and two new smart speakers, the Echo Dot Max and Echo Studio (2nd Gen) . We're curious how the new models will compare to our current favorites, and we will update this guide once we test them. It's also important to note that Alexa+ has forced a privacy change for all Echo devices. Echo devices used to be able to process voice recordings locally on your device, but the “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” privacy feature was killed in March. Now all voice recordings will be sent to Amazon to be processed in order to make Alexa+ function, but even if you don't end up using Alexa+, the feature is gone. What About Gemini for Home and Google’s Smart Displays? Amazon isn't the only one rolling out a new version of its assistant. Gemini for Home is Google's similarly AI-powered smart assistant that will replace Google Assistant in just about all of its available speakers. Unlike Amazon's new assistant, Gemini for Home will be free, but Google is changing its Nest Aware subscription to become a subscription that's both for video storage and for more powerful assistant features. Google is also rolling out a new speaker in the spring, but no new smart display is slated yet. The new assistant will come to all of Google's existing lineup except for the Google Pixel Tablet, which we no longer recommend since it's not currently planned to get support with the new assistant. Google did say they plan to work with third-party partners to bring Gemini for Home to more devices, so we might see new third-party displays that we can recommend again. We'll update this guide as we learn more, but for now, Google's Nest Hub Max and Nest Hub are the best smart displays to purchase if you want access to Google's new assistant. FAQs Do You Need a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton Smart displays are helpful, acting as hubs for your smart home devices, walking you through recipes while you chop away in the kitchen, and in some cases allowing you to video chat hands-free too. But we're not sure how long they'll be worth it, or even exist, in their current form. Companies have been experimenting and doing away with smart displays again and again; Meta discontinued its Portal devices, Google might be discontinuing the Pixel Tablet we favored, and Apple still has yet to even make a smart display. Amazon has continued to make new smart displays, even after losing $10 billion in 2022 thanks to failures around the Alexa voice assistant. The Alexa team was reportedly hit hard by layoffs in 2022 and 2023, but new smart displays continued to come out since then and more are slated to come out later this fall: the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11. The future of these smart home devices isn't clear right now , but if you're going to get one, we suggest sticking with devices directly from the brand whose voice assistant you prefer. Otherwise, consider one of our favorite tablets instead. Does Apple Have a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton So far, Apple has yet to launch its own dedicated smart display. Apple iPhones have a StandBy Mode included in iOS that activates when an iPhone is on its side and charging, using stands like this one from Twelve South . I had hoped this feature would feel similar to a smart display , but StandBy Mode is limited to customizable clock faces, showing your photos, and having your texts pop up in large text that fills the screen. It doesn't scratch the itch of all the features you get in a smart display and instead feels like a fancy alarm clock . What About Digital Calendars? AccordionItemContainerButton There’s a growing market of digital calendars that look a bit like smart displays, but instead of being able to respond to voice commands and stream a video call, these digital screens are designed to have one shared calendar for the entire family to see and view. Skylight, a maker of one of our favorite digital photo frames, makes the Skylight Calendar (starting at $170) that comes in 10 inches, 15 inches, and 27 inches, while I tested the Hearth Display ($699) that comes exclusively in a 27-inch size. Cozyla also makes the Cozyla Calendar+ that starts at 15 inches but goes all the way up to a 36-inch screen. There are some differences in these calendars, but you'll find a similar roadblock to them: memberships. Hearth Display encourages using the display to create routines with your family, specifically kids, though you'll want a kid older than my 2-year-old to use it properly (though the Hearth does have icons designed for kids who can't read yet), and to sign up for the Family Membership. The Skylight touts a photo screensaver and meal planning tools if you sign up for the monthly Plus Plan. You could find these devices are for you, but it's either another device for one parent to manage or something you'll have to teach your entire family to make into a habit to really get the most out of. You're likely better off just teaching everyone in your family to share their Google Calendar. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

f2cb84fb4907,Windows 10 Is Dead. Upgrade to One of These Great Windows 11 Laptops,"laptops, shopping, windows, computers, microsoft, dell, lenovo, windows pcs, buying guides","You'll want to read our extensive guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop , but for the basics, you'll want to decide what category of laptop you need. Most people should buy a 13-inch or 14-inch laptop, and spending around $750-$1,000 is a good place to start. You should expect a laptop around this price to get good battery life, have a decent screen, perform well enough for basic tasks, and have a comfortable keyboard and touchpad. You should also expect at least 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. Anything more than that gets into premium territory where you're paying for higher specs, more performance, or extra features. If you want something with a discrete GPU for either gaming or creative workflows, you'll need to spend more than this. A laptop like the Dell 14 Plus is the ideal example of what you can get while shopping in this price range. You can even find laptops with OLED panels, up to one terabyte of storage, depending on how good discounts happen to be. I would consider anything under $750 to be a cheap laptop , and will therefore come with some significant compromises, especially around the quality of the panel and the touchpad. Fortunately, laptops that use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip get great battery life, despite often falling under $750 in price. Here's a list of important specs to consider: CPU: For thin and light laptops, I would recommend one of the Snapdragon X, X Plus, or X Elite chips. They get the best battery life and performance for their class of laptop. As an alternative, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is also quite good. GPU: As of now, the Intel's Lunar Lake chips, such as the Core Ultra 7 258V, have the best integrated graphics. For discrete options, you'll want to pick something with one of the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, such as the RTX 5060. The biggest leap in performance there is between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti, which increases VRAM to 12 GB. RAM (or memory): Stick with at least 16 GB if you can. Since the advent of the Copilot+ designation, it ha become the new standard. You'll even find laptops as cheap as $600 that have 16 GB of memory. Gamers and content creators should upgrade to 32 GB if possible. Storage: Similar to memory, many laptops have moved to 512 GB as the new standard, and you'll find lots of affordable laptops with 512 GB as the base configuration. Upgrading to one or two terabytes, where possible, will make your life that much easier, especially since many laptops don't offer expandable storage. Display: Laptops are usually categorized by screen size, with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch being the most common. You'll want to consider size, resolution, refresh rate , and panel type here. Portability: Outside of display size, thickness of the chassis and weight are the primary factors here, determining how portable a laptop is to travel with. Other dimensions are important too, but more often than not, that is determined by the screen size. Ports: Many laptops are limited to just USB-C and headphone jack these days, with some exceptions where USB-A or HDMI are included. Make sure your laptop has what you need, or else you'll need a USB Hub or laptop docking station to get more ports or to increase external display support.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-windows-laptops,Technology,Washington Post,Luke Larsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e972a9adf8b328300b90b3/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Windows%2010%20Is%20Dead.%20Upgrade%20to%20One%20of%20These%20Great%20Windows%2011%20Laptops.png",2025-10-13T12:00:00+00:00,115f99c504571b96332341be5c52b0a74567deef
4d8b46b6b44a,"Programming in Assembly Is Brutal, Beautiful, and Maybe Even a Path to Better AI","machine readable, coding, programming, computers, software","Rollercoaster Tycoon wasn’t the most fashionable computer game out there in 1999. But if you took a look beneath the pixels—the rickety rides, the crowds of hungry, thirsty, barfing people (and the janitors mopping in their wake)—deep down at the level of the code , you saw craftsmanship so obsessive that it bordered on insane. Chris Sawyer, the game’s sole developer, wrote the whole thing in assembly. Certain programming languages, like Python or Go or C++, are called “high-level” because they work sort of like human language, written in commands and idioms that might fit in at a poetry slam. Generally speaking, a piece of software like a compiler transforms this into what the machine really reads: blocks of 1s and 0s (or maybe hex) that tell actual transistors how to behave. Assembly, the lowest of the “low-level” languages, has a near one-to-one correspondence with the machine’s native tongue. It’s coding straight to metal. To build a complex computer game from assembly is like weaving a tapestry from shedded cat fur. Why would anyone do this? I recently asked Sawyer, who lives in his native Scotland. He told me that efficiency was one reason. In the 1990s, the tools for high-level programming weren’t all there. Compilers were terribly slow. Debuggers sucked. Sawyer could avoid them by doing his own thing in x86 assembly, the lingua franca of Intel chips. We both knew that wasn’t the real reason, though. The real reason was love. Before turning to roller coasters, Sawyer had written another game in assembly, Transport Tycoon . It puts players in charge of a city’s roads, rail stations, runways, and ports. I imagined Sawyer as a model-train hobbyist—laying each stretch of track, hand-sewing artificial turf, each detail a choice and a chore. To move these carefully crafted pixels from bitmaps to display, Sawyer had to coax out the chip’s full potential. “ RollerCoaster Tycoon only came about because I was familiar with the limits of what was possible,” he told me. Working within the limits? A foreign idea, perhaps, in this age of digital abundance, when calling a single function in an AI training algorithm can engage a million GPUs. With assembly, you get one thing and one thing only, and it is the thing you ask for—even, as many a coder has learned the hard way, if it is wrong. Assembly is brutal and beautiful that way. It requires you to say exactly what you mean. I’ve done assembly’s creators a disservice. They wanted things to be easier, not harder. I imagine they were tired of loading up punchcards and flipping switches on their steampunk leviathans. Perhaps they dreamed of a world like ours, where computers can do so much with such minimal guidance.",https://www.wired.com/story/programming-assembly-artificial-intelligence,Technology,Washington Post,Gregory Barber,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e6c45f693f7ce213ae491f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/MR%20011%20'Assembly%20Codes'.jpg",2025-10-13T11:00:00+00:00,58163628e49b9ee6948c5670e321f73418678b7b
73c3efd70e75,How to Make STEM Funny—and Go Viral Doing It,"stem, comedy","Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. An aspiring chemist goes to college, realizes she’s not good at chemistry, and bombs her dissertation. She takes a class in standup comedy and decides the best way to talk about STEM is to make jokes at its expense. This isn’t a punchline. It’s Freya McGhee’s life. Based in London, the comedian had a strong interest in science as a kid, but after attending the University of Brighton to study chemistry, she realized that she liked learning science more than she liked applying it. Her thesis dissertation—“Synthesis of Iron Nitroxide radical species using radical derivatized ligands and its use as a single-molecule magnet”—flopped. She evaporated her results in the lab. “I was like ‘I don’t know what to do anymore,’” McGhee says. “I feel like if someone else did it, they might get further along with it, but for me it definitely didn’t work. It was a nightmare.” As she was finishing her degree she started studying stand-up and turned that nightmare into a pretty good bit . It’s gotten 4.4 million views on Instagram. McGhee’s stand-up sets regularly get hundreds of thousands or millions of views—and lots of fun comments. WIRED reached McGhee at home in London to talk about what it takes to make STEM funny. This interview has been edited for length and clarity . ANGELA WATERCUTTER: Obviously you made a pretty abrupt turn from chemistry to comedy, but when you first started doing stand-up were you joking about STEM then, or did you find your way there over time? FREYA MCGHEE: When you’re newer I think it’s easier to get laughs for dating jokes and stuff that’s relatable. But if you’re coming onstage, especially in front of a non-science crowd, trying to get them to laugh at science stuff is really hard. You have to explain the science and then tell the joke. You lose momentum. Right. There’s too much setup. But then I realized if I did it with a PowerPoint, if I just put the science up as a PowerPoint, it was much easier for people to understand. When I figured that out it was endgame really. Yes, your sets kind of feel like an advanced high school science course with a very funny instructor. Yeah, it's very on-brand, isn't it? It just made logical sense to me. Like, if I put it into a visual, it cuts out the part of the joke that’s losing momentum. Or I can get to the punchline quicker if I use a visual aid. But it does feel funny to be doing science jokes and holding a clicker as well.

7ac2851a2dcc,New Rules Could Force Tesla to Redesign Its Door Handles. That’s Harder Than It Sounds,"electric vehicles, tesla, cars, automobiles, evs and hybrids, manufacturing","The issues could cascade beyond the design. The auto manufacturing industry operates on strict production schedules. Though it builds in time to validate and test whatever new features come in each new model, the sudden intro of a design change late in the process could throw off the delicate timetable. In this decade, China’s auto industry has shocked the world by racing ahead of legacy automakers, quickly developing, with government support, ever newer, cheaper, and more technologically advanced vehicles on shorter production schedules. The country is the world’s largest automotive market; it’s expected to manufacture a full third of the world’s cars by 2030 . Still, quickly complying with new design regulations won’t be easy for domestic Chinese automakers either, says Broglin-Peterson. “Mechncial release requires a mechanical assembly,” she says. “It’s not just, you write some code.” Automaker’s door handle trouble likely won’t end in China. The new rules could lead to cascading responses from other global regulators. It’s a now-familiar pattern: China, once a place with lax protections, has forged ahead of the rest of the world in setting guidelines for electric vehicle battery safety and recycling, and autonomous vehicle tech. “This is a classic example of China setting the guardrails early: protecting consumers while quietly shaping global design standards,” Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based advisory firm, wrote in an email. A Handle on Design For many years, says Raphael Zammit, the chair of the transportation design department at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, flush electronic door handles were the stuff of futuristic concept cars. “The fact that Elon Musk and Tesla put it into production was, frankly, pretty amazing,” he says. Their rise was linked with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles; tucking door handles into the doors of cars was meant to reduce their drag coefficient, leading to increased battery efficiency. Or so the theory went: Back-of-the-envelope math suggests the tweak maybe adds a mile of range. Maybe. Either way, the handles became a “demarcation of luxury,” Zammit says. Indeed, electronic door handles can be found on many luxury vehicles, including some made by Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz. Jake Fisher, the senior director of the Consumer Reports’ Auto Test Center, tested several of those vehicles’ electronic handles . While all had emergency mechanical releases, as the Chinese regulations mandate, some were in places that could be difficult to find in an emergency—on the floor, in shadow, or, as in the rear seats of the 2021 Model Y under investigation by NHTSA, under a slot at the bottom of the rear door pocket. The best emergency mechanical releases, Consumer Reports found, were those that simply needed to be pulled a bit harder than usual to open, an intuitive reaction in an emergency.",https://www.wired.com/story/new-rules-could-force-tesla-to-redesign-its-door-handles-thats-harder-than-it-sounds,Technology,Washington Post,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e4035668d91f2b22fd4f9c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/gear-telsa-door-handle-shutterstock_2679655353.jpg",2025-10-13T10:00:00+00:00,ece54b04d8299110dbbf3526e9ea860a90bd8775
a065ebddcb86,The ‘Womanosphere’ Is Reshaping the Conservative Dating Landscape,"social media, politics, sex, dating apps, donald trump, influencers, content creators","Anya Lacey is aware of the oxymoron that comes with being an OnlyFans creator while aspiring to be a trad wife. When the 19-year-old Florida-based creator decided to get serious about dating this year, she ran into a wall. Either a lot of conservative men are “immediately turned off by what I do,” she says of being a sex worker, or the men she met on dating apps weren’t all that serious about commitment. “It’s a video game to them.” Those experiences led Lacey to create dateanya.com , a website with two clear objectives. The first was to find Lacey a husband (users can fill out a “Date Me” application). The second—and this very much seems to be its larger aim—was for the site to serve as a kind of relationship roadmap for conservative singles serious about finding love. Billed as “America-First Dating,” the site provides suggestions for “non-negotiables” (“secure borders, secure families”) as well as dating tips for women (“let him drive the date; you drive the conversation”) and men (“exclusivity before intimacy”). “Conservatism is really associated with men and masculine energy, and that’s who was leading the industry,” Lacey says. “But now you have a lot of women coming out of the woodwork.” Lacey is part of an expanding network of women influencers, creators, and media personalities who represent different factions of the conservative movement—spanning faith and flag moderates to MAGA fanatics—jockeying for a larger stake in the dating zeitgeist. Some are using their platform to reclaim the narrative around traditional relationships, one they say has been poisoned by feminist brainwashing and an age of endless swipes. Just as the manosphere has shaped the outlook of young conservative men through chat-casts, rallying a generation around alternative science and hypermasculinity, the rise of female-led rightwing media creators—sometimes called the “womanosphere”—are helping to shape the opinions of young conservative women everywhere. But even as conservatives are reclaiming the debate around modern dating, coasting on the momentum of Trump 2.0, there are noticeable fractures and hypocrisies in their approaches. On the podcast Culture Apothecary, Turning Point USA’s Alex Clark educates women about optimal fertility health and well-being. In an episode of Relatable titled “Be a Godly Woman, Not Just a Trad Wife,” host Allie Beth Stuckey discusses the appropriation of the trad wife trend, saying it “can be a great thing to aspire to” but Christian motherhood is “not just an aesthetic.” More recently, in response to polycule family structures, Stuckey noted that “the sexual revolution is reaching new lows.” Much of what the women discuss—on marriage, faith, and the importance of childbearing—dovetails with the agenda of the Trump administration. On social media, however, where Lacey has more than 1 million followers between TikTok and Instagram, she often straddles her conservatism with a wink and a smile. In one video , Lacey jokes about the consequences of not performing oral sex on your partner. In the next , she’s prancing through a green meadow declaring love for “my bible,” sundresses, and conservative men.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-womanosphere-is-reshaping-the-conservative-dating-landscape,Technology,Washington Post,Jason Parham,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68d5b99da0b397cb2d09d6e2/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Conservative-OnlyFans-Star-Anya-Lacey-Tradwife-Dating-Site-Culture-IMG_4355.jpg",2025-10-13T09:30:00+00:00,35425f1dc19c43fec8863aa1229cdaf3ca069305
f061c8e5dfa8,More Evidence Emerges That One of Saturn’s Moons Could Harbor Life,"science, space, saturn, extraterrestrial life","A recent study of Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons, has detected several organic compounds that had never been recorded there before. The findings, published this month in Nature Astronomy , provide new clues about the interior chemical composition of this icy world, as well as new hope that it could harbor life. The researchers analyzed data from the Cassini probe, which launched in 1997 and studied Saturn and its moons for years until its destruction in 2017. For Enceladus, Cassini gathered data from ice fragments forcefully ejected from the moon’s subsurface ocean up into space. Enceladus is one of 274 bodies so far discovered in Saturn’s gravitational pull. It measures about 500 kilometers in diameter, making it the planet’s sixth-largest satellite. While this moon does not stand out for its size, it is notable for its cryovolcanoes—geysers at Enceladus’s south pole that spew out water vapor and ice fragments. Plumes of ejected material can extend to nearly 10,000 kilometers in length , which is more than the distance from Mexico to Patagonia, and some of this material rises into space. The outermost of Saturn’s main rings—its E ring—is primarily made up of ice ejected into space by Enceladus. This material is believed to come from a saline water chamber beneath the moon’s icy crust that is connected to its rocky core. It’s possible that chemical reactions are taking place down there, under high pressure and heat. Until now, most chemical analyses of ice from Enceladus were of particles deposited in Saturn’s E ring. But during a high-speed flyby of the moon in 2008, Cassini was fortunate enough to directly sample freshly ejected fragments from a cryovolcano. The new research paper reanalyzed this data, confirming the presence of previously detected organic molecules, as well as revealing compounds that had previously been undetected. “Such compounds are believed to be intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules, which could be potentially biologically relevant. It is important to note, however, that these molecules can be formed abiotically as well,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at Freie Universität Berlin and lead author of the study, told Reuters . The discovery significantly expands the range of confirmed organic molecules on Enceladus. The key is that the compounds appeared in freshly ejected particles, suggesting that they were formed within the moon’s hidden ocean or in contact with its internal interfaces, not during their journey through the E ring or via exposure to the conditions of space. This reinforces the hypothesis that hydrothermal processes beneath Enceladus’s surface could be generating rich organic chemistry. Combining this new research with previous studies, scientists have now found five of the six elements essential for life—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—in the satellite’s ejected material. This itself is not a discovery of life, nor of biosignatures—the signs of life. However, the research confirms that Enceladus has the three basic conditions for life to form: liquid water, an energy source, and essential elements and organics. “Enceladus is, and should be ranked, as the prime target to explore habitability and search whether there is life or not,” Khawaja said.

340b0e290138,"Doctor groups need to ‘step up to the plate’ as CDC guidance becomes harder to trust, former leaders say","cdc, policy, public health, rfk jr., stat summit, vaccines","BOSTON — It’s getting harder to trust guidance coming out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, creating an opening for physician groups to step up and fill the void, two former top agency officials said on Wednesday. Speaking at the STAT Summit , former CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and Dan Jernigan, the former director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, stopped short of saying they no longer trust the CDC. They said some information, like that on maternal health, foodborne illnesses, and international travel, appears to remain reliable. The remarks from Walensky and Jernigan point to the ongoing fracturing and loss of trust in the public health infrastructure in the U.S. Already, several independent efforts to evaluate and recommend vaccines have cropped up, and a group of Democratic governors are forming their own public health group. “If [states] can’t trust what’s on the CDC website, then we’re having a significant impact on what happens at the local level, where people actually engage with public health, and that is something that we don’t want to see,” Jernigan said. Walensky, who ran the agency under former President Biden, has previously said that people should be cautious of information on the CDC website, but not write it off entirely. “What I can say is, the vaccine information on the CDC is not necessarily that of the subject matter experts or the CDC, but there’s a lot of other great information on this CDC website that I don’t believe has been tainted with as of yet,” she said in September during a media briefing . At Wednesday’s event, she and Jernigan said that information coming out of the CDC on some issues, like vaccines, may not be well-grounded in science, and suggested that professional medical organizations must fill the gaps. The agency has faced drastic cuts and reorganization under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “Was it something that was an agenda driven ideology?” Jernigan said, of trying to vet vaccine information on the CDC website. Since becoming the head of HHS, Kennedy has taken aggressive steps to change the ways federal health agencies review, approve, and authorize vaccines. Many of those impacts have been felt at the CDC , where Kennedy dismissed a panel of federal vaccine advisers and refilled it with his handpicked choices, including people with vaccine skeptical views. The CDC has also been decimated by numerous rounds of firings that have shrunk the number of subject matter experts on areas like vaccines. A recent KFF poll found that about half of the public say they have a “great amount” or a “fair amount” of trust in the CDC to provide reliable information about vaccines, the lowest level of trust since the beginning of the pandemic. People’s own health care providers are the most trusted source of vaccine information, the poll found. Jernigan, who resigned from the CDC alongside other senior leaders in August, after Kennedy ousted former director Susan Monarez over vaccine policy , said it’s time for professional medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, to step up to the plate to provide its own recommendations on vaccines. The AAP has already issued its own guidance on vaccines for children that differs from federal guidelines. Walensky also pointed to the Vaccine Integrity Project out of the University of Minnesota, which she said is reviewing evidence on vaccines that would typically be reviewed by CDC and helping providers make sense of it. “A team of scientists have gotten together to review the data from the last ACIP meeting,” she said. She added that the group would make its work public, as not all providers or state and local officials have the time to comb through hundreds of pages to make recommendations. “That is transparency,” she said. Others have also urged clinicians to rise to the occasion and make more of an effort to combat misinformation and become trusted sources. “The more [physicians] are viewed as people, not experts all the time, I think the more effective they will be in having a message,” Mike Varshavski, a family physician and influencer known as Dr. Mike  said at the STAT Summit on Wednesday. “There is a way to make science enjoyable, and make it not seem boring, and I think we have to invest in that,” he added. The comments came on the same day that 15 Democratic governors announced a nonprofit coalition to provide alternative sources of public health information. “We can no longer rely on the information coming out of Washington, D.C., but our states are coming together to unequivocally state that science still matters,” Washington State Governor Bob Ferguson said in a statement.",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/15/former-cdc-officials-say-trust-doctors-not-federal-health-recommendations,Health,Washington Post,Chelsea Cirruzzo,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/R52_5208-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-15T17:21:01+00:00,1315a1ad1f9baf3d6bc0385fb55d512e0eb580f2

Lilly plans to submit orforglipron for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to global regulatory agencies in 2026, while submission for the obesity treatment is set to occur by the end of this year. An online parallel market for an unlicensed weight loss drug is being fueled by TikTok fitness influencers and sellers on WhatsApp , The Guardian reveals. Retatrutide, which is still in clinical trials, is being advertised by social media influencers for its supposed fat-burning effects. Followers are urged to message the accounts privately for supplier links, as well as being provided with discount codes. Separately, there is a thriving trade on Telegram, where groups with thousands of members share “before and after” photos, injection guides, and claims of next-day U.K. delivery. Sellers advertise the drug there before directing customers to WhatsApp for transactions. Retatrutide is an experimental injection developed by Eli Lilly. The drug targets three gut hormones — GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. Early trials suggest it could help patients lose up to a quarter of their body weight. Nicknamed the “triple G,” the drug is being hailed online as the next Ozempic. STAT+ Exclusive Story Already have an account?

Send nominations to [email protected] CDC workforce is down 33% since Trump’s start, per union The union representing CDC employees estimated Tuesday that the Atlanta-based agency’s workforce has been reduced by 33% since the Trump administration took office. That figure represents people who have been laid off in the three rounds (so far) of reduction-in-force notices, staffers let go because they were on probation or whose term contracts were not renewed, and employees enticed to take early retirement through the “Fork in the Road” offer. More than 1,300 new layoff notices were issued Friday night, but about 700 of those workers were informed Saturday they’d been victims of a “coding error” and weren’t losing their jobs after all. Yolanda Jacobs, president of local 2883 of the American Federation of Government Employees, isn’t buying that explanation, calling the layoffs “a politically motivated stunt” during a press conference. By the union’s tally, about 3,000 people, or 23% of the CDC’s workforce, has been fully separated from the agency so far this year. Another 1,300 employees who received RIF notices in April (700) and last weekend (600) are on administrative leave — being paid, but no longer able to do their jobs. Those who were let go last Friday will be terminated Dec. 8. — Helen Branswell The people behind CDC’s top health survey are gone As Helen wrote, more than half of the terminations brought down on the CDC late last week have since been rescinded . But one team has not seen any reprieve: the National Center for Health Statistics, which directs a critical annual survey on health and nutrition. The office lost about 100 people in the latest layoffs, including all eight employees left in the planning branch after the first round of cuts last spring. The loss puts at risk information about health services, hospitalization, ER visits, office visits, and individual warning signs of disease. “The [reductions in force] may have left some parts of NCHS intact, but a car cannot drive missing a tire or the steering wheel,” said Denys Lau, who formerly directed a division within NCHS that tracks the nation’s health care provision and utilization.

How this southern state became a go-to destination for biotech The former plantation town of Holly Springs — once dubbed the “poverty pocket” of its wealthy North Carolina county — used to be something of a wasteland, according to former acting FDA commissioner Ned Sharpless, who began his medical career in the state. But now? Genentech is spending $700 million to build there; Amgen has pledged $1.5 billion to construct a manufacturing plant; and pharmaceutical contractor FUJIFILM Diosynth is in the midst of a $3 billion project that will create 1,400 jobs. “[It] seems like every day I hear of another large pharma company building a $2 billion plant down here,” Sharpless told STAT’s Allison DeAngelis. Read Allison’s great story about how North Carolina built manufacturing boomtowns for biotech at a time when most other companies in the field are grappling with layoffs, a lack of financing, and federal pressure. How many Medicare plan choices is too many? Nearly 7 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries did not compare plans when selecting their 2022 coverage, according to a KFF survey. Among those with stand-alone prescription drug plans, half did not compare options for 2024 coverage, per another study from the USC Schaeffer Institute. So maybe there are already too many options  — and too few resources to help older Americans choose the best health care plan for them. That’s the argument made by two public policy experts in a new First Opinion essay. “Policymakers could do much more to simplify beneficiaries’ plan choices — after all, that’s what beneficiaries want,” the two authors write.

You can reach Andrew on Signal at drewqjoseph.45. LONDON — The German biotech Tubulis, which is designing a series of next-generation chemotherapy treatments, said Wednesday it had raised a $358 million Series C, a sizable funding round that will help it push its lead drug candidate into trials in additional types of cancer. Tubulis, based in Munich, is developing a suite of what are known as antibody-drug conjugates , medicines that are designed to deliver chemo directly to tumor sites, unleashing the toxic therapy on cancer cells while avoiding the whole-body side effects that come with traditional chemotherapy. The company’s most advanced product, known as TUB-040, is being tested in types of ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer. Tubulis said the influx of money will allow it to test the molecule in earlier lines of treatment and additional tumor types, as well as expanding work on its whole pipeline.

be73a744d4d2,Stop overloading older adults with Medicare plan choices,"health insurance, medicare, medicare advantage","Nearly 69 million Americans who are disabled or 65 or older receive health insurance through Medicare. Most of them must select a private insurance plan to receive all of their medical benefits, prescription drug coverage, or supplemental coverage. They are about to receive a deluge of insurance company mail during the eight-week enrollment period that opens Wednesday, urging them to switch plans for 2026. As a behavioral researcher and a former chief operating officer at Medicare, we know that switching could save beneficiaries hundreds — perhaps thousands — of dollars per year, depending on how their insurer has changed their plan and how their coverage needs have changed. But most beneficiaries won’t switch, or even look at whether there is a better plan available for them. A KFF survey found that nearly 7 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries did not compare plans of any kind for their 2022 coverage. Among those with stand-alone prescription drug plans, half did not compare options for 2024 coverage, according to a USC Schaeffer Institute survey that one of us co-authored. It’s understandable. Navigating Medicare’s alphabet-based features can be overwhelming. Original Medicare covers hospital visits (Medicare Part A) and doctors’ services (Medicare Part B), and permits beneficiaries to use any Medicare-enrolled provider. For most beneficiaries, only Part B has a premium, but Parts A and B have different deductibles. Prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D) can additionally be bought from an often long list of private insurers who have Medicare contracts. Alternatively, many join a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) run by a contracted insurer, which combines drug coverage with Part A and B. But all of these plans differ in terms of premiums, deductibles, copays, and what they cover. Add to this the plethora of plans on offer. Although older adults report wanting on average no more than four options for their health insurance , the average Medicare beneficiary had 48 plans to consider for their 2025 coverage. This included 14 Part D plans, and 34 Medicare Advantage plans. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently announced that Medicare beneficiaries will again have a huge number of choices made available to them for 2026. Theories of rational choice say that having more options should be better. It should allow everyone to select the plan they like the most given their health care needs and preferences. If all Medicare beneficiaries selected their preferred plan every year, then insurers would be incentivized to improve their plans to give beneficiaries what they want. But in reality, most beneficiaries can rarely predict exactly what prescription drugs or health care they will need the following year. One beneficiary we interviewed for an ongoing USC Schaeffer Institute study said, “I have no basis, none whatsoever, on which to base a decision.” So most beneficiaries end up automatically reenrolled in their current plan, to which their insurer can make changes every year. This past year was especially turbulent: many Part D plans significantly raised deductibles and beneficiary costs for common brand-name drugs , due to changes enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act. Beneficiaries who do not switch their Part D plan from year to year are less likely to be enrolled in their financially optimal plan , given the medications they take. Beneficiaries who do compare Part D plans tend to be those savvy enough to work with the Medicare Part D plan finder website or to find an adviser who can help them. But the plan finder website can be confusing to use, especially for older adults who do not like going online. And beneficiaries who work with advisers do not always know whether their adviser is being paid by an insurer, meaning they may be getting biased advice. Few beneficiaries seem to know that they can get one-on-one counseling from an unbiased volunteer adviser through their local State Health Insurance Assistance Program . Policymakers could do much more to simplify beneficiaries’ plan choices — after all, that’s what beneficiaries want. They could build on previous CMS actions that limited the number of plans offered by any one insurer and discourage duplicate plans with low enrollment. Or make plan features more standardized to help beneficiaries make comparisons. Or allow beneficiaries to stay with their selected plan for longer than a year without any coverage changes, so they won’t have to make choices as often. Or provide increased funding for unbiased SHIP advisers to proactively reach out to beneficiaries whose plans are being changed. There have also been calls to stop automatically reenrolling beneficiaries into their previous plan, especially if their insurer has significantly raised costs, though this requires figuring out who would qualify and how to assign them to a plan better aligned with their preferences. Most people don’t want to spend their time maximizing difficult choices . Facing health issues already produces enough anxiety. Making annual Medicare choices shouldn’t add to it. If you need help with your Medicare choices, please contact your local State Health Insurance Assistance Program to get help from an unbiased adviser.

HOLLY SPRINGS, N.C. — The monolithic gray buildings that have popped up around Holly Springs may not outwardly stir excitement. But they’re signs of a once-in-a-generation boon for the former plantation town, once dubbed the “poverty pocket” of wealthy Wake County. The drugmaker Genentech is spending $700 million to build here, while Amgen has pledged $1.5 billion to construct a manufacturing plant. And in September, pharmaceutical contractor FUJIFILM Biotechnologies opened the first phase of a $3 billion project that will create 1,400 jobs. “It’s unbelievable, actually.

dbabdd7f8944,CDC team running top survey on health and nutrition is laid off,"cdc, chronic disease, hhs, nutrition, politics, public health","Protecting the nation’s public health demands data, whether it be new measles cases, a surge in ER visits, or shifting patterns in obesity. The most recent job cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention threaten the mostly unseen foundation of that research enterprise. The CDC division within the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) that directs the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) — a bellwether of the country’s health — lost all its planners in last weekend’s firings. Unlike the 600 out of 1,300 employees eliminated across disciplines but reinstated within 24 hours, the people in the branch that plans and disseminates the research informing public health policies from food to oral health to environmental exposures got no reprieve. “You’re talking about a small but extremely dedicated part of a larger division,” former planning branch chief David Woodwell told STAT. “It’s devastating, and it will be very, very difficult for the survey to continue with this group gone because as valuable and as important as the other people are, they don’t have the understanding and the experience of running the survey with the contractors in the field on a day-to-day basis. It will be tough. It’ll be extremely, extremely difficult.” NHANES is the principal source of information measuring the health and nutritional status of people living in the community, according to the National Library of Medicine . It’s known for combining rigorous data measurements with answers to questionnaires. Based in Hyattsville, Md., the statistics center has for 60 years provided information on common diseases and behaviors based on nationally representative surveys. Those surveys are conducted by contractors who measure the health and nutrition of Americans via questionnaires that are followed by health exams and lab tests. The number of people terminated across NCHS’s four divisions (data analysis, informatics, operations, and planning) adds up to about 100, including all eight who had remained in the planning branch after earlier cuts on Feb. 14 and April 1 that also spurred retirements. Woodwell called them “boots on the ground,” making sure day to day that each of the health exams and all the questionnaire interviews were performed as expected. They also planned future surveys and analyses. “I worked with them for 10 years and I love them dearly. I’m in touch with them all the time,” said Woodwell, who is now retired. “So I know none of those eight have been rescinded.” The terminations came after President Trump made good on threats to fire federal workers during a government shutdown over stalled budget negotiations. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said job reductions within NCHS affected people in the Office of Policy, Budget, and Legislation and the Office of Informatics, Governance, and Assurance but not the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys runs the Nutrition Examination Survey. In response, Woodwell said that was wrong and that RIFs occurred in DHANES. What may be lost Potentially among the missing: information about health services, hospitalization, ER visits, office visits, and individual warning signs. “Anything related to any emerging outbreaks are also going to be compromised,” Denys Lau, formerly the director of a division that tracks the nation’s health care provision and utilization, told STAT. He is now editor-in chief of the American Journal of Public Health. The fruits of NHANES are shared with the public as well as within other federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. There is nothing flashy about the regular NCHS reports, which scrupulously avoid speculation or even discussion in articles gleaned from survey answers supplemented by patient metrics obtained in mobile exam centers. Like much of public health work, that labor is invisible  — you don’t see the infection you didn’t get. Data gathering is even further from the spotlight, so by extension, the people planning how to gather and share this data work even further behind the scenes. Now Woodwell, Lau, and other former employees are speaking out, calling attention to the value of their colleagues’ work. NHANES and its stringent protocols are known and emulated around the world, Woodwell said. Historically those data have been instrumental in removing lead from gas and paint, as well as adding the nutrition labels to food packaging now taken for granted. “NHANES is in a lot of places,” he said. “People don’t appreciate the value that it has added to the country for decades.” Working with researchers at the NIH, members of the planning branch knew what the scientists were looking for and would make it happen, Woodwell said. That meant following through on a day-to-day basis with the contractors in the field, then editing the data, and later publicly releasing it. While it has never been the main goal of NHANES, the survey can benefit its roughly 5,000 participants, a group that changes over time. “We can see undiagnosed hypertension or diabetes, things that people don’t know about until they come into our mobile exam centers,” Woodwell said. “We are able to provide them with health data that would cost them thousands of dollars if ever they would have some of these exams or blood work done.” What’s next? Now that the NCHS communications office has also been eliminated, Lau told STAT, he wonders how the center will fulfill its mandate to provide data in an objective, nonpartisan way. In the past, reports had to go through NCHS Office of Science, where they were reviewed for fidelity to the data. Information coming out of NCHS now goes through a new clearance procedure at the CDC that Lau fears can be influenced by politics. In a statement offered to media outlets, Lau and colleague Jennifer Schoendorf, former NCHS director of research and methodology who is now senior deputy editor at the public health journal, cited as examples recent federal public health policy recommendations on vaccines, fluoridation in drinking water, and ultra-processed food. Lau is puzzled by the lost ability to track concerns health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has prioritized, such as obesity, nutrition, oral health, and environmental exposure to chemicals. Like Lau, Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the global health organization Resolve to Save Lives and former CDC director, also views the administration’s stated goals and actions as inconsistent. “NHANES helped identify Americans’ dangerous overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, an issue Secretary Kennedy himself has repeatedly cited as a major health threat,” he said. Frieden is also concerned about objectivity. “NCHS was set up to be intentionally firewalled from other government agencies so we can trust that the data they release have not been altered by politics,” he said. Most of all, Woodwell, Frieden, and Lau fear what won’t be known after the reductions-in-force that have hollowed out the CDC they once knew. “Running NHANES well requires highly specialized skills developed over years; the office coordinates complex fieldwork, laboratory testing, and data integration,” Frieden said, adding,”Losing them would severely weaken the nation’s ability to see and steer its health.” Lau put it similarly: “The RIFs may have left some parts of NCHS intact, but a car cannot drive missing a tire or the steering wheel.” STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies .

Yes, we are off the Pharmalot campus today as we gear up for a few days of serious and interesting chatter. Meanwhile, here are a few items of interest to help you on your own journey. We hope you have a smashing day and, of course, do stay in touch. … A troubled Indiana contract manufacturing plant recently acquired by Novo Nordisk is considered to not be in compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards, a serious designation that could further delay the approval of drugs made in the facility, including some from Scholar Rock and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , STAT tells us. The FDA inspection of the plant over the summer found a litany of issues, some related to cat hair, pests, and equipment failures. Last week, the agency told Novo that the plant is classified as “official action required,” a regulatory term meaning the site is in an unacceptable state of compliance. The plant was previously owned by Catalent, which was one of the largest contract manufacturers serving the pharmaceutical industry. Novo acquired the Indiana plant, along with two other facilities, as part of its parent company’s acquisition of Catalent last year. The Indiana plant has had a history of issues going back several years that are now causing major challenges for biotechs that rely on the facility for approval. Shah Capital has urged the Novavax board to pursue a sale of the company, citing a third consecutive year of poor roll-out of its Covid-19 shot , Reuters reports. In its letter, he company’s second largest shareholder recommended that Novavax capabilities will “have far greater potential in the hands of a large capable pharma entity.” Shah Capital owns a 7.2% stake in Novavax. Himanshu Shah, founder and chief investment officer of the fund, maintained that Novavax could get a valuation of “at least $5 billion” based on the commercial potential of its vaccines. He also believes that the “political picture” and scientific evidence were in Novavax’s favor. Novavax has a market valuation of about $1.35 billion, as per LSEG data. The fund’s latest move is its second attempt to push for change at the company. Last year, Shah Capital had withdrawn its campaign against the re-election of three directors on Novavax’s board, after the company struck a licensing deal with Sanofi. A series of critical marketing missteps have led to Nuvaxovid, a protein-based Covid-19 shot, taking only 2% of market share last season, Shah wrote in his letter.

Kennedy Jr.’s tenure atop HHS has been marked by increasing tension between career scientists and political leaders at health agencies. That tension is nearing a breaking point at the FDA, according to interviews with more than 20 current and former agency officials, as well as legal experts. That breaking point arrived after agency scientists received an unusual inquiry in August from the leader of the center that regulates prescription medicines to learn more about leucovorin as part of Kennedy’s bid to identify autism’s root cause by September. Experts say the push to approve leucovorin, a generic drug that’s mainly used to alleviate side effects of cancer treatment, as an autism treatment is a sign that the U.S. is headed toward a new era of drug regulation: one where political decisions lead, and evidence follows. More details from inside the agency from STAT’s Lizzy Lawrence. The fallout from Friday’s ‘massacre’ at the CDC The White House said on Friday it was cutting between 1,100 and 1,200 employees at HHS. According to people familiar with the firings, the terminations were concentrated at the CDC, with a particular focus on disease surveillance and injury prevention, but according to a union representing agency employees, more than half of the terminations have since been rescinded. A statement yesterday from the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 said the firings tied to the government shutdown affected more than 1,300 CDC employees, but more than 700 were reinstated via email within 24 hours, which an HHS official attributed to coding errors in job classifications. More than 600 workers remain fired, the union said. The reversals included almost the entire staff of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, known as the “voice of the CDC,” which initially had been laid off. Information is still trickling out about all of the offices affected, so we will keep you updated about what the scene is once the dust settles more. For now, read my colleagues’ story about the latest turmoil to upend the nation’s top health agency. AstraZeneca, Trump strike drug pricing deal In a bid to honor his promise to lower U.S. drug prices, President Trump on Friday said he struck a drug pricing deal with AstraZeneca . Similar to the deal the president made with Pfizer at the end of September, the British pharma company agreed to give the Medicaid program lower drug prices in line with what it offers other major developed countries and to launch new drugs at so-called most-favored nation prices. In exchange, the U.S. will give the company a three-year reprieve on national security-related pharmaceutical tariffs, allowing AstraZeneca time to make all of the medicines it sells in the U.S. in this country, the company said. AstraZeneca recently broke ground on a new $4.5 billion manufacturing plant in Virginia, part of its pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments. Details of the deal were not made publicly available, but what are drug pricing experts saying about it? Read the story from STAT’s Daniel Payne and Elaine Chen. LGBTQ+ clinicians hold the line, plan for future It would be “out of touch,” as Alex Sheldon put it, if a professional group for LGBTQ+ clinicians didn’t acknowledge at its annual meeting the way that federal forces have zeroed in on the community this year. “We have people in the room who’ve been targeted directly — literally themselves — by the federal administration for the care that they provide,” said Sheldon, executive director of GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ+ Equity. “It would be alarming, honestly, if the tone weren’t slightly different than it was last year.” Last year, everyone gathered just weeks before the presidential election took place. They knew the stakes were high, Sheldon said, but “we still couldn’t possibly have anticipated the rapid descent of everything that we hold dear in LGBTQ+ health care.” This weekend, the group met again for three days of plenaries and presentations organized to balance the focus on resistance to restrictive policies with building a path toward a future with expanded, improved evidence and access to care. Security was on the premises, and many attendees seemed to have considered if there was a physical risk to showing up. But there were also drag performances and karaoke. GLMA’s own work has also changed over the last year. While the group had previously volunteered its medical expertise in litigation, now the group is suing the federal government itself, based on the standing of its members who have lost research grants and been unable to deliver care. In August, the group notched a win when a district court judge blocked the NIH from terminating grants focused on sexual and gender minorities. — Theresa Gaffney California enacts safeguards for AI chatbots California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law yesterday a bill that forces developers of artificially intelligent chatbots to erect safeguards for users of the technology and provides them with the right to pursue legal action against negligent developers. The law has several provisions, including preventing chatbots from exposing minors to sexual content and developing protocols for addressing talk of suicidal ideation, suicide, or self-harm in the chat. It’s the first state to develop guardrails after months of media reports about how AI chatbots can trigger delusions, paranoia, and even suicide. It’s clear that chatbots can pose a risk to a person’s mental health, especially if they have psychosis, as I wrote about in September . Relatedly, my colleague Mario Aguilar has a scoop this morning that Lyra Health will let its members talk about their mental health with a chatbot, making it the largest company to launch a generative AI product as a part of ongoing therapy treatment.

But a decade of enrollment growth could finally contract for the first time in 20 years, writes STAT’s Tara Bannow. Private Medicare insurers are saying cuts to plans and benefits are necessary because members’ care has gotten more expensive. So when Medicare’s annual enrollment period starts Wednesday, beneficiaries will face tough choices. Insurers have been slashing plans and benefits for a few years now. It began after the Covid-19 pandemic, when older adults returned for procedures they’d put off during shutdowns, like hip and knee replacements. Among the plans being sold for next year, industry analysts pointed to noteworthy cuts among Elevance, UnitedHealthcare, and CVS Health, which owns Aetna. Will 2026 be the bottom? Read Tara’s story .

e9eafab047c4,"Inside FDA, career staffers describe how political pressure is influencing their work","autism, biotechnology, children's health, drug development, fda, hhs, pharmaceuticals, policy, rfk jr., stat+","WASHINGTON — The inquiry came in August, and struck scientists at the Food and Drug Administration as highly unusual. The leader of the center that regulates prescription medicines wanted to know what they thought about leucovorin , a generic drug that’s mainly used to alleviate side effects of cancer therapies. He’d seen some promising studies and thought the agency could find a way to approve it as an autism treatment. Autism, with its broad spectrum of symptoms, is one of the most challenging conditions to treat with medication. For the FDA itself to push for such a significant change to a drug’s label, and based on a handful of small studies — it would be unheard of, officials told STAT. The request would have seemed completely random if not for health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s longstanding interest in autism . In April, Kennedy announced his intention to identify autism’s root cause by September. President Trump zeroed in on the condition, too, and the political pressure to announce something big and splashy was ramping up. Even given the president’s interest in the subject, the request was so extraordinary that FDA staff pushed back, STAT has learned. The drug center director who made the request, George Tidmarsh, eventually came to a compromise with his staff: He agreed to ask GSK, the original manufacturer of the drug, to instead submit an application for cerebral folate deficiency, a rare neurological disorder that can have overlapping symptoms with autism. This episode was described by two people familiar with the situation. But at the Trump administration’s press conference on autism in September, the career staff’s efforts to ground the move in science didn’t seem to matter. When FDA Commissioner Marty Makary reintroduced the public to leucovorin, he touted the drug as an autism treatment. “Today, the FDA is filing a federal register notice to change the label on an exciting treatment called prescription leucovorin so that it can be available to children with autism,” he said. “Leucovorin holds promise for hundreds of thousands of kids with autism,” he later tweeted . Reshma Ramachandran, a health services researcher and clinician at Yale School of Medicine, said the sequence of events is the antithesis of how the FDA is supposed to function.

c1b76b590eb9,The long history of euphemisms around the use of animals in lab research,"ethics, research","We woke in Boston before daybreak as usual, and Hammy — my beagle, who was once a lab dog used in research — stretched, a squeak escaping from his yawn. I prepared my oatmeal and served him breakfast, then we bundled up and headed to Boston Common to meet Larry Carbone, who was then a visiting fellow at the Harvard Law School Animal Law and Policy Program. The Common, considered the country’s oldest park, has been an important space for public assembly for centuries: On that land, George Washington celebrated the nation’s independence, women’s suffragists held rallies, and Charles Lindbergh inspired crowds with visions of the future of commercial aviation. (A few years after his celebrated transatlantic flight, in 1927, Lindbergh conducted animal experiments at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, now the Rockefeller University, in New York. He worked with Nobel Prize winner Alexis Carrel, the transplant pioneer who proved that kidney transplantation — at least between dogs — was possible. The unlikely pair, both staunch eugenicists seeking the key to immortality, designed a perfusion pump, which is used today to keep organs alive during transport; they used an early version to exhibit a dog’s thyroid at the 1939 World’s Fair in Queens.) In the park, Hammy and I crossed a bridge over the lagoon to find Carbone. I scanned the surrounding skyline — the hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies — and thought about the effort that went into making the world of animal experimentation invisible. What if we had X-ray vision? I wondered. What if heat sensors could show all the animals tucked away in city buildings? I thought back to a time shortly after I adopted Hammy, when our friend Dave and I saw some of those hidden dogs in the basement of the medical school at George Washington University. We’d heard about a volunteer program inviting outsiders to come in and play with the dogs used for research and had briefly considered applying for positions. The veterinarian who showed us around opened a metal door to a small narrow room with kennels on either side of a walkway, housing maybe a half-dozen large, barking hounds. A cart of dog toys sat idle in the hallway, and a bulletin board with photos of dogs who’d been adopted hung on the wall, reminiscent of collages of recovering kids at a children’s hospital. What’s stuck with me is that these dogs lived in a building just feet from the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metro station and across a courtyard from the George Washington University Hospital, where I’d been treated several times. Thousands of people passed that building daily. Almost none of them would have known of the dogs. Animals used in research aren’t just hidden from sight. They’re objectified, or “de-animalized,” Carbone writes in “ What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy .” He points out that in grant applications, animals are “supplies,” and in scientific papers, they become “specimens” and “tools.” Euthanasia is a protocol to “sacrifice” an animal, jargon that some lab workers shorten to “sac.” One of the common methods used on mice, which the American Veterinary Medical Foundation says “appears to be humane,” requires separating the mouse’s skull from his or her spine. Lab techs press a pen or pencil behind the mouse’s ears to snap the neck; they refer to the technique by a less unpleasant term, “cervical dislocation.” Turns out there’s a long history of employing euphemisms around animal research, as we do with the animals we eat: We don’t eat pigs, cows, and sheep; we eat pork, beef, and mutton. A 1927 pamphlet titled “Cruel Experiments on Dogs and Cats Performed in British Laboratories” states, “Vivisectors have a soothing modern expression for the process of starving an animal: they call it ‘prolonged rest of the digestive organs.’” Around the same time in the United States, the Journal of Experimental Medicine, a respected biomedical publication, adopted an editorial policy that historian Susan Lederer describes as a form of “scientific prior restraint.” For several decades in the middle of the century, editors censored descriptions and illustrations of procedures involving animals, rejected manuscripts that might give antivivisectionists ammunition (or photos they could print in their pamphlets), and devised a system to conceal the number of animals used in studies. Instead of referring to Dog No. 897 in the text — which suggests at least 897 dogs had been used in the author’s experiments — the dog would be referenced as dog A8-97. The editorial staff also avoided including the number of animals killed in the early stages of studies, when a scientist was perfecting a technique or procedure. The guidelines suggested words to avoid ( acute , intense , severe ) and words to substitute ( hemorrhaging for bleeding , intoxicant for poison , animal for dog , and it for he or she ). Also unacceptable: describing an animal as crying out in pain or being restrained. Lederer writes that while defenders of medical research generally accused antivivisectionists of garbling the scientific information they collected from journals, the editing of language and omission of photos “may itself have ‘scrambled’ the communication of laboratory data, skewing expectations, replications, and results.” The objectification and de-individualization of lab animals were undertaken at the journal “not for maximizing scientific objectivity or for minimizing emotional attachment to animals,” she writes, “but for essentially political reasons.” Carbone and I strolled through the park under a brilliant sun, following Hammy’s nose, and spoke of beagles, writing, his long-ago job feeding snakes at the zoo in Boston, and his varied career as a laboratory animal veterinarian. We stopped a few times to sit, and Carbone gently spread his jacket between Hammy and the cold bench. When the two interacted, Carbone smiled and his eyes twinkled; when Hammy shivered, Carbone pulled him close and kissed the bridge of his nose. Carbone wishes there weren’t even a role for lab animal veterinarians. He spent his career working to better the lives of animals in labs because, as he writes in his book, the reality is they are there, and he expects they’ll continue to be there for some time. The job isn’t easy: Carbone presided over the deaths of thousands of animals, and almost every day he witnessed what he considers wrongs. The animals’ welfare wasn’t compromised through the “grand torture that the animal rights activists describe,” he writes, but “in a thousand and one smaller ways” — confined, alone, in cages day after day, struggling before a procedure, dying at the hands of a human when they’ve outlived their usefulness. Carbone has adopted a perspective he credits to the late chimpanzee veterinarian James Mahoney: “We may not have a right to experiment on animals, only a very pressing need.” Excerpted from “ Lab Dog ” by Melanie D.G.

This is the second in a three-part series on the dramatically changing world of dementia. Read the first part here . As a dementia specialist, I think of my work as that of a writer. To diagnose a patient, I write the story of their problems, embellished with an exam, tests of cognition, and brain scans that show that organ’s structure and function. If this story nicely matches the textbook description of a disease that causes dementia, it’s a diagnostic story, what doctors call “a classic case.” Barbara was one of my classic cases of the “amnestic variant” of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. Classic because at her new-patient visit with me at the Penn Memory Center, her and her daughter’s vivid stories nicely matched how Alzheimer’s typically unfolds, beginning with annoying problems with memory. She repeated questions and accounts of recent events (that’s the amnestic part — forgot the answer, forgot she already told you) and later developed problems with multitasking. She was no longer able to organize the household finances. Preparing a meal was a challenge. Her brain MRI showed notable loss of tissue in the medial temporal lobes, regions of the brain where the seahorse-shaped hippocampi nestle, a brain structure critical to forming new memories.

Oct 15, 2025, 06:20 AM ET Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season is here, and insiders Jeremy Fowler and Dan Graziano have been making calls to sources around the league for the latest news and buzz on key situations. This week, they asked around about the defending champion Eagles' offense. How panicked is Philadelphia right now? Will the passing game start to click? Jeremy and Dan also checked in on the aftermath of the Titans firing coach Brian Callahan. Why was it done now, and what should we expect from Tennessee's upcoming coaching search? Then they broke down the 49ers' seemingly never-ending string of injuries and whether that might prompt them to be active at the trade deadline. And speaking of trades, our insiders asked around the league to get a sense of which running backs could be available between now and the Nov. 4 deadline. It's all here, as our national reporters answer big questions and empty their notebooks heading into Week 7 . Jump to: Eagles' offensive woes Callahan firing aftermath 49ers' potential trades RBs who could be moved More notes on Week 7 Should we be worried about the Eagles' offense? Are they worried about it? Graziano: I lean yes on both questions, with the caveat that they're 4-2 and in a position to be able to fix their problems in time. But there are problems, and they do need to be fixed. It's easy to default to ""Oh, there's locker room tension,"" but I really have never had the sense that Eagles players have any personal issues with one another. They all want to be better, and if there's tension, it's because of the two straight losses and the urgency they all feel to get it turned around. Fowler: I was at the game against the Giants on Thursday night and definitely sensed concern. One player told me that this is starting to feel like the 2023 meltdown all over again (when Philadelphia lost five of its last six games), and the team needs to use this week to figure things out and avoid a full-blown repeat. Right tackle Lane Johnson , whose words carry weight, told reporters that the offense felt predictable . The issue is pretty clear: The Eagles aren't dominating in the running game the way they did a year ago. Graziano: Last year around this time, the Eagles had some bye-week meetings and decided to change the offensive approach. They wanted to rely more on Saquon Barkley and the offensive line. Obviously, it worked for the Super Bowl champs. But this season's offensive line is not playing as well as last year's did. It has had injury problems and misses Mekhi Becton , who left as a free agent to sign with the Chargers. By the time Barkley got to the line of scrimmage last season, the offensive line had already moved it a few yards up the field, leaving holes for Barkley. Those holes aren't there anymore. The question now becomes what to do about it, because during times when the Eagles have relied on Jalen Hurts and the passing game for long stretches, Hurts has had turnover issues (one of the reasons they made the change last season). Fowler: Despite Hurts' strengths, asking him to throw 33 times the way they did Thursday is not a winning formula. Last season, he averaged 24 passing attempts. He struggles at times against zone coverage, and without the big run plays, it's harder to get those one-on-one matchups for A.J. Brown deep downfield. To that point, Brown's frustrations two weeks ago probably stem more from the realities of a limited pass game than any personality clashes. The product on the field is the root of any tension -- perceived or otherwise -- and that can change if the on-field problems are exacerbated. As for solutions, some in the locker room would like to see more play-action. The Eagles use it 19.6% of the time, which is 29th in the NFL. Perhaps we see more pre-snap movement/motion to open up more throwing windows, which might encourage Hurts to let it loose a little more. Hit the throws that are there, and hit them on time. Where do the Eagles turn for a spark, Dan? Graziano: I think it has to come from Barkley. He's the best player on an offense loaded with stars, and if they can get him going at even 80% to 85% of the level of his 2024 performance, things would look a lot different. Are there ways to vary the run game so that it's less predictable and more creative? Are there passing-game concepts they could implement that don't carry a ton of turnover risk and might -- if they work -- help make more room for Barkley in the run game? The Eagles' bye isn't until Week 9, and they have a trip to Minnesota this week followed by another game against the Giants in Week 8. Perhaps the ""mini-bye"" they have coming off last Thursday's game will offer them a chance to reconfigure things? Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo was promoted to replace Kellen Moore, who left to coach the Saints, and he came in with a bit of a do-no-harm mandate. But the Eagles believe Patullo is ready to be an offensive coordinator, and when they talked about that during training camp, they cited all the different places he has been and the different philosophies to which he has been exposed. Surely, Patullo has his own ideas that go beyond the simple-but-effective stuff that carried the team to the Super Bowl last season. It's time we found out what those ideas are. play 1:33 What is the biggest issue with the Eagles' offense? Harry Douglas explains the biggest issues with the Eagles' offense after Philadelphia lost its second straight game. What's the leaguewide buzz around the Titans firing Brian Callahan? Fowler: This move leaves a lot to process, and the timing is curious . Titans brass seemed ready to support Callahan in camp. Six games later, he's gone , becoming the fourth Tennessee head coach or GM to be fired in the past 34 months. The 2025 product under Callahan was worse than imagined -- and with one of the NFL's worst rosters, that's saying something. The goal was simple: get better. The Titans didn't. Was 23 games enough for Callahan to establish a winning culture? Of course not. But my sense after asking around is the Titans weighed Cam Ward 's development in all of this, and whether Callahan could spark any improvement. The roster has a long way to go. It looks as if Mike Vrabel got out at the right time. Graziano: Vrabel heading to Nashville this week to coach the Patriots against his former team is a funny little wrinkle in all of this -- especially given that Vrabel has won the same number of games with the Patriots this season as the Titans have won since they fired him after the 2023 season. Fowler: Some people I've talked to believe Vrabel's presence was a factor, at least subconsciously. One industry source told me half-jokingly, ""They didn't want Vrabel to be the one to dunk on [Callahan],"" thus getting ahead of it. People around the league with a fundamental understanding of the Titans' standing also wondered if this was a chance to reset. As one team executive put it, this is the ""last cleanup"" under president of football operations Chad Brinker. Now Brinker and general manager Mike Borgonzi can handpick their coach. Getting a head start on vetting candidates also can be useful. Graziano: I get what you're saying, but people I've talked to argue that if that were the case, they should have let Callahan go in the offseason and let Brinker hire his replacement then. Instead, Tennessee is pretty much in a holding pattern with Ward for the next three months until it hires someone to install a new offense and work with him in January. This smells more like dysfunction to me than the tail end of some grand plan. But we shall see. As is always the case, what matters more is what happens going forward with whom the Titans hire as their next full-time head coach and what they do roster-wise in the meantime. play 1:03 Who Dan Orlovsky would like to see as next Titans coach Dan Orlovsky lists five coaches who could develop Cam Ward and the Titans following the firing of Brian Callahan. Fowler: The Titans were already poised to be active at the trade deadline, and the Callahan firing only expedites that process. They know they need draft capital to rebuild the roster. Edge rusher Arden Key , cornerback Roger McCreary and tight end Chig Okonkwo are among players on my radar. There could be more. But those three are 2026 free agents and do not appear in the long-term vision of the franchise. And the plan right now is to keep defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons . He's unquestionably the Titans' best player and turns 28 in July. But Tennessee needs to find a way to make the job more attractive from a roster standpoint. Ward and Simmons are not enough. The team currently has seven picks in the 2026 draft and would like to add more. Graziano: They could certainly use all the picks they can get. And it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, either, if they ended up with the No. 1 pick in next year's draft, since they wouldn't need to use it on a quarterback and could almost certainly auction it off for a king's ransom to some team that would. There's a big-picture element at play here, with the Titans building a new stadium that's set to open in 2027. You want some excitement around your team when you're trying to sell tickets and PSLs, and maximize the business impact of a new home field. So I would think the goal would be to have the fans and the town feeling energized about the team coming out of 2026 and going into 2027. And I would expect the major moves they make -- including the new coaching hire -- to take that into account. Whoever gets this job is going to have a mandate to show some level of improvement in their first season. The 49ers are banged up. Could they get active in the trade market? Fowler: Yes, the 49ers have been scanning the trade market for pass-rush options. I'm told the Niners consider Trey Hendrickson an ideal fit for their defense if the Bengals would part with him for reasonable compensation. But I'm also told Cincinnati has no plans to trade Hendrickson at this time. Despite a 2-4 record, Cincinnati plans to remain all-in on this season, and the offense showed signs of life with Joe Flacco on Sunday in Green Bay.

Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Graziano: I've been told the same thing on Hendrickson -- that the Bengals don't intend to trade him. Let's see what happens these next couple of weeks. If they lose to the Steelers, Jets and Bears and wake up on trade deadine day with a 2-7 record, maybe they consider it. But if they beat Pittsburgh on Thursday , the Bengals will have reason to believe they can hang in a messy AFC North Division race, especially if they still harbor any hope of a Joe Burrow return . Fowler: Other potential options I suspect the 49ers will check on include edge rushers Rashan Gary (Packers), Jaelan Phillips (Dolphins), Bradley Chubb (Dolphins), Jermaine Johnson (Jets), Will McDonald IV (Jets) and Arden Key (Titans). If the Packers won't part with Gary -- and I don't think they would -- they have pass rusher Kingsley Enagbare , a former starter who's relegated to a reserve role in a contract year. Pass rusher could elicit the most movement on the trade market overall, and I suspect San Francisco will be involved to some extent. Graziano: They will not be able to find a one-for-one replacement for linebacker Fred Warner ( ankle ), who is the heart and soul of their defense, or for Nick Bosa ( torn ACL ), who is their best player. I do think -- given their history, their 4-2 record and their goals for this season -- that the 49ers will look to add at any or all of the three levels of the defense. They have plenty of cap space to take on contracts if teams are unloading them. I don't think it needs to be edge help, though that's probably a priority. If the Jets are dealing players, as most people seem to expect they will, could linebacker Quincy Williams (who's playing on the final year of his contract) make sense for San Francisco? Fowler: The Warner injury leaves a massive hole in the middle of the 49ers' defense that can't be replaced. But adding reinforcements would be a sensible option. Williams has a long history with 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh from their days with the Jets. He became an All-Pro under Saleh. And sitting at 0-6 feels like a unique window for the Jets to acquire assets for the future. So, on paper it makes sense. Another linebacker on my radar is Houston's Christian Harris , a multiyear starter who is now in a backup role. He plays for DeMeco Ryans, who's an extension of the 49ers' defensive principles. Still, my sense is the 49ers will try to find a balance between adding help and preserving picks. After all, this season was considered a quasi-transitional period for San Francisco, which let several starters walk and replenished with younger players on less expensive contracts. I'm not sure giving up quality picks for both the edge and linebacker positions is the most prudent thing, given the plan outlined all offseason. Perhaps the 49ers can utilize or repackage one of their three fourth-round picks in 2026 to acquire two quality players. Getting edge help, to me, is crucial because of how the defense is built. play 1:36 Schefter: NFL trades will happen this week Adam Schefter details to Pat McAfee the buyers and sellers in the NFL trade market. Graziano: It also doesn't have to be defense for the 49ers. They've been extremely banged up in their wide receiver corps this season. They still don't know for sure when Brandon Aiyuk ( knee ) is coming back. They already signed Kendrick Bourne , who has been a star the past two weeks with Ricky Pearsall ( knee ) out and Jauan Jennings ( ribs ) playing hurt, but I wouldn't be shocked if the help the 49ers bring in from the outside comes on the offensive side of the ball. San Francisco is still in a win-now window, with veterans such as Trent Williams and George Kittle in or nearing the back ends of their careers. And being 4-2 gives the Niners reason to think that, if they get healthy, they can still make a run this season. Just so many holes to fill, you wonder which direction they'll go. Name one running back who could be traded before the deadline. Graziano: The name that comes up most is the Jets' Breece Hall . He's 24 years old and in the final year of his contract, and the Jets have made no move to sign him long term. Braelon Allen is out because of a knee injury , which complicates things for the Jets from a 2025 depth-chart perspective. But Allen is only 21 years old and under contract for two more years after this one. They also like Isaiah Davis , who is 23 and also signed through 2027. So there are plenty of reasons Hall might not be in the Jets' long-range plans, and they could be open to a nice offer. Teams I expect to have interest in acquiring a running back ahead of the deadline include, but are not limited to, the Chiefs, Texans and Chargers. Fowler: Team execs have also pegged the Patriots among teams that could look to add a back in the coming weeks. And good call on Hall. He has said publicly he doesn't want to be traded, but he's also on an 0-6 team, so it feels as if all bets are off. I'll go with the Browns' Jerome Ford . It's a rookie show in Cleveland. Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson will man the backfield moving forward. The Browns have remained active in the market with three trades executed in recent weeks. And Ford has enough cachet in the league -- with 1,378 rushing yards and seven touchdowns over 2023-24 -- to attract interest. Graziano: If Miami decides to trade players before the deadline, it could move on from Jaylen Wright . He was a healthy scratch Sunday against the Chargers and seems to have been supplanted by rookie Ollie Gordon II on the depth chart behind starter De'Von Achane . And with Tyrone Tracy Jr . back healthy, and Cam Skattebo running people over, the Giants don't seem to have a screaming need for Devin Singletary anymore. He's making $3.5 million in fully guaranteed salary this season. But at this point, more than $1 million of that has been paid by the Giants, who are looking around for receiver help and might be willing to eat some salary if it's the right kind of deal to help them. Fowler: Wright is a player I've had on my radar for that very reason. A lot of teams were high on him in the 2024 draft, including Dallas, which has a soft need after the Miles Sanders injury . And here's a change-of-pace option: Baltimore's Keaton Mitchell . He has game-changing speed but is the odd man out in the Ravens' backfield. It's worth noting that Chargers GM Joe Hortiz was with Baltimore when the team signed Mitchell as an undrafted free agent in 2023. What else are you hearing this week? Graziano's notes: • Remember when the Chiefs signed offensive tackle Jaylon Moore from the 49ers in March? Kansas City was desperate for a real left tackle after the Super Bowl embarrassment in which it could not protect Patrick Mahomes . The Chiefs had been hoping to get a shot at the Ravens' Ronnie Stanley , but Stanley surprised everyone by taking a below-market deal to stay in Baltimore right before free agency opened. That left slim pickings on the market at a position where elite talent is scarce. So the Chiefs signed Moore, who had been a swing tackle in San Francisco, for two years and $30 million. The move was criticized in some places as insufficient, since Moore had never been a starter and likely wasn't the answer at left tackle. But the Chiefs believed they'd take a left tackle in the draft. They hoped it would be Josh Simmons , and it was -- but not knowing that in March, they thought Moore would be a competent placeholder if the rookie wasn't ready right away. Fast forward to Sunday, when Simmons was a surprising late scratch for the game against Detroit because of a personal matter. Moore stepped in and played left tackle and held up well in the latest strong performance by Mahomes and the Kansas City offense. Would he have been the answer if he had to play left tackle all season? Maybe not. But Kansas City signed him as part of a larger plan, and it has come together the way they hoped. It's a reminder that not every free agent signing has to be a grand slam, instant-solve-the-problem move. Roster building is complex, and some teams are better than others at seeing the bigger picture. play 1:35 Does the road to the Super Bowl go through the Chiefs? Adam Schefter, Damien Woody and Tedy Bruschi discuss the Chiefs' chances of returning to another Super Bowl. • The Ravens are a fascinating team to watch ahead of the trade deadline. They've already been active. Last week they traded Odafe Oweh from an already thin pass-rush group to get safety Alohi Gilman . That's an unconventional in-season move, but Baltimore is now 1-5 and desperate for any kind of answers in a season that had carried Super Bowl hopes. Will it go out and add more pass-rush help on the trade market? Are there players on the roster we might not assume are available (like Oweh) but could be if Baltimore determines it could solve a problem with another player-for-player deal? If the Ravens lose in Weeks 8 and 9 (they have a bye this week) and are 1-7, could they be dealing players for picks at the deadline? These next few weeks are critical ones for the organization, which has another Lamar Jackson extension situation looming and could have big decisions to make if this season continues to get away from them. • The ""Fire Harbaugh"" chants at Baltimore's Week 6 game against the Rams are worth addressing. Anything is possible, of course, if a team continues to lose games it expected to win at a high rate. But at this point, I don't think John Harbaugh is in any danger of losing his job. And if he did, he'd instantly become the top head coaching candidate on the market this winter. In a league that keeps cycling through coordinators-turned-head-coaches, teams would jump at the chance to bring in a guy who has done the big job for 18 years and has won more than 60% of his games -- including 13 playoff games and a Super Bowl. Tough times in Baltimore right now, and the fans are going through it, but it's a smart, circumspect organization that knows how good it has it at the head coach spot. • Jacksonville's performance in Sunday's home loss to Seattle was a big disappointment after the Week 5 victory over the Chiefs . The offense still looks like a work in progress, and it was missing starting center Robert Hainsey , who came over from Tampa Bay with coach Liam Coen and is a critical part of what the Jags want to do on offense. Seventh-round rookie Jonah Monheim was the fill-in, and before the game, Jaguars coaches were telling me they'd likely have to adjust the game plan to help him more with the guards and try to run more outside zone runs. The Jaguars never got anything going, largely because the Seahawks manhandled them with their defensive line. But watch the injury reports on Hainsey's health if you're wondering what to expect from the Jaguars in London against the Rams' tough defensive line this week. • As for the Seahawks, their people were telling me after that game that they were intentionally more conservative on offense due to the ability the Jaguars had shown to generate takeaways (14 in their first five games). Aside from that one picture-perfect deep shot from Sam Darnold to Jaxon Smith-Njigba , Seattle kept things fairly scaled-down on offense -- and it worked. It was the first game this season in which Jacksonville's defense didn't come away with a turnover. All of ESPN. All in one place.

Sign Up Now • Fantasy managers continue to be frustrated at the carry share between running backs Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet , but the Seahawks believe they complement each other well and will continue to vary their usage according to the weekly game plan and opponent. They felt like Charbonnet was the better back for what they wanted to do Sunday, especially once they got the lead. Actual success running the ball wasn't as important to them as a demonstrated willingness to continue to run the ball and avoid turnovers. This also worked! So don't go around thinking the Seahawks are somehow desperate for one of those backs to take over a huge chunk of the workload. They like the way it's going. Fowler's notes: • The Jets will be a focus for teams looking to poach key players at the trade deadline, most notably pass rushers McDonald and Johnson. New York wanted to get back from London before making any sweeping determinations of whether to move players. My sense is the Jets would prefer more modest moves (think corner Michael Carter II ), but much will depend on the type of offers New York receives for key players. • The Eagles are lurking in the trade market, as always. People I've talked to around the league believe cornerback or edge rusher (or both) could be a focus at the deadline. Keep in mind that Philly has already made several trades -- acquiring corner Jakorian Bennett , wide receiver John Metchie III and running back Tank Bigsby -- and those moves haven't paid off yet. • Teams I've spoken to believe the Raiders are open to trading wide receiver Jakobi Meyers but are not actively trying to move him. The sense is the Raiders would prefer to play out the season before making major determinations about the roster. But Meyers requested a trade in the preseason, so a potential deal feels at least on the table. • I've spoken to some teams that believe that trading marquee quarterbacks such as Russell Wilson or Kirk Cousins will be a challenge due to scarcity of jobs. The Bengals had an opening last week but opted for a financially sensible option in Joe Flacco . And both the Falcons and Giants have quarterbacks who have an injury history ( Michael Penix Jr .) or play a physical style that could lead to injury ( Jaxson Dart ). Keeping their respective No. 2s could pay off. • The Rams head to London with uncertainty around the league's receptions leader. Receiver Puka Nacua avoided major damage to his ankle Sunday against Baltimore, but the people I've talked to believe he is a long shot Sunday against Jacksonville. Los Angeles gets a much-needed bye week after that, giving Nacua and others the chance to heal. Nacua's physical style of play could lead the Rams to sit him. • Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz ( shoulder ) plans to practice this week despite what's considered a pretty painful injury. He's day-to-day. Wentz is enjoying a golden opportunity with the Vikings' offense while J.J. McCarthy ( ankle ) is out. He wants to be available in the event that the Vikings need him again this week against his old team , the Eagles. • The Bucs are going on second- and third-string receivers due to injury, but Mike Evans ( hamstring ) will give it a go in practice this week with hopes of playing Monday against Detroit . Evans has missed three games and had hoped to avoid a fourth. It's worth noting that he is tied with Jerry Rice for most consecutive 1,000-yard seasons (11). If he's back this week, he has 11 games to get from 140 to 1,000. • Dallas is optimistic about its health in Week 7. There's a chance that all three key injured players with extended absences -- wide receiver CeeDee Lamb ( ankle ), guard Tyler Booker (ankle) and KaVontae Turpin (foot) -- return Sunday. ""This is the week that they ramp up,"" a team source said. • The Chiefs won't be easing Rashee Rice back into action. They will be allocating a heavy workload for him as soon as possible. Rice, who returns from suspension this week, has been in the building for weeks, had an excellent training camp and is in peak physical shape. A team source says Rice will be ""full bore"" this week as he gets back onto the practice field. The Chiefs have long envisioned an offense with a receiving trio of Rice, Xavier Worthy and Hollywood Brown on the same field, with Tyquan Thornton and JuJu Smith-Schuster as complementary guys. That's a really strong five-man receiving group. • The Panthers have a decision to make on which running back to start after Rico Dowdle scorched the Dolphins and Cowboys for a combined 389 rushing yards on 53 carries while Chuba Hubbard was sidelined with a calf injury . Hubbard will be back soon. While Dowdle has earned a prominent role, I'm told the Panthers are taking the approach that both players will get their touches regardless of who gets the first snap. Both fit the Panthers' tough-minded, grind-it-out mold. The Panthers want to be a run-first team, and since it's a long season, they will need both players. But the rotations will inevitably change due to Dowdle's star turn. Dowdle said the previous setup was that Hubbard got the first two series and Dowdle would get the third. Expect Carolina to tweak that to accommodate the prowess of both players. Hubbard rushed for nearly 1,200 yards and 10 touchdowns last season, so he will remain a focal point. play 1:35 Is Rico Dowdle's fantasy production sustainable? Tristan H. Cockcroft breaks down whether Rico Dowdle can maintain his current fantasy output. • When talking to people with the Steelers this week in advance of Thursday night's matchup with Cincinnati , a few themes emerged. First, Pittsburgh's offense believes it's a run-first attack now. The Steelers believe the interior offensive line in particular has emerged in recent games to provide an additional push up the middle that benefits backs Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell . This helps protect a 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers and plays to offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's strengths as a run-game guru with a tight end background. Expect that identity to continue. It's also noteworthy how Rodgers and Smith have hit it off. As right tackle Troy Fautanu told me recently, Rodgers and Smith are both quick-witted and sarcastic, kindred souls in that way, razzing each other like old friends during team meetings. ""They are always messing around with each other,"" Fautanu said. ""It's a healthy dynamic."" Rodgers and Smith also respect each other's football acumen. It's a match that has worked well.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46584393/nfl-week-7-buzz-news-updates-fantasy-intel-questions-predictions,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1559714_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,d98fc9d88f8f87d2dba66c222813f51260f83523
412cf557f4cb,NFL Week 7 Power Rankings 2025: How all 32 teams stack up,,"Welcome to Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season . The Jets are still winless after losing to the Broncos in London. The Chiefs bounced back with a win over the Lions. And the Buccaneers are shockingly at the top of the NFC race. How do all of these teams fit in our updated Power Rankings? We restacked the NFL heading into Week 7, which includes byes for Buffalo and Baltimore. In addition to the 1-32 rankings, our NFL Nation reporters picked one lesson that we've learned from each team this season. Which teams and players are underperforming? What has surprisingly worked out for teams through six weeks? Let's get into it with our No. 1 team, which saw a change from last week . Our power panel of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities evaluated how NFL teams stack up against one another, ranking them from 1 to 32. Jump to a team: ARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN CLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND JAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN NE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF SEA | TB | TEN | WSH Week 6 result: Beat the 49ers 30-19 Week 6 ranking: 4 Lesson learned: The Bucs are far better equipped to weather injuries. The Bucs lost three games last season without Mike Evans and Chris Godwin Jr ., and yet the past two weeks, Baker Mayfield and this defense have pulled off back-to-back victories without both receivers . In fact, Mayfield delivered this past Sunday's win with just one healthy starting skill player by the game's end in tight end Cade Otton . The Bucs were down to the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth wide receivers -- two of whom scored their first NFL touchdowns. And the defense might be short at corner again, but its depth and its ability to get takeaways have catapulted Tampa Bay to the top of the NFC. -- Jenna Laine Week 6 result: Lost to the Chiefs 30-17 Week 6 ranking: 1 Lesson learned: Aidan Hutchinson has returned to elite form after severe leg injury . A broken leg ended Hutchinson's 2024 season early, but he picked up where he left off as one of the league's elite pass rushers. He set a single-season team record by producing at least 1.0 sacks in five consecutive games, in addition to another franchise mark of four straight games with a forced fumble. His 24 pressures is also the most in the NFL, as he's moving fluidly after a tough rehabilitation process. -- Eric Woodyard Week 6 result: Lost to the Falcons 24-14 Week 6 ranking: 2 Lesson learned: This Bills team still has a lot to learn about itself. Coming into the season, the hype for the Bills was high, with reigning MVP Josh Allen set for another big year. But if anything has been clear for this team through six games, it's that there are some major questions still to be answered to truly have a run at a Super Bowl title. Is the defense talented enough to put together a complete game? Is there enough talent at wide receiver to give Allen targets downfield? The limitations of this team have been clear, even in the wins, and there is work to be done. -- Alaina Getzenberg Week 6 result: Beat the Cardinals 31-27 Week 6 ranking: 5 Lesson learned: They were right about quarterback Daniel Jones . The Colts have a long way to go after playing a relatively soft schedule, but it's impossible to ignore what Jones has done since being handed the starting job in his first season in Indianapolis. Jones, who beat out incumbent starter Anthony Richardson Sr . in a preseason battle, leads the NFL in QBR (79.9) and is third in completion percentage (71.7%). Jones has also shown his versatility and toughness, as only the Eagles' Jalen Hurts (five) has more than Jones' four rushing touchdowns. -- Stephen Holder Week 6 result: Lost to the Giants 34-17 Week 6 ranking: 3 Lesson learned: Repeating as Super Bowl champions is hard. The offensive line is banged up and not performing to its usual dominant standard. Running back Saquon Barkley has less room to run, sending ripple effects across an offense that relied heavily on his production a year ago. The defense lost several key players and looks more vulnerable. The Eagles are playing a first-place schedule and have one of the most difficult slates in the NFL. Add all of that up and add the fact that every team they play is extra motivated to knock off the champs and you have one long road back toward a potential repeat. -- Tim McManus play 1:36 Schefter: NFL trades will happen this week Adam Schefter details to Pat McAfee the buyers and sellers in the NFL trade market. Week 6 result: Beat the Bengals 27-18 Week 6 ranking: 8 Lesson learned: Green Bay is playing with fire. The Packers are the only team in the NFL that has held a double-digit lead in every game this season. But in the past three games, those leads were not safe. They blew a 10-0 advantage in a 13-10 loss to the Browns. They were up 13-0 against the Cowboys but came away with a 40-40 tie . And in the latest game, they saw a 14-point second-half lead cut to six points against the Bengals. They've established a dangerous way to live. -- Rob Demovsky Week 6 result: Beat the Ravens 17-3 Week 6 ranking: 9 Lesson learned: The Rams need to figure out their kicking issues if they want to be Super Bowl contenders. The Rams' protection issues on special teams have led to four blocked kicks, and they again dealt with kicking woes in Week 6 when Joshua Karty missed a 26-yard field goal in the first quarter. ""I thought the protection was good,"" head coach Sean McVay said. ""We've got to make the kick. We ended up missing the kick. Ended up hitting the second one not very clean right there. The snap felt like it was a little bit high."" The Rams have had two extra points blocked this season, which is as many as the rest of the league combined, according to ESPN Research. -- Sarah Barshop Week 6 result: Beat the Jaguars 20-12 Week 6 ranking: 11 Lesson learned: Don't count out a first-round pick after one underwhelming season. Defensive tackle Byron Murphy II is showing why. The No. 16 selection in 2024 was plenty disruptive as a rookie but not productive, finishing with half a sack and two tackles for loss in 14 games. But he's making a massive second-year jump. Along with seven pressures, Murphy had two sacks Sunday to give him a team-high 4.5 through six games. Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence also said Murphy is ""hands down"" the team's best run defender. -- Brady Henderson Week 6 result: Beat the Lions 30-17 Week 6 ranking: 7 Lesson learned: The offensive line is no longer an issue. Much of the Chiefs' offseason was about general manager Brett Veach and coach Andy Reid fixing the offensive line , especially at left tackle. The Chiefs signed left tackle Jaylon Moore in free agency and selected rookie left tackle Josh Simmons in the draft. They also moved Kingsley Suamataia to left guard to replace Joe Thuney , who was traded to the Bears. Each player in the trio has performed well, making the offensive line a strength once again for quarterback Patrick Mahomes . -- Nate Taylor play 1:35 Does the road to the Super Bowl go through the Chiefs? Adam Schefter, Damien Woody and Tedy Bruschi discuss the Chiefs' chances of returning to another Super Bowl. Week 6 result: Beat the Jets 13-11 Week 6 ranking: 10 Lesson learned: Don't look now, but coach Sean Payton has a team powered by defense. Payton's offensive résumé was a big part of why he was hired in 2023 , but the Broncos are 4-2 because of a defense that leads the league in sacks (30), defensive expected points added (31.43) and opposing QBR (43.5). Cornerback Pat Surtain II continues to vex the league's top receivers, and outside linebacker Nik Bonitto is tied for the NFL lead in sacks (seven). Denver pressures across the defensive front and has the secondary depth to play any nickel or dime variations. The Broncos' aggression has surrendered a big play or two -- see Weeks 2 and 3 -- but they have overcome their bobbles on offense and special teams with a playoff-worthy defense. -- Jeff Legwold Week 6 result: Lost to the Buccaneers 30-19 Week 6 ranking: 6 Lesson learned: The 49ers are tough, but that might not be enough to offset their injuries. The Niners looked destined to lose at some point in all six of their games, yet they found a way to win four of them. That's a credit to coach Kyle Shanahan and his staff, as well as the veteran leaders charged with setting a standard. But the 49ers have again been ravaged by injury, losing star defensive end Nick Bosa ( knee ) and linebacker Fred Warner ( ankle ) for the season in addition to other injuries to key players. Resilience is an important trait for any NFL team, but eventually talent trumps intangibles. That means things are only going to get more difficult for San Francisco. -- Nick Wagoner Week 6 result: Beat the Browns 23-9 Week 6 ranking: 13 Lesson learned: Aaron Rodgers doesn't have to do it all alone. The Steelers lead the league in average yards after catch per reception (7.3) but are last in air yards per target (5.3). That means they're not relying on their 41-year-old quarterback to heave it down the field for splash plays. Instead, the recipe of getting the ball out of his hands quickly and into the arms of his playmakers is working for a Steelers offense averaging a respectable 23.8 points. Aaron Rodgers ' 49.0 total QBR ranks 22nd in the league, but he's completing 68.8% of his attempts (12th best). -- Brooke Pryor play 1:09 McAfee: This is the best Aaron Rodgers has looked in years Pat McAfee is very impressed by what he has seen from Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers offense this season. Week 6 result: Beat the Dolphins 29-27 Week 6 ranking: 14 Lesson learned: Offensive coordinator Greg Roman has evolved. Roman resigned as Baltimore's offensive coordinator after the 2022 season amid criticism from players and fans about the team's unimaginative passing offense. Three seasons later, he leads one of the league's best passing offenses. The Chargers' run game has fluctuated, with injuries to the offensive line and backfield. Their strongest position on offense is at receiver, so Roman has leaned on his pass catchers and quarterback Justin Herbert to make plays. Herbert is eighth in the NFL in passing yards (1,493) this season. -- Kris Rhim Week 6 result: Beat the Saints 25-19 Week 6 ranking: 17 Lesson learned: QB Drake Maye has taken the second-year leap. Maye passed for 261 yards and three touchdowns against the Saints, with a 140.1 passer rating. He became the fourth player in NFL history under 24 years old to record at least 200 passing yards and a passing rating of 100 or higher in five straight games, joining Patrick Mahomes (seven straight in 2018 and five in 2018-19), Dan Marino (six in 1984) and Dak Prescott (five in 2016). -- Mike Reiss All of ESPN.

Sign Up Now Week 6 result: Lost to the Seahawks 20-12 Week 6 ranking: 15 Lesson learned: The pass rush is their No. 1 weakness. The Jaguars are 13th in the NFL in quarterback pressures (73) but have managed just eight sacks -- the third-lowest total in the league. Josh Hines-Allen has managed just half a sack; Travon Walker has two; and Dawuane Smoot has one. That's the production of the team's top three edge rushers six games into the season, which equals defensive tackle Arik Armstead 's season total on his own. -- Mike DiRocco Week 6 result: Beat the Bills 24-14 Week 6 ranking: 19 Lesson learned: Running back Bijan Robinson is the offense's focal point. In his third season, Robinson has emerged as one of the league's elite offensive weapons. On Monday night, he might have made himself an MVP candidate with 238 yards from scrimmage, including an 81-yard touchdown against the Bills. Robinson leads the NFL with 164.4 yards from scrimmage per game. He's only the second player ever to have 450 rushing yards and 300 receiving yards through five games. The other was Thurman Thomas in 1991. -- Marc Raimondi Week 6 result: Lost to the Bears 25-24 Week 6 ranking: 14 Lesson learned: Javon Kinlaw 's deal has been a bargain. When Washington signed the veteran defensive tackle to a contract that averaged $15 million per year, many scratched their heads. But Kinlaw ranks 13th among defensive tackles with a 40.2% run stop win rate (his previous career best was 35%). He has been credited with seven run stops, already a career high. Washington wanted Kinlaw because it believed he was still ascending after multiple injuries hampered his growth. He has now been healthy for two straight seasons and is really producing. Washington's run defense still needs some work -- it ranks 20th after finishing 30th last season -- even with Kinlaw doing his part. -- John Keim Week 6 result: Bye Week 6 ranking: 16 Lesson learned: QB decisions are open to scrutiny. The team decided against using the franchise tag on Sam Darnold , couldn't re-sign Daniel Jones, passed on Aaron Rodgers and then traded for Sam Howell . Those moves were all in service of elevating J.J. McCarthy , the No. 10 pick in 2024. It was a defensible position, considering the value of McCarthy's rookie contract, but McCarthy produced the NFL's second-worst QBR in the first two weeks and has since been sidelined by a high right ankle sprain . Meanwhile, Jones and Darnold rank first and third, respectively, in QBR. Rodgers beat them with the Steelers in Week 4 , and Carson Wentz has started three games after replacing Howell just before the start of the season. -- Kevin Seifert Week 6 result: Beat the Commanders 25-24 Week 6 ranking: 20 Lesson learned: Chicago is learning how to win close games. A year ago, the Bears weren't equipped to pull off consecutive come-from-behind wins the way they did to beat the Raiders and Commanders. Chicago's identical 25-24 victories in Week 4 and Week 6 came down to special teams plays in the game's final moments, with Josh Blackwell blocking a field goal against the Raiders and Jake Moody booting a 38-yard game winner against the Commanders -- the day he was elevated from the practice squad. Entering Week 6, the Bears had lost 28 straight games when trailing by eight or more points in the fourth quarter. On Monday night, Chicago flipped the script on the idea that it couldn't end up on the winning end of tight games. ""I feel like we're trending up,"" safety Jaquan Brisker said. ""In the past, we might have gave up, but guys stayed true. Guys never gave up."" -- Courtney Cronin Week 6 result: Bye Week 6 ranking: 18 Lesson learned: The Texans have a premier defense. They have the No. 1 scoring defense -- allowing 12.2 points per game -- and it's not as if they've played offensive bottom-feeders. Houston earned that ranking after playing the Buccaneers (sixth in points per game), Rams (16th) and Jaguars (17th). Those teams are a combined 13-5 on the season, so the Texans have faced respectable competition en route to their No. 1 status. They are also third best in the league in pass rush win rate (47.1%), behind the Steelers and Browns. -- DJ Bien-Aime Week 6 result: Beat the Cowboys 3 0-27 Week 6 ranking: 24 Lesson learned: The Panthers can win by dominating the ground game A big reason the Panthers put up historically bad numbers against the run last season was because they lost Derrick Brown to a season-ending knee injury in Week 1. His presence, along with free agent additions to the front seven, has been a big reason Carolina allowed only 50 rushing yards in the past two games combined. As Coach Dave Canales has said repeatedly, everyone up front thrives off Brown. Meanwhile, Carolina's rushing offense has thrived since moving Rico Dowdle into the lead role. He's the second player with at least 200 scrimmage yards in each of his first two starts with a franchise since the 1970 merger, joining Billy Sims in 1980 with the Lions, per ESPN Research. -- David Newton play 1:17 Orlovsky impressed by Panthers' win over Cowboys Dan Orlovsky talks to Pat McAfee about the Panthers' dominant O-line performance against the Cowboys. Week 6 result: Lost to the Panthers 30-27 Week 6 ranking: 21 Lesson learned: There are no answers on defense. The Cowboys have given up 21 pass plays of 20-plus yards and 24 runs of 10-plus yards this season. They have been lit up by quarterbacks Russell Wilson , Caleb Williams and Bryce Young . They don't affect the quarterback (11 sacks). They can't take the ball away enough (four turnovers). They can't stop teams on third down with teams converting 53% of the time. The Cowboys are last in yards (411.7) and passing yards (269.5); they are 31st in points per game (30.7). -- Todd Archer Week 6 result: Lost to the Colts 31-27 Week 6 ranking: 23 Lesson learned: The Cardinals can't close out games. Arizona lost its first three games on walk-off field goals, becoming the first team since the 1970 merger to do so, per ESPN Research. The Cardinals' efforts to come back Sunday in Indianapolis stalled at the 9-yard line with under a minute left in the fourth quarter. Arizona can't close out games when it's ahead or when it's trailing. And while it has been a costly pain point this season, it has also been a point of emphasis as something to improve. -- Josh Weinfuss Week 6 result: Lost to the Rams 17-3 Week 6 ranking: 22 Lesson learned: The Ravens can't win without Lamar Jackson . Baltimore signed Cooper Rush to a two-year, $6.2 million deal (including $4 million guaranteed) with the hope he could keep the Ravens in contention if Jackson suffered a short-term injury. But Baltimore is 0-2 and has produced a total of 13 points without Jackson ( hamstring injury ) this season. Rush, who went 9-5 as a fill-in quarterback in Dallas, has thrown four interceptions and no touchdowns with Baltimore. The good news for the Ravens is that coach John Harbaugh expects Jackson to return after this week's bye. -- Jamison Hensley Week 6 result: Beat the Eagles 34-17 Week 6 ranking: 30 Lesson learned: Jaxson Dart might actually be the guy. It has been only three starts , but Dart has shown signs of being a franchise quarterback. That was especially apparent as he led the Giants to upset wins over the Chargers and Eagles. Three quarterbacks have rushed for at least 50 yards in their first three starts -- Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts and now Dart. Perhaps more importantly, Dart and rookie running back Cam Skattebo have injected life into the Giants. ""Their energy is contagious,"" cornerback Cor'Dale Flott said. -- Jordan Raanan Your League, Your Rules Create a league and customize league size, scoring and rules to play in the league you want to play in. Create a league today! Week 6 result: Beat the Titans 20-10 Week 6 ranking: 29 Lesson learned: Patience will be the key to Pete Carroll's tenure in Las Vegas. When Carroll took the job , he was determined to turn the Raiders into immediate playoff contenders. However, that process might take longer than expected. The Raiders have a new quarterback ( Geno Smith ) and offensive coordinator (Chip Kelly) and are reliant on young players at key positions. And with general manager John Spytek a believer in building through the draft, Las Vegas will not turn things around overnight. -- Ryan McFadden Week 6 result: Lost to the Packers 27-18 Week 6 ranking: 25 Lesson learned: The future of the defense is murky. Coming into the season, Cincinnati hoped new defensive coordinator Al Golden could transform a unit that really struggled last season. While there have been positive moments, some of the key players aren't playing as well as needed. The Bengals have already made a major switch at middle linebacker, with rookie Barrett Carter taking over for veteran Logan Wilson , a team captain. But other players, such as cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt , have not performed well enough either. A team that spent heavily on offense needs its young defenders to provide adequate play, which could be an issue beyond this season. -- Ben Baby Week 6 result: Lost to the Patriots 25-19 Week 6 ranking: 27 Lesson learned: Scoring touchdowns will be a seasonlong problem. Tight end Taysom Hill gave the Saints a boost by scoring from the 1-yard line against the Patriots, but the past two weeks have been a collection of field goals by New Orleans, which attempted 10 (making eight) versus just two touchdowns. Failing to get in the end zone will continue to lose the Saints games, and drives have stalled for a variety of reasons: turnovers, penalties and sacks being some of them. -- Katherine Terrell Week 6 result: Lost to the Steelers 23-9 Week 6 ranking: 26 Lesson learned: The Browns' "" strategic pivot "" is coming with all the expected growing pains. Cleveland is fielding one of the NFL's youngest rosters with 14 rookies in an attempt to rebuild its foundation, a move that general manager Andrew Berry called a ""strategic pivot"" during the offseason. Between their youth and no clear answer at quarterback, the Browns have had a frustrating start that has been highlighted by the league's lowest-scoring offense (13.67 points per game) and the third-worst point differential (minus-.64). -- Daniel Oyefusi Week 6 result: Lost to the Chargers 29-27 Week 6 ranking: 28 Lesson learned: The Dolphins' defense has taken a dramatic step back from a season ago. There were plenty of reasonable concerns this offseason after Miami parted ways with four members of its 2024 starting secondary. General manager Chris Grier rebounded nicely, adding experienced starters Minkah Fitzpatrick , Jack Jones and Rasul Douglas , but the Dolphins believed a talented front seven would hold down the fort while the secondary jelled. Instead, Miami is tied for the 18th-most sacks (12) and allows a league-worst 168.5 rushing yards per game. After two consecutive top-10 finishes in yards allowed per game, the Dolphins rank 30th in the same category this season. It might not change much if the team decides to trade away players at the deadline. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques play 1:22 Why Stephen A. puts Dolphins' woes on McDaniel, not Tua Stephen A. Smith explains why Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel needs to be fired after Tua Tagovailoa expressed his frustrations. Week 6 result: Lost to the Raiders 20-10 Week 6 ranking: 31 Lesson learned: This team is actually worse than we thought it was. It's hard to imagine the Titans being worse than last season after selecting QB Cam Ward with the No. 1 pick. But here we are. The Titans' offense has scored only 83 points, which is the least by a Titans/Oilers team through six games since 1985, per ESPN Research. The Titans' loss to the Raiders was their fourth by 10-plus points this season, the most in the NFL. No one expected Tennessee to compete for a division title. But there were supposed to be signs of growth in Year 2 under Brian Callahan, who was fired Monday . Ward is the fourth consecutive quarterback drafted No. 1 to see his coach dismissed during his rookie season. -- Turron Davenport Week 6 result: Lost to the Broncos 13-11 Week 6 ranking: 32 Lesson learned: Aaron Glenn isn't a quick-fix coach. No one expected the Jets to be a playoff team in Glenn's first season, but they weren't expected to be 0-6. Compared with last season (5-12), the Jets have regressed on both sides of the ball, finding new ways to lose every week. Glenn talked tough at the outset, promising to exorcise past demons, but his lack of head coaching experience is apparent at times. He walked into a herculean challenge. If he doesn't find some wins soon, his locker room could start to fracture. Welcome to the Jets. -- Rich Cimini",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46521411/nfl-week-7-power-rankings-poll-32-teams-2025-biggest-lessons,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fnfl_power6_cr_16x9.jpg,,eae2714618fdf760de0b0751850f2983920bb237
ee087b47ee91,NBA,,"Nine-time NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook has agreed on a deal to sign with the Sacramento Kings , agent Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports Management told ESPN on Wednesday. Westbrook and the Kings maintained communication all offseason as the 2017 NBA MVP remained patient in free agency and now lands a deal for his 18th season. Westbrook has bonds with Domantas Sabonis , DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine , history alongside Dennis Schroder in the backcourt and with assistant general manager BJ Armstrong on the player representation side, and shared respect for general manager Scott Perry and coach Doug Christie. Westbrook is expected to officially join the team later this week on a one-year, $3.6 million veteran's minimum deal, sources said. Westbrook gives Sacramento some much-needed backcourt depth as a point guard able to play as a starter or reserve. The Kings could use his bench presence after ranking 28th in bench points per game and 29th in bench assists per game last season. In his first season as Kings general manager, Perry has made clear that the franchise wants a team culture of high motor and high effort -- attributes that Westbrook has displayed over his NBA career. In 75 games and 36 starts for the Denver Nuggets last season, Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.4 steals while shooting 44.9% from the field. Westbrook shot 52% on 2-pointers in 2024-25, the best in a season in his career. Westbrook has come off the bench in 145 of his 216 games played over the past three seasons while finishing in the top 10 in Sixth Man of the Year voting in each season. Westbrook, who turns 37 in November, has the most triple-doubles in NBA history (203) and is one of two players ever to play in the league to post 25,000 points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists, along with LeBron James . Westbrook has 26,205 career points and needs another 506 to surpass Oscar Robertson as the highest-scoring point guard in NBA history. Westbrook also ranks eighth in career assists and needs 75 assists to become the eighth player with 10,000 career assists in league history. Westbrook, who left the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2018-19 as a franchise legend, is now on his seventh team ( Houston Rockets , Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , LA Clippers , Nuggets and Kings).",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46604692/russell-westbrook-agrees-join-kings-18th-nba-season,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0425%2Fr1483703_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,9ef91be19d34a4f51c983f9349e127581716423e
2185b83ebd26,Jets' Aaron Glenn reiterates he doesn't want Breece Hall traded,,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- New York Jets running back Breece Hall has been the subject of on-and-off trade rumors for six months. They're on again, with the Nov. 4 trading deadline fast approaching. On Wednesday, coach Aaron Glenn dismissed the speculation, reiterating what he said in the preseason: They have no plans to trade Hall. ""They're rumors,"" Glenn said. ""I still feel the same way."" Hall told reporters last Friday in London that he doesn't want to be traded, but then the Jets fell to 0-6 with an ugly offensive performance in a 13-11 loss to the Denver Broncos . One day after the game, he stirred the speculation with a cryptic Instagram post. ""They want me to lay down but I got sum to stand for... #Free20,"" he wrote in the post . Does he want to be free of the Jets, the NFL's only winless team? Does he want a bigger role in the offense? He already is a major contributor. He has 560 yards from scrimmage, 10th in the NFL. The trade rumors started around the draft, when Glenn indicated his plan to use a three-back system -- Hall, Braelon Allen and Isaiah Davis . From 2022 to 2024, Hall was the clear-cut No. 1 back. That, coupled with the fact that the Jets let Hall go into his last year of his rookie contract without an extension, fueled the speculation. Before the season, Hall said he didn't expect an extension because ""I'm not their guy"" -- meaning he wasn't drafted by first-year general manager Darren Mougey. Neither were cornerback Sauce Gardner and wide receiver Garrett Wilson , but they received extensions before training camp. All three players were part of the Jets' 2022 draft class. Allen's knee injury in Week 4 -- he is expected to be out until at least December -- complicates the matter. If they were to trade Hall, they'd be left with the relatively unproven Davis as their top back. Despite the preseason chatter about a reduced role, Hall has remained a vital cog on offense. In fact, he's averaging a career-high 68.3 rushing yards per game -- 410 yards and 4.7 per rush. He also has 17 receptions for 150 yards, although he's not as involved in the passing game as anticipated. He wasn't targeted once against the Broncos, the first time in his career that he played a complete game with no pass targets. It happened in an injury-shortened game in 2022, the year he tore his ACL. ""I'm in my fourth year, and I don't have a lot of time left to prove what I can do and who I want to be in this league,"" Hall said after the Week 5 loss to the Dallas Cowboys , sounding as if the losing was taking its toll. A few days later, Hall reversed field, saying, ""I want to be here. I love being a New York Jet."" It was Glenn who shut down the rumors in August. At the time, he was explaining his rationale for using three running backs instead of leaning on one. ""That does not mean that I'm trading Breece. OK? [It] does not! So I'm going to say that right now,"" Glenn said at the time. Nothing has changed, he said Wednesday.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46605462/jets-aaron-glenn-reiterates-want-breece-hall-traded,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560591_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,78a73d64306ab53bd656ffb9f1d73e7af13c62e6
1c7f91045296,Jags eye bigger offensive role for Travis Hunter to exploit speed,,"It looks like Travis Hunter is going to have a bigger role on offense for the Jacksonville Jaguars starting Sunday at London's Wembley Stadium. Jaguars coach Liam Coen said Wednesday that they are making it a priority to design and call more plays in which Hunter is the No. 1 option to take advantage of his speed and athleticism. ""Scheming him open is part of it, No. 1,"" Coen said from The Grove resort, where the team is staying and practicing this week in London. ""Our job as an offensive staff [is] to make sure we're putting him in the progression and putting him in the position to be No. 1 [option] a little bit more often in some ways. ""And then when he is the primary [option], we've got to throw and catch. We've got to make sure that we identify it, find him, be able to be at the right spot at the right time. So I think it's a combination of a lot of those things that ultimately can all be controlled."" Hunter had four catches for 15 yards, including a 14-yard catch-and-run, on seven targets in Sunday's loss to the Seattle Seahawks . That was his lowest yardage total of the season (previous low was 21 yards in Week 3 against the Texans ). The need to make Hunter more of a priority in the passing game is related to wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. 's struggles. Thomas is the Jaguars' leading receiver (24 catches for 334 yards) but had a third-down drop and another pass in which it appeared he hesitated in the middle of the field against the Seahawks. Thomas had three drops in Jacksonville's Week 2 loss to Cincinnati , including one on fourth down that would have given the Jaguars a first-and-goal inside the Bengals' 10-yard line late in the fourth quarter. Coach Liam Coen said the Jaguars will make it a priority to design and call more plays with Travis Hunter as the No. 1 option on offense to take advantage of his speed. Chris Leduc/Icon Sportswire The Jaguars also are without tight end Brenton Strange (20 catches for 204 yards), who was placed on injured reserve after injuring his hip in Week 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs . He was the team's leading receiver at the time of his injury. ""It is very important for me to be patient,"" said Hunter, who has 20 catches for 197 yards. ""Just got to let the game come to me. Coach is trying to dial up a couple things for me, and I've just got to continue to just work and just having the guys trust me because I'm doing my job every time."" Coen said getting Hunter more involved offensively -- he hasn't had more than six catches in a game, which he did in Week 1 -- doesn't mean forcing the ball to him. ""We can't always say the ball's going to get thrown to one person based on any play,"" Coen said. ""Down the field, there's elements to that, especially when you're not getting a lot of one-on-one man coverage. ... That's got to be a little bit predicated on what we're seeing but also making sure we're doing our jobs as coaches. And he's doing his job to be in the right spot at the right time, and Trevor [Lawrence] is able to deliver it because it's great protection.

ae09cf930476,NCAAF,,"The Big 12 fined Kansas and Texas Tech $25,000 each on Wednesday for the fallout of a dispute over fan behavior in the Red Raiders' 42-17 win in Lubbock on Saturday. Jayhawks coach Lance Leipold also apologized for statements he made after the game. Texas Tech was twice penalized during the game for fans throwing tortillas onto the field, an old tradition that was banned by the Big 12 before the season. The rowdy scene at Jones AT&T Stadium led to a postgame dust-up between Leipold and Red Raiders coach Joey McGuire with Leipold chastising McGuire for the fans' behavior. In postgame video, McGuire can be seen telling Leipold, ""Coach, I can't do anything about it. You want me to do something [expletive] about it?"" In postgame comments, Leipold complained that the officials should have done more to stop the fans from throwing things, but said the league handled it poorly and alleged that officials were forced to pick up a flag. He also also claimed a fan threw a knife at a Kansas staffer. ""A pocket knife was thrown and hit one of our staff members,"" Leipold said after the game. ""It's ridiculous. It's supposed to be for safety and things like that, and it's a culture that's been accepted to a point, and it hasn't changed. Eventually, somebody's going to be seriously hurt, unfortunately."" Texas Tech submitted footage to the league this week that proved the claim to be inaccurate. The Big 12 said Tech's fine was for the objects thrown onto the playing surface, while Kansas' was for disparaging comments about the conference and ""an inaccurate statement regarding a pocketknife by head coach Lance Leipold."" ""After a formal review, Texas Tech did not take sufficient steps to prevent and deter the repeated throwing of objects onto the field and team bench areas,"" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said. ""Coach Leipold's comments questioned the integrity and professionalism of both the Conference and a member institution."" Kansas issued a statement from that expressed its regret for the ""emotionally charged"" reaction by Leipold. ""I appreciate the Big 12 Conference's thorough review of events that took place during our game last Saturday at Texas Tech. I accept their findings and ultimate ruling,"" Leipold said in a statement. ""I had an emotional reaction in the aftermath of the game and acknowledge that I need to be better. We are excited to move forward and finish our season strong."" The Jayhawks' athletic director, Travis Goff, said Leipold should have handled the situation differently. ""Coach Leipold should not have addressed the matter publicly,"" he said. ""This should have been handled privately with the conference and Texas Tech and not in the heat of the moment when we did not have all the facts. "" Big 12 athletic directors voted in August to solidify the league's policy about objects thrown onto the field. Teams would get warnings for the first two violations, followed by 15-yard penalties afterward. Texas Tech's Kirby Hocutt was the lone dissenter in the 15-1 vote; Red Raiders fans have been tossing tortillas from the stands since the 1990s. But Tech coach Joey McGuire has been frustrated that fans are continuing to cause issues for his team. Tech has tried to start a new tradition of only throwing tortillas during the opening kickoff. ""We've got a new rule in this league and we know the rule and we didn't follow it and we got penalized tonight with two 15-yard penalties,"" McGuire said Saturday night of the postgame scene with Leipold. ""He was frustrated on that side, and we've got to be better. We've got to do a better job as a whole, all of us, and we will."" He implored Red Raiders fans to follow the rules, questioning how they could want to cost their team penalty yards. ""If you came to the game and you love this team and you're passionate about this team but yet you're going to throw another tortilla?"" McGuire said. ""And you know it's against the rules?""",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46605847/big-12-fines-kansas-texas-tech-25k-fan-behavior-dispute,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560610_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,cf4c42dfab89b19beff6d5fce42ee5927dfe1ab0
1484c6c3bb0a,Lawsuit seeks to allow top high school WR to profit from NIL,,"Jamier Brown , the country's top wide receiver in the class of 2027, is the centerpiece of a lawsuit filed in state court in Ohio that seeks to allow him to benefit from his name, image and likeness while in high school -- a move that may trigger the state athletic association to change its rules. The complaint names the Ohio High School Athletic Association, which prohibits its athletes from profiting off their NIL. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in the court of common pleas in Franklin County. Brown, who is committed to play at Ohio State , has earning power of more than $100,000 per year, according to the complaint. The lawsuit was filed by Brown's mother, Jasmine, in her role as the ""parent or guardian"" of Brown. ""OHSAA's blanket ban not only singles out Ohio's high school student athletes for unequal treatment, but it also unlawfully suppresses their economic liberties, freedom of expression, and restrains competition in the NIL marketplace,"" the complaint states. The lawsuit doesn't offer a specific amount above $100,000 that Brown could make if he could profit off his NIL. But it does mention trading card deals as an example of a monetary stream available to Brown as well as ""significant non-monetary benefits"" that include enhanced reputation and networking connections. ""What pushed me was knowing that allowing NIL for high school athletes in Ohio could be a game changer for a lot of kids like me,"" Brown told ESPN. ""My family is getting by, but being able to use NIL would take some weight off my mom and me by helping cover things like tutoring, training and travel, which help me grow as both a student and a football player."" Jamier Brown, the top wide receiver in the class of 2027, is the centerpiece of an NIL lawsuit filed against the Ohio High School Athletic Association. UC Report OHSAA Director of Media Relations Tim Stried told ESPN that the association has been preparing schools that a vote on NIL would be coming soon, one way or another. ""We've been anticipating something like this will happen,"" Stried told ESPN. ""Typically, when this type of legal action happens, it triggers an emergency vote by our schools. Later today or tomorrow, we'll determine if we'll do an emergency vote and what the timeframe of the vote will be."" Brown is a 5-foot-11, 185-pound wide receiver who has been committed to Ohio State since November 2024. He plays at Wayne High School in Huber Heights, Ohio. He is ESPN's No. 2-ranked prospect in the class of 2027, the latest in the assembly line of talented wide receivers recruited to Ohio State by offensive coordinator Brian Hartline. Brown told ESPN he wants athletes in Ohio to have opportunities similar to those of high school athletes elsewhere and to not have to leave the state to get them. The lawsuit states that Ohio is one of six states that doesn't allow high school athletes to profit off their NIL. ""It's about creating fairness and giving us the chance to use our name, image and likeness in positive ways while staying focused on school,"" Brown told ESPN. ""If this helps make things a little easier for the next group coming up, then it's worth it."" The complaint calls the OHSAA rules ""outdated and unlawful,"" noting that the state has enacted laws to allow college athletes to benefit from their NIL. The lawsuit says talented athletes in Ohio are incentivized to leave for neighboring states such as West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. ""I think Jamier's family is similar to a lot of families that recognize that there are significant opportunities to elevate their name, image and likeness,"" said Luke Fedlam, Brown's attorney with Amundsen Davis in Columbus. ""He'd be able to help his family while still focusing on school and competing and playing sports in high school at the highest level."" Brown said his pride in being from Ohio was part of his motivation for bringing the lawsuit. ""Being able to compete where you're from matters,"" he said. ""Ohio is home, and I take pride in that, so my focus is staying here and doing my part to help make things better.""",https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/46602078/lawsuit-seeks-allow-top-high-school-wr-profit-nil,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0525%2Fr1498189_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,33a8fdeae4e239fe654cf8a62191b0e62d374f62
4172857be618,NHL players may play on untested ice at Milan-Cortina Olympics,,"Oct 15, 2025, 12:13 PM ET ROME -- Forget about thin ice. For now, there's no ice. With NHL players preparing to return to the Olympics for the first time in more than a decade, construction on the main hockey arena for the Milan-Cortina Games is going down to the wire. Local organizers told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the main test event for the 16,000-seat Santagiulia arena that was scheduled for December has been moved to a smaller arena and that no new test event has been scheduled. The issue raises the prospect that there might not be a game held in the main arena until the puck is dropped for the women's preliminary round competition at the Olympics on Feb. 5 -- one day before the opening ceremony. ""It's going to be very close to the start of the Games, the timeline is very tight, but we knew that,"" Milan-Cortina local organizing committee CEO Andrea Varnier said recently. The event that was supposed to test the Santagiulia ice was part of the under-20 world championship from Dec. 8-14. That event has been moved to the Rho Fiera hockey venue, which is being set up inside a giant convention center on Milan's outskirts and will host secondary matches during the Olympics. Usually, new Olympic venues are tested at least the year before hosting medal events. With a large hockey arena, it's not just about the ice and making sure that the playing surface is ready and safe. It's also about testing concession stands, bathrooms and everything else inside a new modern arena. The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics is experiencing construction delays, according to local organizers. AP Photo/Luca Bruno The Santagiulia venue, which is being built by a private company, is slated to become Italy's largest indoor arena. After the Olympics, it's being eyed as a possible future host of the ATP Finals tennis event. Despite the delays and concerns, high-priced tickets are already being sold for events at the Santagiulia arena. Seats for the men's gold medal game on Feb. 22 -- the closing day of the Games -- are going for as much as 1,400 euros (more than $1,600). That's more than for any other sports event at the Milan-Cortina Games. Only tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies cost more. The return of NHL players at the Olympics was announced in February, with the world's top hockey league allowing its players to participate in the Winter Games for the first time since 2014 in Sochi. The men's Olympic hockey tournament is scheduled to run from Feb. 11-22. The women's tournament runs from Feb. 5-19.",https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/46604822/nhl-players-play-untested-ice-milan-cortina-olympics,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560568_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,126243c884ccea8fe919cd4883aa9f74c161ca79
794273ce962c,Steven Pearl says Auburn planned for Bruce Pearl retirement,,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Bruce Pearl's retirement last month was a surprise to his Auburn team and even his son Steven, who succeeded his father as the Tigers' new head coach. But Pearl's announcement was not a shock to everyone. Steven Pearl said he didn't officially know about his father's decision until the day before the Tigers' first practice. Bruce Pearl, however, had told Auburn athletic director John Cohen years ago that he had been thinking about retirement. ""Three years ago, [my father] told him, like, 'Listen, I don't know how much longer I'm going to do this,'"" Steven said Wednesday at SEC media day. ""So [Cohen] has been actively, in his mind, being prepared for this for three years now and going through all the different options of, 'Do I bring in an outside coaching staff? Do I bring in a big-name guy or watch this grow? Does the staff grow as a unit and stay together and not go chasing other assistant jobs, not go chasing other coaching jobs?' And he ultimately felt like the staff had earned the right and the opportunity to continue to move this thing forward."" Bruce Pearl's retirement followed months of speculation that he would leave coaching to pursue Alabama's open U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated by Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn football coach who is now running for governor of the state. Steven said the past three weeks have been, as expected, a frenzy. But he also said his time with his father -- he played for his father at Tennessee and spent more than a decade as his assistant -- helped prepare him for the role at Auburn, which is ranked 20th in the Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll. ""As far as when it hit me, it didn't hit me until I showed up at the gym and [my father] was filming his goodbye video and [Cohen] pulled me aside and he was like, 'Hey, you're the guy,'"" Steven said. ""So then I was like, 'All right, here we go. Let's go.' It all happened really fast, but I'm ready because I spent 38 years watching [my father] do this."" Steven said the continuity of the staff and the stability of his team has eased his transition. His staff has a combined 40 years of coaching experience at Auburn under Bruce, who is now an ambassador for the university. Every player decided to stay despite having a 30-day window to enter the portal and transfer, according to NCAA rules on coaching changes. Tahaad Pettiford , a star for a Tigers team that reached the Final Four for the second time in team history last season, said the players found out about Bruce Pearl's decision when they all received a text message to return to the gym the day of the announcement. Pettiford said he never once considered transferring after Steven was announced as head coach. But Pettiford is also the only remaining player on the roster who played for Auburn in the team's loss to Florida in the Final Four. ""It's definitely something new for me coming into this with 10 new guys,"" he said. ""It's definitely different from being the youngest guy on the team last year to being one of the older guys on this year's team. ""I'm just trying to give them the stuff that I learned last year and trying to pass that down to the new guys, especially some of the freshmen, and trying to give them the blueprint of what we did last year and how we were successful.""",https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/46605083/steven-pearl-says-auburn-planned-bruce-pearl-retirement,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560567_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,4ba4827a3a57f6e8e479cd511201bdb7d89aa9b5
41dd60e02d27,College football Bottom 10 after Week 7: James Franklin's last act,,"Oct 15, 2025, 07:00 AM ET Inspirational thought of the week: ""Are you surprised?"" ""Surprised, Eddie? If I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet, I wouldn't be more surprised than I am right now."" -- Clark Griswold and Cousin Eddie, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" Here at Bottom 10 Headquarters, located behind the storage trailers that hold all of the makeup and rubber noses required to attempt to make Glen Powell look even remotely unattractive in ""Chad Powers,"" we, like Chad's South Georgia Catfish teammates and coaching staff, sometimes struggle with recognizing who and what is actually standing before us. Then, when they reveal their true identities, which we're assuming Chad will do at some point, we are left standing with our jaws on the floor and face in our hands like Hugh Freeze during another replay review. See: Last week's much-anticipated Pillow Fight of the Week of the Year Mega Bowl between what were then the Bottom 10 third-ranked UMess Minuetmen and the fourth-ranked State of Kent. And we weren't alone in our anticipation of a close game. The wiseguys in the desert with their calculators next to the shrimp buffet had Kent as a 1.5-point favorite, and our ESPN Analytics team's Ouija board Win Probability Index believed UMass had a 43.9% chance to emerge victorious. Final score: Kent State 42, UMass 6. See, Part 2: Penn State, which just three weekends ago came within a couple of knuckles of beating Oregon in overtime, was facing its second consecutive Bottom 10 contender, Northworstern, having lost to the then-ucLa Boo'ins the week before. And the Nittany Lions lost again, their third straight defeat, then fired James Franklin, who had coached them to within three points of playing for the national title just 10 months ago. The point is that no one knows what the hell we are talking about. But talking about it is so much fun. Well, for us it is so much fun. In Amherst, Massachusetts, and State College, Pennsylvania, they are looking out the window at the silent majesty of a winter's morn and a guy in his bathrobe, emptying a chemical toilet into their sewer. With apologies to former North Texas tight end Robert Griswold, former Northwestern tight end Bob Griswold, Cousin Eddie George and Steve Harvey, here are the post-Week 7 Bottom 10 rankings. The Minuetmen are currently ranked 130th in points against, 135th in rushing yards and 136th in points for. They are also ranked 111th in passing yards. Do you think those other units look at the passing guys and say, ""Stop making the rest of us look bad""? The Beavers traveled to North Carolina and lost to Appalachian State, then hosted and lost to another North Carolina team in Wake Forest, then fired head coach Trent Bray, who wasn't even the biggest Coach Trent to lose his job this week ... The good news for the Bearkats is they kame the klosest to akkcomplishing viktory as they have all season before sukkumbing to Jacksonville State Not Jacksonville City 29-27. Up next on the kalendar is a Konference USA Pillow Fight of the Week. Against whom do they klash? Keep scrolling ... Yep, it's the Minors, who will travel to Sam Houston State on Wednesday night. Hopefully someone reminds them that Sam Houston State isn't actually in Houston; it's an hour north in Huntsville. Hopefully someone reminds them that it's not the Huntsville in Alabama, but the one in Texas, one town over from Arizona, which hopefully someone reminds them is the Arizona town in Texas, not the state of Arizona. Sources tell Bottom 10 JortsCenter that when James Franklin drove home from the office with his box of stuff, he was greeted in the driveway by Charlie Weis and Bobby Bonilla, who gave him a signed copy of ""How To Make a Mattress From Your Pile of Money"" by Scrooge McDuck. The Woof Pack started the year with a loss to Penn State back when Happy Valley was still happy, and followed that with a win over Sacramento State. The rest of the year has been like another former Reno-based late-night show, HBO's ""Cathouse."" And just like that brothel reality program, we never admit that we've watched, but secretly we can't look away. If you were wondering when MTSU and Novada might play in their own version of the Pillow Fight of the Week, we have bad news. It already happened. The Blew Raiders scored two TDs in the final six minutes to win 14-13 back in Week 3. When Trent Dilfer was fired by UAB, he went down to the locker room to tear a bunch of stuff up, but after 2½ seasons of him exploding like the red Anger guy from ""Inside Out,"" there was nothing left to break. The Pillow Fight of the Week, Y'all Edition, is the college football equivalent of that pointing Spider-Man meme, as Georgia State Not Southern travels to Georgia Southern Not State, which is 2-4. The winner retains exclusive rights to ""GSU"" for the next year. The loser has to change all its logos to ""GUS."" For those of you -- and we are talking to ourselves here -- who are still bummed about the lack of substance in the UMass-Kent State game, picture in your mind Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda sitting on a Dagobah log as Luke Skywalker flies away to get his butt whipped by Darth Vader. ""That boy was our last hope."" ""No ... there is another."" These Other Huskies travel to UMass on Nov. 12 ... and host Kent State over Thanksgiving weekend.

5f0466dd14ea,2026 NFL mock draft: Reid's predictions on first-round picks,,"The 2025 college football season has fully entered conference play, and we're exactly one-third of the way through the 2025 NFL season . That means it's a perfect time to take a look at the 2026 NFL draft and forecast the first 32 picks. Keep in mind that there's plenty of time between now and the start of the draft on April 23 in Pittsburgh. Beyond multiple months of football still ahead, some players could decide to head back to school, while others could surprisingly declare early. We also have predraft events such as all-star games and the combine, which will shake up boards . And every team's needs will continue evolving as they move toward the upcoming offseason. Our draft order for this mock draft is based on the standings as of today. Three teams have multiple picks: the Rams (from the Falcons), the Browns (from the Jaguars) and the Cowboys (from the Packers). Here are my projections for all 32 first-round picks in 2026, starting with the Jets looking for another quarterback. (Underclassmen are noted with an asterisk.) See more: QB Hot Board | Position rankings Fernando Mendoza , QB, Indiana* The Jets are 0-6, and their offense is among the NFL's worst. Justin Fields hasn't worked out to this point , and New York needs more than just a franchise quarterback. It needs a jolt of optimism. Mendoza is a decisive pocket passer who has impressed this season after transferring to Indiana from Cal , throwing 17 touchdown passes to two interceptions with a QBR of 84.2 that ranks seventh in the FBS. His ability to throw precise, on-time passes suits a Jets offense that is predicated on timing and accuracy. Rueben Bain Jr ., Edge, Miami* The Ravens' 1-5 start has been one of the NFL's biggest surprises, and a defense that has taken a massive step backward is one of the main culprits. Baltimore desperately needs someone who can generate pressure up front, and Bain has a strong argument for being the best defensive lineman in the country. He is a versatile 6-foot-3, 275-pound defender who can play multiple alignments, and his 24 pressures at edge is eighth in the FBS. His hand power and knockback strength would immediately boost a Ravens defense that needs playmakers. Where could Fernando Mendoza, Jordyn Tyson, Rueben Bain Jr. and Arvell Reese land at the draft? Illustration by ESPN Dante Moore , QB, Oregon* Moore was surging up draft boards prior to an underwhelming performance against Indiana , but he is a calm distributor with the arm strength to get the ball to all three levels of the field. His 72% completion percentage ranks ninth in the FBS. Moore has only 11 career starts, but he is primed to be near the top of a QB class filled with question marks . The Browns have plenty of questions of their own under center, as rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders haven't established themselves as long-term options. Keldric Faulk , Edge, Auburn* The Titans took care of the quarterback need in the 2025 draft by picking Cam Ward , but they still have a ton of needs around him and on the other side of the ball in 2026. Edge rusher is near the top of the list, and the 6-6, 270-pound Faulk is an NFL-ready run defender who continues to show flashes as a pass rusher. He has two sacks this season and had seven as a sophomore in 2024. Tennessee, which will be bringing in a new coach in the offseason, has to find some difference-makers. Caleb Downs , S, Ohio State* QB or no QB? That will be a constant draft-related question for the Dolphins between now and April. They could part ways with Tua Tagovailoa , similar to what the Broncos did in 2024, when Denver cut Russell Wilson and drafted Bo Nix . After all, Miami is tied for the third-most interceptions (seven). But with Mendoza and Moore off the board here, we'll take one of the top defensive players with this pick. The Dolphins desperately need secondary help, and Downs would provide a building block on the back end alongside Minkah Fitzpatrick . Arvell Reese , LB, Ohio State* Saints general manager Mickey Loomis likes to address the trenches in Round 1, especially when picking in the top 10. Reese is one of the best prospects regardless of position, and there will be debates on whether he's best suited as an edge rusher or an off-ball linebacker at the next level. The Saints need help in both areas, and Reese is a versatile game wrecker to the point where he -- not Downs -- might be the first Buckeyes player drafted. I love the idea of him in the middle of that New Orleans defense. Jordyn Tyson , WR, Arizona State* Jaxson Dart is showing signs of being the Giants' next franchise QB, so New York should help him by stocking up on playmakers. With Malik Nabers expected to recover fully from a torn right ACL in time for the 2026 season, drafting Tyson would give Dart another security blanket and a potent one-two punch at wide receiver. Tyson has 47 catches for 523 yards and seven touchdowns this season. It was tempting to go with one of the right tackles ( Spencer Fano or Francis Mauigoa ) here to fill that hole, but ultimately I decided on Tyson. Spencer Fano , OT, Utah* With Jonah Williams scheduled to become a free agent after the season, the Cardinals need to find a young, long-term solution at right tackle. Fano is a punishing run blocker who generates movement with ease. He has allowed only two pressures all season and is an extremely effective, quick-footed pass protector who can mirror edge rushers. Fano and Paris Johnson Jr . could serve as a talented pair of bookends for that Arizona line. LaNorris Sellers , QB, South Carolina* Geno Smith hasn't worked out so far in Las Vegas , as the new Raiders QB has thrown a league-high 10 interceptions and ranks 28th in QBR (38.2). Vegas could be on the hunt for another signal-caller, and the 6-3, 240-pound Sellers is intriguing. The skill set is awesome. But there are mixed opinions on Sellers, who has struggled in South Carolina's disappointing offense. He hasn't played Round 1-caliber ball in 2025, but as an NFC assistant GM told me, ""The traits will convince someone to take him early."" If that's the Raiders, they'll need to show patience. Peter Woods , DT, Clemson* The Bengals could address their offensive line here, but Woods would provide a penetrating presence in the middle of the defense, too. Cincinnati took edge rusher Shemar Stewart in the first round of the 2025 draft, and Woods could pair with him as a difference-maker on the inside as the Bengals build toward the future. Woods has only 0.5 sacks and 1.5 tackles for loss this season, but his high-end traits should translate into an impact player at the next level. Francis Mauigoa , OT/G, Miami* The Texans' offensive line issues are well-documented, and they need a talent infusion. Mauigoa is a strong, dependable protector, but there are varying opinions on where he'll play in the NFL. Some scouts think he's best suited as a guard, but others peg him as a true right tackle, where his 0.7% pressures allowed percentage ranks seventh in the FBS. Houston needs help across the front, though, so Mauigoa would provide a boost no matter where he plays. David Bailey , Edge, Texas Tech Bailey has been a force off the edge this season, and he leads the FBS with a 24.6% pressure rate to go along with 8.5 sacks, which are tied for first. He is a constant disruptor who can win with speed or power. And with Micah Parsons now in Green Bay , the Cowboys need a potent pass-rushing presence outside, which Bailey could provide. Dallas' 11 sacks are tied for 22nd in the NFL, and that defense is giving up 6.2 yards per play, which ranks 30th. Mansoor Delane , CB, LSU Delane is the best cornerback in the 2026 draft and would fit well with a Panthers secondary that allows opposing quarterbacks a QBR of 63.7, sixth-worst in the NFL. Delane has excelled since transferring from Virginia Tech ; opponents are completing just 24.0% of their passes into his coverage this season, sixth best in the FBS. He can mirror and match receivers in man coverage, and his awareness of passing concepts also makes him effective in zone coverage. Jeremiyah Love , RB, Notre Dame* The Chiefs have struggled to find a consistent playmaker in the running game, considering quarterback Patrick Mahomes is their leading rusher through six games (222 yards). That's not sustainable. Love would give Kansas City a Jahmyr Gibbs -like player with his explosiveness, burst and make-you-miss ability. Like Gibbs, Love can also provide creativity as a pass-catching option out of the backfield. play 6:00 Jeremiyah Love's Story Jeremiyah Love's success has come from truly embracing who he is. Kenyon Sadiq , TE, Oregon* A pass-catching tight end is near the top of the Commanders' needs, with Zach Ertz turning 35 next month and on an expiring contract. Sadiq would be an appealing successor, providing Jayden Daniels with versatility in the passing game and serving as a dependable run blocker. Sadiq is young -- he doesn't turn 21 until March -- but he has continued to improve in his first season as a starter. He has three TDs this season. Avieon Terrell , CB, Clemson* The Vikings have been better at cornerback than expected, with Byron Murphy Jr . and free agent hit Isaiah Rodgers standing out. But they're still lacking long-term solutions on the outside. Terrell -- the younger brother of veteran Falcons corner A.J. Terrell Jr . -- is a tough prospect with an ability to make plays on the ball. He would be a welcome addition to Brian Flores' defense. Terrell has 24 pass breakups and three interceptions over three seasons. T.J. Parker , Edge, Clemson* The Bears have struggled to generate a pass rush this season, as their team pass rush win rate of 28.2% is 30th in the NFL. They need impactful rushers off the edge, and Parker is a power-based rusher with strong hands and a good initial burst. He has also been productive, with 18.5 career sacks -- including 11 in 2024. Caleb Lomu , OT, Utah* While Warren McClendon Jr . has been serviceable at right tackle the past two weeks in place of Rob Havenstein , the Rams need a long-term blocker. Havenstein is 33, he is scheduled to be a free agent after the season, and his health is a question mark. Meanwhile, Lomu is effective in space, and his movement skills fit the Rams' zone-blocking scheme well. CJ Allen , LB, Georgia* A run-and-chase linebacker, Allen is a quick mover at the second level and fills gaps with great physicality. He has an advanced feel for reading and reacting, and he is showing improvement in pass defense. That makes him not only one of the top linebackers in this class but also a perfect fit for a Bills defense with two linebackers ( Matt Milano and Shaq Thompson ) on the other side of 30. LT Overton , DT, Alabama Lions GM Brad Holmes isn't afraid to go against the grain and take players who best fit the team's profile, even if it means reaching. Overton could help a Detroit defensive line that needs reinforcements opposite star edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson , as its 27.4% pass rush win rate as a team ranks 31st in the NFL. Overton is a scheme-versatile defender who wins with overwhelming power at the point of attack and could pair nicely with Tyleik Williams , Detroit's first-round pick in 2025, on the inside. A'Mauri Washington , DT, Oregon* A first-year starter, Washington has climbed boards during the first half of the season. He's an explosive interior presence who has the power to shock and shed against the run. His hand power also helps him penetrate the backfield as a pass rusher. With Teair Tart set to be a free agent after the season, Washington could pair well with former Oregon teammate Jamaree Caldwell , who Los Angeles took in the third round in 2025.

Makai Lemon , WR, USC* Even with the emergence of Kayshon Boutte , and free agent signing Stefon Diggs recapturing his pre-injury form, there's no such thing as too many receivers for quarterback Drake Maye , especially with Diggs turning 32 in November. Lemon is a do-it-all target who can play the slot and outside. He's highly productive (44 receptions for 682 yards and six touchdowns this season), and his body control and catch radius help him make miraculous catches look routine. Sonny Styles , LB, Ohio State Off-ball linebacker is arguably the weakest part of an imposing Broncos defense that's second in the NFL in yards (254.2) and points (15.8) allowed per game. Free agent signing Dre Greenlaw hasn't played this season because of a thigh injury , while Alex Singleton is 31 and set to become an unrestricted free agent. Styles would provide Denver with a rangy, second-level defender who shows plenty of instincts in coverage. He is capable of rushing the passer on obvious passing downs, and his wrap-up-and-finish tackling ability would make him a reliable option immediately. Jermod McCoy , CB, Tennessee* McCoy has yet to play after suffering a torn ACL while training in January. The timeline for his return is still uncertain. But McCoy picked off four passes last season before the injury, and the Rams could use help at cornerback. They've gotten by with retreads at corner such as 2023 first-round pick Emmanuel Forbes Jr ., but McCoy is a potential shutdown option on the outside once he returns to full health, something they haven't had since Jalen Ramsey in 2022. Carnell Tate , WR, Ohio State* This team-prospect pairing makes too much sense. Tate is one of the most polished receiver prospects in this class, with dependable hands and the route-running ability of an experienced NFL veteran. His type of play can translate right away into the Browns' offense, which could use more pass catchers alongside Jerry Jeudy . Tate is the next man up in the Ohio State receiver pipeline to the NFL, and he'd be a good fit with Dante Moore, whom we slotted to Cleveland at No. 3.

Sign Up Now Kadyn Proctor , OT, Alabama* There are mixed opinions on Proctor. He came into the season with Round 1 hype but had a disastrous start to the campaign against Florida State . His play has rebounded, but some scouts are still hesitant to buy into the early-round hype surrounding the 6-7, 366-pound blocker. If he continues to play as well as he has over the past few weeks and shows consistency, I think he could go on Day 1. The 49ers have a long-term need at offensive tackle with Trent Williams turning 38 next summer, so Proctor makes a lot of sense. Joshua Josephs , Edge, Tennessee The Eagles love drafting edge rushers early, and Josephs is one of the best pressure generators in the country. His 18.4% pressure rate ranks 10th among all edge rushers in the FBS, and he already has a career-high four sacks. He's capable of operating in a three-point stance or as a stand-up outside linebacker, using the pop in his hands while mixing and matching his moves to win pass rushes. Free agent signee Azeez Ojulari has been active for only two games this season, so Philadelphia could use some edge help to aid Nolan Smith Jr . and Jalyx Hunt . Anthony Hill Jr ., LB, Texas* Hill is a versatile playmaker who is capable of playing the edge along with the second level, where the Seahawks have lacked consistency this season. Even though Hill has zero sacks in 2025, he combined for 13 sacks in his first two college seasons. Off-ball linebacker Drake Thomas will be a restricted free agent in 2026, while edge Boye Mafe is an unrestricted free agent. Hill has the physical profile that coach Mike Macdonald covets and can be used in a variety of spots in Seattle's scheme. Caleb Banks , DT, Florida Banks was viewed as a potential top-15 pick entering the season, but he suffered a foot injury in the preseason that has limited him to one game after he reaggravated it , requiring surgical repair. Banks had 4.5 sacks in 2024 and would represent great value for the Cowboys, who are rebuilding a defense that is last in the NFL in yards allowed per game (411.7) and 31st in points allowed per game (30.7). Ty Simpson , QB, Alabama* It's essential for the Steelers to find the heir apparent under center to soon-to-be 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers , and I think Simpson has been the most impressive of the draft-eligible quarterbacks. Despite the need, Pittsburgh waited until Round 6 to pick a QB this past April ( Will Howard ). It can't wait that long again. Like Moore, Simpson is an inexperienced starter (all six career starts have come this season). It's not certain that Simpson will declare for the 2026 draft, but league evaluators have taken notice of his impressive stretches this season. He has thrown 16 TD passes and just one interception this season. play 0:31 Horton's 16-yard TD catch puts Alabama on top Ty Simpson connects with Isaiah Horton for a 16-yard touchdown pass to give Alabama the lead. Damon Wilson II , Edge, Missouri* Wilson has shined since transferring from Georgia in the offseason, as his 19.8% edge pressure percentage is sixth best in the FBS. Wilson is tied for 10th in the country with 5.5 sacks after a two-sack performance this past weekend against Alabama . He has surged near the top of a deep edge class, and with Kwity Paye set to be an unrestricted free agent after the season, Wilson could be a nice fit in Indianapolis. Cashius Howell , Edge, Texas A&M I'm higher on Howell than most, but his tape is awesome. The upfield burst, bend and closing speed he has shown are Round 1-worthy traits. After waiting his turn behind Nic Scourton and Shemar Stewart -- who both went in the opening two rounds this April -- Howell has flourished with eight sacks in six games. If his performance stays at this pace, expect him to keep climbing up draft boards. Haason Reddick is on a one-year deal, and Yaya Diaby 's contract is up after 2026, and Tampa Bay needs depth on the edge.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2026/story/_/id/46583887/2026-nfl-mock-draft-first-round-predictions-32-picks-jordan-reid,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fnfl_jordan%2Dreid%2Dmock%2Ddraft_16x9.jpg,,4d97b87927bdc2803cc71d8ad7e2b84253a0bafb
8471063776c2,The legacy and legality of the Bush Push 20 years later,,"ON THE SIDELINE at Notre Dame Stadium, USC coach Pete Carroll frantically waved for quarterback Matt Leinart to spike the ball. The Trojans trailed 31-28, inches from the goal line with seven seconds left. ""[Leinart] was to look back at [offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian] on the sidelines, and if we wanted to sneak it, we could sneak it,"" Carroll said this week. ""And he had to point at him. So, we tell him to sneak it. So, he points at the line, and he looks at the line of scrimmage, and he goes, 'There's no way, they're all jammed up.' And he looks back at us, and Reggie [Bush] yelled something at him, 'Go for it. Go for it.'"" Moments earlier, Leinart had fumbled out of bounds inside the 1. The clock mistakenly ran out, and NBC's Tom Hammond declared, ""Notre Dame has won,"" as Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis raised his arms and fans stormed the field. When play resumed, the Trojans would have one last chance to extend their winning streak to 28 games. Leinart sneaked left from under center, but he was bounced backward into a half spin and into the path of Bush, who famously shoved him across for the winning score. ""It was about as sweet a finish as you could have in a great situation to keep the streak alive and all that, too,"" Carroll said. Twenty years ago, the ""Bush Push"" would become one of the most unforgettable moments in college football history -- and one of its most controversial. In the box score, it was the touchdown that preserved USC's dynasty and allowed for the Rose Bowl matchup with Texas that became an all-time classic. In the rulebook, though, it was illegal. Except, it was almost never called. In fact, the rule had become a running joke among officials. ""You were teased if you made the call,"" said former NCAA official and current ESPN analyst Matt Austin. ""It was such a rare occurrence."" In the years that followed, an obscure rule became a flashpoint. It was debated, tweaked and, eventually, led to strategic evolution. THE ""HELPING THE Ball Carrier"" rule had been part of the NCAA rulebook for decades. Its language was virtually identical in every edition dating back to at least 1950. ""No [teammate] shall grasp, pull, push, lift or charge into him to assist him in forward progress."" The idea is believed to have originated as a way to differentiate football from rugby. Teammates could block defenders, but once the ball carrier was engaged, the play was meant to be his alone. Anything more -- a shove, a tug, a lift -- was considered an unfair advantage. It was almost impossible to enforce in short-yardage piles, where pushes and blocks blur together, especially near the goal line. Steve Shaw remembers that problem well. Now the NCAA's national coordinator of officials, Shaw spent more than two decades on the field, and he has seen just about everything. But in the 2000 season, his crew made a rare, yet memorable call. It happened during a Middle Tennessee - UConn game. Late in the contest, a Middle Tennessee lineman reached out and grabbed his running back, helping drag him toward the end zone. Shaw's line judge, Mike Taylor, threw the flag. ""At the end of the year, there's a report listing every penalty called nationally,"" Shaw said. ""Under aiding the runner, there was one -- and it was ours. We gave him a hard time for calling it, but it was the right call."" The rule technically existed, but almost nobody enforced it. And when it was flagged, it was usually because a player was being pulled, not pushed. So when Bush shoved Leinart across the goal line in 2005, the officials did what most would have done: They kept the flag in their pockets. In fact, after Leinart's touchdown, the Pac-10 officiating crew huddled up to discuss the play only to emerge with an unsportsmanlike contact penalty against the Trojans for their celebration after. There was no mention of the legality of the push on the broadcast, either. It wasn't until the next day when the conversation shifted from the game's remarkable ending into a nationwide rules debate that is still built into the game's lore. Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen admitted to the Los Angeles Times that his conference's officiating crew could have called a penalty, but made essentially the same point Shaw did two decades later. ""I just don't think they ever call it,"" Hansen said, adding it would have been different if it was a pull, not a push. This is where the consensus seemed to land. The play looked like part of the normal chaos that happens at the goal line. By the letter of the law, Bush committed a foul. But by the spirit of the game, he just did what any teammate would do. RULE CHANGES IN college football often move slowly. Proposals wind through the NCAA Rules Committee, a rotating group of coaches, officials and administrators who meet each offseason. Most suggestions come after issues are identified over the course of a season. If the committee deems something urgent, it can move quickly. If not, it can linger in discussion until a consensus forms. Sometimes, a single play can trigger an immediate rewrite. When Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett faked a slide in the 2021 ACC championship game -- beginning to give himself up before resuming his run for a long touchdown -- the reaction was instant. Within days, the NCAA issued a memo closing the loophole. The same thing happened last year when Oregon 's Dan Lanning found a way to shave off game time by using a 12th man on defense. The Bush Push didn't work that way. Despite the fierce public debate -- and the way it was officiated -- the rule remained unchanged in the years that followed. It wasn't until 2013, when the rules committee formally decided to adjust the official wording. ""The rules committee had a good debate about this and they watched much video, including the Bush Push play,"" Shaw said. ""Overall, they came to the conclusion that it was very difficult to determine when a push was truly a foul. ""There were few guidelines that could be given to make this a consistent call. Examples were pushing a rugby scrum pile vs. pushing the runner specifically, and they felt it was nearly impossible to distinguish between pushing a runner, leaning on a runner, pushing the pile or leaning on the pile. They felt removing the 'push' component would be the best course of action."" When the NCAA released its updated rulebook for the 2013 season, the word ""push"" was simply deleted, bringing it in line with a similar rule change the NFL made in 2005. Without realizing it, the committee paved the way for innovation in the sport. Right away, coaches tried to use the subtle change to their advantage, including former Kansas State coach Bill Snyder, whose Wildcats started running what is now commonly referred to as the tush push later that year . ""It was just a natural thing to do,"" Snyder told ESPN's Kalyn Kahler earlier this year . ""We needed to create a way in which we could take the shortest distance to get the short distance we needed to go and not get held up, because everybody put all the people over there, so we wanted to compete against no matter how many people you put there. ""We wanted to be strong enough not to get held up at the line of scrimmage. And we would bring one or two, or on occasion, three backs up right off of the hip of the center, and on the snap of the ball, we would push the center or push the back of the quarterback."" That small tactical adjustment eventually made its way to the pros. Nearly a decade later, the Philadelphia Eagles adopted a version of the play built around quarterback Jalen Hurts , perfecting it into an almost unstoppable short-yardage weapon. Which, once again, led to a nationwide debate about whether pushing -- once outlawed, then ignored and finally embraced -- belonged in football at all. In May, a proposal from the Green Bay Packers to ban the tush push came up two votes shy of the 24 it needed to pass.

Sign Up Now At the NCAA level, the play drew some discussion over the offseason, too, but those conversations were more centered on potential injury concerns. ""The NCAA rules committee has looked at it and really up to now have not seen it become an injury, a player safety issue,"" Shaw said. ""So it really becomes a strategic part. Is that something strategically we want in the game? And so far there's not been a big driver to try to put together a reason to eliminate it from our game."" Over the past four seasons, the current rule has been enforced only six times, according to Shaw. Three times in 2022, and just once in 2021, 2023 and 2024. The play looked like part of the normal chaos that happens at the goal line. AP Photo/Joe Raymond AS USC RETURNS to Notre Dame this weekend for a top-20 matchup, the Bush Push helps define one of the sport's most storied rivalries. Carroll, now the Las Vegas Raiders coach, has very specific memories of that game in South Bend: the high grass, the green Notre Dame jerseys, the legends in the crowd. ""The stories I heard are that they sold out the night before the game at their rally that they had,"" Carroll said. ""And they brought Joe Montana back, and Rudy [Ruettiger] came back to speak to the crowd and a guy dressed up as Jesus showed up trying to bring home the power. ... It was just an incredible setting for college football."" The push that once went uncalled now defines the rule. Twenty years later, it's still moving the game forward.

35eba1140812,Best games from the Notre Dame-USC rivalry,,"It's not really an overstatement to say that the Notre Dame-USC rivalry nationalized football. Sure, we already had plenty of heated rivalries when the two schools began playing each other in the mid-1920s, but rivals were neighbors. Harvard vs. Yale. Auburn vs. Georgia. Michigan vs. Ohio State. Missouri vs. Kansas. Notre Dame-USC, on the other hand, required many days on a train at first; it dropped teams off in a completely different part of the world, where they usually had to beat one of the best teams on the planet. It is the Granddaddy of intersectional rivalries (with apologies to Keith Jackson), and it was a massive game right from its origin. On Saturday evening in South Bend, the Trojans and Fighting Irish will meet for the 96th time. Notre Dame holds a 52-38-5 edge, though the momentum has swayed back and forth pretty severely through the years -- Notre Dame went 15-3-1 from 1940-61, USC went 12-2-2 from 1967-82, Notre Dame went 12-0-1 from 1983-95, USC went 11-3 from 1996-2009. The Irish have won nine of the last 12 and are favored to make it 10 in 13 this year. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now There is a feeling of foreboding surrounding this game, however, as there aren't any more Trojans-Irish games scheduled moving forward. The only time these rivals haven't met since their first game in 1926 was because of either war (1943-45) or a pandemic (2020), but the series is now in danger because of ... well ... I don't really know, actually. Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman has certainly said he and the school want the series to continue , and USC head coach Lincoln Riley said, ""Do I want to play the game? Hell yeah, I want to play the game,"" at Big Ten media days in July before equivocating. ""My allegiance is to USC, and I'm going to do everything in my power to help USC."" That led to a sidebar about the need for conferences to get multiple automatic bids into a newly expanded College Football Playoff, as the Big Ten has been pushing for months . ""I think there's a million reasons why we should ... adopt the automatic qualifying in terms of the College Football Playoff,"" Riley said. ""This might be the most important one, right, is that we give every reason for college football to preserve nonconference games that mean a lot to the history of the game and to the fan bases and the former players and everybody that's been associated with it."" Apparently USC and/or the Big Ten think the only way the USC-Notre Dame series can continue is if it has no impact on who makes the CFP? If the series ends, it will end for utterly embarrassing reasons. Just schedule the damn game and keep playing it. For the last century, this has been one of the sport's defining rivalries, both because of its impact on college football's balance of power (especially in the 1960s and 1970s) and the unbelievable moments it has produced. Here are 10 games that have helped to define an incredible, and ridiculously endangered, rivalry. 1931: USC 16, Notre Dame 14 The 1920s were the decade in which the sport fully infected America. The Big Ten and Ivy League remained awesome at it, and the Rose Bowl only gained in gravitas when the Rose Bowl stadium opened in 1922. But schools from everywhere increasingly wanted a piece of the action. Alabama won the 1926 Rose Bowl, proving that the South could more than hold its own, and with its 1925 Rose Bowl trouncing of Pop Warner's Stanford, Knute Rockne's Notre Dame announced itself as a national power. USC went to Notre Dame in 1931 and scored a huge on the way to a title. AP Photo USC had already won the Rose Bowl in 1923, but the Trojans' notoriety as an up-and-comer hit hyperdrive when, having attempted to pluck Rockne away from Notre Dame in 1925, they agreed to trade annual cross-country trips with the Irish. Three of the first four games in the series, alternating between enormous crowds in Chicago and Los Angeles, resulted in one-point Notre Dame wins, all with gut-wrenching missed kicks involved. The country was hooked. Notre Dame welcomed USC to South Bend for the first time in 1931 -- and for the first time without Rockne, who had died in a plane crash the previous March. The Irish hadn't lost a game since a defeat to the Trojans to end the 1928 season, and they took a 14-0 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Gus Shaver scored to make it 14-6 early in the fourth, but the Irish blocked the PAT, and since 2-point conversions weren't a thing yet, it was still a two-score game. No worries! They scored again to make it 14-13, and in the dying seconds, Orville Mohler completed a couple of huge passes to bring USC into field goal range, and Johnny Baker hit the game winner. The Trojans arrived a few days later to a mobbed train station with over 100,000 revelers. They were paraded through town. And after blowouts of Washington and Georgia and a Rose Bowl victory over Tulane, they were unbeaten national champions. 1947: No. 1 Notre Dame 38, No. 3 USC 7 USC enjoyed back-to-back top-10 finishes in 1938-39, but when legendary coach Howard Jones died in 1941, the Trojans grew inconsistent. Notre Dame, however, thrived through and after the war years and won four national titles between 1943-49. In 1947, USC started the season 7-0-1 and rose to third in the country. Unfortunately, Notre Dame fielded the best team ever, according to legendary opinion-haver Beano Cook . USC made the Irish work for this one, but behind the string-pulling work of Heisman-winner Johnny Lujack and the devastating rushing of Emil Sitko and Bob Livingstone, Notre Dame eventually had too much. The Irish led only 10-7 at halftime, but Sitko's 76-yard touchdown made it 17-7, and after an interception and other stellar defensive plays from Lujack, Livingstone raced 92 yards to make it 31-7 and send the backups in. Notre Dame won the AP national title, though somewhat ironically, Michigan also claimed a share after walloping USC 49-0 in the Rose Bowl. It would have been an all-timer had the Irish and Wolverines played that season, but by this point Michigan and quite a few other Big Ten programs were refusing to schedule Notre Dame. 1964: USC 20, No. 1 Notre Dame 17 The 1950s were a tough decade for a number of blue-blood programs, and neither of these teams escaped down years. USC had as many one-win seasons as top-10 finishes (one each) between 1948-61, and Notre Dame had more two-win seasons (two) than top-10s (one) between 1956-63. But they found the men who would bring them back to prominence when USC hired John McKay in 1960, and Notre Dame landed Ara Parseghian in 1964. USC rolled to an 11-0 national title in 1962 but was still attempting to establish consistency in 1964; the Irish, meanwhile, surged from 2-7 to No. 1 in the country in Parseghian's very first season. He had them 9-0 and one win from a national title when they headed to L.A. In front of 83,840 at the Coliseum, the Irish, two-touchdown favorites, raced to a 17-0 halftime lead. But according to Sports Illustrated, McKay was calm, telling his team, ""Our game plan is working. Keep doing your stuff and we'll get some points [...] They've won nine games without any duress. If we can make this thing close, they might not know how to react."" Behind future Heisman winner Mike Garrett and quarterback Craig Fertig, the Trojans proved McKay correct. They scored twice to make it close, and as the final minute approached, they ran 84-Z, a shot over the middle from Fertig to Rod Sherman for the game winner. The Irish would get revenge soon enough, humiliating USC 51-0 in Los Angeles two years later and winning their first national title under Parseghian. But the Trojans still made them wait a while. 1968: No. 2 USC 21, No. 9 Notre Dame 21 These programs have met as top-10 teams 18 times, and half of those games happened between 1965-79. While this rivalry has swayed back and forth with one team rising and the other falling, this period saw both thriving rather consistently. Bill Connelly In 1967, top-ranked USC upended the fifth-ranked Irish 24-7 in South Bend on the way to McKay's second title, and behind soon-to-be Heisman winner O.J. Simpson, the Trojans won their first nine games of 1968 as well. But after a couple of early losses, Notre Dame came to the Coliseum having won its last three games by a combined 135-27. The Irish gave the Trojans and their fans a surprise. As Dan Jenkins wrote for Sports Illustrated, ""The game turned out to be nothing like the 82,659 in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum or the hordes on television had anticipated. They had expected to see quite a contest, of course, with O.J. Simpson getting his usual 183.7 yards and scoring his usual two or three touchdowns and with the Trojans maybe winning by a point and becoming No. 1 again. What they saw instead was a splendidly prepared Notre Dame team that ate up Simpson on defense and kept the ball for hours on offense."" Sophomore quarterback Joe Theismann overcame an early pick-six to throw for 152 yards, catch a touchdown pass and lead Notre Dame to a 21-7 halftime lead. USC again came back, with a short Simpson TD and a long Sam Dickerson score tying the game with 10 minutes left, but the Irish created the late chances. But Scott Hempel missed a 47-yard field goal, then missed a 33-yarder with 29 seconds remaining. Evidently, both of these rivals enjoyed this experience so much that they played to a tie the next year, too, 14-14. 1974: No. 6 USC 55, No. 5 Notre Dame 24 Ah, The Comeback. By the 1970s, these programs were humming. USC won the 1972 title thanks in part to a 45-23 thumping of Notre Dame that featured six Anthony Davis touchdowns, two on kick returns. In 1973, it was Notre Dame's turn, taking down the defending champs 23-14 and eventually stunning top-ranked Alabama in the Sugar Bowl to win the title. In 1974, in the last McKay-Parseghian battle, USC flipped the game like few have ever been flipped. And Davis was behind it once again. Running back Anthony Davis scored three touchdowns in the 1974 game. AP Photo/Jeff Robbins Notre Dame and quarterback Tom Clements stunned the crowd of 83,552 early, gaining 257 first-half yards and bolting to a 24-0 lead. But Davis scored on a short touchdown pass from Pat Haden to make it 24-6 before the break, then took the opening kick of the second half 100 yards for another score. USC forced a punt, and Davis scored again. Then Notre Dame fumbled, and Davis scored again and added the 2-point conversion. Suddenly it was 27-24, and USC kept landing blows. Haden threw touchdown passes to J.K. McKay (twice) and Shelton Diggs, then Charles Phillips picked off his third pass of the day and took it to the house. In just under 17 minutes USC had gone on a 55-0 run. 55-0! The Trojans rode the momentum to a Rose Bowl upset of Ohio State, too. 1977: No. 11 Notre Dame 49, No. 5 USC 19 Dan Devine's tenure as Notre Dame head coach began with two three-loss seasons and an early-1977 loss to unranked Ole Miss. Devine was awfully close to hot-seat status. The Irish had won three in a row when USC came to town, but they'd beaten the Trojans just once in their last 10 tries, and they just weren't looking the part. So they changed their look. The Irish came out in all green for the first time ever -- a hideous green, if we're being honest (it's important to tell the truth) -- and entered the field behind a giant Trojan horse. USC never stood a chance. A rickety Notre Dame offense found its stride, with quarterback Joe Montana completing eight passes to big Ken McAfee and scoring on a pair of quarterback sneaks, and while USC's Charles White rushed for 135 yards, the Trojans consistently self-destructed in Irish territory. Even with four lost fumbles, Notre Dame won by 30. The magic of the green jerseys continued even when they moved back to the regular kits. They won their last seven games by an average of 45-11, including a 38-10 stomping of top-ranked Texas in the Cotton Bowl, and Devine, Montana & Co. were surprise national champs. 1988: No. 1 Notre Dame 27, No. 2 USC 10 Top to bottom, the 1980s weren't great for either program. Head coach John Robinson followed McKay to the NFL, and USC stumbled under Ted Tollner, while Notre Dame made either one of the boldest or most arrogant and reckless hires of all time following Dan Devine's retirement: High school coaching legend Gerry Faust came aboard and went just 30-26-1 over five years. USC rebounded under Larry Smith, however, and Notre Dame surged under Lou Holtz. And in 1988, the series saw a glorious first: a No. 1 vs. No. 2 battle to end the regular season. Notre Dame had already beaten top-ranked Miami in a game worthy of 30 for 30 status , and even without a couple of key players -- running back Tony Brooks and receiver Ricky Watters were both suspended -- it was clear pretty quickly that the Fighting Irish were the superior squad. Quarterback Tony Rice raced 65 yards for an early touchdown, Stan Smagala scored on a 64-yard pick six, Mark Green scored two short touchdowns, and the Irish spent most of the second half killing time. They had only eight first downs for the game, but it was more than enough to secure a sixth straight win in the series. And about five weeks later, they thumped WVU in the Fiesta Bowl to win their first national title in 11 years (and last to date). 1995: No. 17 Notre Dame 38, No. 5 USC 10 While Notre Dame remained elite for a few years into the 1990s, USC lost its edge a bit. Between 1991-2001, the Trojans only made one top-five appearance, and it ended unceremoniously in South Bend. Notre Dame came into this one having gone just 6-5-1 the year before and suffered a pair of early-1995 losses, including an all-time shocker against Rose Bowl-bound Northwestern. Holtz had recently undergone spinal surgery and coached from the press box, and despite a 12-year unbeaten streak in the rivalry, the Irish were underdogs against the No. 5 Trojans. But USC played like a desperate team that hasn't beaten its rival in 12 years. USC's Keyshawn Johnson caught an early touchdown pass to give the Trojans a 7-6 lead -- he had six catches for 122 yards on the day -- but four turnovers, countless red zone miscues, a 10-for-11 start for the Irish on third down and two Marc Edwards touchdowns gave Notre Dame a 21-7 halftime lead. It was only 21-10 heading into the fourth quarter, but Kory Minor sacked USC's Kyle Wachholtz for a safety, Ron Powlus found Pete Chryplewicz for a short score, and a third Edwards touchdown put the game away. The Irish only outgained the Trojans by a yard (380-379), but they gained all of the important yards. USC would finally take back control of the rivalry the next year, winning three in a row against first Holtz and then Bob Davie. 2005: No. 1 USC 35, No. 9 Notre Dame 31 I use this analogy far too frequently, but USC is, for all intents and purposes, a high-performance muscle car: It's too much for most drivers to handle, but with the right hands on the steering wheel, it can destroy everything in its path. USC struggled to find that pair of hands for quite a while. Tollner, Smith, Robinson (in a second tenure) and Paul Hackett combined for zero top-five finishes and only four nine-win seasons in 18 years, and by 2001, when athletic director Mike Garrett was replacing Hackett after a moribund three-year tenure, he struggled to find any takers. Notre Dame broke out the green jerseys for Reggie Bush and Co. in 2005. AP Photo/Tom Strattman Garrett went after everyone from Oregon's Mike Bellotti to Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez and came up empty. He finally grabbed former New England Patriots coach Pete Carroll, whose résumé was far too similar to Hackett's for most fans' liking. He hadn't coached in college for nearly 20 years either, but he should have -- as it turned out, almost no one in the 21st century was a more natural or successful recruiter. Carroll stockpiled both blue-chippers and bright young assistants like Steve Sarkisian and Lane Kiffin, and after starting his tenure just 9-8, his Trojans erupted, winning 45 of 46 games, including a run of 34 in a row. They shared the national title with Nick Saban's LSU in 2003 and won it outright in 2004. That winning streak probably should have ended in South Bend. While USC was surging, Notre Dame was fading into irrelevance. In eight years under Davie and Tyrone Willingham, the Irish alternated between sub-.500 disappointments and seasons just successful enough to end with bowl blowouts -- 27-9 to pre-Saban LSU in the Independence Bowl, 28-6 to NC State in the Gator Bowl, 41-9 to Erickson's Oregon State in the Fiesta Bowl. But it looked like Notre Dame had found its own Carroll in former New England offensive coordinator Charlie Weis. His Irish beat three ranked opponents in his first five games, including No. 3 Michigan on the road, and they were back in the top 10 when USC came to visit. ESPN's ""College GameDay"" was in town, and Notre Dame's Friday night pep rally was broadcast on ESPNews. Notre Dame even busted out the green jerseys. They were pulling out all the stops. Despite a brilliant 195 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns from soon-to-be Heisman winner Reggie Bush, USC simply couldn't shake the Irish. A 32-yard Brady Quinn-to-Jeff Samardzija touchdown pass and a 60-yard Tom Zbikowski punt return gave Notre Dame a 21-14 halftime lead, and Quinn's 5-yard touchdown gave the Irish a 31-28 lead with just 2:04 left. But you probably already know what happened next. Bush shoved Matt Leinart into the end zone on a make-or-break play with four seconds left -- that would be legal with today's rules, but it wasn't in 2005 -- and somehow USC survived. 2018: No. 3 Notre Dame 24, USC 17 As great and important as this rivalry has been for college football, it's found a rut in recent years. It happens. Though the Weis years flamed out spectacularly, Notre Dame has remained relevant, with four top-five finishes and two national title game appearances under Brian Kelly and Marcus Freeman. But USC's Carroll era ended with NCAA sanctions, and under four different coaches -- Kiffin, Sarkisian, Clay Helton and now Lincoln Riley -- the Trojans have enjoyed just one top-five finish since 2008. Notre Dame has won nine of the past 12 games in the series, and only three of those 12 games were decided by one score. The 2018 game was pretty fun, at least. USC, in the middle of a dismal 8-11 stretch following a hot start under Helton, was attempting to both salvage bowl eligibility and wreck Notre Dame's perfect record and playoff résumé right before CFP selection. The Trojans took a 10-7 lead into halftime thanks to an early Vavae Malepeai touchdown, but a 52-yard run by Dexter Williams and a 52-yard Ian Book -to- Tony Jones Jr . strike put the Irish up 14. JT Daniels found Tyler Vaughns for a USC touchdown in the final minute, but Notre Dame recovered the ensuing onside kick, and that was that. We're due a USC-Notre Dame classic on Saturday. It's been a little while, and unless sanity prevails, it might be a long while until we get another chance.",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46593771/notre-dame-fighting-irish-usc-trojans-rivalry-best-game,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559992_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,091566a2332309cafb4af901e228bbc6177212dd
e8846cb7f424,"2025 MLB playoffs: Where NLCS, ALCS stand and what's next",,"Oct 15, 2025, 07:00 AM ET We are two games into both 2025 league championship series, and it's time for our initial impressions based on what we have seen on the field. The Seattle Mariners are headed home with a 2-0 ALCS lead after downing the Toronto Blue Jays on consecutive days to start the series. In the NLCS, the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers have jumped out to a 2-0 road advantage of their own against the Milwaukee Brewers . What has stood out most so far -- and what's next for the World Series hopefuls? Our MLB experts weigh in. ALCS: Mariners vs. Blue Jays What has surprised you most so far? Jorge Castillo: The assumption was Seattle's pitching staff, drained after an exhausting ALDS that concluded with a 15-inning Game 5 on Friday, would need at least Sunday's ALCS opening game to reset. But Mariners pitchers did not relent. Game 1 starter Bryce Miller set the tone, rebounding from a rocky first inning to give the Mariners six crucial innings. The bullpen starred in Game 2, when Eduard Bazardo , Carlos Vargas and Emerson Hancock each tossed two scoreless innings. Tuesday's off day should only help the Mariners as the series shifts to their cavernous home ballpark. Jeff Passan: The lack of competitive at-bats from the Blue Jays. Yes, the Mariners' pitching is very good. But the Blue Jays -- whose high-quality, work-the-count, spoil-pitches approach all season helped deliver them an AL East championship -- were practically tweaking to swing at Miller's pitches in Game 1 and weren't much better in Game 2. Vladimir Guerrero Jr . is hitless. As are Daulton Varsho , Andres Gimenez and Davis Schneider . Four runs in two games is not going to do it against a lineup as deep as the Mariners' and with a pitching staff as susceptible as the Blue Jays' has been this postseason. How can the Mariners close this out at home? Castillo: Hitting home runs at T-Mobile Park isn't easy -- the Mariners hit 134 on the road and 108 at home -- but long balls are often the difference in October. Such was the case in Game 2, when the Mariners scored eight of their 10 runs on three homers -- two three-run home runs and a two-run shot. The Blue Jays surrendered 209 home runs during the regular season -- the sixth-most allowed in the majors and the most allowed by a postseason team. If the Mariners continue hitting mistakes over the fence, the Blue Jays' chances of winning four of the next five games are slim to none. Passan: Do not treat this as a coronation. Too much has happened in Mariners history to ever doubt that something can go very wrong. They have existed 49 years and never so much as made a World Series. The real answer: cut down on the punchouts. The Mariners are striking out more than 30% of the time over the first two games, and it diminishes opportunities compared to Toronto, which is at 13%. Like Jorge said, as long as Seattle is hitting home runs, this might be moot. In the absence of that, though, putting the ball in play can save them. What can the Blue Jays do to get this series back to Toronto? Castillo: It starts with scoring more runs. The Mariners' pitching staff, tired and all, has silenced an offense that demolished Yankees pitching last week. The Blue Jays tallied only four runs in the two games in Toronto. All were scored in the first two innings. In Game 2, the Blue Jays went 1-for-28 with three walks after the second inning. Nathan Lukes and George Springer are the only Blue Jays with multiple hits in the series. Guerrero is 0-for-7 with one walk after finishing the ALDS 9-for-17 with three home runs. Varsho is 0-for-7. Addison Barger and Andres Giménez are 0-for-6. Springer's leadoff home run in Game 1 was the only ball Toronto hit over the fence. One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » The Blue Jays scored 21 runs in a three-game sweep of the Mariners during the regular season. But that was at home in May, and T-Mobile Park is a pitcher's haven. It'll be a quick series if their bats don't wake up in Seattle. Passan: Just look at Game 1 of the NLCS. The Dodgers' offense is struggling, and it really doesn't matter because Blake Snell threw eight of the most brilliant innings you'll ever see. And even though Shane Bieber and Max Scherzer , the Blue Jays' starters in Game 3 and Game 4, are not near Snell's caliber today, they are both former Cy Young winners who have pitched in huge games. Seattle's pitching is too good for Toronto to win this series via slugfests. So the Blue Jays are simply going to have to beat the Mariners at their own game: solid starting pitching and enough relief to backfill. NLCS What has jumped out to you most so far? Bradford Doolittle: The Dodgers' starting pitching has been lights-out. It's not just all the zeros that Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto put up; the Brewers' hitters looked overmatched against them most of the time. Milwaukee had a clear plan to ambush Yamamoto as often as possible in Game 2, but after Jackson Chourio 's first-pitch leadoff homer, it just didn't work. Yamamoto kept pumping in strikes, and the Brewers did nothing with them. Jesse Rogers: The Dodgers' starting pitching went from iffy to dominant in the blink of an eye. Part of the reason the Brewers went 6-0 against L.A. during the regular season is that they faced a team piecing together its starting staff. Dave Roberts even admitted to ""slow playing"" Snell just to have him ready for this moment. Best possible World Series matchups Never-before-seen history? A battle of villains?! Here are the best remaining showdowns for every type of fan. David Schoenfield » Not even a first-pitch home run by Chourio off Yamamoto in Game 2 could change the narrative. Yamamoto threw a 111-pitch complete game, giving up only two more hits and a walk after that long ball. On most teams, Tyler Glasnow and Shohei Ohtani would be the No. 1 and No. 2 pitchers, but the Dodgers will roll them out against Milwaukee at Dodger Stadium later this week. It's an embarrassment of riches -- and it could doom the Brewers' chances at their first World Series title. What do the Dodgers need to do to close out this series at home? Bradford Doolittle: Just keep riding the wave. The L.A. rotation has become the story of the postseason so far, and even though the Dodgers' offense hasn't matched the pitchers in terms of dominance, this is the hottest team around right now. And the offense isn't going to grind this way forever. Jesse Rogers: Just keep pitching the way they are and maybe get Ohtani going at the plate. Not that they've needed him so far, but if he starts to light it up, this series won't return to the Midwest. Closer Roki Sasaki is also likely to be more comfortable in his home setting than he was in Game 1. All signs point to the Dodgers winning a short series. What do the Brewers need to get this series back to Milwaukee? Bradford Doolittle: They need traffic on the bases, especially early in the games. They haven't been able to showcase their athleticism against the Dodgers because no one has been getting on base. Get on base, hope to unnerve Glasnow and Ohtani and get into that L.A. bullpen by the fourth or fifth inning. The formula isn't complicated, but the way the Dodgers are going, executing it will be a challenge. Jesse Rogers: Putting up a crooked number would help. Somewhere along the line, they need one of those Brewers innings -- the kind that forces the defense into mistakes while utilizing their speed and ability on the basepaths to create havoc. Easier said than done against this Dodgers starting staff, but if they can get into the underbelly of L.A.'s bullpen, they have a chance. That's the path forward for the Brewers.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46577595/mlb-2025-playoffs-alcs-nlcs-initial-impressions-blue-jays-mariners-brewers-dodgers,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560287_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,8d4b523154866111e446853d7433856de9f355aa
66041658b32a,Cooper Flagg put the league on notice before he ever played an NBA game,,"SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD COOPER FLAGG had not yet played a single game for Duke when he walked into UNLV's Mendenhall Center on the afternoon of July 8, 2024. But he piqued the curiosity of the future Hall of Famers preparing for the trip to Paris to play for Team USA in the 2024 Olympics. Flagg had been the most hyped and anticipated American high school prospect since LeBron James , who was the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft more than three years before Flagg was born. James and the rest of Team USA were quite familiar with Flagg's name, if not yet his game. It had been more than a decade since an amateur had been invited to play for the Team USA select squad. Doug McDermott and Marcus Smart were accomplished collegians when they received the call in 2013. This scrimmage at Team USA's training camp would be the biggest test yet for the teenage phenom. Would Flagg be intimidated facing perennial All-Stars he grew up watching on TV? Would he be jittery playing in a small gym with NBA coaches and executives surrounding the court? The answer: absolutely not. ""Zero nerves,"" 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis told ESPN, recalling his first impression of the 6-foot-9 forward who will start alongside him this season in the Dallas Mavericks ' frontcourt. ""He went out and balled."" Flagg is back in Las Vegas for one last tuneup entering his rookie season, as the Mavericks play the Los Angeles Lakers in their preseason finale Wednesday night at T-Mobile Arena. But Flagg's welcome-to-the-NBA moment occurred 15 months ago about 2½ miles away, when he made it clear he could make an immediate impact in the league, although he'd have to wait a season to become draft-eligible. Flagg was already the consensus favorite to be the No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft when he arrived at the Team USA training camp in Vegas. If there was any doubt that he'd go No. 1 in the draft, it was eliminated by the end of the scrimmage, when the Olympic squad survived a Flagg-fueled comeback to squeak out a 74-73 win. It only amplified the anticipation for Flagg as he headed to Duke, where he again more than met expectations, earning national player of the year honors while leading the Blue Devils in every major statistical category en route to an ACC title and a Final Four appearance. Now, after the veteran-laden Mavs stunningly cashed in 1.8% lottery odds to land Flagg with the No. 1 pick, the expectation is that Flagg can expand his game as a rookie while proving himself as the rare teenager ready to affect winning right away in the NBA. ""I don't know if it was about proving anything to myself or just feeling comfortable and getting confidence from that experience,"" Flagg told ESPN. ""I definitely just had that feeling that I knew I belonged. I knew I could be out there."" At age 17, Cooper Flagg caught the attention of several NBA players who were headed to the Paris Olympics after Flagg nearly led the select team to an upset of Team USA during a scrimmage in July 2024. Juan Ocampo/NBAE via Getty Images WHILE STUDYING TAPE of Flagg doing everything at Duke, Mavs coach Jason Kidd wondered if Flagg could do even more. Kidd saw shades of another former Duke star in Flagg's game: Grant Hill, who shared the Rookie of the Year award with Kidd in 1994-95, when the 6-foot-8 Hill ran the point a lot for the Detroit Pistons . Kidd saw the same phenomenal blend of feel and force in Flagg that Hill had coming out of Duke. ""I saw that, too,"" Hill, who as managing director of Team USA invited Flagg to join the program's select team and called some of his college games for CBS, told ESPN. ""He tries to play the complete game. You look up and he's got 22 points and it doesn't even feel like he looked to score. He's so unselfish. He defends. He just tries to do what's necessary to win games."" When Flagg arrived in Dallas, Kidd was determined to find out how he could handle point guard responsibilities. Kidd also wanted to see how Flagg would handle an unfamiliar role. That experiment started during his brief stint in the Las Vegas Summer League, which had mixed results as the Mavs split the two games that Flagg played at the Thomas & Mack Center. Flagg shot poorly in the summer opener, going 5-of-21 from the field, but found his way to put his fingerprints on the defining sequence of the win over the Lakers. With a little more than a minute remaining, Flagg swooped in from the weak side to swat a layup attempt, pushed the ball in transition, drew three defenders in the paint and dished to a teammate for an open 3-pointer that gave Dallas the lead for good. Flagg scored 31 points in 31 minutes in the second game, a loss to the San Antonio Spurs . The Mavs had seen enough -- especially pleased with how Flagg handled pressure while bringing the ball up the court -- and shut him down for the rest of summer league. ""He handled the situation as well as an 18-year-old could handle it,"" said Kidd, who started Flagg at point guard in a jumbo-sized lineup in Monday's preseason win over the Utah Jazz . ""He has a talent about winning. It is in his DNA, and so it would be unfair not to make him uncomfortable."" Flagg, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, will make his NBA debut on Oct. 22 when his Dallas Mavericks host the San Antonio Spurs. Richard Rodriguez/NBAE via Getty Images THE MOST MEMORABLE moments of Flagg's time at the national team's training camp, according to Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, who was in charge of the Team USA select squad, didn't occur during the scrimmage. They happened during the few practices and meetings the select squad held beforehand. Flagg's inquisitiveness and intelligence impressed Mosley, who especially enjoyed an in-depth dialogue between Flagg and Magic guard Jalen Suggs about the intricacies of NBA defense. ""He asked a lot of questions,"" Mosley told ESPN. ""I think it's huge for a young guy in this situation to be able to ask the right questions. He just wanted to understand what it looks like at the next level. He's a communicator, and that said a lot to me about him. Guys like that with high basketball IQs that want to play the right way will ask questions."" Then Flagg delivered a fearless performance in the scrimmage. ""He wasn't afraid of the moment and who he was going against,"" Mosley said. ""He was himself. I think he walked in with the quiet confidence, but then when he got on the court with those guys, that demeanor didn't change any at all.""

If there is such a thing as a signature stretch during a scrimmage, Flagg put one together with a late scoring flurry as the select team rallied from a double-digit deficit. He hit a baseline turnaround from the left block over Jrue Holiday . He rose up from the right wing to drill an off-dribble 3 in Davis' face. And Flagg flew in for an and-1 tip-in over Bam Adebayo , eliciting a roar from the entire select team bench. Those three buckets came against a trio of defenders with a combined 16 All-Defensive team selections. Flagg didn't celebrate any of them, maintaining a quiet, focused sense of calm. He called his select team stint ""a big learning experience,"" but nothing he did against the Olympians surprised Flagg. ""He was cooking,"" Davis said. ""He definitely stood out. Guys obviously were hearing the name, and we all knew who he was. But a lot of guys tend to, I don't want to say be hesitant, but when you're going against guys like myself, Bron, Steph [Curry], you see these guys and it's like, 'Oh s---.' ""You look up to and you idolize these guys, and now you got to go play against them. You kind of get nervous, which is normal. But for him, he has the utmost confidence in himself."" Flagg's scoring dominated the media coverage of the scrimmage, but that isn't what made the strongest impression on Steve Kerr, the former Team USA coach. Kerr was wowed by Flagg's command of the game at such a young age against elite competition. ""I just remember the force you felt,"" Kerr told ESPN. ""You immediately felt him. And it was as a basketball player. It wasn't just like he had a huge dunk or something. No. It was the passing, the cutting, the late-clock, left-handed jump hook on the block when the offense had nothing else. It was so consistent. ""I'm coaching against him and we have the best players. He's got incredible feel. He's just huge but plays like a guard in terms of reading the game."" Kerr recalled seeing Duke coach Jon Scheyer in the gym after the scrimmage. ""I said, 'That had to make you feel good,'"" Kerr said. ""He just smiled."" Kidd knows the feeling.

0e34b6a8f53a,Family fights for Chiefs fan wrongly accused in parade shooting,,"Elizabeth Merrill Close Elizabeth Merrill ESPN Senior Writer Elizabeth Merrill is a senior writer for ESPN. She previously wrote for The Kansas City Star and The Omaha World-Herald. Maria Lawson Close Maria Lawson is a reporter in the ESPN investigative and enterprise unit. She is an ESPN-American University investigative fellow from Frisco, Texas. Oct 15, 2025, 07:00 AM ET OLATHE, Kansas -- ""Is everything OK?"" Denton Loudermill Jr. texted his attorney the morning of April 10. Loudermill would check in like that when the weight of everything got too heavy. But LaRonna Lassiter Saunders was on the road and knew she would have to carve out some time for him. She'd call him later. For Lassiter Saunders, sometimes it felt as if she was more like Loudermill's therapist than his attorney. She knew he was just trying to navigate a life that had been upended on the afternoon of Feb. 14, 2024 -- the day of the Kansas City Chiefs ' Super Bowl LVIII victory parade and rally. Loudermill, a 49-year-old father of three, was so excited about his team's back-to-back titles that he had donned a red hoodie and matching sweatpants for the event. Then, in an area near where Loudermill happened to be celebrating, an argument broke out that led to gunfire . A local radio host, Lisa Lopez-Galvan , was killed and 22 people were injured in the Chiefs' Super Bowl parade shooting . Police briefly detained Loudermill in the chaos that followed near Union Station, and onlookers snapped photos of him handcuffed and seated on a curb. In a matter of moments, his life was thrown into the social media wood chipper. An image appeared online and caught the attention of news-seekers, and eventually politicians, who in the hours after the shooting labeled him as everything from the gunman to an ""illegal"" immigrant. The fact that police released Loudermill a short time later did not make the social media rounds, but the photo of him in handcuffs did. And the man who was outgoing and social, who constantly struck up conversations with strangers, became a pariah -- falsely accused of being the shooter. Searches of ""Chiefs parade shooter"" on X revealed various photos of Loudermill's detainment. At the time of this publication, a New York City tabloid social media account still has a picture of him in handcuffs and flanked by police officers. Loudermill tried to return to his everyday life but could not escape the glare. ""'They got my face all over the news,'"" Lassiter Saunders recalled Loudermill telling her shortly after the shooting. ""'I'm just a light-skinned brother that was trying to enjoy my Chiefs.'"" She figured the best way to combat the misinformation was to set the record straight in every possible venue, and within days of the shooting, they appeared on CNN, ""Inside Edition"" and the local TV stations in Kansas City. It didn't seem to help. Loudermill became withdrawn and paranoid, and eventually he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. ""He thought people were following him,"" said one of his sisters, Reba Paul. He wanted an apology, and when he didn't get it, he sought justice in the form of lawsuits. He clung to those calls and meetings with Lassiter Saunders, waiting for something or someone to clear his name. She reminded him these things take time. On the morning of April 11, Lassiter Saunders was about to call Loudermill back to update him on what was happening. Mostly, she wanted to reassure him. But before she could dial, his sister rang in. She told Lassiter Saunders that Loudermill had been found dead. Paul had just been to his house and saw him lying on the living room floor near the couch. The autopsy would take months, but during that time, his siblings remained resolved to stand up for their brother and to do what they could to clear his name. The last year of Loudermill's life is a story of how quickly misinformation can spread -- and how slowly, if ever, the truth breaks through. Through it all, his family remains convinced of one thing: They lost Denton Loudermill Jr. the day of that parade. Law enforcement responds to a shooting at Union Station after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl LVIII victory parade and rally on Feb. 14, 2024. A local radio host, Lisa Lopez-Galvan, was killed, and 22 people were injured. Jamie Squire/Getty Images ABOUT 1 MILLION people gathered on Valentine's Day 2024 to revel in Kansas City's second straight Super Bowl championship, and for Loudermill, the day was supposed to be cathartic. It was the one-year anniversary of the death of his father, Denton Sr., who was also an avid Chiefs fan. It had been a hard year and a half for the family -- Loudermill's mother died in September 2022 -- and his siblings said he often talked about how much he missed her. He rode to downtown Kansas City that Wednesday morning with his brother, Quincy, and another sister, Stephanie Fairweather. They had walked a long distance to get to their spot, and after taking in the festivities for about an hour, Fairweather figured that was enough. She was tired, and she told Loudermill she was leaving with Quincy. But the parade wasn't over, and Loudermill wanted to stay. ""Don't worry about me,"" he told her. ""I'll be all right. I built these streets."" Loudermill was having fun with a million new friends, drinking and socializing with just about anybody. This was normal for him, Fairweather said. ""Everybody loves him. He likes to talk and play with everyone."" Shortly after 11 a.m., the open-top double-decker buses loaded with Chiefs players rolled through the 2-mile parade route lined by fans, some of whom had camped out the night before. People climbed trees and street poles or stood on rooftops for better views. Kansas City Public Schools canceled classes for the occasion. Following the parade, fans assembled outside Union Station for a rally that kicked off just before 1 p.m. Players gave victory speeches, and tight end Travis Kelce sang Garth Brooks' ""Friends in Low Places."" At 1:48 p.m., the rally ended with a final burst of confetti. Less than a minute later, police said, the sound of gunfire was heard on the west side of the stage near Union Station -- which was the site of the 2023 NFL draft. According to court documents, the gunfire erupted after one group confronted another for staring at them. Local radio host Lisa Lopez-Galvan was killed and 22 people ages 8 to 47 were injured, police said. Jackson County prosecutors said three men were arrested in connection with the shooting: Lyndell Mays, Dominic Miller and Terry Young. All three face charges of felony murder and two counts of armed criminal action. Mays is also charged with unlawful use of a weapon and causing a catastrophe, while Miller faces an additional charge of unlawful use of a firearm. Young is also charged with unlawful use of a weapon. In the moments after the shooting, Loudermill called his sister to tell her what happened. He told Paul he thought a child was shot. Paul told ESPN that her brother was ""a little intoxicated, just like everybody else was down there,"" but not slurring or ""talking crazy."" She heard police in the background telling him to move, so she told him to ""just get out of the way"" before his phone went dead. She tried calling him back and assumed he'd return the call, even joking to herself, ""He'll call me from jail."" Police said that as officers tried to clear the area, help the injured and get emergency crews through, they briefly detained Loudermill and handcuffed him to prevent interference. No criminal charges were filed, and he wasn't arrested -- but the photo of him sitting on the curb, in handcuffs, was enough for a story to suddenly play out on the public stage. ""He just thought people were taking pictures, you know, because there was a shooting,"" Lassiter Saunders said. As news of the violence broke nationally, social media posts homed in on Loudermill. On X, the account of U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., posted a photo of Loudermill in handcuffs. ""One of the Kansas City Chiefs victory parade shooters has been identified as an illegal Alien,"" it said. The accounts of Missouri state senators Rick Brattin and Denny Hoskins, now Missouri's secretary of state, reposted on X a photo of Loudermill with text that identified him as 44-year-old Sahil Omar, an ""illegal immigrant."" Both state senators' accounts shared a post by @DeepTruthIntel, a handle that no longer exists. Both accounts tagged then-President Joe Biden and implied that his open-border policies contributed to the crime. Loudermill was born and raised in Olathe, Kansas. Multiple media outlets have reported that the name Sahil Omar is fake and that the description previously has been used on social media with similarly false claims about other violent acts. The post on Burchett's page has since been deleted, and eventually the account posted that he misidentified Loudermill as being an ""illegal alien"" but didn't retract the statement about him being one of the shooters. By midafternoon the day of the parade, Loudermill's world -- and his sister's phone -- were blowing up. The calls started about 15 minutes after her conversation with her brother dropped. By then the photos were circulating all over social media, with family and friends doing double takes and sharing the same reaction. ""Every single person that I heard from [said], 'Oh, I know this is not true,'"" Paul said. ""He would never do anything like that."" Denton Loudermill Jr. worked with attorney LaRonna Lassiter Saunders in the aftermath of the wrongful accusations that he was the gunman at the parade rally. Courtesy LaRonna Lassiter Saunders AFTER AUTHORITIES RELEASED Loudermill, he walked to a Wendy's to try to find a ride back to his home 30 minutes away in Kansas. He noticed people looking at him, then down at their phones. When Fairweather arrived to pick him up, officers were questioning him again. ""We just went through this,"" he told them, and then they let him go. Kansas City police said the department received a call for service about a ""suspicious person,"" but responding officers determined at Wendy's that a report was not needed. His daughters had been at the parade, too, and went to a different restaurant. They were reeling from a call they'd received from their dad about the shooting, his oldest daughter, Raven, 24, said, ""and then the next thing you know it's all over the TVs."" Raven's fears began to snowball. She worked at a school; she was a role model for children; and everyone in the small town in which she lived knew her and her last name. ""I was very fearful that it would affect my character, where I was from and the people I'm surrounded by,"" she said. ""I didn't want them to view me differently and be like, 'Oh, she was raised by him. Was he the one that did it?' ""I immediately knew my dad would never do that, but other people that don't know him don't know that."" His children described him as a ""big old teddy bear"" who, before the parade, was always smiling, happy-go-lucky and energetic. He'd take them to Fairview Park, a recreational space near the railroad tracks where he had hung out since he was young, and play basketball and have cookouts. They'd go to the zoo and Disney on Ice and eat gas station pizza. Loudermill loved the Chiefs, sports and making people laugh. The line he used the day of the parade -- ""I built these streets"" -- was one of his common sayings. It meant that he'd be fine, that he'd get home, whether it was taking the bus or catching a ride from someone. His mom nicknamed him ""Y-A"" after Hall of Fame quarterback Y.A. Tittle, and the name stuck with his siblings. Loudermill valued his time with family and friends. ""He loved his people deeply,"" daughter Raven Loudermill said. His own social media life mainly consisted of Facebook interactions. He posted photos of his family and often sent his siblings dance videos or memes he thought were funny. Paul said most of those happy Facebook Messenger exchanges stopped after the parade shooting. His family said Loudermill lived a simple life. He worked at a car wash and often could be seen riding his bike around town. He had a history of legal troubles. In 2016 and 2017, he was booked by the Johnson County Sheriff's Department on charges including burglary of motor vehicles, misdemeanor theft and felony interference with law enforcement. He also had multiple DUI-related incidents, including a 2020 arrest for driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. In 2021, he was booked again for a court-ordered commitment related to that DUI case. ""No one said Denton was an angel or didn't have a past,"" Lassiter Saunders said. ""But nobody knew Denton -- these [politicians] did not know Denton. He didn't have anything to do with that shooting, and so regardless of what his history was ... it had no bearing on what they did and said because they didn't know him from you or I. ""All of this is hindsight, but it didn't matter because they picked a random individual, did not check their information and essentially ruined his life."" Social media accounts of public officials, including U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, shared false information about Loudermill on platforms like X shortly after the shooting. Tim Burchett/X (formerly Twitter) U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee was one of several political officials whose social media account posted misinformation with photographs of Loudermill being detained. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call Inc. via Getty Images THE MISSOURI FREEDOM CAUCUS is part of the State Freedom Caucus Network, a group of Republican state senators across the country who aim to pull the party further to the right . It is described on its X account as being committed to ""protecting life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for Missourians."" The account on X shared the post from @DeepTruthIntel with the photo of Loudermill handcuffed at the parade, falsely claiming he was an illegal immigrant. The X accounts of Hoskins and Brattin, both caucus members at the time, quickly shared the false claim. The caucus later deleted its post and issued a retraction , acknowledging that Loudermill wasn't the shooter and saying it wanted to clear his name. At a Feb. 22, 2024, news conference in Jefferson City, Missouri, a Kansas City Star reporter asked Brattin whether he had apologized to Loudermill. ""There's nothing that I even see worth that,"" he told reporters. ""We've done nothing, and you know, I have no comment,"" said Brattin, who didn't respond to messages from ESPN. Two lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri against Hoskins and Brattin alleged defamation and that Loudermill was falsely identified as an ""illegal alien"" and a ""shooter"" at the parade. They originally were filed in Kansas but have since been refiled in Missouri for jurisdiction reasons. ""They picked a random individual, did not check their information and essentially ruined his life."" LaRonna Lassiter Saunders According to the suits, the posts caused Loudermill reputational harm, mental distress and death threats. The complaints sought a minimum of $75,000 each in damages, citing false light invasion of privacy and libel. The lawsuits claimed that the posts were knowingly false, widely shared and unrelated to public concern. Loudermill also filed a defamation lawsuit in Kansas against Missouri state Sen. Nick Schroer, which was dismissed. It wasn't refiled in Missouri because, although Schroer's account reposted the Missouri Freedom Caucus post, it was asking for clarification on the shooter's identity rather than pointing at Loudermill. In response to an ESPN request for comment, a communications manager for Hoskins in his current role as Missouri's secretary of state said the ""matter doesn't pertain to the scope or duties of the Missouri secretary of state's office. As such, the office -- nor Secretary Hoskins -- can or will comment."" Burchett's account had posted the same photo of Loudermill. After deleting the post, the account shared a screenshot of the original and wrote: ""It has come to my attention that in one of my previous posts, one of the shooters was identified as an illegal alien. This was based on multiple incorrect news reports stating that. I have removed the post."" His correction did not clarify that Loudermill wasn't involved in the shooting. The deadline to refile the suit against Burchett passed because of difficulties finding a D.C.-based attorney within the statute of limitations in the jurisdiction, Lassiter Saunders said. But the lawsuits against Brattin and Hoskins were refiled. On Oct. 7, a Missouri judge denied requests by Brattin and Hoskins to have the respective suits against them dismissed. Burchett is known for inflammatory remarks that become viral. Less than two weeks after the parade shooting, a reporter for the Tennessee Holler, an audience-supported progressive news site, asked Burchett on camera why he didn't apologize to Loudermill, to which he responded: ""Your mother told me, allegedly, that you were the second-biggest disappointment in her life."" In a separate exchange, he mocked a reporter's question on national security by responding with a ""your mother"" joke, asking the reporter if he trusts his mother to make his Hot Pockets and charge his Game Boy every night. Loudermill thought it was important for Burchett to be held accountable because of his larger platform and position as a member of Congress. Burchett's personal X account currently has more than 350,000 followers, and his congressional account has more than 180,000. ""My brother wasn't political,"" Fairweather said. ""He didn't vote. He wasn't involved in that, so it has nothing to do with politics or anything other than he was falsely accused."" On a spring afternoon in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C., after a foreign affairs subcommittee hearing, an ESPN reporter approached Burchett to ask about the post. ""Call my office,"" he responded. His scheduler directed ESPN to the campaign manager, who declined two requests for comment. The photo of Loudermill decked in the red sweatsuit and handcuffs continued to stalk him. At the car wash where he worked, his family said, Loudermill would watch people drive up, apparently recognize his face and search their phones. His attorney said some people would sympathize; others would look scared or angry at him. Lassiter Saunders said he was dealing with that ""every day, even up until the day he passed."" In late March, she met Loudermill and his sister Reba Paul at a library in Olathe to give them an update on the case. Lassiter Saunders described Loudermill's last 14 months as an ""emotional roller coaster."" He lost roughly 25 pounds after the parade shooting and went from despondent to hopeful to hopeless at times, as the lawsuits dragged on with no resolution in sight. The dismissal of the Burchett case, along with his viral quips on social media, were gut punches that sank her client into a deeper abyss. ""So then he's thinking, 'These people in power, people with money, can do whatever they want and harm whoever they want,'"" she said. But on that day at the library in late March, Loudermill seemed all right. She reminded him that the wheels of justice are sometimes slow but that he hadn't been forgotten. She told him that they were going to keep fighting. They'd explore everything possible to clear his name and make him whole. It was their last meeting. A few weeks later, on the last full day of his life, Loudermill sent the early-morning text: ""Is everything OK?"" Denton Loudermill's family has decided to continue with the lawsuits he was pursuing before his death. Courtesy LaRonna Lassiter Saunders THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S report described an average man: 49 years old, 191 pounds and just over 5 feet, 10 inches. He was dressed in black jeans, a black belt and black shoes and was carrying a black towel, a pair of dice, his driver's license, a debit card and some loose change. He was reported to be intoxicated at the time of his death and had been drinking ""in excess"" the previous two days. According to autopsy and toxicology reports from the Johnson County medical examiner's office, Loudermill died accidentally from cocaine, synthetic marijuana and alcohol. Heart disease and long-term alcohol use were listed as contributing factors. The report said Loudermill had a documented history of post-traumatic stress and depression but no signs of suicidal intent. At autopsy, early decomposition and contusions on his forehead and arms also were noted. The fact that he had drugs in his system surprised Paul. The presence of alcohol didn't. ""We had been down this road before with the alcohol,"" she said, ""and they had given him medication that made him not like the taste of alcohol, and then he quit. He ended up back drinking again, but then he had said he wanted help. ""It was really troubling for me because I was like, he was really trying to escape. He's trying to escape all of these feelings, you know, the loss of Mama, the loss of Daddy, and then this stuff and people thinking that he's -- I mean, imagine somebody thinking that you're a killer."" Earlier this year, Loudermill decided he was ready to get help for his mental health. He started to get counseling in March. Paul said her brother was undergoing lab work to determine what medicine would work best. On April 10, Paul picked him up from work. Her grandkids were in the car, and they went to McDonald's because Loudermill wanted ice cream. She's glad they had that time together, bantering about how he got shorted on his ice cream. For a year, she had looked for signs of the old Denton and had tried to encourage him to leave his house and be more social. His favorite rapper, Too Short, was coming to a festival in Kansas City in late June, and over the winter, she had asked him to go. He said no. ""Too many people,"" he would say. But on that day they went to McDonald's, he told her he wanted to go to the concert. It surprised her and gave her hope that, after three weeks of therapy, maybe her old brother was coming back. He had an appointment with his therapist scheduled for the following day -- the day they found him dead. Now, Paul's life is full of wondering. If Denton had gotten help a few months earlier, would it have made a difference? Would he be here, his old self, riding his bike around the neighborhood, stopping to talk to everybody? Their grandfather is a pastor, she said, and when she's lost in these questions, she tells herself that God doesn't make mistakes. She said God called her brother home. Loudermill's memorial service in May was a barbecue at Fairview Park in Olathe with his family and friends. He would have turned 50 on June 8 and was supposed to have a birthday party in the park with his favorites -- ribs, hamburgers, chicken, pork and no vegetables. The family served that food at the memorial and asked mourners to wear red or ""anything Chiefs-themed to show your spirit and honor one of the biggest fans we've ever known."" Lassiter Saunders, dressed in a long-sleeved red shirt and matching pants, took in the scene as the trains rumbled by on a bright Saturday afternoon. She'd been in frequent touch with family members since his death but waited to ask about the lawsuits against the two Missouri senators. If they wanted to drop them, she said, she understood. That was Denton's fight. They wanted to press on, and in August, Loudermill's estate was substituted for Denton's name in the lawsuits, which were filed in District Court for the Western District of Missouri. ""We can't let them get away with this,"" Paul told her. A few weeks later, the Kansas City Chiefs' season started without one of their biggest fans from Olathe. Paul, who owns a cookie shop in town, thinks about her brother every time she makes peanut butter cookies -- Denton's favorite -- or when a family birthday or milestone is celebrated in a muted form. For years, the siblings and their families would gather at Paul's house on autumn Sundays to watch the Chiefs, with massive spreads of food and card games, and Loudermill's booming voice reverberating throughout the house. But now those gatherings are over. It's too hard, Paul said, and too much of a reminder of what they've lost. In late September, the Chiefs faced the Baltimore Ravens -- one of their biggest AFC rivals -- on a Sunday night. Paul and her husband, Mark, watched the Chiefs win in a quiet, empty room. ""He was bigger than life, and he was literally everywhere,"" Paul said. ""So it's like his memories are everywhere. ""It's not the same at all.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46545176/kansas-city-chiefs-super-bowl-parade-rally-fatal-shooting-denton-loudermill-family,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559688_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,674f467c6a84b964850053373b88d8fc550239a3

Voepel began covering women's basketball in 1984, and has been with ESPN since 1996. Oct 15, 2025, 09:00 AM ET Las Vegas Aces president Nikki Fargas poked a little fun at how challenging it is for WNBA franchises to prepare for the biggest free agency period in league history. ""You're going to need to have Plan A, Plan B and Plan 9-1-1,"" Fargas said. ""There is nothing normal about this offseason, so you can't look at it from a normal lens."" Because it was long assumed the players would opt out early from their 2020 collective bargaining agreement, almost everyone not on a rookie contract will be a free agent. The league must also hold an expansion draft for the two new franchises that will join the WNBA in 2026. The league and players must agree on a new CBA before all of this takes place. But once we get to free agency, how chaotic will it be? ""You have to be prepared for multiple scenarios, and different plans for each scenario,"" said Fargas, whose Aces won their third WNBA title in four years last week. ""There's so many great players in this league. But most importantly, we want to keep our core nucleus together."" Four-time MVP A'ja Wilson is at the top of that list. The 29-year-old has played her entire eight-year career with Las Vegas, which drafted her No. 1 in 2018. Will she stay there or can she be lured to another team? Satou Sabally , who just spent her first season with the Phoenix Mercury after five with the Dallas Wings , said it will be interesting to see what dictates different players' choices. ""If you want to win a championship, you need good players around you,"" Sabally said. ""You also want to get your money. So what are the goals of people? What are they willing to do? Maybe they want to carry a team and put themselves on the radar, which is totally understandable. ""Or maybe they are more willing to give a little on the salary side and have a super team."" Much is unknown, but we can speculate on which teams might be most affected by free agent movement -- or lack thereof. Jump to a team: ATL | CHI | CON | DAL | GS | IND | LV | LA | MIN | NY | PHX | SEA | WAS Arike Ogunbowale played in 29 games this season, averaging 15.5 points and 4.1 assists. After seven seasons in Dallas, might the guard be headed elsewhere? Joe Boatman/NBAE via Getty Images Teams that could change a lot Dallas Wings With No. 1 pick Paige Bueckers as the clear franchise star -- and the Wings having the top odds for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft -- this upcoming season will be about Dallas firming up its vision around Bueckers, and it's a future that includes new team facilities now under construction and hiring a new coach to replace Chris Koclanes. A primary offseason question revolves around whether Arike Ogunbowale returns to the franchise she has spent her whole career with. Beyond that, the Wings have a lot of other young players who can provide depth while the team maintains the cap flexibility to take some big swings in free agency. -- Philippou Golden State Valkyries It makes sense that free agents prior to the 2025 past season wanted to see how the first year went for the expansion Valkyries. Safe to say they were impressed by the atmosphere at Chase Center -- which sold out every home game and was nicknamed ""Ballhalla"" -- and the success of Golden State, which became the first expansion team to reach the playoffs in its inaugural season. So in the upcoming free agency, the Valkyries might be able to bring in some bigger stars to play for 2025 Coach of the Year Natalie Nakase. Golden State seems likely to try to bring back its top two scorers from this season: Kayla Thornton , who was limited to 22 games because of injury, and Veronica Burton , who won the league's Most Improved Player award. -- Voepel Chicago Sky On one hand, the Sky had bad luck with injuries, with Courtney Vandersloot missing all but seven games and Angel Reese and Ariel Atkins out for extended periods. But GM Jeff Pagliocca said during exit interviews that the team ""absolutely need[s] to improve the roster"" in free agency, indicating change is on the horizon. After trading the No. 3 pick for Atkins this offseason, the Sky would likely look to re-sign her, and Pagliocca already said they intend to have Vandersloot back once she returns from an ACL tear. Then there's the big question of what happens with Reese. She's not technically a free agent but is someone who could be traded, or request a trade, after a tumultuous end to the season left her status in Chicago in question. -- Philippou Re-signing Kelsey Mitchell -- who has played her entire WNBA career in Indiana -- is a priority this offseason for the Fever. Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images Teams that might not change much Atlanta Dream The Dream won a franchise-record 30 games in coach Karl Smesko's first season, and Allisha Gray had the best season of her career. Keeping free agents Gray, Brionna Jones and Jordin Canada and restricted free agents Rhyne Howard and 2025 Sixth Player of the Year Naz Hillmon would put the Dream in a great position for 2026. We'll see if center Brittney Griner , who signed with Atlanta this season and moved to a reserve role in August, will also be in the mix to return. -- Voepel Indiana Fever Given their slew of injuries throughout the 2025 season, the Fever didn't get to really see what their revamped roster from this past free agency could have done if healthy, but they still ended up five minutes away from making the WNBA Finals. One thing working in their favor: Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston are still on rookie deals. Indiana GM Amber Cox made it clear the team's top priority is to re-sign Kelsey Mitchell , who enjoyed an MVP-caliber season and has spoken glowingly of her relationship with coach Stephanie White and of her time in the organization. When asked how much roster change she anticipated this offseason, Cox focused on how special this 2025 group's chemistry was, and said that while there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding free agency, ""a lot of these players will be in our plans."" -- Philippou Las Vegas Aces The enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Fargas said the Aces have been extremely fortunate to keep former No. 1 picks Wilson and Jackie Young together for seven seasons. Chelsea Gray has played with those two for five seasons. The trio established the foundation for the Aces even before coach Becky Hammon arrived in 2022. They have had a good relationship with Hammon, as does Jewell Loyd , who played this past season for the Aces after spending a decade with Seattle. If the four of them stay, Las Vegas picks up where it left off this season. ""It starts with, 'What are our core values, and are they aligned with everyone we've kept and brought in?'"" Fargas said. ""And the answer is, 'Yes.' We've been able to maintain consistency because the players feel valued."" -- Voepel Phoenix Mercury The Mercury added forwards Sabally and Alyssa Thomas this season, and they formed a strong trio with Kahleah Copper when all were healthy. Despite returning just two players from 2024, the Mercury's chemistry was very good, Sabally said, and got them all the way to the WNBA Finals. Keeping the key players together should be a big benefit for Phoenix. ""I think we have a really good thing going here,"" Sabally said during the Finals. ""People are less inclined to leave this spot just because of the resources and the comfort that comes with [this franchise]. But also truly the culture. You can tell the staff likes to be around each other, the players like to be around each other. ""It's a business, and you never forget that, but you want an environment that creates a family atmosphere and where you feel heard, and there's clear communication. Rather than things being shady or messy."" -- Voepel Washington Mystics The Mystics' best players this past season were Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen , two of the five rookies they had on contract. Washington has just three unrestricted free agents -- Alysha Clark , Stefanie Dolson and Jade Melbourne -- none of whom are in the top tier. With three picks in the first round of the 2026 draft, Washington might focus the most there to add to the young talent it already has as it continues the rebuilding process. -- Voepel GM Jonathan Kolb said in his exit interview that he has the ""utmost confidence"" Liberty players Sabrina Ionescu, above, Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones will be back. But a much different supporting cast might surround the trio in New York. Michael Hirschuber/Getty Images The most difficult teams to predict Connecticut Sun Though 2025 got off to a rocky start for the Sun, it ended with a clear direction as the organization looks to rebuild around a young core of Leila Lacan , Saniya Rivers , Aneesah Morrow and Aaliyah Edwards , all of whom are under contract for the foreseeable future. General manager Morgan Tuck will have decisions to make from there on which players she wants to surround them with -- for example, might Marina Mabrey and Tina Charles return to provide a veteran presence? Either way, the franchise will hope to have more firm answers on where the team will play beyond 2026 so that it can answer free agents' questions. -- Philippou Los Angeles Sparks The Sparks are in an interesting situation: They have two stars in Kelsey Plum and Dearica Hamby who seem likely to be re-signed, as well as two young building blocks in Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson . And yet the group they fielded in 2025 wasn't able to make the playoffs despite arguably having the talent to do so. The front office must determine how much change is needed for L.A. to make it back to the postseason for the first time since 2020, and improving on the defensive end will be chief among those priorities. The Sparks appear to be in a better situation to make free agent pitches, with Plum signing with them this past offseason and a gorgeous new practice facility on the way. -- Philippou Minnesota Lynx This year, the Lynx brought back a very similar team to the one that lost in the 2024 WNBA Finals. That worked out great, giving Minnesota the best regular-season record, until things went awry in the playoffs. Minnesota's semifinals loss to Phoenix might push the Lynx to make more changes for 2026. Star Napheesa Collier is expected to return -- she has played her entire career with the Lynx since she was drafted in 2019 -- but Minnesota could look to add more scoring from the small forward spot and perhaps a ""true"" point guard. Free agency could help the Lynx, and they also have a lottery pick thanks to a 2024 trade with Chicago. -- Voepel New York Liberty There's one big change in Brooklyn we know with certainty: A new head coach will replace Sandy Brondello. How much overhaul do we see from there? Early indications are that the Liberty's core looks poised to return, as general manager Jonathan Kolb said in his exit interview that he has the ""utmost confidence"" Breanna Stewart , Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones will be back. But even if those three are back in the fold, the cast of characters surrounding them could change based on the team's coaching hire. Kolb said New York would be interested in bringing back Emma Meesseman , while also acknowledging Meesseman ""doesn't make decisions before necessary,"" and said that the organization is ""always evaluating"" who the best backcourt partner alongside Ionescu is. -- Philippou Seattle Storm After a first-round loss to the Aces, Storm coach Noelle Quinn was let go. How Seattle moves forward could depend a fair amount on who the new coach is. The Storm have young post player Dominique Malonga on a rookie deal, but another, Ezi Magbegor , is a free agent. So are veterans Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins , both of whom will turn 36 next season. Seattle could stay with its core -- if those players want to stay -- but the Storm also might look to make some big changes. -- Voepel",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46597951/wnba-free-agents-move-2026-season-cba-lockout,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560395_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,26c841a75fffb9a762f7fa785b0bbfd30bed839a
af39c21ed6e1,WNBA,,"When the Las Vegas Aces won their third WNBA title in four seasons, the debate Friday immediately turned to whether they had cemented their status as the league's next dynasty. Now it's time to see where this Aces' title team ranks among the league's 29 champions. It's not easy an easy task. There was a big gap this season between the 2025 Aces at their worst versus at their best. Perhaps no other team in league history reversed its fortunes so dramatically, going from 14-14 after a 53-point loss on Aug. 2 to completing a 4-0 sweep of the WNBA Finals on Oct. 10. The Aces ended the regular season on a 16-game winning streak, but their playoff run had its drama. They were nearly upset in the first round, winning the deciding Game 3 by one point against Seattle. They went to overtime in the deciding Game 5 of the semifinals against Indiana. And Games 1 and 3 of the Finals versus Phoenix were decided by a combined five points. All of that is why the 2025 Aces aren't in the top 10 like their 2022 and 2023 championship predecessors. Speaking of which: Among the biggest challenges for assembling this list is ranking champions who are from the same franchise and were made up of mostly the same players. We've attempted to split those hairs. There is more than one way to assess the teams. ESPN's Michael Voepel ranked the teams based on discussions with coaches and players around the league, plus some old-fashioned subjectivity. ESPN's Kevin Pelton ranked the champions 1 through 29 using a similar statistical model to the one he developed to determine the NBA's top teams. Based on the predictive power of point differential, it starts with that mark in the regular season. Ultimately, being at the bottom in these rankings isn't that much different from being at the top. They're all champions. Regular season and playoff records: 34-6, 8-1 Defeated the New York Liberty 3-1 in Finals Pelton overall rank: 2 RS differential: +12.6 (3rd among champions) PO rating: +20.3 (2nd among champions) Rating: +13.7 (first among champions) As good as they were in winning the 2022 championship, the Aces were even better in 2023. They ranked No. 1 in scoring and defense during the regular season and stumbled just once in the playoffs, in Game 3 of the Finals. A'ja Wilson got her first WNBA Finals MVP honor for her performance in 2023; she won again for the 2025 Finals. In Chelsea Gray , Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young , the Aces also had trio of guards who were among the best backcourts in league history . Candace Parker, a free-agent signee who was expected to be a big part of the Aces' 2023 title run, was sidelined by foot surgery that July. The Aces also lost starters Gray and Kiah Stokes before Game 4 and still won the title, illustrating how good the chemistry was for the team. The Las Vegas bench -- then led by Alysha Clark , Cayla George, Sydney Colson and Kierstan Bell -- came through when they were needed most. -- Voepel play 1:42 How the Aces' resiliency led them to back-to-back championships Rebecca Lobo examines how the Aces won the battle of the superteams vs. the Liberty and became back-to-back champions. 2. 2000 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 27-5, 6-0 Defeated the New York Liberty 2-0 in Finals This was the last of Houston's four consecutive title teams, the end of the Comets' version of ""Camelot."" In 2000, the WNBA was at 16 teams and most of the former ABL players were in their second year in the league. Sheryl Swoopes won her first of three MVP awards and two-time MVP Cynthia Cooper played her last full season at age 37. As was the case with the other Houston championship teams, the stars carried them: Swoopes and Cooper averaged 35 minutes a game, Tina Thompson 34 and Janeth Arcain 30.5. Fifth starter, Tiffani Johnson (22.2), was the only other player who averaged at least 20 minutes a game. With three future Hall of Famers (Cooper, Swoopes, Thompson), Houston didn't need much statistically from its reserves. The Comets' bench players knew their roles, and the team knew how to win. This title ended the dynasty -- the Los Angeles Sparks were ascending -- but what a finish. -- Voepel The Comets weren't the top seed in the playoffs. Despite the best differential in league history, Houston finished one game back of the 28-4 Sparks before sweeping Los Angeles in the best-of-three conference finals. Five of the Comets' six playoff wins came by eight points or fewer, but all three of their opponents went 20-12 or better during a top-heavy year where the league expanded by four teams. -- Pelton Sheryl Swoopes, left, was the 2000 WNBA MVP, and Cynthia Cooper, right, won her fourth straight WNBA Finals MVP award as the Comets won the last of their four titles. Bill Baptist/NBAE via Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 18-4, 6-0 Defeated the Las Vegas Aces 3-0 in Finals Bringing back the same core that won the 2018 title into a bubble season marked by opt-outs of several stars, the Storm entered 2020 as heavy favorites. Seattle wasn't the No. 1 seed in the playoffs, losing a tiebreaker to Las Vegas, but dominated with veteran point guard Sue Bird back in the lineup. After a COVID-19 scare postponed their opening semifinals game, the Storm never looked back, going 6-0 in the playoffs with five of the six wins by double-digits -- including a 33-point blowout to close out the Aces. -- Pelton Bird, part of all four Storm title teams, has ruminated over which of them was ""best."" Lauren Jackson was the superstar of the 2004 and 2010 Storm title teams; her counterpart in 2018 and 2020 was Breanna Stewart . Bird said an edge goes to the very similarly constructed 2018 and 2020 teams due to the presence of guard Jewell Loyd . Bird then gives a nod to the overall depth and chemistry to the 2020 Storm, who were first in the league in offensive and defensive rating. ""The way we shot 3's, the way we moved the ball -- if you took something away, we'd just keep it moving,"" Bird said. ""We talked before every game that we were going to wear teams out with the pace that we played."" -- Voepel The Seattle Storm's 2020 championship team had incredible overall depth and chemistry, and led the WNBA in offensive and defensive rating. Julio Aguilar/Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 7-0 Defeated the Atlanta Dream 3-0 in Finals This was the second of four Lynx titles in a seven-season span. They didn't have the best regular-season record among Lynx champs; both 2011 and 2017 went 27-7 (and the 2016 runners-up were 28-6). But coach Cheryl Reeve said the ""core four"" of the franchise -- Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Maya Moore and Lindsay Whalen -- were near the peak of their collective powers in 2013. They all averaged double figures in scoring, led by Moore's 18.5 PPG. The fifth starter was Janel McCarville, Whalen's former University of Minnesota teammate, and that pairing again thrilled Gophers fans. In 2012, Minnesota lost 3-1 in the Finals to Indiana, which irked the Lynx because they were five games better than the Fever in the regular-season standings. The 2013 team didn't allow any openings in the playoffs, sweeping Seattle, Phoenix and Atlanta. -- Voepel This Lynx championship team was the league's best from start to finish, sweeping its way to a title with the best playoff point differential ever (+15.4 PPG). We were denied playoff matchups against either of the other two teams to win at least 20 games during the regular season because both Chicago and Los Angeles were upset earlier in the postseason. -- Pelton 5. 1998 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 27-3, 4-1 Defeated the Phoenix Mercury 2-1 in Finals More on Pelton's ranking system The statistical model ESPN's Kevin Pelton developed starts with point differential in the regular season. Pelton then added playoff point differential and adjusted it for the regular-season performance of the opponents each team faced en route to the title to give more credit for beating another powerful opponent than a lesser competitor. There are two key differences from the rating Pelton used for the NBA and the WNBA version. First, instead of giving equal weight to play in the regular season and playoffs, he weighed each of them by games played to acknowledge the greater variability in the shorter WNBA postseason. (That gap has narrowed somewhat by the WNBA going to a best-of-seven format in the Finals this year.) Second, since the WNBA hasn't gone through as many different eras, he did not use an adjustment for quality of play in a given season. After winning the WNBA's inaugural championship with limited contributions from Swoopes, who played just nine games after giving birth to son, Jordan, and did not score in the 1997 playoffs, the Comets teamed a prime Swoopes with reigning MVP Cooper and second-year forward Thompson. The result was a 27-3 record, still the best winning percentage in league history. Houston's playoff rating isn't quite as relatively strong because the Comets were taken the distance in the best-of-three Finals by a 19-11 Phoenix Mercury team. -- Pelton Cooper said if she had to pick just one Comets championship team as her favorite, it would be this one. As Kevin noted, the team's .900 winning percentage remains the best in WNBA history. Swoopes was second on the team in scoring at 15.6 PPG to Cooper's 22.7. Cooper won her second consecutive MVP award; she was Finals MVP for all four championship teams. And there's another reason this team is dear to Cooper's heart. Her close friend, Kim Perrot, the Comets' spark plug point guard, averaged 8.5 points and 4.7 assists in what would be her last season in the WNBA. Perrot had 13 points, five rebounds and four assists in the title-clinching win over the Mercury. Five months later, she was diagnosed with cancer and died in August 1999 at age 32. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 29-5, 7-1 Defeated the Chicago Sky 3-0 in Finals Amid the Lynx dynasty from 2011 to 2017, the Mercury owned this season. Their 29 wins is a WNBA record, and they were first in offensive and defensive rating. All five starters -- Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner , Candice Dupree, Penny Taylor and DeWanna Bonner -- averaged double digits in scoring. Their only loss in the playoffs came to Minnesota in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals, but they bounced back to win the series with an 18-point Game 3 victory. In the WNBA Finals, Chicago was no match. Taurasi, who averaged 16.2 PPG in the regular season and 21.9 PPG in the playoffs, was WNBA Finals MVP for the second time. -- Voepel The 2014 Phoenix team still holds the best winning percentage for any team outside the expansion era. Relative to that record, the Mercury's +9.5 differential wasn't especially dominating, the reason Phoenix falls outside the top five in my rankings. In the playoffs, Phoenix was outstanding, beating the defending champion Lynx 2-1 in the conference finals and sweeping a 15-19 Chicago team in the Finals by an average of 18.3 PPG. -- Pelton 7. 2017 Minnesota Lynx Regular season and playoff records: 27-7, 6-2 Defeated the Los Angeles Sparks 3-2 in Finals The top-rated one of the Lynx's four title teams in my model fully integrated Sylvia Fowles, who won MVP and Finals MVP, to the core of the team that had already won three championships in the previous six years. After sweeping Washington in the semifinals, Minnesota rallied from a 2-1 deficit to win a Finals rematch against the Sparks in five games. -- Pelton Minnesota was still smarting over a 3-2 Finals loss to Los Angeles in 2016, and the teams were again archrivals in 2017. Minnesota was first in the league in offensive and defensive rating and Los Angeles was second in both. Target Center was being renovated, so the Lynx's home games in the 2017 playoffs were at the University of Minnesota' Williams Arena, where Whalen had played in college. The decisive 85-76 Game 5 win came in a packed and cacophonous Williams, and Fowles was Finals MVP for a second time (she also won in 2015). -- Voepel Maya Moore, Seimone Augustus, Lindsay Whalen and Rebekkah Brunson led Minnesota to the 2013 title. The Lynx core only got stronger when Sylvia Fowles joined the team two years later. Scott Cunningham/NBAE via Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 6-3 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 3-2 in Finals Compared to a regular season that saw the Mystics win a record 13 games by 20-plus points -- four more than any other team in league history -- their playoff run was a slog. Washington outscored Las Vegas by just one point in a hard-fought four-game semifinals win, then needed the full five games to beat Connecticut in a classic Finals. A formula that puts more emphasis on the playoffs would drop the Mystics in the statistical rankings. -- Pelton Elena Delle Donne said this was the best team she has ever played on: ""Not just talent-wise, but the way emotionally and mentally we were so on-point with one another. That's what took us to the next level."" The Mystics also overcame a back injury that hampered Delle Donne during the Finals and has impacted her career since. Delle Donne was the MVP in 2019, but teammate Emma Meesseman was the Finals MVP, averaging 17.8 points in the championship series. -- Voepel 9. 2022 Las Vegas Aces Regular season and playoff records: 26-10, 8-2 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 3-1 in Finals The 2022 Aces ran into more challenges in the regular season than the 2023 version of Las Vegas. But by the playoffs, they were in control as the league's best team. In coach Becky Hammon's first season with the franchise , the Aces changed their playing style -- 3-pointers became a far bigger part of the offense -- and Plum and Young matured into even better players. Wilson won her second regular-season MVP award and was Defensive Player of the Year. Then Gray was on fire throughout the playoffs, winning Finals MVP. It was a big achievement for a franchise that started when the league did in 1997, in Utah, moved to San Antonio, and then found its championship home in Las Vegas under owner Mark Davis. He paid top dollar to bring Hammon from the NBA, where she was a San Antonio Spurs assistant, and it was a great investment. -- Voepel 10. 1999 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 26-6, 4-2 Defeated the New York Liberty 2-1 in Finals Only by contrast to Houston's championship teams before and after would the 26-6 Comets look unspectacular. Houston came within Teresa Weatherspoon's unforgettable buzzer-beating heave of sweeping the playoffs and came back to finish off New York in the winner-take-all Game 3 of the Finals to hoist the trophy a third time. -- Pelton In 1999, almost all the former ABL standouts had transitioned into and strengthened the WNBA. That didn't stop the Comets, who added former ABL player Sonja Henning at point guard. Houston's standouts were the same as in 1998: Cooper, Swoopes and Thompson. Bulgarian center Polina Tzekova, then 31, made the most of her only WNBA season, starting every game for Houston in 1999. Ultimately, there was a melancholy feel to the 1999 championship for the Comets. Their former point guard Perrot died from cancer on Aug. 19. On Sept. 5, Houston secured ""3 for 10"" -- its motto in winning its third title in honor of Perrot, who wore No. 10. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 32-8, 8-3 Defeated the Minnesota Lynx 3-2 in Finals Pelton overall rank: 11 RS differential: +9.2 (10th among champions) PO rating: +9.4 (19th among champions) Rating: +9.2 (11th among champions) It took 27 years since the launch of the Liberty as an original WNBA franchise in 1997, but New York finally broke through for its first championship. After finishing with the best record in the league, the Liberty defeated defending champion Las Vegas in the semifinals and then avenged a Commissioner's Cup final loss to Minnesota in the Finals. The deciding Game 5 vs. the Lynx nearly extended the Liberty's long postseason heartbreak. But a late foul (still disputed by Minnesota) sent Breanna Stewart to the line. She scored the tying points to send the game into overtime, where New York prevailed 67-62. Jonquel Jones won the Finals MVP honor as she got her first title. Sabrina Ionescu also won the championship for the first time. It was the third title for Stewart, who won two championships in Seattle. -- Voepel The New York Liberty won their first WNBA title in 2024. Jonquel Jones was Finals MVP. Elsa/Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 28-4, 6-1 Defeated the Charlotte Sting 2-0 in Finals After being denied by the Comets a year earlier, the Sparks became the first championship team besides Houston in the league's fifth season. Los Angeles matched the 28-4 record of the previous season with a slightly better point differential. The Sparks followed their lone playoff loss, by one point to the Sacramento Monarchs in the conference finals, with three wins by at least 20 points in their final four postseason games. -- Pelton The Sparks learned a lot going against Houston for four seasons before making their championship breakthrough. Los Angeles star Lisa Leslie has joked, ""Thank God that Coop retired,"" in reference to the Houston's Cooper ending her playing career after the 2000 season (she returned for four games in 2003 at age 40). Leslie, Mwadi Mabika, Tamecka Dixon and DeLisha Milton-Jones all averaged in double figures during this title run. Leslie was MVP for the season and the Finals. -- Voepel 13. 2011 Minnesota Lynx Regular season and playoff records: 27-7, 7-1 Defeated the Atlanta Dream 3-0 in Finals In 2010, Minnesota got a new coach (Reeve) and also added Whalen (trade) and Brunson (Sacramento dispersal draft). The next year brought the opening championship of the Lynx dynasty as No. 1 pick Moore was Rookie of the Year. The 22-year-old Moore started alongside Taj McWilliams-Franklin, who turned 41 two weeks after the Finals ended. This Lynx team really spanned the age/experience gamut. The season also brought a well-deserved spotlight to Augustus, who became the original building block for the dynasty when she was drafted No. 1 in 2006. She led the 2011 Lynx in scoring in the regular season (16.2) and playoffs (22.0) and was the Finals MVP. -- Voepel The first Lynx title winner announced itself as a contender by winning six more games than any other team during the regular season. Following a hard-fought 2-1 win in the opening round over the San Antonio Silver Stars, Minnesota swept the next two rounds en route to a championship. -- Pelton 14. 2016 Los Angeles Sparks Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 6-3 Defeated the Minnesota Lynx 3-2 in Finals After winning back-to-back titles in 2001-02, the Sparks endured a lot of frustrating ""almost"" in the playoffs. They lost in the WNBA Finals in 2003 and the conference finals in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2012. The playoff format changed in 2016, seeding the top eight teams regardless of conference, and the Sparks made the Finals again. In an epic five-game series, they beat Minnesota 77-76 on Nneka Ogwumike 's putback with 3.1 seconds remaining. Ogwumike was the season MVP and teammate Candace Parker the Finals MVP. It was the last jewel to complete Parker's crown; she already had won two NCAA titles and two Olympic gold medals. -- Voepel That timely rule change allowed the 26-8 Sparks and 28-6 Lynx -- the league's two best teams by a five-game margin -- to meet in the Finals, setting up perhaps the greatest series in league history. -- Pelton 15. 2025 Las Vegas Aces Regular season and playoff records: 30-14, 9-3 Defeated the Phoenix Mercury 4-0 in Finals Pelton overall rank: 13 RS differential: +2.9 (28th among champions) PO rating: +8.7 (22nd among champions) Rating: +4.0 (28th among champions) The 2025 Aces might be the most difficult champion to rank because the first half of their five-month season (counting playoffs) was so different from the second half. These Aces are next to last using Pelton's model, but some key factors elevate them to the middle of the pack in the overall rankings. The first is the play of Wilson , who won her fourth regular-season MVP and second Finals MVP. During the playoffs, she averaged 26.8 PPG, 10.0 RPG, 3.3 assists and 2.5 blocks. Her postseason performance was even greater than in the regular season. She also hit the most crucial shot of the Finals: the game winner with less than a second left in Game 3 to give the Aces a 90-88 victory. The Aces also got a terrific postseason from guards Jackie Young (20.4 PPG, 5.5 APG) and Chelsea Gray (11.2 PPG, 7.3 APG). The Aces' 17-game winning streak (counting Game 1 of the playoffs) is the second longest in WNBA history. And coach Becky Hammon led the Aces to a third championship in four years despite having to replace a key player (guard Kelsey Plum) from the first two title teams. The Aces are the league's ultimate example that it's not how you start, it's how you finish. -- Voepel play 1:54 Jackie Young: A'ja Wilson will be the GOAT when she retires Jackie Young joins ""SportsCenter"" to discuss the Aces' championship and A'ja Wilson's legacy. 16. 2018 Seattle Storm Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 6-2 Defeated the Washington Mystics 3-0 in Finals History repeated itself with the Storm. They had back-to-back No. 1 picks in Jackson and Bird in 2001 and 2002, which led to two titles. Seattle again got consecutive No. 1s in 2015 and 2016 with Loyd and Stewart, which also led to two titles. This 2018 championship in a lot of ways was won in the semifinals, when the Storm held off Phoenix in an epic Game 5 in which Bird took over in the fourth quarter. In the finals, Seattle wasn't going to be denied and swept the Mystics. And the Storm looked to be a strong threat to become the first repeat champion since the Sparks in 2001-02. But an Achilles injury kept Stewart out in 2019. When she returned in 2020, the Storm picked up where they had left off in 2018. -- Voepel With Los Angeles and Minnesota both eliminated in advance of the semifinals after back-to-back Finals meetings, the Storm emerged as the league's best team, improving by 11 wins under first-year head coach Dan Hughes with Stewart winning MVP. -- Pelton 17. 2010 Seattle Storm Regular season and playoff records: 28-6, 7-0 Defeated the Atlanta Dream 3-0 in Finals All of ESPN.

Sign Up Now A rating that focused on record instead of point differential would have the 2010 Storm much higher. Seattle went 28-6 in the regular season and became the first team to go 7-0 in the postseason after the Finals expanded to best-of-five series in 2005. The Storm specialized in close wins, going 9-1 in games decided by five points or fewer in the regular season and winning their last five playoff games by single digits. -- Pelton The 2010 Storm were six games better than any team in the WNBA; no other team in the Western Conference even had a winning record. Jackson won her third MVP award, and she and Bird got to celebrate their second WNBA championship together. Bird, Swin Cash and Svetlana Abrosimova, who had won an NCAA title together at UConn in 2000, all played for this Storm team. Seattle didn't lose at home in 2010, which ended up being Jackson's last full season in the WNBA, as injuries forced her out of the league after 2012. -- Voepel 18. 2005 Sacramento Monarchs Regular season and playoff records: 25-9, 7-1 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 3-1 in Finals After losing in the conference finals three of the previous four years, the Monarchs broke through in 2005, sweeping their way to the Finals and pulling off a mild upset of a 26-8 Connecticut team with home-court advantage in four games. -- Pelton At age 29, Yolanda Griffith entered the WNBA in 1999 from the ABL and was her new league's MVP that year, a perfect target for point guard Ticha Penicheiro. Griffith also won Finals MVP, and it was a career-best year for DeMya Walker, who led the Monarchs in scoring in the regular season and made an All-Star appearance. This was also the first of Rebekkah Brunson's five WNBA titles; her other four came with Minnesota. -- Voepel 19. 2002 Los Angeles Sparks Regular season and playoff records: 25-7, 6-0 Defeated the New York Liberty 2-0 in Finals Coming off back-to-back 28-4 records, the Sparks slipped by three games during a less dominant regular season. They were more impressive during the playoffs, going 7-0 with an average margin of 12.0 PPG. -- Pelton The Sparks' repeat championship seemed more predictable than extraordinary at the time, coming after Houston had won four in a row. But almost two decades later, no franchise has gone back-to-back, so Los Angeles' achievement stands out more now. There isn't much to separate this team from the 2001 Sparks, who had a little better regular-season record. The standout players were the same except for Nikki Teasley, a rookie in 2002 who hit the championship-clinching 3-pointer in Game 2 of the Finals. -- Voepel 20. 2006 Detroit Shock Regular season and playoff records: 23-11, 7-3 Defeated the Sacramento Monarchs 3-2 in Finals After a 23-11 regular season, the Shock upset a 25-9 Connecticut team with a 24-point road win in the deciding Game 3. Detroit got home-court advantage thanks to Sacramento upsetting Los Angeles in the Western Conference finals and used it, rallying from a 2-1 deficit to knock off the defending champs in five games. -- Pelton A big key for this team was the 2005 midseason trade that brought Katie Smith to the Shock. She fit in well with Cash, Cheryl Ford, Deanna Nolan and Ruth Riley, who were all on Detroit's 2003 championship squad. Nolan, a native of nearby Flint, Michigan, was Finals MVP as the Shock prevented Sacramento's attempt at a repeat. In the decisive Game 5, won 80-75 by Detroit, Nolan played all 40 minutes and scored 24 points. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 22-12, 7-3 Defeated the Minnesota Lynx 3-1 in Finals A long-awaited title for Tamika Catchings came as something of a surprise after the Fever finished with the league's fourth-best record during the regular season. Indiana reached a different level in the playoffs, as Mechelle notes below. -- Pelton When Indiana lost its playoff opener 75-66 at home to Atlanta, there was no reason to think anything magical was in the works. Yet two days later, Indiana scored 103 points in beating the Dream, then closed out that series with another victory. The roller coaster wasn't over. The Fever also lost their opener in the East finals to Connecticut and were on the verge of getting swept before pulling Game 2 out of the fire and winning Game 3 on the road. Next up: A Lynx team that had the best record in the league that year. The Fever and Lynx split the first two games of the Finals, but Game 3 was one of the weirdest in WNBA playoff history. The Lynx, who led the league in offensive rating, were held to a season-low 59 points, while Indiana's Shavonte Zellous erupted for 30 points. Indiana had been up 2-1 in the 2009 Finals but couldn't close out that series at home and lost Game 5 at Phoenix. In 2012, franchise legend Catchings and the Fever won Game 4 at home. -- Voepel 22. 2007 Phoenix Mercury Regular season and playoff records: 23-11, 7-2 Defeated the Detroit Shock 3-2 in Finals Three years after winning her third title at UConn, Taurasi won her first WNBA championship. Phoenix's winning formula was coach Paul Westhead's run-and-gun offense, which was first in the league. Defense was not as much a priority; the Mercury were next-to-last in defensive rating. But it worked, with Taurasi, Taylor, Cappie Pondexter and Tangela Smith all averaging double digits in scoring. The Finals matchup with defending champion Detroit got chippy, with Phoenix surviving a physical Game 4 in a 77-76 win. Then the Mercury became the first WNBA team to win a championship on the road, taking Game 5 108-92 at Detroit behind 30 points from Taylor -- who went 18 of 18 from the free throw line -- and 26 points and 10 assists from Finals MVP Pondexter. -- Voepel Despite a 23-11 record, the Mercury had the worst point differential in the regular season of any champion to date. (Whoever wins this year's Finals will surpass them.) Phoenix was much more impressive in the playoffs, sweeping to the Finals and outscoring Detroit by a combined 30 points in a series that went the full five games. -- Pelton 23. 2004 Seattle Storm Regular season and playoff records: 20-14, 6-2 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 2-1 in Finals In a season without a dominant team, the 20-14 Storm had the league's best differential during the regular season, then got home-court advantage throughout the playoffs when the 25-9 Sparks -- who had gone 3-1 against Seattle that season -- were upset in the opening round. Seattle went the distance to beat both Sacramento and Connecticut. -- Pelton This was Seattle's first trip to the WNBA Finals. And this was the last year that the Finals was a best-of-three series. The Storm were on the ropes after a 68-64 opening loss at Connecticut. But they pulled out a 67-65 nail-biter in Game 2 at Seattle, led by Betty Lennox's 27 points. In Game 3, with KeyArena packed with Storm fans wielding thunder sticks, Lennox had 23 points and earned Finals MVP honors as Seattle clinched the title 74-60. -- Voepel 24. 2015 Minnesota Lynx Regular season and playoff records: 22-12, 7-3 Defeated the Indiana Fever 3-2 in Finals Of the Lynx's four title teams, this was the only one with double-digit losses, as Augustus and Whalen both dealt with injuries. But big-time help came via two trades in July: first for guard Renee Montgomery and then for center Fowles, who had sat out the season to that point to force a trade from Chicago. Moore, the 2014 MVP, was again brilliant in 2015, leading the Lynx in scoring in the regular season (20.6 PPG) and the postseason (23.4). She hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to win Game 3 of the Finals vs. Indiana 80-77. The Fever won Game 4, but Fowles cemented her Finals MVP award with 20 points and 11 rebounds in a Game 5 victory. -- Voepel It's surprising to see the Lynx in last in my statistical model given the championship teams two years before and after are both among my top seven, and the next year's runner-up is the best-rated non-champion in WNBA history. Minnesota was still integrating Fowles, acquired midseason, and slogged through the postseason. The Lynx's +2.5 differential in playoff games was lowest for any champion. Minnesota had just two playoff wins by more than seven points -- one of them in the deciding Game 5 of the Finals against Indiana. -- Pelton 25. 2009 Phoenix Mercury Regular season and playoff records: 23-11, 7-4 Defeated the Indiana Fever 3-2 in Finals Thus far, the 2009 Mercury are the only champion in league history to go the distance in every series they played, winning three deciding games. (Phoenix could do that one better this year, winning four deciding games with a potential five-game Finals win.) Naturally, Finals MVP Taurasi was at her best in those games, averaging 25.3 PPG in the elimination wins. -- Pelton This was a good team led by a great player in Taurasi, who won her only regular-season MVP award in 2009. Like the 2007 champions, the Mercury focused on outscoring foes: Phoenix was first in offensive rating and last in defensive rating. Five players averaged in double figures, led by Taurasi's 20.4 PPG and Pondexter's 19.1. The first game of the 2009 Finals was amazing: a 120-116 Mercury victory over Indiana. But the Fever took the next two games and had a chance to close out the series at home. Phoenix's defense showed up for Game 4, holding the Fever to a series-low 77 points. In Game 5, Taurasi and Pondexter combined for 50 points to win their last game as Phoenix teammates. Pondexter requested and got a trade to New York the next year. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 16-16, 8-2 Defeated the Phoenix Mercury 3-1 in Finals With longtime Sparks star Candace Parker coming to her hometown of Chicago as a free agent, there were big expectations for the 2021 Sky. Chicago went .500 in the regular season, the worst record of any championship team. But all the pieces were there -- including point guard Courtney Vandersloot and guard/forward Kahleah Copper -- to win a title. The No. 6 seed, the Sky beat Dallas in the first round and Minnesota in the second. Then they went against No. 1 seed Connecticut in the semifinals. A double-overtime win in the first game of the series was pivotal, and Chicago won 3-1. In the Finals, the Sky won 3-1 over Phoenix, with Parker celebrating with family as the franchise won its first title. 27. 1997 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 18-10, 2-0 Defeated the New York Liberty in championship game This is where it all started, with the Comets winning the inaugural championship of the WNBA, which launched with eight teams. Cooper at age 34 was the best player in the new league, averaging 22.2 points and being named MVP. They played just single-game semifinals and finals in the first year, and Cooper scored 31 and 25 points in those victories. Thompson, who had been the top pick in the college draft, averaged 13.2 points and Brazil's Arcain 10.9. Swoopes gave birth to a son on June 25, just after the WNBA season had started. She played her first game on Aug. 7, and appeared in nine regular-season and two playoff games. - Voepel Because Swoopes was a part-time player, the inaugural Comets weren't yet the juggernaut they'd soon become, going just 18-10 in the regular season. Houston was more dominant in the playoffs, winning the two one-and-done games by an average of 15 points. -- Pelton 28. 2008 Detroit Shock Regular season and playoff records: 22-12, 7-2 Defeated the San Antonio Silver Stars 3-0 in Finals As the top seed in the Eastern Conference, the Shock needed the full three games to beat both Indiana and New York before playing their best basketball in the Finals. Against a San Antonio team with home-court advantage, Detroit pulled off a surprising sweep by an average of 10.7 PPG. -- Pelton By the time the Stars met the Shock in the WNBA Finals, Detroit was the better team. Five Shock players averaged in double figures in the regular season, led by Nolan and Smith. A late-season trade brought McWilliams-Franklin to Detroit, and she averaged 12.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in the playoffs. Smith won Finals MVP honors as the Shock won their third WNBA title in six years. Unfortunately, the franchise was nearing its end in Detroit. The Shock played just one more season in the Motor City before moving to Tulsa in 2010. -- Voepel 29. 2003 Detroit Shock Regular season and playoff records: 25-9, 6-2 Defeated the Los Angeles Sparks 2-1 in Finals The Shock went from worst in 2002 (9-23) to first in 2003, ending the Sparks' attempt to three-peat. Former Pistons player Bill Laimbeer took over as Shock coach during the 2002 season and totally changed the team's culture. He drafted Cheryl Ford at No. 3 in 2003; she averaged a double-double (10.8 PPG, 10.4 RPG) and was Rookie of the Year. Cash, who had been the No. 2 pick in 2002, led the Shock with 16.6 points in the regular season and 16.3 in the playoffs. Detroit lost the Finals opener to Los Angeles, but survived Game 2, winning 62-61. In front of a huge crowd at The Palace at Auburn Hills, the Shock took the title in Game 3 in an 83-78 win, led by 27 points from Finals MVP Ruth Riley and Cash's near triple-double (13 points, 12 rebounds, 9 assists). ""I think our team really embodied the city of Detroit,"" Cash said. -- Voepel Detroit was the WNBA's least dominant best team, leading the league with 25 wins. The franchise's first playoff trip under Laimbeer started slowly, with the Shock going the distance to beat a 17-17 Cleveland Rockers team in the opening round, but Detroit found its footing in a conference finals sweep over Connecticut and then beat the two-time defending champion Sparks 2-1 in the Finals.",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46583911/wnba-finals-2025-ranking-every-wnba-champion-las-vegas-aces,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1011%2Fr1558630_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,a41fc1d72c7fcd12536ade6b463065dfeb90ae00

Charles Barkley weighs in on Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Bucks after Milwaukee had trade conversations with the Knicks earlier in the offseason. Eastern Conference One of the early observations made by players during the first days of Hawks camp was that everyone was on the court, and the trainer's room was empty. The Hawks are healthy and buzzing over new additions Kristaps Porzingis , Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard . Being healthy again is vital to the Hawks' success and growth. A huge factor for Atlanta this season is Jalen Johnson , who looked good in his first two preseason games back from left shoulder surgery that ended his 2024-25 season; Johnson made 7 of 11 shots and had 20 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in 25 minutes against Memphis. Coach Quin Snyder said Johnson's improvement on defense will be the next step for the young forward. If he can stay healthy and continue to grow as a playmaker to help Young and Porzingis, the Hawks could really take off this season. -- Youngmisuk The Cavaliers have a lot of depth, and they will need it. Max Strus is likely out for a few months with a Jones fracture in his left foot. Darius Garland will miss the opening weeks of the season as well after offseason turf toe surgery. New addition Lonzo Ball is not going to play back-to-backs, and he played 35 games last season for the Chicago Bulls after missing the prior two seasons with injuries. De'Andre Hunter has never played more than 67 games and has missed at least 25 games in three of his six seasons. And Dean Wade has eclipsed 60 games in only one of his six seasons. So while Cleveland feels good about where it sits after claiming the top seed in the East last season, it is already navigating injuries -- and likely will be throughout this season. -- Bontemps Giving third-year forward Ausar Thompson more responsibility has come into focus. The team began to take off last season when his health restrictions (blood clot) were lifted and his two-way prowess was unleashed. Now, the Pistons view him as a secondary ball handler, initiating offense as a change-of-pace guard to contrast the more deliberate Cade Cunningham . Coach J.B. Bickerstaff noted how Thompson initiated some offense with Cunningham on the floor to present a different look. With Jaden Ivey (left fibula) still ""dealing with some discomfort,"" according to Bickerstaff, the team is bringing him along slowly, thus creating more opportunity for Thompson on offense. As for Cunningham, preseason is the smallest of sample sizes, but according to sources, ""he's proving last year wasn't a fluke."" -- Goodwill play 0:50 Cooper Flagg shines in preseason debut for Mavs The 18-year-old rookie scored 10 points and contributed 6 rebounds, 3 assists and a blocked shot in 14 minutes. The Giannis saga is far from over. Despite attempts from the Bucks to quell speculation over Antetokounmpo 's future since the start of camp, the two-time MVP has simultaneously emphasized his current commitment to the Bucks while leaving the door open that he could continue his career elsewhere . Antetokounmpo has doubled down on his desire to compete for championships with an unwillingness to accept anything less. It has put the pressure on the Bucks this season to prove he can win another championship in Milwaukee. For a team that has lost in the first round in three consecutive seasons, not advancing further in the playoffs could lead to a day of reckoning. -- Collier Off the floor, the Antetokounmpo situation will hang over the team all season following the revelation that the Knicks and Bucks discussed a potential trade of the power forward this offseason. Several key players will be on notice and have an eye on what's going on with Milwaukee to track Antetokounmpo's frame of mind. On the floor, the Knicks want to play faster on offense and shoot more 3s, but it has been a work in progress through four preseason games. The Knicks have a favorable schedule to start the season, which should provide an early window into how the Mike Brown era will look in New York. -- Goodwill The Magic are getting healthier, and that is a big deal. Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner started camp healthy after both dealt with oblique injuries last season; they missed a combined total of 58 regular-season games. Orlando isn't whole yet, though. Guard Jalen Suggs is still slowly making his way back from left knee surgery and Mo Wagner remains out with a torn left ACL sustained in December 2024. In the meantime, Banchero, Wagner and the rest of the Magic will try to develop chemistry as quickly as possible with new addition Desmond Bane while hoping to drastically improve on their league-worst 31.8% 3-point shooting last season. The Magic have started out camp playing faster, focusing on getting out in transition and using defense to create offense. Through the first three preseason games, the Magic averaged 104 possessions. They averaged a league-low 96.5 last season. The most important thing will be going into the season with Banchero, Wagner and Bane healthy and hoping Suggs can add to the team once he is ready. -- Youngmisuk Joel Embiid might be healthy? That feels strange to say after everything that has happened over the past 18 months, but so far it has been a relatively stress-free preseason in Philadelphia. Embiid appears on track to be ready for the 76ers' opener against the rival Celtics on Oct. 22. Anyone who has followed Embiid's tenure in Philadelphia knows how quickly things can change, and he has had enough issues with his left knee that it's fair to wonder how long it will last until another flareup. Embiid said at the start of training camp they're just taking things day-by-day. But unlike last year, when his preseason was a waiting game to see when his knee would be ready to go, Embiid has practiced regularly, participated in Sunday's open scrimmage and is expected to play Friday against Minnesota in Philadelphia's preseason finale. -- Bontemps play 1:27 LeBron's injury puts his Warriors-Lakers opening night in jeopardy Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. Western Conference The mantra of Dallas GM Nico Harrison is "" defense wins championships ,"" but the Mavericks have some things to figure out on that end of the floor, particularly on the perimeter. Coach Jason Kidd said he has to ""continue to look at different combinations to see what gives us the best way to start the game"" after the Hornets scored 95 points through three quarters as the Mavs played their starters into the second half. Klay Thompson was tasked with being the primary defender on Charlotte star LaMelo Ball , which is probably asking too much of a 35-year-old with his injury history. The options are limited if D'Angelo Russell starts alongside Thompson. P.J. Washington typically took the toughest perimeter defensive assignment last season, but he came off the bench in the first two preseason games. Would the Mavs be better off starting Washington with 18-year-old Cooper Flagg as the primary offensive initiator? That's the look Kidd went with against the Utah Jazz on Monday, when Russell rested. -- MacMahon The headliners aren't showing any alarming signs of age at the moment. Al Horford has fit the culture and system well so far. One of the leftover questions is how exactly Steve Kerr will deploy his starting lineup around Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . Horford will start at center on some nights, but Kerr said he wants to be careful considering Horford's age and the need to limit his minutes. ""If Al were a little younger, he'd be in the starting lineup for sure,"" Kerr said. Kerr has hinted that he might employ a small-ball unit that includes Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski . But Moody hurt his left calf in practice and his status is uncertain to start the season. Podziemski punctuated a great camp with a 23-point night in Los Angeles against the Lakers. Kerr wouldn't officially commit to him as the starting shooting guard, but the presumed lineup for opening night is Curry, Podziemski, Butler, Green, Horford -- though it is anticipated Kerr will change it around often. -- Slater Houston's offensive initiation by committee approach will work out just fine in the wake of veteran point guard Fred VanVleet 's season-ending injury. Rockets coach Ime Udoka often throws around the term ""KYP"" (know your personnel) in news conferences. Perhaps that intricate knowledge of Houston's roster played a major role in Udoka's confidence that his group ""can get the job done"" in VanVleet's absence. Early returns in the preseason have been promising with the Rockets utilizing multiple players -- mainly center Alperen Sengun and forward Amen Thompson -- to initiate offense. Expect Houston to also lean on Durant to facilitate the offense along with second-year guard Reed Sheppard , who appears to be growing more confident in his role. -- Wright Playing beneath the cloud of an NBA investigation -- and one centered around a team's star player -- is no small thing. But it appears the Clippers, for now, are resolved to not let that inquiry serve as a distraction. Through two preseason games, Kawhi Leonard appears in midseason form. He scored 18 points in 18 minutes in one game and 17 points in 19 minutes in the other. New acquisitions Brook Lopez and John Collins have seemed to fit in already, and Chris Paul 's reunion with the Clippers feels seamless. The Clippers boast one of the league's oldest rosters, but it's also among the deepest, which should help some of their more veteran players as the season moves along. There are a few preseason games left, not that those offer concrete evidence of the season to come, but despite the small sample size, the rebuilt Clippers appear especially promising. -- Holmes play 1:27 LeBron's injury puts his Warriors-Lakers opening night in jeopardy Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. The extra time to practice and jell together that the team pined for after last season's abrupt first-round exit was not to be. Unfortunately, training camp didn't provide the opportunity everyone hoped for. LeBron James was limited to being a vocal participant in the Lakers' scrimmages from the sidelines because of sciatica down his right side , which also kept him out of the preseason. Luka Doncic was purposely held out of the majority of L.A.'s preseason slate and was given a modified workload for a handful of practice days, with the medical staff cognizant of his EuroBasket duty over the summer . Marcus Smart , signed in the offseason, was out with Achilles tendinopathy. Maxi Kleber , who was only healthy and available for one game after being acquired from Dallas in the Doncic trade in February, missed most of camp with a quad injury. Rookie Adou Thiero was also limited because of knee swelling. ""These are the cards we were dealt,"" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. ""I surely would like everybody to be healthy."" -- McMenamin All-NBA wing Jalen Williams is unlikely to be ready for the start of the regular season as he continues to recover from surgery on his right wrist, an operation he had on July 1 , after playing the entire postseason with torn ligaments. ""I would have cut my right hand off to win a championship,"" Williams told ESPN. He has only recently begun to shoot with his right hand again and has yet to be cleared for contact work. The Thunder and Williams have not publicly discussed a timetable for his return as they take a patient approach. ""Whenever I feel like I can be a hundred percent and do that whole thing, then I'll rock out,"" Williams said. -- MacMahon The Spurs will look different this season. Team president and former coach Gregg Popovich has always encouraged new coach Mitch Johnson to be himself. It'll be apparent on the floor this season as Johnson incorporates more of his own principles in San Antonio during his first full season on the job. Victor Wembanyama made that point clear in describing how the staff put together ""a more extended plan"" over the summer that emphasizes ""better recognition of our roles together."" Veteran Harrison Barnes pointed out, ""We have a lot of new stuff that we're doing,"" adding, ""We've changed some of the processes of how we're doing [things]. That comes with Mitch implementing his style, which I think has been well-received by players."" Expect the Spurs to flex their collective youth and athleticism to play a faster style. -- Wright",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46582125/the-biggest-nba-preseason-takeaways-14-contenders,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560324_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,b4f716409795e89d88c7e30e746097c826d75912
f2e768a27d42,"2025 MLB playoffs: How Vlad Jr., Blue Jays bet on each other",,"SIX MONTHS AGO , just seven games into the 2025 season, the Toronto Blue Jays arrived in Queens with uncertainty hovering over Vladimir Guerrero Jr .'s future. New York Mets fans, hopeful that their team could eventually land the impending free agent and partner him with Juan Soto , welcomed the first baseman with notably loud cheers at Citi Field to open the weekend series. Guerrero and the Blue Jays had failed to reach an agreement on a contract extension before an arbitrary mid-February deadline, and the drama would not die. Then, suddenly, it did, hours after the Mets completed a weekend sweep. The deal was historic: 14 years, $500 million without deferrals, the third-largest contract in Major League Baseball history. The Canadian-born Guerrero, signed out of the Dominican Republic as a 16-year-old with a famous name, would be a Blue Jay for life. Guerrero bet on himself by turning down smaller offers and bet on the Blue Jays by agreeing not to test free agency. And the Blue Jays bet on the homegrown star at a massive price, having whiffed on other marquee talents in recent years. The impact was instant. ""We didn't start playing our best baseball until May,"" Blue Jays starter Max Scherzer said. ""But if that didn't get settled, it would be this cloud hanging over our season the whole time. The fact that that was resolved just kind of settled everything down. The outside attention is resolved. It's no longer, 'What's going to happen here?' It kind of took the elephant out of the room."" Guerrero, 26, responded with his fifth All-Star season, batting .292 with 23 home runs and an .848 OPS in 156 games. His play, coupled with rebound seasons from George Springer and Bo Bichette and a deep roster of contributors, fueled the Blue Jays' ascension from 74 wins and last place in 2024 to 94 wins, an American League East title and, now, Game 3 of the American League Championship Series. The Blue Jays can point to a few possible turning points on their way to a fourth playoff appearance in six years. There was a three-game sweep in Seattle in early May. There was Bichette's pinch-hit, go-ahead home run in the ninth inning in Texas later that month. But Guerrero's agreement a week into the season helped pave the way to where the Blue Jays find themselves Wednesday: four wins shy of their first World Series appearance in 32 years. Down 2-0 after the Mariners dominated the first two games in Toronto, it's no easy feat. But the goal Guerrero has set for himself hasn't changed. ""For me my goal always is to win a World Series, to bring the World Series here,"" Guerrero said earlier this postseason. ""My father, he never had the chance to win a World Series. That's one of my goals, always been one of my goals, to do that for me, for him."" THE JOURNEY TO this breakout postseason for Guerrero and the Blue Jays began more than a decade ago. In January 2015, months before Guerrero was eligible to sign as an international free agent, Edwin Encarnación received a call from Alex Anthopoulos, then Toronto's general manager: The Blue Jays wanted to see a 15-year-old Guerrero, their top target that year, work out again in the Dominican Republic -- and they needed to find a ballpark. Encarnación, coming off an All-Star season for Toronto in 2014, reached out to his contacts and a workout was arranged to have Guerrero face older free agents from Cuba. With Encarnación and Blue Jays officials, including Anthopoulos and international scouting director Ismael Cruz looking on, Guerrero convinced the decision-makers. ""It was something special,"" Encarnación said in Spanish on the field at Rogers Centre on Monday before Game 2 of the ALCS. ""Vladdy was better than the Cubans. This kid, at 15 years old, showed off against them. He was special."" The return of George Springer The Blue Jays' playoff run features the AL's top seed -- and a modern Mr. October on their side. Jeff Passan » That July, the Blue Jays used their entire international bonus pool to sign Guerrero for $3.9 million. Worried about the hoopla that came with being the son of a future Hall of Famer, Anthopoulos asked the team's media department to hold a low-key event when Guerrero, born in Montreal during his father's time starring for the Expos, was brought to Toronto for the first time. No news conference at the podium. Just batting practice on the field. ""I was concerned with the last name, the hype and the expectations were going to be out of this world,"" said Anthopoulos, now general manager of the Atlanta Braves . ""And they were anyway, as much as we tried to play it down."" Guerrero was not immune to the pressure upon arriving for his major league debut in 2019 as the top prospect across baseball at just 20 years old. The years that followed were not a linear progression. After an AL MVP runner-up season in which he clubbed 48 home runs with a 1.002 OPS in 2021, his first year as a full-time first baseman, Guerrero hit 58 home runs with an .804 OPS over the next two years. Then came another breakout last season: a .323/.396/.544 slash line with 30 home runs in 159 games to raise his value heading into his platform year. ""He's not easily distracted,"" Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins said. ""He's still very human, and I think the hardest part, from my perspective and my view, that Vladdy's had to deal with is the expectation. Not the distractions off the field or the attention. And he embraced the expectations."" This year, the pressure was on Guerrero to finally perform to those expectations in the postseason. He entered the AL Division Series against the New York Yankees 3-for-22 with two walks, five strikeouts and no home runs in six career playoff games -- all losses -- spread over three separate wild-card series. Guerrero quickly discarded that history in Game 1, swatting a solo home run in his first plate appearance of the postseason. In Game 2, he cracked a grand slam that will long be replayed on Rogers Centre highlight reels. He finished the series 9-for-17 with three home runs and nine RBIs as the Blue Jays eliminated New York in four games. ""I think he's improved a lot in all aspects,"" Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk said. ""The experience, how he's matured as a person. He's no longer the 20-year-old Vladimir when he debuted. Now he's Vladimir."" VLADIMIR VASQUEZ WATCHED the Blue Jays close out the Yankees last Wednesday from his restaurant 5 miles north of Rogers Centre. Born in the Dominican Republic, Vasquez moved to Toronto when he was 11 years old in 1990 and quickly became a fan of the early-'90s Blue Jays championship teams. He opened Cabacoa, a Dominican restaurant, a year-and-a-half ago -- a sign of the city's growing Dominican community. ""I've been following Vladimir Guerrero Jr. since he was in the minors,"" Vasquez said. ""It's funny because his dad was the only older Dominican Vladimir I knew growing up. But it's important for the community, for the Dominican community, to have somebody who's that good who's going to be here long term."" One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » It's part of the responsibility Guerrero shoulders beyond playing first base and batting third. He's the only Canadian citizen on Canada's only MLB team. His No. 27 jersey is the one Blue Jays fans wear from British Columbia to Newfoundland. He's the player the Blue Jays committed to as their cornerstone through his age-40 season in 2039 -- 20 years after his debut -- with hopes he'll end up with his own Hall of Fame career. ""I look at Vladdy long term because I've gotten to play with the greats,"" said Scherzer, an 18-year veteran and three-time Cy Young Award winner. ""I've gotten to play with so many great, different players over my career. For me, he kind of fits this Prince Fielder- Miguel Cabrera mold. He's kind of a hybrid between those two."" In the short term, the agreement was an exhale. Perhaps, as Atkins said he'd like to think, the Blue Jays would've found their footing without Guerrero signing the extension. The pieces were in place two years removed from an 89-win season. But that variable, which had lingered from the day Guerrero reported for spring training, was removed. Six months later, the Blue Jays, behind their franchise pillar, are breaking through. ""I think it kind of showed our fan base and the league kind of what we're trying to do here short and long term,"" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. ""And it just kind of clears a little bit of a cloud around a really good player and allows the team to say, 'OK, this is our guy, this is what we're going to do.' I think it kind of freed everyone up.""",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46577607/mlb-2025-playoffs-blue-jays-vladimir-guerrero-jr-deal-extension,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560070_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,8f0cff253fb34a479c9b15703f376df2c1ee8e15
84e0efed4b1c,MLB playoffs: How Jorge Polanco put the Seattle Mariners on the brink,,"TORONTO -- Every so often in the Seattle Mariners clubhouse, the ""Top Gun Anthem,"" full of soaring guitar notes and pick-me-up vibes, will randomly blast from inside a locker. Everyone knows the culprit. Jorge Polanco , the Mariners' veteran second baseman, is not a fan of silencing his phone. ""But he loves Maverick and Iceman,"" Mariners star Cal Raleigh said. Nobody really minds. When a player is doing what Polanco has done this postseason -- rescuing the Mariners from the danger zone seemingly daily, with his latest trick a go-ahead three-run home run that paved the way for Monday's 10-3 victory -- his ringtone could be Limp Bizkit and nobody would utter a peep. Instead, it's the perfect soundtrack for this Mariners run, which currently sees them up two games to none against the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. The ""Top Gun Anthem"" is an epic ballad filled with the sorts of ups and downs that personify an organization that has spent 49 years alternating among the desolation of mediocrity and the heartbreak of underachievement. The only team in Major League Baseball to never to play in a World Series, Seattle is two wins away from capturing its first American League pennant and is heading home to T-Mobile Park for Game 3. The Mariners' dominant position is in large part thanks to a 32-year-old infielder whose feats have earned him the right to be called Iceman himself -- and yet that's not the nickname Polanco wears these days. ""He's George Bonds,"" M's catcher Mitch Garver said. Yes, Polanco's alter ego is the anglicized version of his first name and the surname of Major League Baseball's all-time home run leader. He earned it earlier this season, Garver said, when ""everything he hit was 110 [mph] in a gap or over the fence. It was unbelievable."" The Big Dumper ... and some magic? Seattle has never won a World Series. Or even an American League pennant. Could a little bit of alchemy change that? Alden Gonzalez » Particularly when considering that last winter, Polanco didn't know whether he would be healthy enough to keep hitting major league pitching. Polanco, who had struggled for years with left knee issues, underwent surgery in October 2024 to repair his patellar tendon. A free agent, Polanco drew limited interest on the market and wound up re-signing with the Mariners for one year and $7.75 million. ""It's been a journey, man,"" Polanco said. ""That's the way I can put it. I wouldn't say it's been bad. I wouldn't say it's been easy. I think God just prepared me for this year. I've been hurt a little bit, so yeah; but now we here, and I'm glad to be back. ""You just have to have faith. You overcome. Come back stronger."" Polanco's strength has been on display all October. It first appeared in the second game of Seattle's division series against the Detroit Tigers when he hit two home runs off ace Tarik Skubal , who is about to win his second consecutive Cy Young Award. It continued three games later in a winner-takes-all Game 5 when he lashed a single into right field in the 15th inning that advanced the Mariners to their first ALCS since 2001. It didn't stop there, with Polanco's go-ahead single in the sixth inning of Game 1 against the Blue Jays on Sunday. MLB playoff tracker: Who can clinch next? From current playoff matchups to league races to the postseason schedule, we've got you covered. Everything to know » Then came Monday's fifth-inning blast off Toronto reliever Louis Varland , who fed a 98 mph fastball over the plate and watched it leave the bat at 105.2 mph, flying 400 feet to turn a 3-3 tie into a 6-3 Seattle lead. ""He's always been a great hitter,"" Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. ""His swing right now is very short. That ball tonight, I wasn't sure it was going to go out of the ballpark, but I think he's just getting that kind of spin on it right now where it stays up."" That is no accident. Polanco arrived in the major leagues with the Minnesota Twins in 2014 at age 20, a bat-to-ball savant whose ability to hit from both sides of the plate carved him out a regular role with the team. ""He wasn't George Bonds before,"" Garver said. ""He was Harry Potter. Because he was a wizard. He'd just make hits appear."" Polanco found power five years into his career, and he maxed out with 33 home runs for the Twins in 2021. But the degradation of his knee sapped the juice in his bat and left him flailing too often at pitches he'd have previously spit on. Last year, in his first season with the Mariners, his numbers cratered, but the organization appreciated Polanco's even-keeled demeanor and believed fixing his knee would fix his swing too. The Mariners were right. George Bonds was born during a ridiculous first month of the 2025 season when he whacked nine homers in 80 plate appearances. Polanco had embraced the M's ethos of pulling the ball in the air. Raleigh led MLB with a 1.594 OPS on balls pulled. Third baseman Eugenio Suarez was second at 1.497. Polanco hit 23 of his 26 home runs this season to the pull side, and both of his homers off Skubal (hit from the right side) and the one against Varland (left) were met in front of the plate and yanked over the fence.

Sign Up Now ""Throughout the years, I hated going to Minnesota just solely because of him,"" said shortstop J.P. Crawford , the longest-tenured Mariner. ""The guy single-handedly beat us so many times. We all know the type of player he is when he is healthy, and it's clearly showing right now."" Never in the game's 150-year history had a player logged three consecutive game-winning hits in the fifth inning or later during the postseason. It's the sort of performance teams need to win pennants -- and championships. As brilliant as Raleigh has been in a could-be-MVP campaign and as conflagrant as Julio Rodriguez was in the second half and as dominant as Seattle's pitching has been en route to this point, winning playoff baseball takes more. Like, say, a guy who over the winter was an afterthought now hitting cleanup and never wavering, even in the highest-leverage situations. ""What's most impressive is bouncing back after a rough year last year,"" said Seattle pitcher Bryan Woo , who is lined up to start a potential Game 5 on Friday. ""Especially for a guy on his second team, back half of his career. To do what he's doing -- get healthy, come back, help the team like he has -- is even more impressive than just playing good baseball."" Playing good baseball helps too. Polanco has helped get Seattle in a place that barely a month ago looked impossible to conceive. From mid-August to early September, the Mariners lost 13 of 18, trailed the Houston Astros by 3½ games in the AL West and held a half-game lead on the Texas Rangers for the final wild-card spot. From there, the M's went 17-4, won the West, earned a first-round bye and charted a course for history. They're not there. And yet even Polanco admitted that Seattle players can't ignore the team's history and recognize what it would mean to get to the World Series. ""Yeah, we think about it,"" he said. ""We've heard it a lot. We know."" The knowledge hasn't deterred them. Raleigh is raking. Rodriguez is slugging. Josh Naylor , who grew up in nearby Mississauga, Ontario, blasted a two-run home run in Game 2 of the ALCS. And George Bonds has shown up in style, cold as Iceman, cool as Maverick, perfectly happy to eschew silent mode in favor of loud contact.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46587262/mlb-2025-playoffs-jorge-polanco-seattle-mariners-alcs-game-2,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559813_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,cd826c36b100c46a5f09f140dca75c8c76823ff1
72df891f3b77,"Ranking top 10 NFL rookies in 2025: Emeka Egbuka, Jaxson Dart",,"Oct 15, 2025, 06:20 AM ET The 2025 NFL draft class is off to a hot start through Week 6 . Buccaneers wide receiver Emeka Egbuka has the fourth-most receiving yards in the NFL (469), while Colts tight end Tyler Warren is second in receiving yards at his position (370). Elsewhere, the Browns and Giants have embraced rookie production on both sides of the ball. But how do the top first-year players stack up against each other? We polled five NFL analysts and reporters -- Matt Bowen, Kalyn Kahler, Jeff Legwold, Matt Miller and Jordan Reid -- to make a consensus ranking of the top 10 rookies. Who cracked the list? Who just missed? Our experts also looked closer at quarterback Cam Ward 's start with the Titans , picked out the most impressive position group and then named one overperforming late-rounder and one underperforming first-rounder. Let's begin with the top 10 through six weeks. Note: Chargers running back Omarion Hampton was omitted from consideration because he is on injured reserve with an ankle injury . Jump to a section: Top 10 | Just missed Big questions Stats: 27 receptions, 469 yards, 5 TDs Drafted: Round 1, No. 19 Egbuka is the latest success in the Ohio State wide receiver pipeline to the NFL. His 78.2 receiving yards per game ranks seventh in the NFL. He's showing the sure hands and reliability of a 10-year veteran. Egbuka has not only displayed his route-running ability in the short and intermediate areas, but he has also been a deep threat. His 17.4 yards per reception ranks fourth in the NFL, as quarterback Baker Mayfield has been able to consistently connect with him downfield. Despite already having Mike Evans and Chris Godwin Jr . as the top two options on the depth chart, the Buccaneers stuck to their ""best player available"" theory in the draft. It has paid off, even if Egbuka misses some time after injuring his hamstring in Week 6. -- Reid Stats: 13 tackles, 0.5 sacks Drafted: Round 1, No. 3 Carter leads rookie defenders in pressures (13), quarterback hits (eight) and total pass rush wins (16). His only half a sack came against the Commanders in Week 1 , but his versatility at linebacker and edge rusher is what makes him so valuable to this Giants defense. Before Week 6, Carter was the only player to have lined up on the edge, on the interior and at linebacker at least 40 times this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats. He has shown he can get to the quarterback with ease, and those sacks will come. -- Kahler Stats: 29 receptions, 370 yards, 3 total TDs Drafted: Round 1, No. 14 Warren has elevated the Colts' passing game in Shane Steichen's offense, using his rugged play style and alignment versatility to hit all levels of the field. Warren is averaging almost 62 receiving yards per game, and we've seen him produce from traditional tight end alignments while also shifting to slot, wide and even backfield sets to create conflict for opposing defenses. He has the makeup of a future All-Pro. -- Bowen Stats: 27 receptions, 380 yards, 2 TDs Drafted: Round 1, No. 8 McMillan entered the NFL as the best pure receiver from the 2025 class, and so far he has lived up to that billing. He has quickly become the go-to target for quarterback Bryce Young and is winning the one-on-one battles that a WR1 must dominate. That ability to win 50-50 balls was on his college tape, too, along with powerful route running. McMillan is on track for a 1,000-yard season in Carolina. -- Miller Stats: 82 carries, 338 rushing yards, 20 receptions, 155 receiving yards, 5 total TDs Drafted: Round 4, No. 105 Skattebo fell to the third day of the draft as a high-contact runner who ran a ho-hum 4.66-second 40-yard dash at his pro day. But with his bring-it-on style, he has carved out a place in the Giants' offense and in the hearts of the team's faithful. Among the rookie backs, only the Raiders' Ashton Jeanty and the Chargers' Omarion Hampton have averaged more yards after contact per carry than Skattebo's 2.1. He also leads all rookies in runs for first downs (21), which is tied for fifth best in the league. Only six running backs in the NFL have more receiving yards than Skattebo, too. -- Legwold play 0:55 Brian Burns loves 'fearless' Jaxson Dart-Cam Skattebo combo Brian Burns joins “The Rich Eisen Show” to discuss the Giants' win over the Eagles, led by Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo. Stats: 52 tackles, 1 sack Drafted: Round 2, No. 33 Schwesinger has arguably been the most impressive rookie defender this season. His range was among the many positives on his scouting report coming out of UCLA, and that has carried over into the NFL. The rookie learning curve hasn't affected him at all. His instincts, tackling ability and effort are on display weekly. Schwesinger was Cleveland's second defensive pick in the 2025 draft (defensive tackle Mason Graham went No. 5), but he is already a building block for a Browns defense that is among the best in the league. -- Reid Stats: 40 tackles, 1 forced fumble, 1 interception Drafted: Round 1, No. 31 Campbell was my No. 15-ranked prospect in the 2025 class, but he slipped due to injury questions after he had left shoulder surgery prior to the draft. Campbell has been healthy, impactful and playing like the do-it-all linebacker we saw at Alabama. His range was a trademark of his college game, and that's showing up on Sundays, too. Campbell is smooth and instinctive in pass coverage, and his best trait could ultimately be what he brings to the table as a pass rusher. That hasn't been unlocked yet in Philadelphia, but it's something to watch as he gets more comfortable in his role. -- Miller Stats: 6 starts, 90.8% pass block win rate, 83.3% run block win rate Drafted: Round 1, No. 18 There is an argument to be made that, regardless of position, Zabel has had the best start to a season of any rookie. He started games at left guard, left tackle and right tackle at North Dakota State, and his transition to guard in the NFL has been seamless. He has not surrendered a sack -- NFL Next Gen Stats didn't even register him for a pressure allowed until Week 4 -- and he was flagged for the first time in Week 5 (holding penalty). Oh, and his run block win rate leads all guards in the league. -- Legwold Stats: 84 carries, 383 rushing yards, 9 receptions, 62 receiving yards, 2 total TDs Drafted: Round 2, No. 36 Judkins has the stature of an NFL lead back. He is an urgent runner with the foot quickness and short-area juice to make defenders miss in tight quarters. He has seen at least 20 touches in three games this season, and he can produce on screens and checkdowns. In Kevin Stefanski's offense, where the run game is a foundational component, Judkins has been an easy fit since his debut in Week 2. -- Bowen play 0:42 Should fantasy managers start Quinshon Judkins in Week 7? Matt Bowen details why Quinshon Judkins is still valuable on fantasy rosters this week vs. the Dolphins, despite his season low against the Steelers. Stats: 508 passing yards, 4 TD passes, 2 INTs, 167 rushing yards, 2 rushing TDs Drafted: Round 1, No. 25 It was clear after Dart's preseason debut that Russell Wilson would not have the starting job for long. Coach Brian Daboll did his best to disguise his excitement about Dart but fooled absolutely no one. In his first start against the Chargers , Dart ran for 54 yards, a touchdown and five first downs, and he has rushed for more than 50 yards in every game since. That fearlessness and toughness has Giants fans dreaming of their own Josh Allen , who developed under Daboll in Buffalo. Dart has also played well when facing pressure. Per NFL Next Gen Stats, he completed 9 of 13 passes (69.2%) for 99 yards and a touchdown throw when the Eagles blitzed in last Thursday night's win . He is already shifting New York's expectations. -- Kahler Just missed Armand Membou , OT, New York Jets : 6 starts, 90.4% pass block win rate, 79.3% run block win rate Josh Simmons , OT, Kansas City Chiefs : 5 starts, 88.6% pass block win rate, 75.9% run block win rate Will Campbell , OT, New England Patriots : 6 starts, 84.8% pass block win rate, 76.6% run block win rate Ashton Jeanty , RB, Las Vegas Raiders : 105 carries, 424 rushing yards, 14 receptions, 73 receiving yards, 5 total TDs Jacory Croskey-Merritt , RB, Washington Commanders : 60 carries, 344 rushing yards, 6 receptions, 61 receiving yards, 4 total TDs Also received top-15 votes from our panelists: Kelvin Banks Jr ., OT, New Orleans Saints ; Jahdae Barron , CB, Denver Broncos ; Mason Graham , DT, Cleveland Browns ; Travis Hunter , WR/CB, Jacksonville Jaguars ; Jacob Parrish , CB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers ; Jonas Sanker , S, New Orleans Saints ; Xavier Watts , S, Atlanta Falcons How can Cam Ward improve on his rough start after coach Brian Callahan's firing ? It's the timing and ball location with Ward. Through six games, his average time to throw is 2.95 seconds (fourth highest), and he has been off target 20.7% of the time (third highest). Ward has the traits to be a very productive player in this league, but he must show a greater sense of timing and rhythm as a thrower with the Titans this season. See it faster, and deliver the ball with more precision. -- Bowen Which position group overall has stood out the most so far this season? When you consider how much hand-wringing goes on in the predraft run-up about the proper time to select a running back, this year's rookies have certainly shown there's value at the position. Yes, Hampton is on injured reserve, but he, Skattebo, Judkins and Croskey-Merritt have had productive starts as key elements in their respective offenses. Toss in Jeanty, who has been the busiest among the rookies with the fourth most carries in the league, and you have quite the RB class. -- Legwold Which first-rounder is underperforming? Ashton Jeanty , RB, Las Vegas Raiders . The Raiders selected Jeanty at No. 6 to power a ground game under offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. Jeanty -- and the entire Raiders offense -- has been slow to launch. His 424 rushing yards are good for No. 9 in the league, but his 4.0 yards per carry rank 28th. Since transitioning from college, Jeanty has struggled with his pacing when attacking the line of scrimmage and finding rushing lanes. The good news is that's something he can fix quickly once he feels more confident in his blockers. The Las Vegas offensive line isn't doing him any favors; only three backs have gotten fewer yards before first contact per rush than Jeanty (1.3). -- Miller Which late-rounder is overperforming? Jacory Croskey-Merritt , RB, Washington Commanders . We're going to stick with the running backs here, as the Commanders found their lead back in the seventh and final round of the draft. With 344 rushing yards and four touchdowns, Croskey-Merritt has already shown that he's capable of being a key part of coordinator Kliff Kingsbury's offense. His contact balance carried over from the University of Arizona to the NFL, as his 2.8 yards after first contact rank fourth overall. Croskey-Merritt still needs to improve his ball security, with two fumbles this season. But the early returns on the rookie have been positive ever since he got a larger role when Austin Ekeler tore his right Achilles in Week 2. -- Reid",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46593311/2025-nfl-rookies-ranking-top-10-egbuka-carter-warren-skattebo-dart,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1560069_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,c1dfde9661712e55397c3d315370b3414b80bea8
1eef7af4b101,2026 World Cup squads ranked: All 87 national teams that could win next summer,,"It's the quadrennial question. What's more important for a national team: talent or form? With the third-to-last international break before the FIFA World Cup upon us, I have some good news: we actually don't need to answer that question. Instead, we're going to operate from an alternative premise: What if talent and form are both really important? At least, that's the idea behind the rankings you're about to read through. We want to get a sense of where every national team stands ahead of next summer, so we've looked at every country that still hasn't been eliminated from World Cup contention, and then ranked them by equal parts performance and results. As a proxy for talent, this ranking uses the average, estimated transfer value of each player on each team's most recent roster from the site Transfermarkt. And for results, we'll use the World Football Elo Ratings -- a system that awards or subtracts points every time a team plays a game, based on the final scoreline, the location of the match, the quality of the opponent, and the competitiveness of the match. Then we've normalized those numbers to make them equivalent, added them up, and produced what you see below. There are 87 teams still in contention to compete in the 2026 World Cup, so let's get to ESPN's World Cup field rankings: - Inside how U.S. Soccer schedules games for USMNT, USWNT - O'Hanlon: How to fix Man United in four steps - Di María shows Neymar triumphant return is possible It's not only the addition of 16 more teams that's made World Cup qualifying even more convoluted -- it's the existence of the Nations League, which gives some teams multiple paths to qualification, depending on the federation. For example, Moldova have lost all five of their qualifying matches. They've scored three goals and conceded 25. Yet, somehow, they could still sneak into the UEFA qualification playoff. The market value of Benin's entire roster is €14.28 million. There are 15 different Nigerian players with higher market values -- by themselves. Despite that, the two countries had something close to a win-and-you're-in match in Nigeria to wrap up the current stage of qualifying. 73. Qatar (qualified) And there you have it: Our first qualified team for the 2026 World Cup! The estimated market value of Wolverhampton midfielder Jean-Ricner Bellegarde is more than the entire squads for 19 countries behind Haiti on this list. It's their first time qualifying for a World Cup , which is the sort of thing that can happen when expanding the tournament from 32 teams to 48, as will be the case next summer. 61. Jordan (qualified) While Jordan doesn't have a particularly talented squad beyond Rennes winger Mousa Tamari, you can't qualify for the World Cup as a non-host unless you win a bunch of games. So, Jordan have a significantly higher Elo rating than all of the teams behind them on this list. How much is Bolivia's home-field advantage at 13,615 feet above sea level worth? They have the 90th-most-valuable squad on this list. 54. Tunisia (qualified) 48. Iran (qualified) Among teams ranked in the top 50, Iran have the biggest positive gap between the value of their squad and team performance. Mehdi Taremi is one of the only four players, across all confederations, with at least 10 goals in qualifying. He is 33 years old and left Inter Milan for Olympiacos on a €2 million transfer this past summer. 46. Egypt (qualified) 44. Ghana (qualified) There are 21 countries, including Paraguay, with an Elo rating of 18400 or better. The average market value of the players on those teams is €22 million. The average market value of Paraguay's current players: €3.6 million. 34. Algeria (qualified) 32. Canada (qualified) play 1:47 How Nigeria clinched a World Cup play-off place Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. 26. Mexico (qualified) For all of the consternation around El Tri every year, Mexico are tied for 19th in the Elo ratings, and based on the current rosters, they have the 35th-most-valuable squad in the world. Perhaps there are deeper player development issues here, but there's no real argument that this team hasn't been performing at its true talent level. That could all change pretty quickly, of course. Gilberto Mora has been starting for Tijuana since he was 15, and he doesn't turn 17 until later this month. He plays approximately zero defense, but he's already a quality possession player in a good professional soccer league. He's also one of the most promising young players on the planet. 25. Japan (qualified) 24. Ecuador (qualified) They would be higher with a full roster -- both Chelsea 's Moisés Caicedo and Arsenal 's Piero Hincapié missed call-ups because of injuries -- but this is still a team significantly outperforming its talent level. Ecuador currently rank 9th in the Elo ratings. And over the past year, they've improved their rating by a larger degree than all but one other team inside the top 20. The U.S. men's national team ranks 19th in estimated player value -- and 40th in the Elo ratings. Put another way: The USMNT has a roster of comparable quality to Croatia , and yet it is performing like Hungary. Now, as you start to dream about an efficiently managed American team reaching the semifinals in back-to-back World Cups like Croatia did, it's important to remember that we're talking about Croatia right now . Not the one that had Luka Modric playing like a literal Ballon d'Or winner and a number of other stars playing significant minutes for the best teams in the world. Looking at the market values of these teams is instructive, though. For structural reasons, there are basically eight countries that are going to have more talent than everyone else, at most World Cups. There are the two South American giants ( Brazil and Argentina ) and the six European powers: France , Spain , England , Portugal , Germany and the Netherlands . We can also throw Italy into that mix if they ever start qualifying for World Cups again. Argentina have the least valuable squad of those top nine, and their team is still more than twice as valuable as what we can assume is among the most valuable American teams ever assembled. By pure value, the gap between Argentina and the USMNT is bigger than the gap between the USMNT and Moldova. In other words: It doesn't take a ton of improvement to go from the 70th-best team in the world to the 20th-best team in the world. But to get from 20th to the top 10? It's a massive leap that we haven't really seen anyone be able to sustain. 21. Senegal (qualified) 17. Morocco (qualified) They were third in the Elo ratings a year ago, and they're sixth today. The question for Colombia ahead of next summer, then: Will the slide continue? Among the top 30 teams, only Paraguay have an older current squad. Plus, this team only has one true star in Luis Díaz . No one else on the roster plays for a Champions League-qualified squad in a Big Five league. Beyond Diaz, they're especially reliant on the health and consistency of James Rodríguez , who is 34 years old and currently plays in Liga MX . For most of their history, Colombia have been worse than the sum of their parts. The current iteration the exact opposite, but to what degree? Although the results have been there, it's hard to look at this roster and see this as the sixth-best team in the world. This is the anti-Colombia: they're 39th in the Elo ratings but have the 12th-most-valuable squad in the world. Part of that discrepancy comes from the randomness of player development and the arbitrariness of national borders. Sweden's two best players, Liverpool 's Alexander Isak and Arsenal's Viktor Gyökeres , play the same position. It's not to say they can't play together, but they don't complement each other in the same way that the top two at another Scandinavian nation do. With just one point through the first three qualifying matches, it's looking likely they'll be one of the most talented teams watching from the couch next summer. It seems like it's finally happening. After giving Israel a 90-minute-long noogie and winning 5-0 despite Erling Haaland missing two penalties, Norway have a plus-26 goal differential in qualifying through six matches. Barring a sudden collapse, they're going to their first World Cup since 1998. There won't be a better one-two combination than Haaland and Martin Ødegaard next summer, either. The former rarely touches the ball and just constantly threatens the defense with runs in behind, while the former might be the best high-volume attacking passer in the world. Put more simply: There's no one better than the Arsenal captain at playing through balls, and there's no one better than the Manchester City forward at running through on goal. The haphazard structure of international soccer favors simplicity, and things have just happened to work out that Norway's two superstars fit that perfectly. They're lucky they don't have two star goalkeepers you can't play at the same time or a game-breaking creative-passing right back who requires some tactical creativity to get the most out of. As long as they can get some solidity around Ødegaard and Haaland, this team should be able to beat anyone next summer. Given how random international tournaments are -- and qualifying, too, to a lesser extent -- it makes sense to buy low (theoretically) on the super-talented sides that haven't yet produced results. Enter: Germany under Julian Nagelsmann. They took Spain to the brink in the knockout round at the Euros in the summer of 2024, but it's been all downhill ever since then. They've fallen eight spots in the Elo ratings since last year and now sit 15th between Switzerland and Norway. Their qualification hopes even looked at risk at one point, but they're back in first in their group and should be favorites to advance. The big question is whether or not Jamal Musiala (1) comes back from his ankle injury in time for the World Cup, and (2) how quickly he can get up to speed if he does. The team we saw at the Euros played well enough to win that tournament (and the upcoming World Cup), but it's hard to see them getting back to that level without Musiala. There are Italians who are old enough to legally drink a glass of wine but have never seen Italy get out of the group stage at the World Cup. The last time it happened was in 2006, when they ... won the World Cup. And with Italy well behind Norway on points and in a different universe on goal differential in their qualifying group, there's a very real chance that they miss their third-straight World Cup, too. By building a team around a 38-year-old guy playing in MLS and some of his best friends, Argentina can only rate so highly in an exercise that accounts for estimated transfer values. Yes, Lionel Messi may be the greatest player to ever do it, but re-read the previous sentence. The Elo ratings have Argentina in second, and how could they not be? They've won the past three major tournaments they've contested and they finished atop the CONMEBOL qualifying table. But their rating has dipped a bit, and it's now closer to Portugal in fourth than it is to Spain in first. Messi is still absurdly good in MLS. Some player-value metrics, like G+ at American Soccer Analysis , rate him as twice as good as the second-best player in the league. There's no doubt he can still contribute to a top team at the international level. But when you're 38, a year is a really long time. This team would be awesome if you could just build an entire starting 11 out of only forwards, goalkeepers and center backs. With AC Milan , manager Carlo Ancelotti figured out a way to cram five central midfielders onto the field at the same time and win the Champions League. He'll have to think up something similarly lopsided if he wants to get all of Brazil's best players onto the field next summer. 3. England (qualified) play 1:20 Is Jude Bellingham disruptive in the England camp? Nedum Onuoha addresses reports about Jude Bellingham's temperament within the England squad and its effect on the dressing room. Thanks to their demotion in the Nations League before he arrived, we haven't seen England under Thomas Tuchel play any competitive games against any of the top teams in Europe. I don't suspect it will be any more exciting than it was under Gareth Southgate, but I doubt we'll see anything as ill-conceived as the what if "" Trent Alexander-Arnold is an 8"" experiment at the Euros. In fact, as of now, I'm not sure we'll even see Trent Alexander-Arnold as anything next summer. Much like with Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT, we still have no idea what Tuchel thinks is England's best starting lineup. play 1:24 Moreno: Pedri is untouchable for Spain Alejandro Moreno describes Spain's Pedri as the best player in the world in his position after their 4-0 win over Bulgaria. Everyone knows how good this team is. They're first in the Elo ratings. They were first at this time last year, and their rating has gone up since. Just to give you a sense of where they're at, even without a fully functioning Rodri : Turkey are 14th on this list, and they lost to Spain, 5-0. The game was in Turkey, there were no red cards, and Spain didn't score a goal in the final 30 minutes of the match. France's front three at the next World Cup will presumably be a combination of Kylian Mbappé , Michael Olise and Ousmane Dembélé . Per Transfermarkt, their average market value is €127 million. Only three players in the history of world soccer have ever moved for that much money. Their backup forwards will likely come from Liverpool, PSG, Inter Milan, PSG and Manchester City. A starting center back from either Arsenal, Bayern Munich , or Liverpool will be on the bench next summer. France won the 2018 World Cup, they lost the 2022 World Cup final in a shootout, and the players they take to the 2026 World Cup might have more talent than either of those teams.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46587255/2026-world-cup-squad-ranking-national-teams-win,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560359_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,0cb51240fde23368e3c3e4dc1d50825dc602378a

Myanmar's Lwin Moe Aung scored the very first goal in a 5-1 win over Macau. All confederations are drawing to a close, but we're still a long way from discovering the full list of 45 nations that will join hosts United States , Mexico and Canada to make up the field of 48. Japan were the very first country to qualify on March 20. QUALIFIED (25/45): Japan, New Zealand, Iran, Argentina, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Australia, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, Cape Verde, South Africa, Qatar, England, Saudi Arabia, Ivory Coast, Senegal What was decided in October? Europe and Concacaf: Qualifying doesn't end until November, but we did see England become the first European country to book their place.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in UEFA Nations League (UNL) action played their first matches. QUALIFIED (1/12): England What happened in October? The teams that were in the UNL finals only played their first games in September so we're still a way off from discovering all the qualifiers. Group A: Germany (9, +5) and Slovakia (9, +3) are in the box seat, and Northern Ireland (6, +1) will surely have to win in Slovakia on Nov. 14 to stay in contention. The final group game between Germany and Slovakia in Leipzig on Nov. 17 looks like being the decider, though. If Northern Ireland miss out on the top two, they are almost certain to get a playoff through the Nations League route. Luxembourg (0) are out. Group B: Switzerland (10, +9) hold a lead over Kosovo (7, -1) and their goal difference is worth an extra point. In effect, it means the Swiss will have qualified in all but name if they win at home to Sweden (1) on Nov. 15. If they don't, it could open the door to Kosovo, who are away to Slovenia (3) before hosting Switzerland in what could be a decider on Nov. 18. Slovenia must beat Kosovo to keep alive their hopes of a playoff. Sweden are all but out of it but are set to get a playoff route through the Nations League. Group C: Denmark (10, +11) and Scotland (10, +5) are the only two teams left in contention. On Nov. 15, it's Denmark vs. Belarus while Scotland go to Greece. As long as Scotland avoid defeat, the group is set up for a decider between the top two in Glasgow on Nov. 18; that looks like being must-win for Scotland as their goal difference is not as good. Greece and Belarus are eliminated. Group D: France (10, +6) still have work to do to hold off Ukraine (7, +1) in second. On Nov. 13, it's France vs. Ukraine and Les Bleus will qualify with a victory. Even if France lose, goal difference means they are in strong position with a home game against Azerbaijan (1, -9) to finish up on Nov. 16. Iceland (4, +2) will hope that France get the win, as if Iceland beat Azerbaijan they will move into the playoff place on goal difference. And that sets up a huge final day-game between Ukraine and Iceland in Warsaw. Azerbaijan have only a mathematical chance of a playoff. Group E: Spain (12) are top with a 100% record with Turkey (9) the nearest challengers. Spain have a goal difference advantage of 12 over Turkey, so they will qualify in all but name with a victory in Georgia (3) on Nov. 15 (and it will be certain if Turkey do not win at home to Bulgaria). Turkey look set for the playoffs, while Bulgaria (0) are out. Group F: Portugal (10) are close to qualification but a late Hungary (5) equaliser in Lisbon meant they must wait until November to seal it. A win in Republic of Ireland (4) on Nov. 13 seals it for Portugal, but the Irish need results in the race for second place. On the same day it's Armenia (3) vs. Hungary, with the away team able to seal second place with a win if Ireland lose to Portugal. On the final day on Nov. 16, it's Hungary vs. Ireland and Portugal vs. Armenia. Group G: Netherlands (16, +19) sit top ahead of Poland (13, +4), who do still have to host Netherlands on Nov. 14 but their goal difference is 13 worse right now -- so the Dutch know they can afford to lose that and as long as they win at home to Lithuania (3) on Nov. 17 they'll still top the group. With a game in hand on Finland (10, -5) and far superior goal difference, it looks like Poland will be in the playoffs. Lithuania and Malta are out. Group H: A surprise win for Romania (10) at home to Austria (15) has reignited the group, but Austria remain favourites to top it. Nov. 15: Austria will qualify with a win in Cyprus (8) if Bosnia and Herzegovina (13) draw or lose at home to Romania, who must at least avoid defeat to stay in contention for a playoff spot (though they will get a route as a UEFA Nations League group winner regardless). Romania finish up at home to San Marino, so if they can beat Bosnia they will be odds-on to finish at least second, and that would benefit another country through the Nations League route. Nov. 18: If Bosnia and Austria both win (or results to keep the two teams in touch), then they meet each other in Vienna to decide who qualifies automatically. Cyprus are out and San Marino have only slim hope of a playoff through the Nations League route. Group I: Norway (18, +26) are in control ahead of Italy (15, +10) and it's Norway's vastly superior goal difference which means a win at home to Estonia (4) on Nov. 13 should effectively do the job, even if Italy win away to Moldova (1) that day. On the final day, it's Italy vs. Norway; if Norway go into it three points ahead then Italy would need a huge win to avoid the playoffs. Group J: Belgium (14, +15), who moved back to the top of the table with a 4-2 win in Wales, finish up against two eliminated teams -- away to Kazakhstan (7) on Nov. 15 and at home to Liechtenstein (0). As North Macedonia have only one fixture to play, Belgium need three points to qualify, so they will do it by beating Kazakhstan -- though the second game against Liechtenstein means it's effectively a formality. North Macedonia (13, +9) will look to hold off Wales (10, +3) for second. Wales go to Liechtenstein first up, before a huge game against North Macedonia in Cardiff. Wales need to win by six goals in the first game to go into the match in second on goal difference, which would mean a draw would be enough in the last game. While both North Macedonia and Wales are guaranteed a playoff route through the Nations League, finishing in second gives a better seeding -- and for Wales a home semifinal. Group K: ENGLAND (18) have dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record without conceding a goal. It was sealed with a 5-0 win in Latvia. Albania (11) hold the playoff place over Serbia (10), and both play England in November. As Albania's other game is vs. Andorra (1) they are favourites to finish second. England became the first European country to qualify. Tullio Puglia - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images Group L: Croatia (16, +19) now look locked for the World Cup and need just one point from games in November at home to Faroe Islands (12) and away to Montenegro (6). Even if they lost both matches, their goal difference is far better than that of Czechia (13, +4), who have one game left. A shock win for the Faroes at home to Czechia is unlikely to mean they can gatecrash the playoff place, because Czechia's last remaining game is at home to Gibraltar on Nov. 17. Faroe Islands are away to Croatia on Nov. 14, and Czechia will be assured of second if the Faroes lose. Montenegro and Gibraltar are eliminated. - Check out the latest fixtures and results here | Tables PLAYOFFS The final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL, who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. This creates four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. The priority order for the four World Cup playoff places through the UNL is: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, England, Norway, Wales, Czechia, Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova, San Marino. Of the 14 teams to win their UNL groups, 10 of those were in Pot 1 or 2 for the World Cup qualifying draw -- so on ranking would finish in the top two of their group. If that comes to pass, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova and San Marino would get a playoff place. However, that now appears unlikely with Romania and Sweden struggling to finish in the top two. Seeding: Pot 1: Four World Cup qualifying group runners-up with the best FIFA World Ranking Pot 2: As above, teams fifth to eighth in the FIFA World Ranking list order Pot 3: As above, teams ninth to 12th in the FIFA World Ranking list order Pot 4: UEFA Nations League teams Semifinals: Pot 1 vs. Pot 4 Pot 2 vs. Pot 3 The World Cup Trophy on display in New York during the official Trophy Tour around host cities.

Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images This is by some distance the most complicated route to the World Cup, with a layered qualifying process featuring a dual group stage to find the eight automatic qualifiers. But the main part is now done and dusted. Round 1: The 20 lowest-ranked nations played two-legged ties in October 2023. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore and Yemen advanced. Round 2: Those 10 winners joined the 26 best-ranked nations. The 36 teams were drawn into nine groups of four teams, with the top two nations going through to Round 3. This stage began in November 2023 and was completed in June 2024. - Final tables Advanced: Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyz Republic, North Korea, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan Round 3: We were left with 18 nations, drawn into three groups of six teams. Matches began in September 2024 and the round is completed on Tuesday. The group winners and runners-up took the first six places at the 2026 World Cup and their campaign is complete. Japan became the first team to qualify for the World Cup on March 20, followed by Iran , Jordan , South Korea , Uzbekistan and Australia . - Check out the results | Final tables Round 4: The six teams in this stage were drawn into two groups of three. They played each other once, so two matches in total per team, in one host country in October. QUALIFIED (8/8): Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Australia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia What was decided in October? We found out the final two automatic qualifiers, plus the teams that will battle it out for a playoff in round five. Group A: Qatar (hosts), United Arab Emirates, Oman Wednesday: Oman 0-0 Qatar Saturday: United Arab Emirates 2-1 Oman Tuesday: Qatar 2-1 United Arab Emirates Qatar won the final group game 2-1 and qualified for the World Cup, while UAE are in the playoff. Group B: Saudi Arabia (hosts), Iraq, Indonesia Wednesday: Indonesia 2-3 Saudi Arabia Saturday: Iraq 1-0 Indonesia Tuesday: Saudi Arabia 0-0 Iraq A goalless draw meant the two hosts of the playoffs both qualified, Iraq move into the playoffs. Round 5: A two-legged tie in November 2025 to earn the place in the interconfederation playoffs. UAE will play Saudi Arabia. Usually, Concacaf would have six automatic places in qualifying -- but for the 2026 finals three of the six are taken up by the hosts. That leaves three places to be won, plus two spots in the interconfederation playoff path. Concacaf saw 32 nations enter the race to make the finals. Round 1: The four lowest-ranked Concacaf nations battled it out in two-legged ties. Anguilla and British Virgin Islands eliminated Turks and Caicos Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands respectively, both on penalties. Round 2: The top 28-ranked nations, plus the two winners from Round 1, were drawn into six groups of five teams. Teams played each other only once, rather than home and away. This stage was played in two blocks, in June 2024 and June 2025. The six group winners and six group runners-up moved on to Round 3. Advanced: Bermuda, Costa Rica, Curaçao, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago Round 3: The 12 remaining teams were drawn into three groups of four teams. This phase started in September and will be completed in October and November. The group winners will qualify for the World Cup, with the two runners-up with the best record going on to take part in the interconfederation playoffs. - Check out the fixtures and results | Latest tables QUALIFIED (0/3): What can be decided in October? Group A: Panama (6) and Suriname (6) drew 1-1, with a 1-0 win for Guatemala (5) in El Salvador (3) leaving the group wide open -- and it's guaranteed to go to the last day. On November, 13 it's Suriname vs. El Salvador and Guatemala vs. Panama. The group finishes up on Nov. 18 with Guatemala vs. Suriname and Panama vs. El Salvador. Group B: Jamaica (9) moved top of the group with a 4-0 thrashing of Bermuda (0), who are now eliminated. Closest challengers Curaçao (8) drew at home to Trinidad and Tobago (5). Jamaica can qualify on Nov. 13 with a victory in Trinidad & Tobago if Curaçao fail to win in Bermuda. The last-day showdown between Jamaica and Curaçao in Kingston looks decisive, however. Group C: Honduras (8) are in a good position after they beat Haiti (5) on Monday. The nearest challengers are Costa Rica (6), who thrashed Nicaragua (1). Nov. 13 sees Honduras go to Nicaragua, and a win will send them to the World Cup if Haiti vs. Costa Rica is a draw. On the final day on Nov. 18 it's Costa Rica vs. Honduras, which could yet be a decider for the automatic qualification place. As in recent qualifying competitions, all 10 nations played each other home and away. The top six nations qualified directly to the finals. The seventh-placed team goes into the interconfederation playoffs in March. The first qualifiers took place in September 2023, with the league phase completed in September 2025.

2b6945ca719c,College Football Playoff 2025: Bubble watch at midseason,,"Week 7 shook up the College Football Playoff picture. No team earned a more impactful result than Indiana, whose win at Oregon is now the best in the country during the first half of the season. Indiana's playoff chances jumped 21%, climbing to a 93% chance to make the playoff, according to the Allstate Playoff Predictor . Not only are the Hoosiers off the bubble, but Indiana also is chasing a first-round bye as one of the top four seeds, having cemented its place alongside Ohio State and Miami as one of the nation's best teams. Indiana wasn't the only winner, though, as South Florida and Texas Tech both saw their playoff chances jump by at least 15%. Below you'll find one team in the spotlight for each of the Power 4 leagues and another identified as an enigma. We've also tiered schools into three groups. Teams with Would be in status are featured in this week's top 12 projection , a snapshot of what the selection committee's ranking would look like if it were released today. Teams listed as On the cusp are the true bubble teams and the first ones outside the bracket. A team with Work to do is passing the eye test (for the most part) and has a chance at winning its conference, which means a guaranteed spot in the playoff. And a team that Would be out is playing in the shadows of the playoff -- for now. The 13-member selection committee doesn't always agree with the Allstate Playoff Predictor, so the following categories are based on historical knowledge of the group's tendencies plus what each team has done to date. Reminder: This will change from week to week as each team builds -- or busts -- its résumé. Jump to a conference: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten SEC | Independent | Group of 5 Bracket SEC Jacob Kupferman/Getty Images Spotlight: Tennessee . The Vols have looked like a borderline playoff team against unranked opponents in recent weeks, beating Mississippi State and Arkansas by a combined 10 points with one overtime. Offensively they've been elite, averaging 300 yards passing and 200 rushing per game. Defensively, they need to stop the run to make to challenge in the SEC. They'll have a chance against Alabama on Saturday to further legitimize their hopes. With a win, Tennessee's chances of reaching the playoff would jump to 52%, according to the Allstate Playoff Predictor. Tennessee ranks No. 10 in ESPN's game control metric and No. 19 in strength of record. The Vols are projected in the committee's No. 12 spot this week, which means they would get knocked out of the actual field during the seeding process to make room for the highest-ranked Group of 5 champion. The five highest-ranked conference champions are guaranteed spots in the playoff, so if the fifth team is ranked outside of the committee's top 12, its No. 12 team gets the boot. Enigma: Texas . The Longhorns took a baby step toward a return to CFP relevance with a big win against Oklahoma, but it was their first win against a Power 4 opponent and their first against a ranked team. Texas has the 15th-most-difficult remaining schedule, and with two losses is already in a precarious position. The Longhorns will play three of their next four opponents on the road (at Kentucky, Mississippi State and Georgia). There were encouraging signs from the win against the rival Sooners, from the stingy defense that flustered quarterback John Mateer all game to what looked like an improved offensive line that gave quarterback Arch Manning some time to throw. He completed 16 of 17 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown when under no duress. If Texas can continue to put it all together against the heart of its SEC schedule, it could make a run to be one of the committee's top two-loss teams. If the playoff were today Would be in: Alabama, Georgia, LSU, Oklahoma, Ole Miss, Texas A&M On the cusp: Tennessee Work to do: Missouri, Texas, Vanderbilt Would be out: Arkansas, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi State, South Carolina Big Ten Spotlight: USC . The Trojans have looked like a CFP top 25 team through the first half of the season, with their only loss a close one on the road to a ranked Illinois team. In Week 7, USC's convincing 31-13 win against Michigan pushed it into more serious Big Ten contention. Ohio State and Indiana are the leaders, followed by Oregon, but USC has the fourth-best chance (7.1%) to reach the Big Ten title game, according to ESPN Analytics. That will change when the Trojans go to Oregon on Nov. 22, but they don't play Ohio State or Indiana during the regular season. A win at Notre Dame on Saturday would be a significant boost to USC's playoff résumé, while simultaneously knocking the Irish out of playoff contention. According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor, USC's chances of reaching the playoff would adjust to 58% with a win against Notre Dame. According to ESPN Analytics, USC has less than a 50% chance to win its games against Notre Dame and Oregon. Enigma: Washington . The Huskies have improved significantly and quickly under coach Jedd Fisch, who's in his second season. Their only loss was to Ohio State, 24-6, on Sept. 27, but they lack a statement win that gives them real postseason credibility. Wins at Washington State and Maryland are certainly respectable, but bigger opportunities loom starting on Saturday at Michigan. This game has significant implications, because if the Huskies can win, they stand a strong chance of hosting Oregon as a one-loss team in the regular-season finale. According to ESPN Analytics, Michigan has a 67.6% chance to win on Saturday, and Oregon has a 70% chance to beat Washington on Nov. 29. The Huskies are projected to win every other game, though. A win against Michigan could increase their playoff hopes significantly. If the playoff were today Would be in: Indiana, Ohio State, Oregon On the cusp: USC Work to do: Nebraska, Washington Would be out: Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Northwestern, Penn State, Purdue, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin ACC Spotlight: Georgia Tech . Raise your hand if you had Georgia Tech at Duke on Saturday circled as a game that would impact the College Football Playoff. The Yellow Jackets would have been the next team to crack the latest CFP projection this week, and their chances of reaching the ACC championship game will skyrocket if they can win at Duke. Georgia Tech currently has the fourth-best chance to reach the ACC title game behind Miami, Duke and Virginia. ESPN Analytics gives the Blue Devils a 61.8% chance to win. The only other projected loss on the Jackets' schedule is the regular-season finale against Georgia. Even if Georgia Tech reaches the ACC title game and loses, it could get in as a second ACC team with a win over Georgia. Enigma: Virginia . The Hoos have won back-to-back overtime games against Florida State and Louisville, putting themselves in contention for a spot in the ACC championship. They host a tricky Washington State team on Saturday that just gave Ole Miss a few headaches, though, and need to avoid a second loss to an unranked team. The toughest game left on their schedule is Nov. 15 at Duke. Without an ACC title, Virginia is going to have a tough time impressing the committee with a schedule that includes a loss to unranked NC State and possibly no wins against ranked opponents. It didn't help the Hoos that Florida State lost to an unranked Pitt, as the win against the Noles was the highlight of their season so far. If the playoff were today Would be in: Miami On the cusp: Georgia Tech Work to do: Virginia Would be out: Boston College, Cal, Clemson, Duke, Florida State, Louisville, North Carolina, NC State, Pitt, SMU, Stanford, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest Big 12 Spotlight: BYU . The Cougars needed a late-night double-overtime win at Arizona to stay undefeated and are on the path to face Texas Tech in the Big 12 championship game. The question is if they can stay undefeated until the Nov. 8 regular-season matchup against the Red Raiders. BYU has its second-most difficult remaining game on Saturday against rival Utah, which is also in contention for the Big 12 title. BYU has a slim edge with a 51% chance to win, which would be a critical cushion considering back-to-back road trips to Iowa State and Texas Tech await. The Big 12 has also gotten a boost from Cincinnati, which has a favorable remaining schedule and could be a surprise CFP top 25 team. If BYU stumbles over the next three weeks, a road win at a ranked Cincinnati team would help its résumé. Speaking of the Bearcats ... All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Enigma: Cincinnati . Is this team for real? The Bearcats have won five straight since their 20-17 season-opening loss to Nebraska, including three straight against Big 12 opponents Kansas, Iowa State and UCF. All three of those teams are .500 or better, and the selection committee will respect that as long as it holds. Cincinnati also has November opportunities against Utah and BYU, which could change the playoff picture in the Big 12. ESPN Analytics gives the Bearcats less than a 50% chance to beat Utah, BYU and TCU. If the playoff were today Would be in: Texas Tech On the cusp: BYU Work to do: Cincinnati, Houston, Utah Would be out: Arizona, Arizona State, Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Oklahoma State, TCU, UCF, West Virginia Independent Would be out: Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish have the best chance to win out of any team in the FBS, with a 49% chance to finish 10-2. According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor, Notre Dame would have a 50% chance to reach the CFP if it runs the table. That seems accurate, given the selection committee would compare Notre Dame against the other 10-2 contenders, and it's a coin toss as to whether the room would agree that the Irish's résumé and film make them worthy of an at-large bid. How Miami and Texas A&M fare will impact this -- as will the head-to-head results if those teams don't win their respective leagues and are also competing with the Irish for one of those at-large spots. It helps Notre Dame that opponents USC and Navy could finish as CFP top 25 teams if they continue to win. Undefeated Navy could also make a run at the Group of 5 playoff spot. Group of 5 Spotlight: South Florida . South Florida. The Bulls are back on top after their convincing 63-36 win at previously undefeated North Texas, which just a week ago was listed here as a potential Group of 5 contender. Following the win, the Bulls' chances of reaching the CFP increased by 20%, according to ESPN Analytics. South Florida's lone loss was Sept. 13 at Miami, 49-12, which was a significant defeat against what could be the committee's No. 1 team. Although that result showed the gap between the Bulls and one of the nation's top teams, it certainly didn't eliminate South Florida, which has one of the best overall résumés of the other contenders. With wins against Boise State, Florida and now at North Texas, this is a team that earned the edge in this week's latest projection . Still, South Florida has the second-best chance of any Group of 5 school to reach the playoff (30%) behind Memphis (42%), according to ESPN Analytics. Enigma: UNLV . Undefeated UNLV survived a scare from 1-5 Air Force on Saturday to stay undefeated and in contention for a playoff spot. UNLV and Boise State, both of the Mountain West Conference, are the only teams outside of the American Conference with at least a 5% chance to reach the playoff, and they play each other in a critical game on Saturday. UNLV has scored at least 30 points in each of its six games this season and is 6-0 for the first time since 1974, but it hasn't always been pretty. UNLV scored the winning touchdown against Air Force with 36 seconds left and allowed the Falcons 603 total yards. The Rebels have the fourth-best chance to reach the playoff at 9% behind the American's Memphis, South Florida and Tulane. If the playoff were today Would be in: South Florida Work to do: Memphis, Navy, Tulane, UNLV Bracket Based on our weekly projection , the seeding would be: First-round byes No. 1 Ohio State (Big Ten champ) No. 2 Miami (ACC champ) No. 3 Indiana No. 4 Texas A&M (SEC champ) First-round games On campus, Dec. 19 and 20 No. 12 South Florida (American champ) at No. 5 Alabama No. 11 LSU at No. 6 Ole Miss No. 10 Oklahoma at No. 7 Georgia No. 9 Texas Tech (Big 12 champ) at No. 8 Oregon Quarterfinal games At the Goodyear Cotton Bowl, Capital One Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl Presented by Prudential and Allstate Sugar Bowl on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.

cc8e52fe340b,Best (and worst) men's college basketball offseason moves,,"Over the past six months, college basketball has once again experienced another offseason full of coaching changes, staff moves, portal action and recruiting gains and losses. As a result, the landscape is stacked with teams that have seemed to master the new Moneyball approach to restructuring teams every spring and summer. There are others who did not make the improvements they may have anticipated, which means there are winners and losers in this conversation. Our 2025-26 superlatives list attempts to make some sense of what just unfolded and sort the victors from those who might have missed out this offseason. Best overall offseason Florida Gators After winning the national title, Todd Golden lost the best backcourt in America. Departures included the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player in Walter Clayton Jr. and two more players who were selected in the 2025 NBA draft (Alijah Martin and Will Richard) -- but that's only part of the story. The return of Golden's frontcourt wasn't a guarantee as key players flirted with the NBA draft. But the Gators enter the season with a strong case to be the No. 1 team in the country after securing the returns of Thomas Haugh , Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu . They also added former five-star recruit Boogie Fland and all-Ivy League guard Xaivian Lee . In this turbulent climate, few teams have managed to lose the core of a championship squad and bounce back the way this team has ahead of the 2025-26 campaign. Florida won't look exactly like the title-winning team did, but it will be similarly equipped to chase another ring. The chemistry the Gators foster over the course of the season will matter the most. Lee and Fland will have to share ballhandling responsibilities. Golden wants Haugh to be an inside-outside threat. And Condon is an SEC Player of the Year candidate who will have to deal with the pressure that comes with that attention. These are all good problems to have because it means Florida has the pieces to be the best team in America again. Strongest overall transfer class St. John's Red Storm Rick Pitino made New York City fall in love with St. John's basketball again with a run to the Big East conference and tournament championships last season. The Red Storm shouldn't lose any ground as a result of Pitino again hitting the reset button in the portal, with a transfer class headlined by Ian Jackson (North Carolina), Bryce Hopkins (Providence), Oziyah Sellers (Stanford) and Joson Sanon (Arizona State) -- all of whom averaged double figures at their previous stops. Now, there are questions. Will Jackson be a consistent presence this season? He demonstrated his ability to impact a game at a high level only in spurts at North Carolina. Will Hopkins stay healthy? He has battled injuries in recent years. Will Sellers and Sanon continue to build on strong seasons a year ago? It certainly seems possible. But the questions don't supersede the potential for this stacked group of transfer talent to excel under Pitino. There's also Dylan Darling -- a star at Idaho State who scored 35 combined points between matchups against UCLA and USC last season -- could be a hidden gem. And Dillon Mitchell is a veteran at his third school. Pitino won big with a similar group a year ago. The same thing could happen in 2025-26. Rick Pitino has recruited strong transfer classes to St. John's in back-to-back seasons. Brian Fluharty-Imagn Images Most impactful transfer commitment Darrion Williams , NC State Last year, Will Wade won 28 games at McNeese State and led the Cowboys to the second round of the NCAA tournament before he left for NC State -- his first power conference job since being fired by LSU in 2022 as a result of recruiting violation allegations . He hit the ground running in Raleigh by adding some of the best players in the portal, including Williams. The former Texas Tech star scored 23 points as the Red Raiders nearly knocked off Florida in the Elite Eight. Averaging 15.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.3 steals in 2024-25, Williams is one of America's most versatile players. His arrival gives Wade a chance to put his team in the NCAA tournament conversation a year after the program won just 12 games. Biggest transfer portal loss P.J. Haggerty , from Memphis to Kansas State Penny Hardaway had his most successful season as coach at Memphis when Haggerty -- an Associated Press second-team All-American and AAC Player of the Year -- helped the Tigers win 29 games en route to capturing the regular-season and conference tournament championships in 2025-26 while averaging 21.2 PPG. Haggerty isn't the only star that the Tigers lost in the portal, but he is the most pivotal prospect who departed. Now a Memphis team that ended last season as a trendy pick to reach the second weekend of the NCAA tournament -- until a foot injury that Tyrese Hunter sustained during the AAC tournament changed the Tigers' outlook -- will have to rebuild without one of the country's top returning players. Strongest recruiting class Duke Blue Devils Cameron Boozer is the obvious headliner for Jon Scheyer's program, but Duke is stacked with young talent that will once again put the Blue Devils in the Final Four conversation. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Boozer, a 6-foot-9 do-it-all talent, is a two-time Gatorade National Player of the Year who could be the most polished freshman in the country. His twin brother Cayden Boozer could also leave his mark on this program. Nikolas Khamenia , a top-15 prospect, had a great offseason on the USA Basketball circuit. And Dame Sarr is a 6-foot-8 former EuroLeague standout who could be a major addition, too -- he was ranked as a lottery pick in ESPN's latest NBA 2026 mock draft . With 6-foot-8 Sebastian Wilkins -- who reclassified from the 2026 class to the 2025 class -- also in the fold, the Blue Devils will have the size and versatility to compete with any team in America. Yes, they are young, but they won't have talent disparities against most opponents. Best freshman* *after top-three recruits AJ Dybantsa , Darryn Peterson and Cameron Boozer Nate Ament , Tennessee Volunteers Since 2019, Rick Barnes has coached 11 players who were drafted by NBA teams. He knows talent. And he called five-star freshman Ament, a 6-foot-11 small forward, the ""No. 1 player in the class"" this past April. Ament is not as physically ready as the three players ahead of him -- Peterson, Dybantsa and Boozer -- in ESPN's latest 2026 NBA mock draft. But Ament's ceiling is high in a scheme that has produced elite players such as Dalton Knecht, Chaz Lanier and Grant Williams in recent years. Ament is big, can play and guard multiple positions, and will continue to grow throughout the season as he begins to understand this level of basketball. His coach will help him get there. Barnes has shown a willingness to adapt by allowing his elite players to get the shots they want when they are on the floor, rather than being married to a system. That's how Knecht earned SEC Player of the Year honors two years ago before he was selected 17th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2024 draft. Ament could follow the same path. Most surprising recruiting miss Darius Acuff Jr . choosing Arkansas over Michigan The No. 7 recruit in ESPN's 2025 rankings is the top-rated point guard in the class, and was also a high school superstar in the state of Michigan until he ended his prep career at IMG Academy in Florida. The Detroit native had three great choices for the next chapter of his career, ultimately selecting Arkansas over Kansas and Michigan, in part because John Calipari has produced a fleet of high-level point guards who became standouts in the NBA (John Wall, De'Aaron Fox, Derrick Rose). Bill Self had already landed Peterson, who is in the running to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft, but Dusty May missed a chance to turn the in-state star into the next great point guard for the Wolverines. Michigan is still a threat to reach the Final Four, of course. With Acuff, however, May's squad would have been in a different tier entering this season. Highest-upside coaching hire Sean Miller, Texas Longhorns During a 20-year coaching career that includes two stints at Xavier and a stop at Arizona, Sean Miller has won at least 20 games in 15 season (or 75% of his coaching tenure). That consistency over a stretch that includes the most transformative chapter in college basketball history with the introduction of NIL deals, revenue sharing and the transfer portal has demanded consistency that is difficult to attain. Yet, Miller managed to lead three different programs to the Sweet 16 or beyond. At Texas, Miller's standards and expectations will remain. While the SEC has been one of the country's strongest conferences in recent years, Miller has proved that he can elevate the Longhorns to the same heights Arizona once reached under his watch.",https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/46587135/mens-college-basketball-offseason-moves-transfers-recruits-coaches-2025-26,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559839_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e93f27fbe18d2d08c644dc807f2e0c06002e5ba6
8a2103da1352,ESPN,,"RULES ESPN's Bracketology efforts are focused on projecting the NCAA tournament field just as we expect the NCAA Division I basketball committee to select the field in March. ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi uses the same data points favored by the committee, including strength of schedule and other season-long indicators, including the NET and team-sheet data similar to what is available to the NCAA, in his projections of the field. Visit the NCAA's website for a fuller understanding of NCAA selection criteria . 68-Team Bracket The 68-team bracket is the standard version of the NCAA tournament field that has been in place since 2011. If the 2021 field is comprised of 68 teams, there will be some key differences to past years, however. The primary adjustment from a normal year is, of course, the playing of the entire NCAA tournament at a single site. This eliminates the need for geographical considerations in seeding. Additionally, there will be at least one fewer automatic qualifier this season, as the Ivy League's decision to forgo the 2020-21 season reduces the number of AQ entries to 31 for this season. 48-Team Bracket In this projection, a condensed selection process would reduce the field by 10 at-large teams and 10 automatic qualifiers (the latter of which still receive a revenue unit). The top four seeds in each region would receive a bye into the second round, with four first-round games per region - 5 vs. 12, 6 vs. 11, 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9 - being played without fans on the higher seed's home court. To minimize travel, first-round pairings will be guided by geography to the greatest extent possible. And the reduced field results in only 32 teams competing at the central site. All participants must post a minimum .500 conference record - the ""Lunardi Rule"" - for at-large consideration. 16-Team Bracket In this projection, the committee selects and seeds the 16 best available teams. There are no automatic qualifiers, although all non-competing conference champions receive the designated revenue unit. To maintain some sense of national balance, conference participation is capped at four teams. And no region shall have more than one team from the same conference.",https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/bracketology/ncaa-bracketology-2026-march-madness-men-field-predictions,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/1014/r1559874_1296x729_16-9.jpg,,2fd04a16c4e682fea364970d1ce6124329a7c55c
8c06a359b95e,"2025-26 NBA season simulation: Predictions, playoffs, Finals",,"How will the NBA season look if my stats-based projections are an accurate measure of team ability? The purpose of simulating the NBA season ahead of time is generally to see how often various things are likely to happen, from the weakest teams winning the draft lottery to the best ones taking home the Larry O'Brien Trophy. It can also be fun to go through individual runs of the simulation to give an idea of what unlikely events could become reality based on random chance. In the spirit of ESPN's NFL tradition of detailing the events of a single simulation , let's go through the NBA season using simulation No. 620 -- chosen because of its interesting outcomes -- from opening night to the end of the NBA Finals. Note, this is not my prediction (or ESPN's) of how this season will unfold. The outcomes are produced at random via simulation, and everything else, including player stats, takes creative license. Along the way, we'll crown an NBA Cup winner, enjoy the action on Christmas Day, determine the final playoff seeds, set the draft lottery and winner, run through the play-in tournament, playoffs and finally, name the 2025-26 NBA champion. Let's get to it. Oct. 21: Thunder, Warriors dominate Opening Night Oklahoma City Thunder over Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors over Los Angeles Lakers After getting their championship rings and raising the first banner in the rafters at Paycom Arena, the Thunder showed why they were favored to repeat with an impressive win during Kevin Durant 's Houston debut. Durant scored 27 points against his former team, the first day of the regular season, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams both topped 20 points and Chet Holmgren had five blocks. Later, the Warriors spoiled Luka Doncic 's first home opener with the Lakers, handing them a 107-99 defeat. Afterward, an ebullient Draymond Green vowed that the Warriors, not Oklahoma City, should be considered the title favorites.

Boston, off to a 16-10 start without the injured Jayson Tatum , finished as the No. 1 seed in the East play-in and beat the Pistons at home and the Heat in the semifinals in Las Vegas. The upstart Blazers, also 16-10, took advantage of the Thunder getting upset by the Timberwolves at home during the quarterfinals. Portland also won on the road, in Memphis, and then beat Minnesota in the semifinals. Alas, the Blazers' run ended in a 115-103 loss. Portland shot 10-of-36 on 3s, while Derrick White and Payton Pritchard made four apiece for Boston, which immediately shut down talk of referring to the NBA Cup as ""Banner 19."" Still, the Celtics were able to match the rival Lakers' inaugural NBA Cup title. Dec. 25: Knicks, Lakers stumble on Christmas Struggling teams were the storyline on Christmas Day. The Cavaliers and Knicks , who entered the season as East favorites, were 11th and seventh, respectively, going into their matchup at Madison Square Garden. The Cavaliers, buried by early-season injuries to the backcourt, got some measure of satisfaction with a win over the Knicks. There was no such relief for the Lakers, who dropped five games below .500 after losing at home to Houston. The vibes were better for the top two teams in the West, the surprising Warriors and Thunder, who both won at home. So did the Denver Nuggets behind a 30-point triple-double from Nikola Jokic .

Green and Jimmy Butler III joined Steph Curry on the West roster thanks to Golden State's league-best 42-13 record at the break. In the rearview mirror of the experienced Warriors there was plenty of youth with the Thunder 4.5 games back in the West and the ascendant Magic atop the East with the NBA's second-best record. After their slow starts, the Knicks and Cavaliers had righted the ships, moving up to second and fourth in the conference, respectively. The Clippers were tied for fourth in the West, but their crosstown rivals continued to stumble. Now 12 games below .500, the Lakers were all but eliminated from the play-in race at six games back of the Sacramento Kings for 10th. LeBron James mused about taking March off to watch his son Bryce play in the NCAA tournament for the Arizona Wildcats. NBA Standings through All-Star Break Eastern Conf. W L Win% Western Conf.

With less than two weeks left in the regular season, plenty remained at stake, including the top seed in the West. The Thunder had closed within 2.5 games of the still-hot Warriors. The race to avoid the play-in was hard-fought with three teams at 40 wins apiece, albeit with the Blazers two games back in the loss column of Houston and Minnesota. Two games back in the loss column for the play-in, the Mavericks were still looking to make it with Kyrie Irving 's return to the lineup. In the East, the Celtics -- who had gone just 19-30 since winning the NBA Cup -- were trying to hold off the Philadelphia 76ers and disappointing Detroit Pistons to reach the play-in.

In the East, the Magic ran away with the top seed and finished seven games clear of the Knicks. The No. 6 seed in both conferences was decided via a tiebreaker. Cleveland, which fell back off the pace after the All-Star break, ended up in the play-in with the Milwaukee Bucks getting the No. 6 seed. Meanwhile, Houston won a tie out West, sending the Timberwolves to the play-in a year after they narrowly avoided it.

Not only did Chicago win in Miami to claim the No. 8 seed in the East playoffs, but the Bulls also landed a first-round pick when Portland capped its unexpected season by winning at the Target Center to earn the seventh spot in the West. Things went from bad to worse for the Timberwolves in the final game of the play-in tournament as the Sacramento Kings handed them a surprise 103-101 loss on a DeMar DeRozan pull-up jumper in the final five seconds. Sacramento players celebrated by donning ""Kings of the Play-in"" T-shirts, much to the Bulls' dismay. There was less drama in Cleveland, where the Cavaliers salvaged the No. 7 seed with a 31-point win over Miami reminiscent of last year's dominant first-round sweep. Draft lottery 1.

A swap from the Rudy Gobert trade sent the top pick to the Utah Jazz, who unsuccessfully attempted to deny their interest in drafting AJ Dybantsa from nearby BYU. The news wasn't all bad for Minnesota, which swapped down only to No. 5. Meanwhile, the 34-48 Pelicans didn't benefit from jumping up to No. 2, sending that pick to the Hawks to complete their deal on 2025 draft night. The Nets and Wizards claimed the next two picks, having entered with the best odds because of their combined 25 wins. Later on, the playoff-bound Thunder and Grizzlies acquired lottery picks through trades; the Grizzlies had the opportunity to swap for the Suns' pick in the Desmond Bane trade. Speaking to reporters before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged that the league's competition committee will revisit lottery odds to avoid teams preferring the lottery to advancing through the play-in tournament.

Two road teams with less experience won their Game 7s. The Toronto Raptors held former star Pascal Siakam to 15 points on 4-of-16 shooting for their first series win since 2020, and the Rockets shocked the Nuggets in Denver thanks to 12 fourth-quarter points from Durant. Houston hadn't advanced in the playoffs since 2019. The Clippers were the other lower seed to advance, beating Memphis, which ESPN BET listed as the underdog before the series.

With Curry playing through a minor injury by the end of the season, the Warriors' potent offense operated at less than full strength. Orlando took advantage, unexpectedly winning the first championship in franchise history barely a year after upgrading their starting lineup with Bane. Paolo Banchero completed a breakthrough campaign by scoring 32 points in Game 7 and being named Finals MVP. He split votes with Franz Wagner , who averaged 22 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in the series while defending Butler.

75d6e41aa04d,Biggest injury returns for the 2025-26 NBA season,,"Oct 14, 2025, 07:00 AM ET We're a week away from opening tipoff for the 2025-26 NBA season with a few familiar faces and some new ones ready to take the court starting Oct. 21. Victor Wembanyama will be back and healthy to start the season after being shut down last February because of a blood clot in his right shoulder. And Zion Williamson will be back after playing in only 30 games last season for the New Orleans Pelicans because of various injuries. But you'll have to wait to see a few notable superstars debut this season. Los Angeles Lakers front man LeBron James is expected to sit out three to four weeks, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Plus, Kyrie Irving appears to be working his way back from his season-ending ACL tear last March. Before we get caught up in the whirlwind of the regular season, our NBA insiders provide updates on the injury status of key players and break down who is primed to make a notable return during opening week and who to keep an eye on as the regular season progresses. Zion Williamson, center, has sat out more games (268) than he has played (214) since turning pro in 2019. ESPN Ready for their return Zion Williamson , F, New Orleans Pelicans There was skinny Jokic. Then skinny Doncic dazzled on the cover of Men's Health. Now it's skinny Zion who has many buzzing about the Pelicans this season, as he appears to be in his best shape since looking like a once-in-a-generation prospect at Duke. Williamson credits Daniel Bove, the Pelicans' director of performance and sports science, for helping him transform his body through boxing and working out on a football field while rehabbing from a hamstring injury that plagued him all last season. In six seasons in the league, Williamson has played 60 or more games only twice and was shut down last season in March after dealing with a bone bruise , having played only 30 games. ""I really felt a shift in my body to where I would look at [Bove] and say, 'Dude, it feels good to feel good.' I haven't felt like this since college, high school, where I can walk into a gym, I feel good."" -- Ohm Youngmisuk Anthony Davis , F, Dallas Mavericks Davis was fully cleared weeks before training camp, having recovered from offseason surgery to repair a detached retina in his right eye . He will spend the preseason getting used to the protective glasses he'll have to wear the rest of his career, per doctor's orders, as well as shedding the 15 extra pounds he carried into training camp. The 6-foot-10 Davis, now listed at 268 pounds, downplayed any worries about his weight, saying it's normal for him to report to camp a little heavy. ""I never want to come in at my playing weight, because then I lose weight during the season and then I'm too small,"" Davis said. ""I lose about 10 to 12 pounds very quickly. ... So I'm never concerned about that. I feel great. I'm moving great. I feel good."" -- Tim MacMahon Anthony Davis was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks at last season's trade deadline. In the nine games he played for the Mavericks, he averaged 20 points and 4.4 assists. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images) Kristaps Porzingis , C, Atlanta Hawks Porzingis has a new home in Atlanta and the center, after dealing with a mysterious ailment that allowed him to play over 20 minutes in only one of his final six games with the Boston Celtics , says he's feeling good again. ""Honestly, I still don't have an exact answer,"" Porzingis said at Hawks media day when asked about what was bothering him. ""They had some sort of explanation for it, but it was lingering. That was the toughest part. Some days I was OK, energy was good and some days, boom, I had a crash. I'm glad it's gone now."" Porzingis played for the Latvia national team at EuroBasket this past summer and the center said the tournament helped him get back into shape for the upcoming season. The Hawks will need a healthy Porzingis to stretch the floor and provide a defensive presence at the rim for Trae Young and the Hawks to contend in the East. ""I don't know, maybe it was just my system needed some reset during the summer,"" Porzingis said. ""I was really happy I had this summer, got in shape, played the tournament, I felt confident again like I have the gas tank again."" -- Youngmisuk LaMelo Ball , G, Charlotte Hornets Ball spent time in the weight room this offseason to get stronger. After playing in a total of 105 games over the past three seasons combined because of injuries -- most recently being shut down last season to have surgery on his ankle and wrist -- Ball is determined to stay on the court. So far this preseason, coach Charles Lee and Ball have talked about the star point guard stepping up and leading the Hornets more this season. Lee said he has seen his point guard show some of his leadership in the weight room by adding muscle.

""Melo noticed that he is always drawing the best, most physical defender. At times, they made it difficult on him. ""So this year, adding that weight room piece for him was really important. ... I think he has increased his lean muscle mass, he has increased his weight."" -- Youngmisuk Victor Wembanyama , C, San Antonio Spurs Wembanyama was limited to 46 games last season because of right shoulder deep vein thrombosis. It motivated him to push himself physically and mentally this offseason in ways he has never experienced. He approached the offseason looking to try unconventional training methods , such as a 10-day retreat at a Shaolin temple in China, replete with meditation and kung fu training, and spent time working with Houston Rockets icon Hakeem Olajuwon . Early returns look promising. He has bullied defenders in the preseason and swatted shots from all over the court. Wembanyama is fully healthy and has improved his body control, adding upper- and lower-body strength. And according to the 21-year-old, the chances for a recurrence of DVT are very low. -- Michael C. Wright Tyrese Maxey , G, Philadelphia 76ers After sitting out the final few weeks of last season because of a finger injury -- one of many maladies during a season that, even by 76ers standards, felt particularly cursed -- Maxey is healthy and ready to go for the start of this season. He played in the two exhibition games in Abu Dhabi last week and is on track to begin the season as the starting point guard. Given the number of other injuries Philadelphia is already dealing with, the fact that Maxey is ready to go will be music to the ears of coach Nick Nurse. -- Tim Bontemps Ja Morant , G, Memphis Grizzlies Morant's goal to ""play 82,"" as he stated at media day, is already in jeopardy. He's considered week-to-week after spraining his left ankle during practice the day before the Grizzlies' preseason opener. Morant's acrobatic game makes durability an issue for the star guard. That's why Morant, whose popularity is fueled by his high-flying highlights, declared last season that he is ""not trying to dunk at all,"" prioritizing protecting himself over entertaining fans. Since serving a 25-game suspension to start the 2023-24 season, Morant has played in only 59 games. He has been sidelined during that stretch by a variety of injuries -- shoulder, hip, thigh, knee, back, foot, hamstring and ankle. -- MacMahon Opening night in question Jaren Jackson Jr ., F, Memphis Grizzlies Jackson's availability for the Oct. 22 season opener is in doubt as he works his way back from an early July surgery to repair a turf toe injury in his right foot. The Grizzlies announced entering training camp that Jackson would be able to return to play in four to six weeks, putting the two-time All-Star's timetable in late October or early November. The surgery occurred a couple of days after Jackson officially agreed to a five-year, $240 million contract extension, but the Grizzlies' front office was aware of the severity of the injury when that deal was finalized. -- MacMahon LeBron James , F, Los Angeles Lakers James will make history whenever he appears in his first game this season, becoming the only NBA player to have played 23 seasons. But for the first time in his career, James is injured before the season opener, ending his streak of playing in Game No. 1 for 22 straight years. James is dealing with sciatica down the right side of his body, according to the Lakers, and won't be reevaluated for another two to three weeks and has been limited to light shooting in training camp thus far, sitting out every practice and preseason game. James hinted at the injury -- which was sustained sometime in late July or early August during an on-court workout, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania -- during the team's media day when he told ESPN, ""I'm not where I want to be [physically].""  James also said he would be sure to stay connected to the team while he rehabilitated. ""My presence is going to be important,"" James told ESPN. ""Making sure that even if I'm not on the floor, I'm always in tune to what we're doing -- so I know what's going on at all times."" -- Dave McMenamin Zach Edey , C, Memphis Grizzlies Edey sit out at least the first two weeks of the season while recovering from offseason ankle surgery, according to the timetable the Grizzlies announced entering training camp. At the time, the team said that Edey could return to play in six to nine weeks. The longer end of that timetable would be the final weekend of November. Backup center Brandon Clarke also will sit out time to start the season while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery, so the Grizzlies will have a glaring lack of depth in the frontcourt. Memphis will have to rely heavily on journeyman Jock Landale , an offseason addition who has averaged 12.8 minutes while playing for three teams in his four-year NBA career. -- MacMahon Jalen Williams , F, Oklahoma City Thunder Williams initially suffered a fairly severe wrist injury -- a torn scapholunate ligament -- late in the regular season while grappling for a loose ball with Devin Booker in Phoenix. He played through it, estimating he needed nearly 30 painkilling shots during the Thunder's run to the title. That delayed surgery until July 1, attached to a 12-week reevaluation clock, which expired right before training camp. The team hasn't officially ruled Williams in or out for the regular-season opener, but he hasn't been in the contact portions of practice and has been spotted working only individually on the side, predominantly using his left hand. ""Still got some ways to go with it,"" Williams said at media day. -- Anthony Slater play 1:30 Shams details what makes OKC special after Jalen Williams' extension Shams Charania explains the significance of the Thunder locking up their core after Jalen Williams' extension. Jared McCain , G, Philadelphia 76ers Last season, McCain was well on his way to winning the league's Rookie of the Year award when he suffered a meniscus injury that cut things short after only 23 games last December -- adding to the injury bug that plagued Philadelphia last season. But while McCain is fully healed from that injury, he tore a tendon in his right (shooting) thumb that required surgery last month, an issue that will cost him time at the start of the regular season. Though the 76ers have plenty of guard depth, they also want to get McCain on the court with both Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe , the No. 3 pick in the June draft. -- Bontemps De'Aaron Fox , G, San Antonio Spurs Last March, Fox opted to undergo season-ending surgery to repair tendon damage in his left pinkie finger and recovered just fine from that setback, only to suffer a strained right hamstring during a summer workout that leaves in question his availability for San Antonio's Oct. 22 season opener at Dallas. Fox acknowledged he would sit out the preseason while expressing doubt he'd be ready to play in the opener. But internally, the team has been encouraged by Fox's progress. It's worth noting that San Antonio traditionally errs on the side of caution when bringing players back from injuries. It certainly helps that the roster features a glut of guards that includes last season's NBA Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and No. 2 pick Dylan Harper . -- Wright Dejounte Murray , G, New Orleans Pelicans Murray has spent six days a week in the training room, rehabbing and working his way back from a ruptured right Achilles tendon suffered at the end of January, and could be back this January. The point guard is eager to return after his first season in New Orleans was limited to only 31 games, as he was also hampered by a broken hand. Murray averaged 17.5 points, 7.4 assists, 6.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals after coming in a trade from Atlanta. ""I've been having fun seeing the progression, knowing that day it all happened, I just couldn't walk and couldn't feel my calf. It was a challenge and I accepted it."" -- Youngmisuk Until further notice Joel Embiid , C, Philadelphia 76ers In a familiar feeling for the 76ers and their fans -- most unfortunately -- there is no bigger health question in the league than Embiid, and specifically his troublesome left knee. For more than a calendar year, it has been unclear when, or if, Embiid is going to be right again, and he reiterated that at media day last month. ""I've had so many injuries,"" Embiid said. ""The only thing I've always told myself is you can't give up."" Though both Embiid and the 76ers are not giving up on the superstar center returning to the dominant form that led to winning the league's MVP award for the 2023 season, it remains unclear when he will be back on the court, be it at the start of the season or sometime after that. -- Bontemps play 0:55 How much of Joel Embiid will we see this season? Shams Charania joins ""NBA Today"" to explain why there is no set timeline for Joel Embiid to return from injury. Darius Garland , G, Cleveland Cavaliers After his postseason was affected by a turf toe injury, Garland opted to have surgery in June, one that is likely to sideline him for the first few weeks of the regular season. Garland said at media day last week that his recovery is on schedule and that he's running and doing on-court work. He remains out of participating with the team in practices to start the preseason, and isn't expected to be ready to play in any exhibition games. But Cleveland has made it clear that it isn't going to rush Garland back -- given the Cavaliers are hoping to be playing into June, and need Garland at 100% to do that. -- Bontemps Paul George , F, Philadelphia 76ers George's status for the start of the season remains unclear after it was announced he'd undergone an arthroscopic surgery after suffering an injury in an offseason workout -- an ominous sign after only playing in half the games in his first season in 2024-25. George, who has done some on-court work, said, ""I do think I will be at a good place, hopefully earlier than later. Can't get any worse than last year. That was a rock-bottom type of season."" We'll see if last season was, in fact, as bad as it can get, but the 76ers will be hoping George can be back either by opening night or soon thereafter. -- Bontemps Kyrie Irving , G, Dallas Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd went out of his way to push back against the perception that Irving is ""ahead of schedule"" in his recovery from a torn ACL suffered in early March. But Irving's progress is evident, and he hasn't been shy about putting the proof on display with his post-practice work during media access periods. Irving isn't only taking spot-up jump shots. He's working on his legendary isolation game, making one- and two-dribble moves against the defense of a team staffer. He often takes turns with No. 1  pick Cooper Flagg during these sessions, helping teach the 18-year-old rookie some tricks of the trade. When will Irving join Flagg in game action? Irving, 33, doesn't want to set a specific target date, preferring to pour himself into the daily grind. The Mavs would be happy to have Irving back in the mix around the All-Star break, which would give him about two months to chip off rust and ramp up before the postseason. -- MacMahon play 0:53 Jason Kidd doesn't consider Kyrie 'ahead of schedule' Mavs coach Jason Kidd dismisses reports that Kyrie Irving is ahead of schedule in his recovery. Lauri Markkanen , F, Utah Jazz A variety of injuries, most notably a lower-back issue, limited Markkanen last season to a career-low 47 games. But he bounced back over the summer and looked healthy, leading Finland to the bronze medal game at EuroBasket with a 29-point performance that included 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in an upset win over Nikola Jokic and Serbia. Markkanen sustained a left wrist bruise during the tournament, which forced him out of preseason games and has limited him for a good portion of the team's training camp. Markkanen said he's rehabbing daily, feeling better, and making progress, but added he's ""not sure of what the exact date is when I'm gonna start"" playing again. -- Wright",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46553585/biggest-injury-returns-2025-26-nba-season-wembanyama-zion-embiid,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fnba_biggest_injury_1296x729.png,,225c6861ab50a154e5bf83f9cc8b3293b6f24604
d2317fd9db81,NHL,,"It takes more than one elite player to win the Stanley Cup. The repeat champion Florida Panthers continue to prove that is true -- and the results of the NHL Rank poll for the 2025-26 season bear that out. We asked a panel of ESPN broadcasters, analysts, reporters and editors to rate players based on how good they will be this season compared with their peers. Emphasis was placed on their value for this coming season, which explains why players who are out injured (but expected to return) might be lower than if they were healthy now. In the case of the Panthers, this put Matthew Tkachuk a bit lower than usual, while Aleksander Barkov (who is expected to miss the regular season, if not longer) did not make the cut in the top 100. Nevertheless, the defending champs put six players in the top 100, which was behind only the Dallas Stars ' seven for most players to make the list. As for individuals, Connor McDavid continued his reign as the top vote-getter, holding down the No. 1 spot again, as he did for 2024-25 and 2023-24 and 2022-22 and 2021-22 and ... you get the idea. Here's the 1-100 list for 2025-26, featuring write-ups courtesy of ESPN reporters Ryan S. Clark, Kristen Shilton, Greg Wyshynski and editorial staff. 2024-25 rank: 1 Age: 28 Simply put, McDavid is the best player on the planet, the best player of his generation, and could finish his career as one of the best to ever touch a puck. An eight-time 100-point scorer, McDavid has captained the Oilers to consecutive Stanley Cup Finals; this season, the objective is having Edmonton win its first title since 1990. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 4 Age: 26 Many types of players are needed to win in the NHL. Among them, a puck-moving defenseman who can also be trusted to play heavy minutes in every scenario. Makar is just that, as the two-time Norris Trophy winner (given to the NHL's best defenseman) is trusted to drive play in every scenario. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 3 Age: 30 The Avalanche? Team Canada? It doesn't matter. Any team that has MacKinnon is going to pose a serious threat to win on a nightly basis. His combination of control, power, speed and unpredictability has made him one of the best in the world. Like McDavid, he has a chance to win a gold medal and a Stanley Cup in the same season. Unlike McDavid, the Cup would be his second after the Avs' win in 2022. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 9 Age: 30 Since 2022-23, Draisaitl is second in goals scored (146) and goals per game (0.63). He is a dominating offensive star who long ago put to bed the notion that he was simply a product of his teammate, Connor McDavid. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 2 Age: 32 Kucherov led the NHL in points for a second consecutive season and for the third time since 2019. He can either score goals or create them for his teammates, which has been integral to the Lightning winning two titles during his time with the only club he has ever known. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 31 Age: 32 Only four goalies in the NHL's expansion era (since 1967) have won the Hart Trophy as league MVP; Hellebuyck joined the fraternity in 2025, taking his spot with Carey Price , Jose Theodore and Dominik Hasek . Can Hellebuyck join Hasek as the only goaltenders to pull off the feat two years in a row? -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 12 Age: 26 Suggesting that Hughes can do everything asked of a contemporary defenseman isn't an overstatement. The consistency he has shown in every scenario has made him one of the game's best players, and someone who could be instrumental in the United States' chase for a gold medal at the Olympics. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 6 Age: 28 There aren't many goal scorers who are as pure as Matthews, who possess the sort of shot every player covets. He has tallied 30-plus goals in every season of his career -- despite injuries -- and does it all for the Leafs as a standout 200-foot center. -- Shilton 2024-25 rank: 16 Age: 29 Talent has never been the question with Eichel. But last season, he unlocked aspects of his game that have made him one of the most complete centers in hockey. He'll help push his team to capture its second title since 2023, while also helping the U.S. in its push for Olympic gold. -- Clark All of ESPN. All in one place.

Sign Up Now 2024-25 rank: 8 Age: 29 Could his first full season in Dallas be the one that sees the Stars win the Stanley Cup that has eluded them over the past few years? Rantanen left Colorado in the NHL's biggest trade last season and then made his way back to the Central Division in a subsequent deal. But with a long-term pact in hand, he'll be a key player for the Stars for the foreseeable future. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 11 Age: 29 Pastrnak has scored over 40 goals in four consecutive seasons. Given his career total with the Bruins (391 entering this season), he could move all the way to third in franchise history if he notches another 40 goals in 2025-26. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 27 Age: 31 Some might have surmised that Vasilevskiy was heading into a decline based on 2023-24, when his save percentage dipped to .900 after seven straight seasons at .915 or higher. The 2024-25 campaign ended that talk, as he registered a .921 mark along with a 2.18 GAA and 38 wins. The ""Big Cat"" can still roar. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 30 Age: 29 The Panthers pulled off a unique feat last season, placing two players in the top two spots in Selke Trophy voting. Florida captain Aleksander Barkov -- who won the award -- is likely out until April (if not longer), meaning Reinhart and others will have to pick up the slack on both ends of the ice. The scoring part won't be a problem, as Reinhart has 127 goals in the past three seasons combined. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 26 Age: 29 A one-time Vezina Trophy winner (for now), Shesterkin is easily the best player drafted at No. 118 in NHL history. If the Rangers fail to make the postseason again, it won't be because of their superstar goaltender. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 17 Age: 28 All anyone needs to know about Kaprizov and his value could be seen last season. Before he got hurt, he was among the front-runners for the Hart Trophy, and the Wild looked as if they could win the Central. But an injury meant that Kaprizov played in just 41 regular-season games. The Wild struggled to score goals in his absence before his eventual return helped them capture a wild-card spot. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 25 Age: 26 Brady Tkachuk captained the Senators to their first Stanley Cup playoff berth since 2017. His goal scoring and physicality will be vital not only to Ottawa in the NHL, but also to Team USA in the 2026 Olympics. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 23 Age: 34 The 6-7 blueliner remains a dominant presence in both ends of the ice: 66 points in 79 games last season, while using physicality and his considerable wingspan to disrupt opponents in his own zone. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 14 Age: 28 Marner is the unique skater who dominates individually while also elevating literally any linemate he is paired with. A force on special teams -- his penalty killing is particularly good -- Marner is more likely to try setting up a goal than attempting to score one himself. And the Golden Knights are counting on his playmaking to carry them for years to come -- Shilton 2024-25 rank: 35 Age: 26 Part of the Stars' legendary 2017 draft class (with Miro Heiskanen and Jake Oettinger ), Robertson has 269 points in 246 games the past three regular seasons. His line with Roope Hintz and Mikko Rantanen will be one of the NHL's most dangerous this season. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 58 Age: 28 The Michigan native removed any sense of uncertainty for next summer by signing a team-record $96 million contract extension on the eve of the season -- then opened the campaign with a hat trick against the Stars. He'll also be a key player for the U.S. in the Olympic Games. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 13 Age: 38 Father Time? Crosby has never heard of him, apparently. The Penguins captain is playing as well now as he has throughout a legendary career that kept Pittsburgh as a contender for nearly two decades. And Crosby shows no signs of wanting to slow down. -- Shilton 2024-25 rank: 55 Age: 38 Season No. 20 will be the last one in the NHL for Kopitar, by far the best hockey player ever from Slovenia -- he has outscored second-place Jan Mursak 1,281-4 heading into this season. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 63 Age: 26 The Devils captain built another strong case for a Selke Trophy in 2024-25 and finished fourth in the voting, garnering 11 first-place votes. Another standout season could see him land in the finalists' circle. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 49 Age: 29 The heart and soul of the Red Wings, Larkin turned heads with his excellent two-way play during the 4 Nations Face-Off. Can he lead the Red Wings back to the postseason? -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 22 Age: 26 There are sitcoms that have episodes with lesser run time than Heiskanen averages in a game. He's frequently in the discussion for the league's best shutdown defenseman, and he'd receive even more acclaim if he had offensive numbers similar to some of his peers. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 32 Age: 29 With Mitch Marner now plying his trade for the Golden Knights, the Leafs will need continued production out of the elite scorers who remain -- and Nylander is certainly one of them, with 125 goals in the past three seasons combined. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 34 Age: 31 Forsberg was not immune to whatever plagued the Predators in 2024-25, as his 76 points was a steep decline from 94 the season prior. Will 2025-26 be a rebound for him personally and for his team? -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 19 Age: 28 The top center on the Hurricanes, Aho is a point-per-game offensive player whose defensive play fits the Carolina tradition of two-way play. -- Wyshynski Breaking News from Emily Kaplan Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

That's what the Canucks star is trying to prove in 2025-26 after injuries and locker room drama contributed to the worst offensive season of his career. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 18 Age: 31 Jake Guentzel has earned the chance to skate with the greatest. He was Sidney Crosby's linemate for eight seasons in Pittsburgh. Last season, his first with the Lightning, he scored a career-high 41 goals on a line with Nikita Kucherov. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 33 Age: 26 The man they call ""Otter"" has been everything the Stars wanted after they selected him 26th in the 2017 draft, including 151 wins in 253 career games and a 2.54 GAA. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 15 Age: 24 When Jack Hughes is in the lineup, he's one of the most gifted playmakers in the NHL, averaging 1.13 points per game last season.

Watt and is looking to breach the 40-goal benchmark after notching 37 last season. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 50 Age: 27 The Chesterfield, Missouri, native is one of the NHL's underappreciated scorers, with 90 points in 81 games last season.

0f1cb2079e5a,Fantasy Football,,"What's your favorite ghost story? The one that made your eyes go wide and the tiny hairs on the back of your neck stand straight up? A tale so compelling that, while you might not recall all of the details, you'll never forget how its telling captivated your whole self. A yarn spun so fantastically that disbelief wasn't just suspended, it was gleefully tossed aside. That could be any story, I suppose. But there's something uniquely fascinating about lore. Maybe because it's a tale warped in historical legitimacy. They don't deliver big feels without being founded on solid facts. The more specific the picture painted, the more easily we are swept into the mythology. A bit of a reveal ... my most beloved sightseeing activity is to sign up for a guided ghost tour anytime I'm visiting a new city. Posting up at a dive bar full of locals is close second. But what if that pub is haunted? Talk about strong spirits! I'm here for the education and the entertainment. What better way to soak up an unfamiliar locale than via the people and places of its past? And that is why, despite having lived in Los Angeles for more than 15 years, I finally participated in a haunted pub crawl through Hollywood this past weekend. Instead of making a reso at some new Italian spot or group bingeing the latest Jason Bateman vehicle, my friends and I decided to traipse down the Walk of Fame while an aspiring actor named Bennie shared stories of our town's heyday and the souls that are rumored to linger. What better way to celebrate Spooky Season?! Whether it was learning about Fritz, the phantom stagehand who allegedly still rustles the curtains at Grauman's Chinese Theater or Rudy Valentino, whose lothario spirit has been sighted throughout the city, each account delighted us. Sure, the suds we sipped along the way increased our buy-in, but we were willing participants. There is, after all, no better context for the present than to discover the past. I don't know if I believe in ghosts. But I will admit to being intrigued at the idea of eschewing permanence. Not because there's anything appealing about languishing in a liminal space. But because there exists a distinct desire to become unstuck. I mean we've all been plagued by something at some point. Probably not a translucent barkeep or headless horseman, but definitely by a thought, or an idea, or a pattern. Once we're able to stop the repetition, though, then we're free. We can move on. We do this in fantasy on a regular basis. Which Cardinals RB do I start this week? How do I bench Cam Skattebo versus Denver when he's been on such a tear? Is Ladd McConkey back? Can Dallas Goedert keep this up? When will the wheels fall off Baker Mayfield 's wagon? The back-and-forth can be downright haunting. Eventually, though, we make a choice and we live with it. Hopefully, we learn from it, too. So that, unlike the apparitions stranded under creaky floors and behind attic doors, we can continue on our journey and experience the next undertaking. Even (and especially) if it gives us the chills. Facts vs. Feelings for players in Week 7 (and the beyond) Dak Prescott is fantasy's QB6 through Week 6 and is poised to climb the leaderboard with a matchup against the Commanders in Week 7. Grant Halverson/Getty Images Dak Prescott , QB, Dallas Cowboys : Prescott has been playing like a man possessed, ranking second at the position in passing yards (269 per game) and passing scores (13). Prescott, 32, has logged at least 22 fantasy points in four of his past five games while averaging 27 fantasy points over the past three weeks. Given that the Cowboys' defense is allowing more than 30 points per game, there's no reason to believe Prescott won't keep chucking the ball. And with CeeDee Lamb likely to return, Prescott's conversion rate (71.6 CMP%, QB4) figures to stay sterling. Also working in Prescott's favor is the matchup versus Washington. Admittedly, the Commanders' D-line has been able to generate pressure as of late, registering the sixth-most sacks (18) on the season. That said, its secondary has been susceptible to big plays, giving up the second-most receptions of 40 or more yards with six (behind only the Cowboys' seven) while also allowing the sixth-most fantasy points to quarterbacks. In a game with a spread of just 2.5 points and an over/under of 55.5 points , the fantasy fireworks figure to be popping Sunday. Consider Prescott a top-5 fantasy play at the position. Travis Etienne Jr ., RB, Jacksonville Jaguars : The electric rusher who started the season seems to have vanished over the last pair of outings. Etienne's production and efficiency have plummeted since Week 4, as he has failed to reach double-digit fantasy totals in back-to-back efforts. In fact, he has managed zero rushes of 10 or more yards over the past two weeks. While those results could be explained away via game script and schedule, they don't figure to change in Week 7. The Jags are 2.5-point underdogs versus the Rams in London. Acknowledging that international games always add an element of surprise, there's no denying the strength of L.A.'s run defense. Per Next Gen Stats, the Rams' 37 percent run stop win rate is the best in the NFL. Furthermore, Chris Shula's unit has not only allowed the fifth-fewest yards per carry (3.7) to RBs, but the defense has yet to give up a single run of 20 or more yards. In fact, not one back has managed a run of 15 more yards this season. Derrick Henry was able to accumulate 122 rushing yards versus Los Angeles in Week 6 but was impressively held out of the end zone, making the Rams the only team yet to allow a rushing score to the position. For context, Christian McCaffrey has been the only running back to post 15 fantasy points when facing the Rams, and he did that mostly through his work as a pass catcher (only 2.6 YPC, but 8-82-1 through the air in Week 5). Etienne does offer appeal as receiver (he has drawn at least four looks in consecutive outings), which helps to buoy his stock. Yet, given his recent struggles and the matchup, the Jags' RB1 projects as a low-end RB2 for fantasy purposes in London. play 1:21 Why Rico Dowdle was a big fantasy winner in Week 6 Field Yates breaks down Rico Dowdle's upward trend in fantasy that he thinks will continue into Week 7 when the Panthers face the Jets. Chuba Hubbard , RB, Carolina Panthers : Hubbard's absence has created space for the resurrection of Rico Dowdle . After rumbling his way to an otherworldly 473 scrimmage yards over his past two starts, the former Cowboy seems to have seized the Panthers' RB1 gig. As the saying goes, there's no putting the genie back in the bottle. That, however, has left Hubbard investors in a precarious position. On the bright side, noting the fact that Dowdle averaged 30 touches per contest, a 50-50 split would still result in 15 touches for Hubbard. (And that theory is about as likely to materialize as Marilyn's ghost in a haunted mirror at the Roosevelt Hotel.) While the softness of Carolina's schedule certainty contributed to Dowdle's massive numbers, it's not as though this week's matchup presents an imposing obstacle. The Jets' run defense has been a major liability, allowing the ninth-most rushing yards on the season and an average of over 115 total yards to RBs per week. Still, it seems unlikely that a more difficult matchup would inspire Dave Canales to prioritize the lesser of his two backs. That point hits home all the harder when noting that Hubbard recorded zero goal-to-goal rushes and zero rushes inside the 5-yard line prior to injuring his calf. Conversely, Dowdle registered five goal-to-goal opportunities and three attempts inside the 5. This game projects to be all kinds of messy, but the backfield split should be clean with Dowdle offering virtual investors RB2 appeal and Hubbard existing as a last-ditch flex. Drake London , WR, Atlanta Falcons : London's production has taken on a mystical quality since he was visited by the Commanders in Week 4. The 24-year-old (yes, he's younger than his QB, despite having been in the league for two more seasons) has posted triple-digit yardage totals and found the end zone in two straight efforts (separated by a bye). Posting 25 fantasy points in Week 4 (WR5) and 31.8 fantasy points in Week 6 (WR1), London has been dominant as Michael Penix Jr .'s most relied upon pass-catcher (10.6 looks per contest, WR3). With Darnell Mooney (hamstring) and Ray-Ray McCloud III (coach's decision) out of the lineup, London drew a monster target share of 52% last Sunday. Even without the noted absences, his 33% target share for the season ranks third among WRs (behind only Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Garrett Wilson ). Additionally, London's 43% end zone target share is tied for the seventh most in the NFL. Simply put, he's getting the looks and doing the most with his opportunities. That's a trend that should continue at San Francisco in Week 7. The 49ers' defense is down badly, having lost its two most revered stars (DE Nick Bosa and LB Fred Warner ). While that's excellent news for Bijan Robinson supporters, a projected point total of 44.5 suggests plenty of aerial action for the Falcons receivers. In fact, the 49ers gave up 256 receiving yards and two receiving scores to an embattled Bucs squad last Sunday. That bodes well for London, who figures to flirt with six grabs and 80 yards this weekend. Rashee Rice , WR, Kansas City Chiefs : The time is nigh! Rice is set to make his 2025 debut Sunday versus the Raiders. There exists an understandable amount of speculation regarding his potential volume. Still, managers didn't select the SMU standout before the double-digit rounds of fantasy drafts to let him languish, particularly in a week with two teams on bye and a slew of star players set to miss time. Remember, Rice, 25, isn't working his way back from an injury. He's been healthy, serving a suspension. That means he should have the ability to pick up where he left off. Rice last suited up in September 2024, drawing 29 targets over three games while averaging 96 yards per contest. He may not match those numbers this Sunday, but there are plenty of places from which to draw opportunities. JuJu Smith-Schuster (who has yet to clear 60 yards in a game) figures to move down the depth chart. Tyquan Thornton will likely also see his role reduced, drawing one or two deep looks per outing. Finally, Andy Reid has remained candid regarding his desire to preserve Travis Kelce for the postseason. In fact, Kelce averaged just four targets per game when sharing the field with Rice last year. All of that being said, with the Chiefs being 10.5-point favorites , Rice's opportunities may not be robust. Still, he figures to be involved. Plus, facing a generous Raiders secondary that has allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to WRs, Rice won't need a boatload of targets to put up points. He figures to act as a balm to struggling squads, presenting with top 15 to 20 position fantasy appeal in Week 7. Matthew Golden , WR, Green Bay Packers : Perhaps this is more of a premonition than a prognostication, but the Golden moment feels fast approaching. The Texas standout has exceeded 50 receiving yards in three straight efforts, after managing just 16 receiving yards over his first two outings combined. Interestingly, he's also logged at least one rushing attempt in each of his past four games, registering a total of eight since Week 2 (tied for the most by any WR or TE in the NFL during that span). That indicates a desire to get the versatile rookie acutely involved in the offense. While Golden figures to play second fiddle to Romeo Doubs , his matchup sets him up for flex-worthy success in Week 7. The Cardinals have been uber generous to the slot, allowing the most grabs and receiving yards to players manning the inside. Interestingly, Golden leads the Packers in fantasy points from the slot this season. The arrow is pointing up. play 0:39 Why Harold Fannin Jr. shouldn't be overlooked in fantasy Liz Loza breaks down Harold Fannin Jr.'s upward trend in fantasy ahead of the Browns matchup against the Dolphins in Week 7. Harold Fannin Jr ., TE, Cleveland Browns : Fannin is the future, and the future appears to be now. With Dillon Gabriel at the helm, Fannin has posted double-digit fantasy points in two straight efforts. In fact, Fannin leads the Browns in grabs and receiving yards (and is tied for the team lead in red zone looks). Admittedly, David Njoku 's early exit afforded the rookie more opportunities in Week 6. Still, the former Bowling Green player rose to the occasion, converting seven of a season-high 10 balls for a team-high 81 receiving yards. Fannin figures to be involved again this Sunday, especially given that Cleveland leads the NFL in tight end targets, catches and yards. Additionally, more than half of Fannin's snaps (74%) have come while lined up as either a WR or an RB, a point made by Kimberley A. Martin during last week's edition of ""Fantasy Football Now."" He's all over the field and demonstrating excellent rapport with the team's current stopgap under center. Bettering Fannin's odds of converting is a plus matchup versus Miami. The Dolphins are allowing the sixth-most fantasy points to tight ends, having gifted the Chargers' Oronde Gadsden II (also a rookie) with a 7-68-0 stat line in Week 6. If Njoku is absent (or even limited), Fannin could post top-eight fantasy numbers at the position. He offers low-end TE1 appeal regardless of Njoku's status.

9c4aa6292029,"Week 7 fantasy football matchup rankings: Quinshon Judkins favorable, Jalen Hurts less so",,"Oct 15, 2025, 07:00 AM ET Making tough lineup decisions each week can be the most challenging part of the fantasy football process. When you're torn between two similar players and simply don't know which to start, start the player with the superior matchup. Ah, but exactly how does one determine the best (and worst) weekly matchups? The matchup rankings provide a schedule-independent method to evaluate positional matchups each week, ranking all 32 opposing defenses in order of most to least favorable for opposing players at all four skill positions (quarterback, running back, wide receiver and tight end). Instead of relying upon seasonal totals, we calibrate points-allowed data to show how each defense fared relative to the difficulty of the schedule it has faced. This provides a fairer approach to judging the quality of individual matchups. ""Adj. FPA,"" or adjusted fantasy points allowed, reflects how far above or below players' weekly PPR fantasy point averages that defense held opponents at that position. A positive number means that the matchup is favorable; a negative number means it is unfavorable. Additionally, remember teams often use multiple running backs and wide receivers in a game, and these plus/minus averages cover all of a team's personnel at that position. Finally, a caveat: Matchups are only one ingredient in my rankings formula. Not every favorable matchup should be exploited, nor unfavorable matchup avoided. If you want my -- and the ESPN fantasy staff's -- most complete source for whom to start and sit each week, consult our weekly rankings . Quarterbacks Matchups highlight: Justin Herbert , Los Angeles Chargers (vs. Indianapolis Colts ). He's a more prominent part of the Chargers' offense this season than last, attempting a pass on 57% of his snaps played (up from 51%), and the injury to Omarion Hampton (ankle) should continue to buoy that rate. Herbert will be plenty involved in a game projected to be among the week's highest-scoring (48.5 over/under), against a Colts defense that has struggled to contain upper-tier quarterbacks. Bo Nix (20.24 fantasy points in Week 2), Matthew Stafford (27.40, Week 4) and Jacoby Brissett (20.70, Week 6) all scored in excess of 20 points against this defense. Others to like: Caleb Williams , Chicago Bears (vs. New Orleans Saints ); Aaron Rodgers , Pittsburgh Steelers (at Cincinnati Bengals , Thursday); Baker Mayfield , Tampa Bay Buccaneers (at Detroit Lions ). Matchup to avoid: Jalen Hurts , Philadelphia Eagles (at Minnesota Vikings ). As the No. 4 QB in fantasy scoring for the season and one of the league's best running QBs, he's a tough player to bench regardless of matchup. However, the bye-week-rested Vikings represent one of his most challenging opponents this season, meaning you should temper your expectations. The Vikings have afforded quarterbacks the seventh-fewest yards per passing attempt (0.37), and since Hurts generates a decent chunk of his fantasy production via the tush push (19% of his points since the beginning of 2023 have come on runs from the 1-yard line), be forewarned that the Vikings have afforded touchdowns on only 31% of rushing attempts within three yards of the goal line, the third-best rate in the league.

Sign Up Now Matchups highlight: Quinshon Judkins , Cleveland Browns (vs. Miami Dolphins ). Judkins has been surprisingly productive for a player whose team has run 77% of its plays on offense while trailing on the scoreboard (the league's fourth-highest rate), and one who missed training camp and Week 1 of the regular season. He has 101 rushing yards more than expected (fifth at the position), per Next Gen Stats, 344 yards after contact (sixth) and eight explosive runs (22nd), and ranks 20th in fantasy points per game (13.1). Now, for the first time all season, Judkins' Browns play as the favorites (giving 2.5 points), meaning a potentially expansive opportunity for him against a defense that has surrendered a 20-point performance to an individual running back in four of the past five weeks. Others to like: Jaylen Warren , Steelers (at Bengals, Thursday); Jacory Croskey-Merritt , Washington Commanders (at Dallas Cowboys ); Rhamondre Stevenson , New England Patriots (at Tennessee Titans ).

He and his teammates are returning from London, where they had an utterly miserable offensive effort in which he scored 5.9 fantasy points on 22 touches and the Jets as a team totaled nine points and 82 yards on offense against the Denver Broncos . While the Panthers lack the Broncos' reputation as defensive stalwarts, they've played much better defense than they're given credit for. The Panthers' defense ranks 13 spots higher against running backs (fifth) than the Broncos' (18th). The Panthers also limited the No. 4 ( De'Von Achane ) and No. 5 ( Javonte Williams ) RBs to a combined 25.0 points in hard-fought victories the past two weeks. DEF to avoid Opp. Rk Adj.

It's not often that you see a defense with an Adjusted FPA number as deep into double-digits as the Cowboys have against wide receivers (17.8), but here we are. In six games, the Cowboys have seen seven different wideouts score 15-plus fantasy points against them, and a league-leading three of those scored 25-plus ( Malik Nabers and Wan'Dale Robinson in Week 2, Romeo Doubs in Week 4). Additionally, in three of their six games, the Cowboys surrendered a double-digit fantasy score to two different wide receivers, which will be important in Samuel's example in the event Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) is able to return. Others to like: Ladd McConkey , Chargers (vs. Colts); Mike Evans , Buccaneers (at Lions); Brian Thomas Jr ., Jacksonville Jaguars (vs. Los Angeles Rams ). Matchup to avoid: Tetairoa McMillan , Carolina Panthers (at New York Jets). Bryce Young's early-season struggles have held McMillan back from a breakthrough thus far, and while the rookie's usage metrics show promise -- he has a 25% target share and seven red zone targets -- he's not yet at a point where he can be termed matchups-proof. This is one of his tougher ones on the 2025 schedule, as the Jets have seen a relatively low number of pass attempts (28.3 per game, sixth fewest) and have allowed only two opposing wide receivers to score at least 15 fantasy points against them ( Calvin Austin III in Week 1, Ryan Flournoy in Week 5).

Tight end has been a difficult position to fill, as only four of the preseason's top-10 positional picks on average find themselves top 10 in scoring, while 13 of the 35 instances of a 15-point performance by a tight end thus far came from players available in more than half of ESPN leagues. In short, matchups have been the way to go at the position, and Taylor has one of this week's best. The Panthers have afforded tight ends a league-most 2.45 fantasy points per target, and they're the only team to have seen an individual tight end score at least 7.9 points against them in all six weeks. Matchup to avoid: T.J. Hockenson , Vikings (vs. Eagles). The Eagles, conversely, have held tight ends to the fewest fantasy points per target (1.15). It's not the first time they've shown excellence defending the position, either, as they finished 2024 fourth best in that department (1.49) and third best in Adjusted Fantasy Points Added (minus-2.6).

70070e17afeb,Behind the scenes of the 'Abbott Elementary' Phillies episode,,"Nick Trotta's 10-year-old son had a request. He told his dad that he was the biggest fan of the ABC sitcom ""Abbott Elementary"" and hoped to see baseball integrated into the show. Trotta, who is Major League Baseball's VP of global media and licensing, spoke with Carolyn Lehman, the league's head of development for original content, about whether any efforts had been made for MLB to partner with the show. Trotta's department then reached out to ABC to express its interest and learned that Quinta Brunson, the show's creator, cowriter, executive producer and lead actress who stars in the sitcom as Janine Teagues, had wanted to work with MLB for some time. ""[Quinta's] one of the best in the business, so just knowing that's where her creative instincts were at, nothing could make us happier,"" Trotta told ESPN. ""Same thing goes for the Phillies, they obviously have awareness of her love for their city. ... To be able to give back, but really collaborate together, [it was] once in a lifetime."" On Wednesday, the Golden Globe-winning television show on ABC airs an episode that was filmed at the Philadelphia Phillies ' Aug. 28 showdown against the Atlanta Braves . The episode isn't the first time a professional Philadelphia sports franchise has been featured in ""Abbott Elementary,"" a comedy about teachers and a Philadelphia public school principal who are determined to help their students succeed. In previous seasons, three Eagles stars ( Jalen Hurts , Jason Kelce and Brandon Graham), former Philadelphia 76ers forward Andre Iguodala and Flyers mascot Gritty made cameos. Trotta said that when MLB began to collaborate with the ""Abbott Elementary"" production crew for the episode, they coordinated the Phillies' regular-season schedule with the television show's production schedule to determine a designated shooting day. Once the two parties scheduled the filming date -- Aug. 28 -- Trotta said that the Phillies organization reacted positively. The team previously had contributed to the documentary ""The Turnaround,"" which required the Phillies to shoot content for game day-related events. ""[The Phillies] are entertainment savvy and very accommodating as a staff [and] we had challenged what the limits of shooting during games could be on some other projects recently,"" Trotta said. ""There was a level of trust there and know-how on the Philly side."" Chris Perfetti, who plays Jacob Hill in the series, says he was pumped when he received the news that ""Abbott Elementary"" would shoot an episode at a Phillies game. ""I love when we start the season off with a bang, which I feel like this really is,"" he told ESPN. ""We're taking big swings, no pun intended, and I think it's really just a testament to how well the show is working."" ""Abbott Elementary"" is filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Perfetti explained that sets are normally so quiet during taping that you can hear a pin drop, but shooting at Citizens Bank Park was the total opposite for the cast. With the episode being filmed at the live event, the cast and crew had just one chance to execute the perfect scene -- there would be no do-overs. Even though there were 41,293 fans at the game, Perfetti said the cast was so enthusiastic for the challenge that it made it easier to focus. ""It just felt like we had so much support, and we were all kind of buoyed by this idea that we were going to try and do something really difficult,"" Perfetti said. In the episode, Principal Ava -- played by Janelle James -- takes the staff on a field trip to the Phillies game in hopes of being featured on the kiss cam. When the ""Abbott Elementary"" cast was featured on the jumbotron in real life, Citizens Bank Park erupted into cheers and applause. For James, shooting the episode made her realize in the moment she was truly acting. ""It's something that I've never done before, and it's something I know that a lot of shows haven't done, and I always frequently say that there's always like one or two episodes each season that make me outside of the character as Janelle, where I kind of realize like, 'Oh I'm on a sitcom,' and it was a very, like, sick 'Oh, I'm on a TV show' moment,"" James told ESPN. Phillies left fielder Kyle Schwarber launched his first homer of the day in the bottom of the first inning. He hit another one in the bottom of the fourth inning. After the second home run, Trotta joked that Schwarber would hit a third home run. His words turned into reality. After Schwarber's third homer in the bottom of the fifth, conversations between Trotta, the ""Abbott Elementary"" writers and Brunson began to take place. They changed the episode's script on the fly to incorporate Schwarber's impressive performance. Schwarber's historic four-homer game -- making him the 21st slugger to achieve the feat in MLB history -- and nine RBIs helped propel the Phillies to a dominant 19-4 win over the Braves. ""I remember looking at Quinta like 'Is this really happening?'"" Perfetti said. ""Kyle Schwarber was part of the episode from the jump, but you know, he ends up being kind of not the star of just the episode but certainly the star of that team."" Ahead of the game, Schwarber had received his lines and participated in a rehearsal. Trotta told ESPN that it took the slugger about an hour after the Phillies' win to wrap up his media availability and get ready for his TV star turn. He was a natural. ""Kyle did great in his acting part,"" James said. ""And so everything just came together, and it seems like every time we do feature some type of athlete that they do really well."" The ""Abbott Elementary"" cast says the Phillies episode was a win for both sides. ""It felt like 'Abbott' brought a little luck to the Phillies, and the Phillies brought a little luck to the 'Abbott' shoot. It was rad,"" Perfetti said. ""It will definitely go down in history for 'Abbott,' for all parties.""",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46597864/philadelphia-phillies-kyle-schwarber-atlanta-braves-abbott-elementary-season-five,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1560106_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,87b2ed4d1688eb3ac6da0968ccf46c2ba7be7eae
172bae977c20,"USMNT World Cup roster implications: Wright, Roldan make cases",,"Jeff Carlisle Close Jeff Carlisle U.S. soccer correspondent Jeff Carlisle covers MLS and the U.S. national team for ESPN FC. Joey Lynch Close Joey Lynch Australia Correspondent Joey Lynch is a Melbourne-based sports journalist and AYA cancer advocate. Primarily working on football, he has covered the Socceroos, Matildas and A-Leagues for ESPN for over a decade. Oct 14, 2025, 11:59 PM ET COMMERCE CITY, Colorado -- Haji Wright scored goals either side of halftime to help the United States defeat Australia 2-1 in a friendly Tuesday night. The Coventry City striker's brace helped the hosts overcome Jordan Bos ' 19th minute opener, with both goals assisted by midfielder Cristian Roldan . The win for the U.S. extended its unbeaten streak to three games, while Australia saw its 11-game run under manager Tony Popovic come to an end. It was also the first time in nine games that U.S. won under Mauricio Pochettino after conceding first. Jeff Carlisle and Joey Lynch take a look at the major talking points from the match. - As it happened: Wright inspires USMNT past Socceroos - Pulisic subbed off early in USMNT friendly with Australia - 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it 1. Wright shows striker competition is still open After Folarin Balogun scored in each of his past two U.S. games, it was beginning to look like he had gained some separation in the race to secure the starting striker spot. It was perhaps a bit puzzling then when Pochettino decided to hand Wright a start in Balogun's place. After all, Wright hadn't started for the U.S. since September 2024 against New Zealand . The move proved to be a master stroke, as Wright scored twice, though it wasn't obvious at the start. In the opening minutes Wright looked a bit lost, and seemed oddly reluctant to exploit the space in behind that the Australia back line was giving him. But Wright stuck to his task, latching onto a through ball from Roldan in the 33rd minute to score with his right foot past Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan . Then, six minutes into the second half, he ran through on another Roldan pass, left defender Cameron Burgess in a heap on the ground, and curled his effort past Ryan into the Australia goal. If the World Cup were to start tomorrow, Balogun would likely get the start for the U.S., but Wright's goals have kept him in the running, and have boosted his chances of earning a spot on the U.S. World Cup roster. -- Carlisle Haji Wright and Cristian Roldan have made compelling cases to be part of the USMNT World Cup roster. John Dorton/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images 2. Socceroos' unbeaten streak finally snapped It was going to have to come to an end at some point. For the first time in the Popovic era, the Socceroos have lost a match, ending an 11-game run that began with his first game in charge last September and that had produced wins across the side's past seven games. There are all the necessary qualifications about this being a friendly staged with a bigger, World Cup-shaped goal in mind -- even if Popovic and his staff rejected this narrative in the build-up to the game -- but particularly disappointing for the Socceroos will be that Tuesday evening's defeat came despite Bos putting them ahead after 19 minutes. Defending has long been the great strength of this team, even before Popovic's arrival, but as one would expect from the former defender, this has only been reinforced in recent times. And it's hardly panic stations for the Australians yet. Nonetheless, two lapses in concentration were all it took for Wright to get in behind and, as the Championship 's leading scorer showed, players that are in-form and playing at the highest level will punish you if you give them the scope to. As the Socceroos shifted into chasing the match -- a game state largely unseen since their late draw against Bahrain last November -- the U.S. team was able to capitalize and create a series of looks on goal that, with slightly sharper finishing, could have easily blown the lead out further. -- Lynch All of ESPN.

Roldan bounces back from slow start It's stunning to think that two months ago, Roldan didn't seem anywhere near a World Cup roster spot. He was even an afterthought for the September window, only to earn a late call-up and then put in an outstanding shift in the 2-0 win over Japan . On Tuesday, Roldan once again helped his cause with another big-time performance, one made all the more impressive given how it started. The U.S. had plenty of possession to start, but then out of nothing, in the 19th minute, Bos broke through the U.S. defense with Chris Richards and Roldan both needing to do better to thwart the left back's slaloming run. But Roldan rebounded impressively. He quickly put his stamp on the U.S. attack, and twice came close to scoring on shots that just missed the target. Following his assist on Wright's first goal, Roldan engaged in some quick-thinking to set up Wright's second. After Alex Freeman won a free kick on the right wing, Roldan had the presence of mind to take it quickly and immediately put Wright in a one-on-one situation that he duly converted. Like Wright, Roldan did plenty to increase his chances of making a second consecutive World Cup roster. The Seattle Sounders midfielder has a lot of bodies to climb over in order to reach that goal, some of whom have an impressive pedigree. But Roldan seems to be a favorite of Pochettino's for his contributions both on and off the field, and if he continues to perform at this level, it will be nearly impossible to leave him off the World Cup roster. -- Carlisle 4. Pulisic injury casts a pall on October window After a successful September window, one of the hopes for Christian Pulisic in October was to see him perform alongside more of the USMNT's first-choice lineup. It wasn't to be. An ankle injury saw Pulisic limited to just 17 minutes in the 1-1 draw against Ecuador . It's unclear if Pulisic injured the same ankle against Australia, but what is known is that he was on the receiving end of several heavy challenges. After Australia's Jason Geria was booked in the 26th minute for a transition tackle on Pulisic, the U.S. attacker was forced off two minutes later. The decision by Pochettino to take Pulisic off made sense. There was no reason to risk his star's health further, especially given the fine form that the U.S. attacker has been in for AC Milan . Yet the injury is still a blow for the USMNT, at least in the context of this window. The World Cup countdown clock is ticking, and the more Pochettino can get his top players on the field at the same time, the better. Now that will have to wait until next month, assuming Pulisic heals up in time. -- Carlisle Christian Pulisic was forced to come off with an injury in the first half. John Dorton/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images 5. Australia's loss could come at a big cost Thanks to their win over Canada , combined with Austria 's shock 1-0 loss to Romania in European qualifying , the Socceroos had entered Tuesday evening ranked 24 in the FIFA rankings. It's a position that would have vaulted the Socceroos into Pot 2, and potentially a weaker World Cup group, should the draw have taken place that day. Tuesday's 2-1 loss, however, has put a dent in these hopes. While a loss on the road against a 16th-ranked United States won't necessarily cost them a significant amount of ranking points -- nowhere near close to the 14.88 that Austria was docked for their loss to the Romanians -- Australia will nonetheless slip backwards. Will this defeat ultimately prove costly? We can't know for certain, but with a clash with defending World Cup champions and world No. 2 Argentina , in India, of all places, heavily rumored to be one of the Socceroos' opponents in the November window (and 21st-ranked Iran another rumored opponent in that window), the Australians may have a mountain to climb before December's draw. -- Lynch 6. Bos shows why he is considered one of Australia's best As disappointing as the loss will be, the night wasn't a total waste for Australia, with Bos putting in another performance that, despite some stiff competition from the likes of Nestory Irankunda and Mo Touré , separates him as the most exciting talent coming through in green and gold. Coming into the window fresh off being named the Eredivisie player of the month, the first Australian to scoop the honor, the 22-year-old instantly changed the dynamic of the game when he came on as a second-half substitute against Canada and was among Australia's best when he started against the U.S. on Tuesday evening. Blessed with rare athleticism, the left wing back's ability to tirelessly get up and down the touchline adds a critical ability to break lines and advance field position in Popovic's system, and his goal -- pouncing on a loose ball, forcing his way through three American defenders, bundling over Roldan and finishing into the bottom corner -- was emblematic of the combination of skill and physical power he brings to the game. Bos set a then-Australian transfer record when he transferred from Melbourne City to KVC Westerlo in 2023 and the subsequent reported €5 million move he made to Feyenoord this season already looks like a good deal for the Dutch giants. Give it a year or two, and it's hard to see how the onetime Point Cook junior isn't playing, and starting, in one of the world's biggest leagues. -- Lynch",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46599498/usmnt-world-cup-roster-implications-wright-roldan-make-cases,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560393_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,0e45eea2b5e6d47b2be007e78f17167b8d8f0921
47aca5a7f424,Why Spain's player production line is the envy of the world,,"Georgia coach Willy Sagnol spoke for the managers of Turkey , Bulgaria , France , Germany , England and many others when he sighed with melancholy resignation and proclaimed: "" Spain don't just play on another world, they play from a different universe."" The Frenchman, who won the UEFA Champions League with Bayern Munich and was a FIFA World Cup runner-up in 2006, had just seen Spain's ""C"" team threaten to put eight or nine goals past Georgia. Then, days later, La Roja smashed Bulgaria for another four to equal their all-time unbeaten run (29) in competitive matches. ""All-time"" means that this squad has just matched the best undefeated run set by the Spain of Iker Casillas, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets , Xabi Alonso, Carles Puyol, Jordi Alba , Sergio Ramos , David Villa and Fernando Torres. Had you realized that we are in a new golden (perhaps goldenest ) age? - 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it - Tiny New Caledonia is amazingly two wins from the World Cup - Premier League big issues: Will Amorim, Ange last? Is Salah fading? And what's remarkable about Luis de la Fuente's current version of Spain is that they keep getting stripped of their elite talents ... but win and thrill anyway. For example, in their last two World Cup qualifying matches Spain could have formed an XI from the following absent players: Goalkeepers: Joan García , David de Gea Defenders: Dani Carvajal , Dean Huijsen , Pau Torres , Nacho , Alejandro Balde , Iñigo Martínez Midfielders: Rodri , Fabián Ruiz , Marc Casadó , Gavi , Fermín López , Dani Olmo , Isco Forwards: Lamine Yamal , Álvaro Morata , Ayoze Pérez , Joselu , Nico Williams That, folks, is a team (prune it down to your favorite XI) which could beat any rival and win any tournament. But they were all, for one reason or another, absent from Spain's last two victories. Throw in Ferran Torres , absent from the squad to face Bulgaria because he had a muscle strain, and that's 20 top-class footballers. Be honest. How many other nations could lose that many leading footballers, some of whom are the best in the world in their position, and still thrive? Who could still romp past teams who want to defend for their lives and frustrate an understrength ""big team""? I think that the answer is: absolutely nobody. No other international team could come up with so many solutions against a backdrop of talent-drain and still look -- at times -- unbeatable. On Saturday, down on Spain's south-eastern coast, if it hadn't been for Liverpool goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili putting on yet another masterclass against the European champions, the scoreline would have been 8-0 or 9-0. How many other nations could lose that many leading footballers, some of whom are the best in the world in their position, and still thrive? Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images That sparked this reply when I asked Sagnol -- as an ex world-class defender and long-time coach -- precisely why it is, in his view, that Spain are not only superior but appear to have limitless depth? ""Do you remember in the 1980s and 1990s -- Spain were good, they played well but they didn't win things?"" he said. ""What you see now is a product of 20-25 years good planning and practice by the Spanish FA. Take [Barcelona midfielder] Pedri as an example. He's what: about five kilograms? He looks as if he'd blow away if a strong wind got up. ""But he's one of the two or three best players in the world, best in his position, because he's so intelligent. Everything he does is for the team, driving them forward, offering for the ball, finding space, creating space. ""Spain produces so many players with football intelligence -- that's the special thing. Look at it today; they had six or seven top players missing and you wouldn't have noticed. They play exactly the same way and at the same level. And they keep producing these wonderful, football-intelligent players."" All of ESPN. All in one place.

Sign Up Now Spain's record in the past four years reads: UEFA European Championship semifinal (2021), Olympic silver medal (2021), UEFA Nations League runner-up (2021), World Cup round of 16 (2022), Nations League winners (2023), European Championship winners (2024), Olympic gold medal (2024), Nations League finalists (2025). If this was a racehorse who'd placed third, second, second, ninth, first, first, first, and second, the stud-value would be off the charts and punters would be betting in their millions that this beautiful beast would be a cert to win the big one next summer. To emphasize Sagnol's point, De la Fuente has used at least 63 players during that run. Many of those are footballers who other judges -- within the game, from the media and among fans -- thought couldn't cut it at the highest level but are now established international mainstays. I managed to speak to Leeds United 's organizing midfielder Ilia Gruev after Spain's 4-0 win over Bulgaria on Tuesday, and he was equally eloquent about the world's leading football nation. ""It's very, very tough against Spain because you don't even get in duels,"" he said. ""You can't even make a tackle or get close because they move it [the ball] so quickly. ""They are very intelligent footballers. They play easy and smart which, for me, is the best anyone can play. Everybody knows what to do and it's very tough against them. You defend the whole time and then suddenly you win the ball and you're exhausted. You need to have the ball just to breathe a little bit. ""When I watch Spain play I enjoy it. It looks easy and people think that's the truth but it's not. It's very hard to do what they do."" But, like Sagnol correctly pointed out -- it's a process. Every year, Spain's FA starts with the 14-to-15-year-old age group, selects the best 55 players from that generation and then begins to mold them. Tactics, discipline, unity, responsibility. play 1:33 Ogden fears physical and mental burnout for overplayed Lamine Yamal Mark Ogden explains why the physical and mental strain being put on Lamine Yamal as a teenager could shorten his career in the long term. When I spoke to the then youth coordinator at the Spanish FA, Ginés Melendéz he told me: ""From the minute the lads arrive aged 15, right up until they are 20 or 21, we work with them in exactly the same way, with the same training drills, until they become automatic. The boys arrive with plenty of talent but we have to give them order. That's the two things which defines our football: order and talent."" Which partially explains why, when Spain's key footballers are absent, someone simply steps up and does the same thing. ""We are a family,"" Arsenal midfielder Mikel Merino said Tuesday night after scoring twice against Bulgaria. Instead of taking the dying minutes penalty, which might have given him a hat trick, Merino handed the ball to Mikel Oyarzabal who scored his 13th goal of the De la Fuente reign. The strike made it eight goals and five assists, plus a European Championship final-winning goal to his name, in his past 13 Spain matches. Is it a coincidence that he and De la Fuente have been working together since Oyarzabal was 19? And that the striker looks three times the player with Spain that he does at Real Sociedad ? I think not. Sagnol, of course, provided the last word on La Roja's supremacy: ""Spain and Portugal are the two football models right now that every other country should be looking to learn from and copy."" He's right, but he said it with a sigh and a sad face. He and his Georgia team had just been through the Spain experience and come out battered and bruised -- but full of admiration -- on the other side.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46598014/why-spains-player-production-line-envy-world,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560326_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,859d392ccdeab19e8fb5e4e9f80b6bc4b9d8b30b
bbafda01ef58,"Rocked by scandal, Portland Thorns find footing with new owners",,"The Aug. 10 match between the Portland Thorns and the Seattle Reign looked like countless other NWSL matches at Providence Park in downtown Portland over the years. The stadium's North End, home to Thorns supporters group Rose City Riveters, kept up a steady beat of chants and songs. The Pride flags and Cascadia banners were draped over the railing. A crowd of 21,811 fans enjoyed a 4-2 victory over their longtime rivals. Compared to the 2022 and 2023 seasons, there were some flags missing, however. There were no ""Sell The Team"" signs, nor were there any ""You Knew"" banners, a reference to the abuse scandal that rocked the team -- and the NWSL as a whole -- starting back in 2021 once the news had broken. The reason for this was simple: A change in ownership in early 2024 meant that Merritt Paulson -- who long caught the ire of fans -- was out, and RAJ Sports, headed by the Bhathal family, was in . For fans, attending games the past two seasons has meant no more inner turmoil in terms of supporting the team once owned by Paulson, who they held responsible for much of the scandal. ""The joy is back,"" said Gabby Rosas, the former president of the 107IST, the organizational arm of the Rose City Riveters, as well as the Portland Timbers' counterpart, the Timbers Army. ""I know I feel more comfortable in the stadium, in the stands. I don't feel conflicted about it. I think the new ownership is not even really on my thought list when I'm getting ready for a match, unlike for a few years there."" The joy might have returned to Thorns game days, but that doesn't mean there haven't been growing pains. Decoupling the Thorns from the Timbers organization -- which had been the driving force behind the NWSL team since its debut in 2013 -- has been a bumpy process at times. And it's still not over. - Alex Morgan talks next chapter after USWNT, NWSL retirement - NWSL commissioner Berman gets contract extension - Some execs call it ""dangerous"" but NWSL aims to be 32-team league Rebuilding trust in Portland The Thorns' new ownership group, led by the brother-sister duo of Alex Bhathal and Lisa Bhathal Merage, has attempted to steer the Thorns into a new era. That has meant a clear separation of the club from Paulson's organization and crafting their own approach in moving the Thorns forward. ""For me, I consider it incredibly fun, challenging,"" Merage told ESPN about taking over the Thorns. ""It's about problem solving. It's about making a difference. It's about influencing and shaping the future. I like to say shaping the future of women's sports for generations to come. So, it comes with everything, but that's what makes it so fun. We're very lucky to be in this line of work."" Alex Bhathal added: ""We love business and we love sports, so there's nothing better than to be the custodians of this community asset, and it's been a thrilling ride, a lot of fun, a lot of challenges to overcome, but we're just getting started and really excited about where we can elevate the club to on a global stage."" Reilyn Turner and Pietra Tordin celebrate the Portland Thorns scoring against the Seattle Reign on Aug. 10. Soobum Im/NWSL via Getty Images While there have been numerous challenges, the biggest ones have been about rebuilding trust with fans and sponsors. Portland was one of the teams at the epicenter of the Yates Report , which detailed systemic abuse at multiple NWSL teams. Former Thorns manager Paul Riley, who coached the team in 2014 and 2015, was named in the report as having allegedly engaged in sexual coercion of players, with the organization's leaders -- including Paulson -- keeping the manner of his departure quiet and helping him find new employment within the league. A report from the Oregonian also detailed a toxic workplace culture at the Timbers-Thorns organization as it related to its treatment of women employees. Later, ESPN reported that Paulson had given North Carolina Courage owner Steve Malik a warning that Riley shouldn't apply for the then-vacant U.S. women's national team job, extending the wall of silence about Riley's behavior. Longtime Thorns executives Gavin Wilkinson and Mike Golub were later fired . In 2022, Paulson announced he was stepping down as CEO from both the Thorns and the Timbers, and later said he would sell the NWSL side . That sale was completed on Jan. 3, 2024. Bhathal and Merage said they spent the first year of their ownership on a ""listening tour"" in which they engaged with fans and other stakeholders. There were connections to the business community and fan base that needed to be reestablished. There was an organization that needed to be staffed. Along the way, RAJ Sports also secured a WNBA expansion franchise, dubbed the Fire, that will be based in Portland. ""Our primary focus and goal and vision is to cement Portland as the global epicenter for women's sports,"" Bhathal said. As it relates to the Thorns, that has meant knowing when to push through with ideas and when to back off. Tina Ettlin, a current 107IST board member, recalled how in one early meeting, the new ownership asked, ""How are we going to light the beam?"" -- a reference to the postwin ritual of the NBA's Sacramento Kings who count Alex Bhathal as one of their owners. That suggestion did not go over well with the Riveters and was eventually discarded. ""We're like, 'Did you not buy the team because of what you saw in the Riveters?' So, we were a little bit confused by that and a little bit off-put by that,"" Ettlin said. Some endeavors from new ownership have been more successful than others. At the height of the scandal under Paulson, sponsors began abandoning the Thorns . Among those were Alaska Airlines, which ended its jersey sponsorship in 2023, after previously redirecting its funds to the NWSL Players Association Emergency Trust and local youth sports. Cheesemaker Tillamook also withdrew its support. But Alaska Airlines and Tillamook have since come back into the Thorns' sponsorship fold. Both companies had previously been Timbers sponsors too. Tillamook has since returned, signing on as the Timbers' front-of-jersey sponsor, but Alaska has not. The Thorns, meanwhile, locked up security camera company Ring as their new jersey sponsor, which Merage said has helped bring sponsorship revenue up over 600% year over year. At the height of discontent under former owner Merritt Paulson, Portland Thorns fans displayed signs that said, 'You Knew,' in reference to his involvement in covering up allegations of abuse under ex-coach Paul Riley. Logan Hannigan-Downs/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Not all broken ties have been mended, though. Union Wine was one sponsor that didn't return, citing a wait-and-see approach with the new ownership. ""Our commitment to this community runs deep,"" said Union Wine owner and founder Ryan Harms in a statement to ESPN. ""We believe the Thorns are an important part of Oregon sports culture, and we're hopeful that the new leadership will take the steps necessary to rebuild and strengthen trust with fans and partners alike. If that happens, we'd certainly be open to exploring what a future partnership could look like."" It helps that, with new owners, the organization has something of a clean slate. ""We are just approaching everything brand new, and establishing who we are, what our mission is, what we're about, and really leaning into that,"" Thorns CEO Alexis Lee said in relation to sponsorships. ""And everybody has been very open to those conversations and quite actually excited about it."" That doesn't mean the relationship with Paulson is now nonexistent, though. According to Lee, no staff came over from Peregrine Sports, the Paulson-led entity that previously owned the Thorns. The two entities have been completely separate on the business side since the start of this year, Merage said. At present, the Thorns employ 20 employees on the soccer operations side and 35 on the business side, with more to come. But the Thorns remain a subtenant at Providence Park, which is operated by Peregrine Sports and, by extension, Paulson. ""We still text with Merritt pretty regularly,"" Bhathal said. ""We cheer on the Timbers. He cheers on the Thorns. It's all good."" Facility gains, attendance challenges RAJ Sports has also jumped headlong into building new infrastructure for the Thorns, who lacked their own practice space in the Paulson years, often having to train at the artificial turf of Providence Park. RAJ Sports broke ground on a new training facility back in May, one that will be shared between the Thorns and the Fire and will be designed for women athletes. Construction is expected to be completed in time for the start of the 2026 NWSL season and has involved consultation with other NWSL teams that have built similar facilities , including the Kansas City Current . Thorns players like Morgan Weaver and Sophia Wilson , who just gave birth to her first child, have also had a say in what amenities the facility will have. ""I think that what we learned was to allow flexibility for growth because it seemed like [Kansas City] built it and they were already starting to bust out the seams,"" said Merage. ""So we're like, how does that come into play for ours? And then also just how they approach the female athlete. So, there were learnings with that as well."" New Portland Thorns owners Alex Bhathal and Lisa Bhathal Merage accept a WNBA ball from commissioner Cathy Engelbert as the Bhathals announce their new WNBA team, the Portland Fire, planned to debut next year. Cameron Browne/NBAE via Getty Images When asked if the Thorns would ever consider constructing their own stadium, Bhathal said that the team's current venue is ""representative of Portland being a soccer city, and it allows for the community to really support both the Timbers and the Thorns, and we are very happy in Providence Park."" Attendance has proven to be a bigger challenge. During the 2022 season, when the Thorns' organizational reputation hit rock bottom, per game average attendance was 15,543 and a wave of fans opted not to renew their season tickets . Once Paulson announced in December 2022 that he would sell the team, 2023 attendance ticked up to 18,918. It was about the same (18,725) in 2024 but has since moved downward to 17,479 so far this season. Lee noted that mark still leads the league, though attendance is down this year across the league. Gavin Wilkinson, left, and Merritt Paulson, who oversaw both the Portland Timbers and Thorns before the Thorns' ownership change, had been called out in investigations for their handling of abuse allegations. Diego Diaz/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images ""Although we are in the top of our area, there's always more opportunities to sell in that particular space,"" Lee said. ""We are very affordable. We want to remain affordable. We're going to continue to evaluate what the product mix looks like, how are we meeting the needs of our marketplace and just the ever-changing demands of that as well."" To meet those demands, Lee said they are looking at modifying kickoff times, the better to cater to families. Earlier this year, the Thorns held the ""World's Largest Baby Shower,"" in a bid to not only honor Wilson and Thorns midfielder Olivia Wade-Katoa , but also to donate diapers to families in the community. ""What we're trying to do is meet our audiences of where they're at, also understanding where the economy is, and just trying to test how do we meet you where you're at in whatever price point you're at,"" Lee said. Even the presence of new owners can't entirely repair the damage done during the scandal years. Chris Bright, a local tech entrepreneur who at one time tried to put together a consortium of microinvestors to buy the team, had canceled his season tickets at the height of the scandal, and while he has attended some games this year, he hasn't yet renewed them. ""It's just more about me not getting around to it,"" Bright said. It shows the problem that the new Thorns organization still faces in winning fans and sponsors back to the same level of engagement after it has lost them once already. A Thorns rebuild on the field too As much as off-field matters continue to be a work in progress, so too is what's happening on the field. The Thorns have been without Wilson and Weaver because of pregnancy and a right knee injury, respectively. That, along with the retirements of club legends Christine Sinclair , Meghan Klingenberg and Becky Sauerbrunn , might explain in part the drop in attendance. But on the field, the Thorns are staying afloat despite those absences -- they are currently in seventh place, but just two points behind third-place Orlando. There has been some upheaval on the soccer operations side, with Jeff Agoos replacing Karina LeBlanc as general manager at the start of 2025, while Rob Gale replaced Mike Norris as manager after the start of the 2024 campaign. This is Agoos' first foray into woman's soccer after previously working for the New York Red Bulls and MLS league office. Agoos admits that there's been a bit of a learning curve, but insists that while the loss of former league MVP Wilson was a huge blow, it forced the team to diversify its attack. ""We wanted to make sure that we were going to be younger and more aggressive,"" Agoos said. ""We wanted to make sure we rebalanced our team and that we had different areas that were capable of scoring from a lot of different places. Sophia was essentially the main protagonist for us last year, whereas we've got goals coming from a lot of different players this year."" Deyna Castellanos and Mimi Alidou after a game at Providence Park in April 2025. Soobum Im/NWSL via Getty Images Agoos added he's trying to reset the club's culture, even as the club won a championship as recently as 2022. ""We want to make sure that you have the courage to do the right thing at the right moment, even when people aren't looking,"" he said. ""And so being a good pro, both on and off the field, whether it's staff or whether it's for players, is critically important."" While the vibe from fans overall is positive, there is a sense that the Thorns have fallen from what was once a lofty perch. As the league expands -- two new teams, in Boston and Denver, debut in 2026, taking the league to 16 teams -- there's no guarantee that the organization will make it back. There has been a scarcity of top signings that make fans sit up and take notice. ""I think part of the frustration is how do we get back to being No. 1,"" Rosas said. ""Not just in the standings, but how do we get back to being the club that international players want to come to? The top tier players want to be at? How do we get back to being this beacon for women's soccer, not only in NWSL, but for around the world?"" That the Fire, who will launch in the WNBA next year , are now part of the RAJ Sports portfolio isn't viewed entirely as a positive to some fans either. The constant advertising for the Fire at Providence Park leaves some fans feeling wary. ""The frustration is it feels like their focus has really pivoted to [the WNBA],"" Rosas said. ""I know that that's a tall order, that's a huge project, but I also feel like there's still a lot of work to do on the Thorns side as well. ""I think they now are calling themselves the epicenter of women's sports. And it's like, what does that mean? I just feel like the Thorns are getting pulled into this identity that isn't the Thorns. It's like you're trying to spread something out to encompass a lot more than what it needs to. We're in a playoff run; we should be focusing on the Thorns."" In response to those concerns, Lee said that while the Fire is an ""exciting new addition"" to the organization, it hasn't changed the level of commitment of investment that the ownership has in the Thorns. ""Our success is intertwined, and the Thorns remain a top priority,"" Lee said. Both Bhathal and Merage acknowledge that there is more work to be done. With a home venue with a 26,000-seat capacity, there is certainly room to grow in terms of attendance. But ownership is intent on playing the long game. Bhathal said women's sports franchises will be billion dollar businesses ""in short order."" ""We consider ourselves growth stage investors,"" Bhathal said. ""So, when we came in, it was post the venture stage. I would say it's into the growth stage, and it's nowhere near maturity. There's so much opportunity ahead. So, it was the right time for us where we feel that there's a proof of concept, it's working.""",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46491142/portland-thorns-rebuild-new-owners-raj-sports-bhathal-replace-paulson,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560299_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,814a2b0826cdeb206b54786c62866594db58da75

acdf62b7164f,Emotional intelligence and talent make Piastri title favorite,,"If the pressure of this year's title fight is getting to Oscar Piastri , he isn't showing it in his interactions with the media. Even in the aftermath of his recent wheel-to-wheel contact with Lando Norris at the Singapore Grand Prix -- an incident that could still have ramifications on the drivers' championship battle between the two McLaren teammates -- he was remarkably stoic as he faced the press. With his McLaren overalls still drenched in sweat from 90 minutes of racing at one of Formula 1 's most physically demanding events, Piastri resisted journalists' attempts to turn up the heat on his simmering emotions. Asked if the collision, which was a result of Norris attempting to pass Piastri on the inside in the opening three corners, would change the way he races his teammate going forward, his single-word response was completely void of emotion. ""No."" OK, understandable, but how about this: Was he at all concerned that Norris, who was not reprimanded by McLaren for the contact as per the team's internal rules, might be getting preferential treatment? ""No,"" again without so much as a quiver in his voice. Right, but is he worried that as the pressure ramps up in the title fight, it might become hard for the team to remain fair and impartial? ""No,"" he said flatly. ""I'm not."" So measured was each response that it was impossible to gauge Piastri's true thoughts. Over team radio during the race, he had quite clearly raised his objections to Norris' move, but when given the opportunity to twist the knife in front of the world's media, he declined. It's a personality trait that is as compelling as it is disarming. It speaks to a level of maturity belying Piastri's 24 years -- just three of which have been spent racing in F1 -- but should not be confused with indifference. While some drivers rant and rage as events conspire against them, Piastri seems to conspire against the events. His race engineer Tom Stallard -- the voice at the other end of the pit-to-car radio during races -- believes Piastri chooses his words carefully as he knows it can amount to a competitive advantage. ""He's like that because he chooses to be like that, and because that's something that he values in himself and as an individual, so he goes out of his way to be like that,"" Stallard tells ESPN. ""Maybe there's some nature and nurture in there as well, but I think it's a conscious thing and it's something that he's worked on very successfully. ""I mean, he's a human [so the emotions are there], but he's conscious of what emotions are going to be positive and what are going to be negative, and he's just incredibly focused on achieving what he wants to achieve, to the point where he will control that kind of thing to ensure he gets there."" McLaren team principal Andrea Stella, who worked closely with greats such as Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso during their careers in F1, is also of the belief that Piastri maintains control to gain a competitive advantage. Oscar Piastri's ability to manage his emotions has helped put him atop the F1 drivers' championship in 2025. LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA/AFP via Getty Images ""If you want to talk about maturity in handling emotions, this is a function of age, but it is also a function of how you are framed from a young age -- like what is your personality,"" Stella says to ESPN in a separate interview. ""And I think Oscar, very clearly, he has a way of limiting the way in which the emotions develop inside himself and the way in which the emotions get disclosed and made visible. ""I think this is a very different concept to not having emotions. I think this would be completely incorrect. It's just the awareness of your emotions, the way you respond, how visible you make it. I think this is more the trait in which Oscar appears as a controlled person; it's not in the emotions themselves or the intensity of the emotions that are generated."" A champion in the making Where that trait came from is undoubtedly complex, but as Stella points out, it was likely formed at a young age. Piastri's family tell stories of a 2-year-old who was so obsessed with cars that he could point to any badge on a hood or trunk and correctly identify the brand. In the evenings, the only bedtime stories that would lull him to sleep were books about cars, and the next morning he would be able to recite the horsepower and top speed of his favorite models. His first step toward racing came at 6 years old when his father, Chris, returned from a business trip to the U.S. with a remote-control monster truck. It instantly became young Oscar's prized possession and soon led to him entering the world of competitive remote-control racing in national championships. ""My dad came back with this remote-control monster truck, and I started driving that around the backyard, the school oval, a BMX track at one point,"" Piastri recalls in an interview with ESPN. ""And once I started kind of being OK at handling it, then my dad asked if I wanted to race because he had one as well. So we went and raced that for fun, and yeah, that led to more serious RC racing for three or four years."" All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Piastri won his first national championship in RC racing at the age of 9. Using nothing but his exceptional hand-eye coordination, he was able to control a 70-mph RC car and beat far more experienced opposition, many of which were grown men in their 20s and 30s. It was far and away his favorite hobby up until the day he first sat in a go-kart. ""Sometimes the RC cars, especially at that point, you couldn't drive them in the rain,"" Piastri says. ""So there were a few times where we used to race on Wednesday nights every week, and sometimes it would be rained out, and my dad started taking me to the hire go-kart track instead. ""And yeah, once I'd done that a few times, someone asked if I wanted to go in a real kart, and then I had to go. Very quickly RC cars went by the wayside."" By age 13, he was excelling in go-karts at a national level, but in order to set a path toward F1, he needed to leave Australia. In 2014, he started racing in Europe, but it was combined with long-haul flights back to his homeland and simply wasn't sustainable. The next step on the motorsport ladder would require far greater emotional and financial sacrifices, including packing Piastri off to live at a boarding school in the United Kingdom. Although Piastri wasn't aware of it at the time, his father was weighing up the future of Oscar's career as he watched his 13-year-old son line up 21st on the grid for the 2014 IAME X30 world finals in Le Mans, France. Chris needed to be convinced those sacrifices would be worth it. He needed to see a performance that would convince him Oscar had what it took to succeed. ""Yeah, that race was pretty major,"" Piastri recalls. ""That was my first international race, and like, 2014 was really kind of the first year where I started having more success. I didn't really know at the time, but it was kind of the feeler for how I would cope with it."" When Piastri carved through the field to stand on the podium and claim the fastest lap, Chris' mind was made up. ""I really enjoyed the experience,"" Piastri says. ""Obviously, when you walk away with the podium, that was even better. play 2:43 McLaren to let Piastri, Norris fight it out for the drivers' title? ESPN's Laurence Edmondson believes McLaren should let Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri battle it out for the drivers' championship now the contructors' title has been won. ""But I think that was kind of a bit of a test for my parents, or especially my dad, on how I was going to cope with it and whether I was good enough to kind of chase that, really. And yeah, I think the result of that weekend kind of made that a bit clearer."" Two years later, Piastri enrolled at the prestigious Haileybury boarding school in the UK, which became his new home away from his family in Australia. His parents visited when they could and tried to attend important races, but essentially he was on his own to pursue his dream of becoming a professional racing driver. In his first year at his new school, he spent more than 100 days at kart circuits across Europe as his on-track results continued to gather momentum alongside his studies. But for as big a change as moving to the other side of the planet must have been for the teenage Piastri, he doesn't remember being affected by it. ""It wasn't like I was completely fending for myself or having to do everything,"" he says. ""I didn't have to cook my own food, I had to put my laundry in the right baskets, but I didn't even have to wash my own clothes! ""I honestly enjoyed it. I guess at the beginning, it was a little bit daunting, meeting new people, being in a very different environment, especially compared to Australian schooling and stuff. But I don't know whether it's right or wrong, but I never felt that homesick, because I knew I was there doing what I wanted to do, which was race internationally and race against the best guys in the world. ""I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing that I wasn't that homesick, but I guess from a mental standpoint, probably a good thing."" LISTEN TO 'UNLAPPED' Nate Saunders and Laurence Edmondson geek out about Formula 1 and the personalities behind it on ""Unlapped,"" ESPN's weekly F1 podcast. Listen to 'Unlapped' Reflecting on the experience now, Piastri believes it may have contributed to his personality as an adult and his ability to manage his emotions so effectively when the pressure is on. ""I think there's definitely an element of just the life experiences, you know? Moving to Europe when I did and I think also just experiences in racing,"" Piastri says. ""It's a pretty cruel business at times, so I think just learning the lessons from that and ultimately becoming stronger from that's been probably been one of the bigger things."" Cutting out the noise One thing about Piastri that continues to stand out to Stella is his ability to focus on what's important during a race weekend and reduce the outside ""noise."" That's easier said than done when racing within inches of competitors at more than 200 mph, but Stella sees it as a key factor in how Piastri has continued to unlock performance since arriving in F1. ""He is particularly gifted in keeping his, we call it bandwidth, but we can call it processing capacity, brain power -- there's really not much noise in his head,"" Stella explains. ""He's just focused on the important things. ""This doesn't exclude that he's actually a sophisticated thinker, but quite essential, a very clever person, but limiting in a way the inner dialogue to what is essential to make the progress that we need to make and deploying at times even a large degree of common sense. So I think these are qualities that allow, together with his speed, allow him to process what's happening in a very efficient way and then absorb the learning which keeps him in such a steep trajectory of development."" Stallard says Piastri's ability to focus on what's important also makes the job easier for those working around him, which in turn allows them to find solutions to help Piastri. ""In the race, his ability to process information has always been good,"" Stallard says. ""He doesn't necessarily say a lot, but generally what he says is really high-quality, accurate information that we can actually work off. ""One of the positives with Oscar is you don't get a lot of slightly confusing, kind of complaining about a situation that he can't actually control. Generally, because he's quite stoic, if he is frustrated he tends to keep that to himself. It makes people making decisions on his behalf have a slightly easier ride, because you don't get so distracted by, 'Oh, I need to also manage his emotional state.' You can kind of trust him to do that."" Oscar Piastri's supreme speed in 2025 has given him the ability to dedicate additional bandwidth to strategize and manage emotions. Glenn Dunbar/LAT Images But when Stella is asked where Piastri has made the most progress now that he is fighting for a title, the answer is surprisingly simple. ""Let me say that, first of all, there's a quality that sometimes we give for granted, but in this instance it's the quality where he has improved the most from last year to this year, and that's speed, like being fast,"" Stella explains. ""Because being fast takes care of the main requirement in terms of your bandwidth. ""Think, if you are not fast, you need to use all your bandwidth to actually find the pace that you need to have in a qualifying session or you need to have in the race. So the fact that you are fast leaves you with the spare bandwidth to then process, and you process in terms of the short term, almost immediate decision making, but also you have bandwidth to process post-session or post-testing. So the learning quality, being such a fast learner, would not be possible without being quick in the first place and talented from a driving point of view in the first place."" The potent combination of pace, intelligence and mental fortitude are among the reasons why Piastri has led this year's drivers' championship since his victory at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in April. But the true test of his calmness under pressure will be at the final six races of the season -- starting this weekend in Austin, Texas -- as he attempts to close out the title ahead of Norris and four-time defending champion Max Verstappen . Although Piastri has fought for and won titles throughout his junior career, nothing shines the spotlight on a driver like a chance to win the F1 world championship. As a former British Olympian who won silver in rowing at the 2008 Beijing games, Stallard knows the kind of pressure that comes with fighting for a career-long goal, but he also knows that the best way to deal with it is to focus on the strengths that got you there in the first place. ""Hopefully, we'll be in the same position next year, but we definitely have that Olympic-every-four-years kind of feeling, that feeling that this is our chance,"" he says. ""And that's always a slightly dangerous thing to feel, because very much handling pressure is about doing what you're good at, rather than delivering some magic. And normally, when it looks like magic to the rest of the world, it's actually just because you went out and did your thing. So we'll be trying to do that. ""I think we're both quite well placed to handle that pressure. You're right in that the pressure is going to ramp up, but people say pressure is a privilege. That pressure is something that he's worked for, for let's say 10 years, arguably more, in order to be in a position where he can have that pressure. And it's very rare that you get to be world champion without being able to ride that pressure. ""So, I think it comes with the territory, and we're in the territory we want to be in.""",https://www.espn.com/racing/f1/story/_/id/46603686/emotional-intelligence-talent-make-mclaren-oscar-piastri-f1-title-favorite,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560515_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,5792f4184a907a0afc5ca238bdead30a94b7f56c

COTA first hosted a grand prix in 2012 when the circuit was opened by Mario Andretti. Chris Graythen/Getty Images Circuit stats and history America's history with F1 dates back to the sport's origin in 1950 when Indianapolis hosted the event between 1950-1960. In 1959, Sebring hosted the first United States Grand Prix, and since then the race has been held at five other circuits. Circuit of the Americas (COTA) took over as host in 2012 when the track was opened by Mario Andretti, following four years of F1 absence in the U.S.. During F1's popularity in the eighties in the era of Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Niki Lauda, the U.S. hosted additional grands prix including Long Beach from 1976 until the early-eighties, as well as Dallas, Las Vegas and Detroit around the same period. Now the U.S. has Miami, Austin and Las Vegas on the calendar. COTA is a varied circuit with straights, esses through to sector two, and a series of hair-pins in sector three. The high-speed corners takes some inspiration from Silverstone and Hockenheim. Circuit: Circuit of the Americas; Austin, Texas First F1 race: 2012 Lap record: 1:36.169, Charles Leclerc (2019) Laps: 56 laps of 5.5km Most wins: Lewis Hamilton with six (2007, 2012, (2014-2017) Other winners from the current grid: - Verstappen (2021-2023) - Leclerc (2024) Most poles: Hamilton (2007, 2016-2018) is tied with Michael Schumacher (2000-2002, 2006) on four Other pole sitters from the current grid: - Verstappen (2021) - Carlos Sainz (2022) - Leclerc (2023) - Lando Norris (2024) What makes it special: A modern American classic, with a mix of fast corners, long straights and an iconic climb to Turn 1. The U.S. crowd brings a festival-like atmosphere, making it one of the most popular events of the year. What the drivers say about it: ""I think they've nailed the circuit. For a modern-day track, for me, it's definitely the best there is. I love it."" -- Daniel Ricciardo Where to watch from: Turn 1 grandstand. The steepest elevation change on the F1 calendar, watching from the top of the hill is brilliant, especially as the pack bundles through at the start. Charles Leclerc won the U.S. Grand Prix with teammate Carlos Sainz on the podium. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images What happened last year? Leclerc won a memorable U.S. Grand Prix , where a late time penalty demoted Norris behind title rival Verstappen to fourth. Norris had caught and passed Verstappen for third after a lengthy battle late in the race, but exceeded the limits of the track while doing so and took a five-second penalty. Verstappen finished third behind Sainz. Who will win? After dominating the first half of the season, McLaren hasn't won a race since the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August. The newly-crowned constructors' champions aren't convinced COTA will suit its car either -- saying Brazil, Qatar and Abu Dhabi will be its best opportunities to win again -- and are pointing to Verstappen as the favourite. Given Verstappen's ability to maximise race weekends and McLaren's propensity for end-of-season jitters, we're going to agree with that assessment and back Verstappen for the win. Oscar Piastri is 22 points ahead of Lando Norris in the drivers' championship coming into the United States Grand Prix. Kym Illman/Getty Images How the championships look McLaren wrapped up the constructors' title in Singapore in their first back-to-back win since the early 1990s. The drivers' championship is yet to be decided, and it's close at the top with six races to go. Oscar Piastri leads teammate Norris by 22 points, but Verstappen is 41 points behind Norris, and has finished ahead of him in the past four races (including Norris' DNF at Zandvoort).

084bbfca20dd,How to ace your salary cap draft: Tips and strategies to build a winning team,,"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is undeniably awesome. So is Victor Wembanyama . Yet, in a traditional snake draft, getting both is essentially impossible given both are found firmly in the first round. There is a draft format, however, that absolutely allows you to pair SGA and Wemby. Or Nikola Jokic and Stephen Curry , Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo ... you get the idea. Salary cap drafts afford you the ability to assemble compelling collections of superstars. The mission of this piece isn't solely to explain how salary cap drafting works, but more importantly, share several actionable strategies to help you thrive in this uniquely rewarding way to build fantasy basketball rosters. How salary cap drafts work In ESPN salary cap drafts, each manager begins with a $200 budget to build out their roster. Default settings host 13 roster spots, with the calculator on my laptop revealing this is a bit more than $15 per slot. You are welcome, of course, to spend well above $15 to acquire star-caliber players, leaving less for filler and depth. Instead of having a fixed draft slot to acquire NBA talent as you would in a snake draft, mangers rotate turns nominating players for bidding. As you might guess, the highest bidder when the clock hits zero lands that player on their respective roster. As my long-time colleague John Cregan once coined, ""your reign as manager begins with a wad of fake cash, a couple of hours to kill, and an empty roster to stock."" Now that we have an idea how they operate, let's delve into some winning tips for salary cap drafts. The road to imaginary glory begins here. Preparation pays Leverage live draft trends as you prepare for your salary cap draft. Just like how we identify average draft position as a tool of differentiation and value in snake drafts, average salary performs this function in this format. Unlike how we enter snake drafts knowing that certain players will get drafted in a finite range of selections, the variance and volatility of player pricing inherent to a salary draft demands you identify which players you truly want to target with your imaginary coin. Which is to say, set not only price ranges you are willing to pay (within a few dollars) for specific NBA talents, but order players into pricing tiers. If you are the turn in a snake draft, your options are almost surely limited to a handful of top talents available in that range. In salary formats, you can acquire two typical first-rounders, or four players generally found in the second and third rounds of snake results. Before such expenditure, just make sure to have identified which talents in each tier you intend to bid for. In category-driven leagues, it's wise to prepare lists of players who thrive in distinct statistical categories; knowing that Gary Trent Jr . is an elite, and underrated source of steals. Or that Myles Turner can drive bold block results without tanking free-throw efficiency. No matter the scoring key, it's beneficial to list your top targets at each position, as well. Preparation is more crucial and comes with greater rewards in salary drafts, as average draft position doesn't do the work for you. Be nimble While snake drafts can throw some surprises at you; a reach here, a player sliding there, salary formats are atypical in that each draft room behaves as its own unique market. Did the room hesitate to pay enough for a top star who is coming off a down season? Maybe he goes $15 or so below expected value, but that doesn't necessarily equate to a trend, as there could be a bidding war for him in another salary draft. Value is a variant concept in these drafts, so being adaptive and nimble is critical. This is why we can refer back to preparation; if you establish your targets at different tiers, statistics, and positions, then you'll be ready to act on players who appear undervalued in that specific salary market. Players closer to the end of a tier, or round using snake results as a comparison, are often where bargains emerge. Strategize strategies There are a bevy of established investing strategies to consider for salary drafts. I don't believe it's prudent to lock into any one of these prior to the first nomination, but it does help to have an understanding of how some early decisions might dictate your path. Let's consider a few of the more notable approaches. The freedom of salary drafting bears the need for restraint in order to refine and define your strategy and player valuations. You determine which players best fit your philosophy, rather than a draft spot you often randomly net in snake rooms. Stars and Sleepers If you've identified strong interest in Luka and Giannis in your pre-draft prep and they both appear undervalued as the bidding approaches the final seconds, go for it. Just be mindful this pairing would still likely consume 60% of your total budget, leaving say $80 of your original $200 to canvass the remaining roster spots. Sometimes, as the early bidding begins, the superstars find you. Pro basketball is a space where heliocentric stars often drive impressive outcomes even with role players riding shotgun, as both Luka and Giannis' actual NBA careers confirm, so you can make this strategy of extremes work. It will just demand savvy waiver management and securing some sleepers in the draft. Snake style It's unlikely that anyone actually calls this strategy ""snake style,"" but I just did. The premise here is simple; you can mimic a snake outcome pattern in that you want one true high-dollar star -- or in this comparison first-round talents -- which in current live draft trends ranges from roughly $70 for the Joker and Wemby to $45 for the likes of Devin Booker and De'Aaron Fox . Assume downshifts in spending for each successive tier of spending, with second-rounders which can range from the $40s into the high-$20 range. Minding the middle I generally don't adhere to the aforementioned snake-like framework, as the power of salary drafts is the ability to identify, for instance, that you love the values found in the third-to-fifth rounds, allowing you load up on say five of such players. Then again, it's up to you how to navigate your spending. My most common approach; netting one high-dollar star and complementing them with a series of those mid-round gems we all admire. An example this year would include paying top-dollar for statistical anchors like Victor Wembanyama or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and then focusing on the likes of Jalen Williams , Desmond Bane , Immanuel Quickley and Evan Mobley at prices below what I project and expect their actual production will deliver. Draft with discipline Sticking to your pre-game planning in regards to player targets, tiers and statistical specialists is far more vital than adhering to any of the approaches such as stars or sleepers or snake-driven spending. It's also important to note that you avoid what we nerds deem as price enforcing; engaging in bidding almost purely to protect the price point of a specific or multiple players. This is how you end up spending real percentages of your budget on players you truly didn't want just an hour before the draft. There is a very clear line between identifying a value and trying to police every bid. Your peers will absolutely get some great values during the process, but your team is paramount to those outcomes. There really should be a breaking point for when you stop bidding, just as you should feel comfortable trusting your pre-draft price points with regards to paying enough for talent you want on your team. After all, you will ride with many of your choices for months during the NBA marathon, so at least you can enjoy the team you wanted all along.",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/story/_/id/38651878/fantasy-basketball-how-ace-your-salary-cap-draft-nba-2025-26,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0923%2Fr1549986_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,c9b54f8b940d4d3649af94add009fb1bba4533d8

Join us for the latest transfer news and rumors from around the globe. Transfers homepage | Done deals | Men's grades | Women's grades TOP STORIES - Sources: Utd may extend Casemiro but salary key - De Jong signs new Barcelona contract until 2029 - Sources: Barça, Madrid tracking Mexican teen Mora Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo has impressed since moving from Brighton for £115 million in 2023. Chris Lee/Chelsea FC via Getty Images TRENDING RUMORS - Chelsea plan to offer midfielder Moisés Caicedo a new contract to ward off interest from Real Madrid , according to TEAMtalk . Los Blancos are reported to be one of the sides keeping tabs on the 23-year-old but, following several impressive performances so far this season, it looks as though the Blues are set to reward him with improved terms to stay put at Stamford Bridge. And Caicedo's long-term deal in West London isn't set to expire until 2031 already. - A race between Chelsea and Juventus could take place for Al Hilal midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic , according to Corriere dello Sport . The 30-year-old is set to enter the final six months of his contract in January and, having not yet signed an extension, multiple clubs across Europe (including Galatasaray and Fenerbahce) are tracking him with a view to getting him to sign a pre-contract agreement. The Serbia international has made four appearances in the Saudi Pro League side so far this season. - Internazionale have joined the race for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi , reports Tuttosport . Inter are reportedly monitoring the 25-year-old's situation at Selhurst Park, with belief that he could be a strong replacement for Yann Bisseck , who could leave San Siro next summer. Guéhi remains on the radar of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich , but Liverpool are leading the race for him after a £35 million move broke down on the final day of the summer transfer window. - Brighton will dismiss offers to sign midfielder Carlos Baleba in January amid interest from the Premier League . TalkSPORT reports that the Seagulls have no plans to part ways with the 21-year-old during the middle of the season, with hopes of dissuading interested sides by asking for a £120 million fee. Meanwhile, Manchester United are set to prioritize a move for Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton , 21, according to iNews , having placed him as their No. 1 priority ahead of Baleba amid their search for a midfielder. Wharton has also recently been linked with Real Madrid. - A move for Dinamo Zagreb winger Cardoso Varela is being considered by Barcelona and Chelsea, reports Mundo Deportivo . The Blaugrana are closely monitoring the 16-year-old, with club sporting director Deco having already met with his representatives. While the Blues are also interested in Varela, whether the LaLiga club make a move for him is expected to hinge on if they decide to sign on-loan Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford permanently. EXPERT TAKE ESPN's Madrid correspondent Alex Kirkland looks at the likelihood of Real Madrid landing Moisés Caicedo. Real Madrid's summer rebuild -- signing three defenders in Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen and Alvaro Carreras, plus a wide forward in Franco Mastantuono -- didn't include a central midfielder, which for many fans and pundits, should have been top of the list. So far this season, Xabi Alonso has tended to pick Aurelien Tchouameni, Fede Valverde and Arda Guler as his midfield three, with Jude Bellingham coming back into the picture after his recovery from shoulder surgery. The team have mostly played well, but in the two biggest games of Alonso's tenure so far -- the Club World Cup semifinal against PSG, and the derby against Atletico -- they've come up short, and it's hard to escape the feeling that, despite the qualities of Tchouameni, Valverde et al, they're still missing a really dominant, tempo-setting midfielder. Is Caicedo that player? A contract until 2031 is clearly an issue. Madrid only pay big transfer fees for the most elite prospects, like Bellingham, and that contract duration means a free transfer would be a distant prospect. Here in Madrid, there's been no reporting yet that Caicedo is a serious target.

12ef79e98f3b,Red Bandana Girl: Meet the Viral Fan Who Stood Up for Billie Eilish,,"Aniyah Saint-Surin was about to live her dream. A lifelong Billie Eilish fan , Saint-Surin was finally able to see the Hit Me Hard and Soft singer for the first time in concert when Eilish began her tour at Kaseya Center in Miami on Oct. 9 . The tickets had come together at the last minute, and with the help of her aunt, Saint-Surin had thrown together a serviceable outfit, complete with a red bandana that had been gathering dust in the corner of her room. The clothes didn’t matter — she was there to see her Billie. Saint-Surin has seen countless Eilish concerts through her phone screen, so she knew what was going to happen next. After hearing Eilish sing “Guess,” her hit collab with Charli XCX , Saint-Surin could see Eilish getting ready to run past the crowded barricade. This was what she had been waiting for, when Eilish would hop down from her stage and speed past a hoard of waiting fans, arms all outstretched for a second of contact. This was her moment. Eilish had just touched Saint-Surin’s fingertips when everything went haywire. A fan grabbed Eilish, and the singer went down hard — slamming into the metal barricade . “Instantly, something clicked,” Saint-Surin tells Rolling Stone . Before she even realized what she was doing, she was pushing the fan away, leaving her coveted spot at the barricade — and her chance to interact with Eilish again — to loudly berate the man for grabbing Eilish so roughly. A few minutes later, she was back in her spot, shaken up but convinced no one had noticed her actions. Saint-Surin has been listening to Billie Eilish for as long as she can remember — at least six years — which for an 18-year-old, is a substantial chunk of her life. Since Eilish released her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in 2019, Saint-Surin has been a self-proclaimed stan, following the Los-Angeles based singer as she went from an industry newcomer to a Grammy and Academy Award-winning powerhouse. She watched Eilish’s concerts via TikToks, streamed interviews on YouTube, and of course played her music constantly. “When tickets dropped, I got everyone, my brother, my sister, everybody on their Ticketmaster app,” she says. “I just kept saying ‘I need these Billie tickets.’ I need them!” She was still overwhelmed to be at her first ever Eilish concert, so she regaled her family with the story later that night, but went to bed thinking it would be forgotten by the time she woke up. When she fell asleep, she had about 70 followers on TikTok . Five days later, she’s reached half a million. What Surin didn’t know was that the night of her concert, several clips of her yelling at the fan that grabbed Eilish slowly went viral online, garnering posts from Finneas and Renee Rapp . Ticket reselling company StubHub got her tickets to the next show, making sure she could finally live her dream of touching hand with Eilish. Through her tour manager, Eilish got Saint-Surin’s brother a ticket to a show — and even sent Saint-Surin several pieces of merch to thank her for her actions. (The fan who grabbed Eilish has not been identified.) The viral video comes as artists have become more vocal about fan behavior at concerts can put them in danger. In a 2023 interview with the Hollywood Reporter , Eilish herself noted that when fans are excited, trying to grab her or throw things , it can get scary. “People just get excited and it can be dangerous. I have mixed feelings about it, because when you’re up there it blows,” Eilish said. “But you know it’s out of love and they’re just trying to give you something. You’re in a vulnerable position, but I’ve been getting hit with stuff for like years.” Now Saint-Surin is a hero online, dubbed with the moniker “ Red Bandana Girl ” for the red headscarf that was on her head when she went after the fan who grabbed Eilish. For her first public interview, Saint-Surin spoke to Rolling Stone about her love for Eilish, the deterioration of concert etiquette, and why it might be time for fandoms to have a reckoning in their ranks. How long have you been a music lover? Do you have a preferred genre? I love this question. It all depends what mood I’m in. I’ve been listening since I can remember, and I’m so deeply in love with all the genres and the feelings they give me. From pop to hip hop, and K Pop, I love it all. I love music so much. Like, what would I do without it? As someone who loves so many different genres, what draws you in about Billie Eilish as an artist? I’ve been a Billie stan for six years. It feels like I watched her grow — Well, I did watch her grow — but it’s like this connection that she has with us. Call stans crazy, but I swear it’s real. What really connected me to Billie’s music was the way she puts her stories and experiences and traumas into something so beautiful that helps millions of other girls like me also get through obstacles in their lives. From watching her interviews and personality, everything about her character is so captivating to me. When you’re a fan and you find your artists, it’s like… they just get it. How many Billie concerts have you been to before this viral incident? Thursday was my very first time. As someone who’s been a fan for so many years, that must have felt a bit overwhelming. Oh my gosh. As I walked into that arena and I grabbed that barricade, it felt like every time I closed my eyes, I was going to be in bed, and I’ve never felt that way before, like it’s more than a dream, one, like this is not even real. I’ve watched her do this show online. But to really look at that stage and look at everybody excited around me, and I’m talking to people about her, It did not feel real. Yeah, I kept falling to the ground. I kept falling to the ground. Walk me through the incident with the fan. Okay, so Billie has two stages, a small stage and the main stage, which is a long rectangle. So she sings “Guess” and then “Everything I Wanted” and I realized, “Wait, this is when Billie does the crowd walk.” So I rushed back to my barricade spot, and my girls saved my spot. So I get there and I just hold on. I’m like, “This is it.” This was my dream. This is every stan’s dream, just to be able to have that second of contact with their favorite artists. It just means so much. So Billie’s walking down. I have my phone [tight to my chest]  because I want to remember this, but  I don’t want the phone in my face. But the second our fingers touch, Billie goes down. It didn’t look right at all, because her head was down and she was smashed against the barricade. I try to pull her arm up and I feel a pull on me, so I turn around and it’s this guy. And instantly, something clicked. It was immediate. All I thought was, “You just put your hands on this little lady? Now it’s me and you.” What did you do? All I saw was his face and I just started rushing him. I was screaming and honestly, it was a lot of cussing. “What are you doing? What are you doing? Don’t mess with Billie! Get him out of here!” And then next thing I remember, what felt like six police officers were on top of him. I don’t even remember the police kind of grabbing me as well, but they were actually really nice and ended up being on my side. Were you able to enjoy the concert after the incident? After the security guards questioned me, and they were very nice, I went to my spot by the barricade. Everyone there was so nice. They kept my purse for me. They were asking if I was OK. They’re the sweetest people ever. I love them forever. But I was so angry I couldn’t really just enjoy the moment. Like in all my concert videos after that, you can hear me screaming “I can’t even believe this happened! This is insane!” By the end of the concert, everyone was smiling, filling their hands with confetti and because I went by myself, I was just walking around the arena solo trying to find the exit, just yelling “I can’t believe that!” to myself. I know I looked insane. Did you expect the incident to go as viral as it did? No, I was still very heated, so I didn’t even go on social media. The first thing I did was call my aunt, and tell her this guy just attacked Billie and that I rushed him. I thought I was really the only one with the video. I called my mom and she was immediately like, “No more solo concerts. That’s a grown man. You could have gotten hurt.” I did see one video about it by the end of the night, but I thought it would be gone by morning. So I go to sleep and when I wake up, I have 2,000 new followers on TikTok. Were you concerned when you realized just how viral the clips were getting, especially the ones focused on you? So when I first saw the video on Twitter, I gasped. I was like, “Oh my goodness, all people are going to see is an angry Black woman. Many Black women before me dealt with showcasing their emotions to disrespect, even if you’re trying to defend someone that you care about. So I was really worried that I would be taken out of context and treated like that. But I’m glad that people understood and I’m very thankful for the opportunity to be seen as justified, because a lot of women did not get that same grace. How do you think fandom and obsession plays a part in incidents like this? That connection with stan and artist, your favorite artists — you care so deeply about them. And they care about all of the people that support them, too. I’m a woman. Billie is a woman. And it felt like this man just abused his power. Billie even has a song that is about that. So to forcefully grab her for no reason, just to be aggressive, you’re just out of your mind. But I feel like I would have done the same for anybody in that pit. I don’t play about putting hands on people and overstepping boundaries. It was just so disrespectful. I couldn’t fathom how that all went down so it led to so much anger in me. I’ve never ran up on nobody before. Yes, you could call me confrontational with my words, but it was just something about that situation. I had to do something. And I see a lot of comments like, “You saved Billie. You saved Billie.” Well, Mr. Police and Mr. Security — they saved Billie. But I was definitely going to give that man a piece of my mind. As someone who identifies as a stan, do you think concert etiquette like this has gotten worse because of parasocial relationships? One thousand percent. People see artists in the industry and think, “You owe me.” And I’m even guilty of this. When I first started getting into music I’m like, “Oh my gosh, if I see them I’ll run up and ask for a picture, give them a hug.” It’s because I know them, but they’re looking at me and being nice but I’m a stranger. It’s reached a certain level of creepy, like now people are crossing boundaries. It’s getting weird. It’s getting invasive. And I think it’s really important to keep understanding that you are strangers to your favorite artists. Yes, you have that relationship through their music, but you don’t know them personally. Yes, you watch them on live, yes, you watch all their interviews, and yes, you know every song, but you don’t know anything about that person. I think that’s something people really need to understand. Do you think stans are aware of when this kind of love and obsession gets disrespectful? I think so. I like to call them real stans, people who respect those boundaries. It’s the people who aren’t googling into their business and trying to find out what’s going on in their personal life. When headlines come out about Billie — that’s none of my business.  Something I keep in mind is Billie saying something along the lines of she wishes she could tell us everything, but then it would be all over the internet. If it was only Billie stans and my girl, we’d have so much fun. But I understand that when she disappears for months, I just know my girl is probably vibing because she needed that space. And I tell myself that she’ll come back again. She always does.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/billie-eilish-red-bandana-girl-viral-fan-1235447895,Entertainment,Washington Post,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Aniyah-billie-concert.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-15T17:59:59+00:00,33604f51b56604aa760e995af1641e7fab430063
a6f9e661035d,How Limp Bizkit Ended Up On the Soundtrack for ‘Battlefield 6’,,"To the surprise of absolutely no one, Battlefield 6 has been a major hit, with fans across all platforms rushing to game’s multiplayer mode for one purpose: break stuff. With a peak concurrent player count of over 747,000 users on Steam alone for the game’s Oct. 10 launch day, Battlefield 6 has been dominating the charts in its opening week. Our own review of Battlefield 6 called the game a throwback military fantasy that operates on the same wavelength as 2000s-era multiplayer shooters, which totally aligns with the direction of the game’s soundtrack. An early leak of the in-game audio revealed licensed tracks from bands like Godsmack and Drowning Pool, but one collaboration has gone further — rap-rock maestros Limp Bizkit have partnered with EA Games to contribute not just one of their classic songs (“ Break Stuff ”) to the trailer , but to create entirely new music for the game. The first is the wildly named “ Making Love to Morgan Wallen ,” which was released back in September . The second track, “ Battlefield: The After-party,” is a full reimagining of the traditional Battlefield theme, produced in cooperation with the game’s composer, Henry Jackman. Rolling Stone has an exclusive video interview featuring Jackman and Limp Bizkit frontman, Fred Durst , detailing how the collaboration came to be. You can watch the full video below. In the video, Jackman details the development of the new game’s score, noting that one specific theme was paramount. “In a really early meeting, I just threw out, ‘Does anyone got like a sentence or key word?’ And I guess, it not being a romantic comedy — it being a video game — the word that came out straight away was ‘destruction,’” Jackman says. Jackman, whose body of work encompasses films like Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Kong: Skull Island (2017), also has extensive credits on high-profile video games including PlayStation’s Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End (2016). Going into designing the music for Battlefield 6 , he knew exactly that kind of attitude he wanted to bring to the project. “There was a lot of aggression techniques in the engineering and [production]. It’s not polite.” The dearth of politeness in the game’s score left Jackman and co. searching for the right partner to help put their mark on this new, more aggressive era of Battlefield . Enter Limp Bizkit. Durst, a well-known gamer himself, notes that the process began with questioning whether the composition would be all-new or building on the existing foundation. Speaking with Jackman, the singer says that the decision was to ultimately add to the work that had already been done. “It was more like, follow the yellow brick road — until we get to Henry,” Durst says. Battlefield 6 is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s soundtrack is now streaming.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/battlefield-6-limp-bizkit-soundtrack-1235446825,Entertainment,Washington Post,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/limp-bizkit-battlefield-6.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-15T17:00:50+00:00,c3e42efe9dd123d5db0b29bbbe14aa78781537a9
3f75ac6ba44d,This Small Town Protected a Predator. Now His Survivors Are Fighting Back,,"I t seemed like any city council meeting: a beige, cinderblock room, metal chairs, a U-shaped table with a maroon tablecloth reading “Leonia Board of Education.” But for the men — some sporting matching T-shirts, claiming that they were survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved teacher — it signified a release, a silence broken. Paul King, 59, choked back sobs as he took the mic, his family thronged behind him on a school lunch table bench. “I hope that none of you have ever experienced sexual assault ,” he said in measured tones, despite the emotion. “So what do I want? That’s a good question. I don’t know. But I do know that I want what’s fair. I want the people that are victims to be free to come out. To heal. … There’s a saying that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. This crisis has been going on for over 50 years.” “That was like the most I’ve ever seen him cry in my life,” King’s 24-year-old son, also named Paul, later tells me. He sat behind his father during his speech, nodding emphatically. “He was reaching really deep down into his memories, into his darkest, repressed stuff, to figure out what happened to him and convey it in a way that was more digestible for these guys sitting on the council.” Nearly half a century ago, King and his fellow survivors saw their idyllic enclave of Leonia, New Jersey , turn into a hostile place. A leafy, close-knit community less than 10 miles from New York City, Leonia isn’t that kind place where tragedy often happens — in fact, it was the model for the suburban utopia depicted in Disney’s WandaVision . But, much like in that show, there was unease beneath the surface: back in the Eighties, King and the rest watched as their beloved hometown rallied around elementary school teacher John Anagnosti, a.k.a. Mr. A — despite the fact that Mr. A was convicted of abusing one of their fellow students. It was a stunning state of affairs: a young boy’s pain dismissed, his abuser given a slap on the wrist and thousands of dollars of legal support from local parents. Now, though, due to expanding statutes of limitations on child sexual abuse cases, more and more of those who say they are Mr. A’s victims are coming forward, including two brothers who sued the school board, settling for a combined $6 million. As one of the plaintiff’s attorneys claims, more than a dozen survivors could be coming forward in the coming weeks — alleged victims of abuse that reportedly spanned nearly 15 years. And his supporters? Some have apologized to survivors; others are now silent. AT 66, MICHAEL GONZALES RESEMBLES a svelte Santa Claus, wiry and strong. But back in the 1970s, he was an eight-year-old with a high and tight haircut and a mischievous smile — a Dennis the Menace incarnate. He also believes he was likely Mr. A’s first victim. Joe and Mike Gonzales both say they were victims of Mr. A. Courtesy of the Gonzalez Family At the time, unconventional teaching was all the rage: field trips, dinners at teachers’ houses, ballgames — anything to get fidgety, bored students engaged. Mr. A embraced that educational style, even earning him a glowing piece in the local paper in 1971 about a class trip to dig fossils with a Columbia University professor. ”I spend so many hours with the kids outside the classroom because that’s when I truly get to see them as human beings,” he later told The New York Times . ”They’re more open then. I feel that if I get to know them, I can help them.” Unfortunately, it seems, those outings also allowed Mr. A unfettered access to his alleged victims, like Gonzales. “The bell rings for lunch, and he would put his arm out to prevent me from going out the classroom door, and that’s when the molestation started,” Gonzales says. He says Mr. A molested him until seventh grade, roughly 500 times, a claim also included in his lawsuit against the school board. “All the kids are out in the school yard playing, and I’m here being molested. That same scenario over and over again, but not just in the classroom…. That all started with me; that was his plan on how he gathered the kids. That was his master plan.” Gonzales’ brother, Joe, also says he became one of Mr. A’s victims at age six, when Michael went by the teacher’s house to rake leaves with his brother in tow. Michael didn’t find out until years later, but the experience nearly ruined both of the brothers’ lives. “I became a bully. I ruined friendships,” Michael says. “I came out of high school and I didn’t know how to read, because I couldn’t concentrate.” Joe, 60, turned to drinking at age 12; he was 35 days sober when we spoke. “I wasn’t born an alcoholic,” he says. “I was born a normal kid that was abused at five, six years old, and alcohol, it was a savior, and it is the love of my life.” The brothers’ pain only intensified in January of 1981, when an elementary school student publicly accused Mr. A of molestation. “I carried around that burden,” Michael says, his voice breaking. “Why didn’t I say something? It’s not what he did to me. These kids [that he may have abused], who knows if they’re even alive…. It’s just a total failure of humanity.” It didn’t help that the people of Leonia seemed firmly on Mr. A’s side back in 1981. When the child’s father paraded through the town center with a sign proclaiming the teacher’s guilt — then took the pulpit at the Presbyterian Church to do the same — he was charged with harassment, and endangering his child by keeping him out of school, and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to The New York Times . Mr. A wasn’t completely able to escape consequences. In spring of that year , following an investigation he was charged with molesting the student, pleaded guilty, and resigned. Still, by June, he’d changed his tune — especially after local parents had raised $7,500 for his defense. Mr. A then opted to retract his plea, claiming that he’d only fessed up to the crime to spare the child “emotional trauma.” The case then moved to state Superior Court, and in 1982, he was convicted of sexual assault. It may seem strange in 2025 that Leonia would stand by an alleged child abuser, but even the headlines of the day reflect a different time: “Leonia Parents Support Teacher in Morals Case,” trumpets one, while another article, titled “Supporting a Neighbor,” casts a benefit dinner at All Saints Episcopal Church as a heartwarming communion in support of a beloved educator. ”When Mr. A resigned,” one child said, according to the paper, “we got a teacher who just told us what to do and sat there. Mr. A said it was better to learn by experiencing things. We went to New York to the planetarium, to the World Trade Center, to the Statue of Liberty and other places. The class would go to his house for dinner and talk about what we’d seen.” According to the the Times, the local TV shop even put up an open letter from Mr. A thanking the town for its support — a sore point for Joe, who worked at the store. Paul King had to walk by that poster every day on his walk to school, silently seething. “Joe told me, ‘Every time I walked into that TV [store], I look at that effing poster,” he says. “I’m thinking, ‘I’ve been abused for over two years by this guy, like big time.’…It wasn’t, ‘You show me your weenie and I’ll show you mine,’ it was full-on physical touching and beyond.’ But nobody believed the kid.” King has not filed a suit. Michael was similarly enraged by the support. He was on leave from the Army when he heard the news of Mr. A’s conviction, and wracked with guilt and shame (and alcohol), he went to the man’s house with the intention of killing him. Mr. A let him into his condo, and after calling his lawyer or psychiatrist — Michael isn’t sure which — Michael changed his mind. “You know, it tortures me,” he says. “I could have went to jail. I could have ruined my whole life.” Even after Mr. A was convicted of sexual assault, the judgment was muted. He received only three years of probation and a $25 fine. “I don’t know what other punishment this man deserves,” the judge opined at the time, while Mr. A took the stand to tell the court: “I would rather cut off my right hand than harm a hair on a child. My love for children is genuine.” It’s not all that surprising, then, that Leonia received a glowing write-up in the infamous pedophile magazine, Pan, an underground publication about “boy love.” “He was indicted by a grand jury in October. But instead of running him out of town, as, sadly, often happens in such cases, the community rallied to his support,” the magazine said. “It must have occurred to more than one of the good parents at the All Saints Episcopal Church: John Anagnosti is a paedophile in the true sense of the word; he loves children, and whether or not there is a sexual expression of this love would not seem to be very important.” MR. A DIED IN 2020, BUT THE MEN never forgot him — or what he did. And, at the time, they suffered in silence, since neither King nor the Gonzaleses knew that they shared the same abuser. “I had lost my hope,” Michael says. “I’m going to the grave with the secret. …I’m laying in bed, and I see this commercial on TV, and it says if you were molested by a teacher in New Jersey or something or another, to call this number. I called the number.” The law firm from the commercial then connected Michael with Baldante & Rubenstein, which has seen a massive uptick in such cases since New Jersey, along with several other states, changed its statute of limitations for child sexual abuse survivors in 2019. Now, Michael and his brother could fight back. “When you sit down with these victims and they start to tell their story, oftentimes we’re the first person they’ve ever spoken to about it,” lawyer John Baldante says. He adds that 80 to 90 percent of their cases deal with sexual abuse cases. “They start crying like the eight- and 10-year old-children that they were when they were abused. … One of my clients once said, ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever spoken out on behalf of that 10-year-old version of myself.’” With Baldante’s help, Joe and Michael each sued the Leonia Township Board of Education, alleging that the school and board knew about Mr. A’s reported actions, but did nothing to stop them. “Despite such knowledge,” Michael’s suit reads, “[the school] failed to adequately respond to stop harassment…against the plaintiff.” The brothers garnered a combined $6 million in separate settlements in 2024. Still, according to Michael’s daughter, Keegan, “this lawsuit wasn’t a payday. It was acknowledgement that something horrific happened, and the school system failed these kids. The story does not end here. We’re going to continue speaking about this, because this goes beyond compensation. We want people’s stories to be heard.” To date, Baldante says several other men have come forward with similar stories about Mr. A, and he expects there will be many more. The firm is in the process of working up further litigation. “There’s no question that there’s undoubtedly hundreds [of victims],” he claims. “Mr. A was the Pied Piper.” Although stressing that there are only three cases of litigation currently pending against the teacher and school board, Baldante says “in the context of cases against a single perpetrator within a public school Board of Education, the claims against Mr. A are evolving into one of the largest clusters of claims.” AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THAT city council meeting. Through a series of happenstances, Keegan met the younger Paul King, and they figured out that both their fathers claim to have been victims of Mr. A — right before the Gonzaleses and another alleged survivor, Daniel Schlademan, were due to speak at the meeting on June 17. In light of more and more alleged victims coming forward, the men planned to address the Board of Education, calling on them to take steps to bring closure and comfort to the victims, as well as concrete moves to ensure the safety of the town’s children in the future. Daniel Schlademan created a website so Mr. A’s victims could come forward. Courtesy of Dan Schlademan King joined them, and, one by one, they emptied their hearts in that ugly municipal board room. The men acknowledged that the school board is populated by far different people than it was 50 years ago, but they still want justice — and recognition of systemic failure. “The Leonia school district dismissed the reports of sexual abuse made by students and tried to sweep Anagnosti’s predatory conduct under the carpet,” says the lawyer, Baldante. “Unfortunately, these efforts by Leonia only compounded the problem.” “The Leonia School District is currently involved in active litigation related to these matters, and therefore we cannot provide specific comments,” said Daniel Lee, President of Leonia Board of Education. “That said, our lack of direct response to the public comments on this matter must not be mistaken for indifference to the pleas of those who have come forward. We recognize how painful these issues may be for victims, their families, and the wider community. We take this concern very seriously. The Board’s goal is always to foster a safe, supportive environment, and we are mindful of the role we can play in the healing process. At this moment, however, our legal and ethical responsibilities require restraint to avoid jeopardizing the district or those it serves now and in the future.” In a 2022 filing, the BOE denied “any wrongdoing or negligence,” adding: “The Board did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the allegations of sexual misconduct of Defendant John Anagnosti. The Board did not enable any alleged sexual abuse and the Board did not fail to take action with regards to any alleged sexual abuse.” Now, all the men can do is wait. Wait for the school board to listen to them. Wait for more people to come forward. Schlademan created a website in May outlining the town’s history with Mr. A called Voices of Leonia ; he’s currently fighting his own legal battle against the school board and declined to be interviewed for this article. Meanwhile, Baldante is interviewing more survivors of Mr. A in preparation for future lawsuits. And the Gonzaleses? They’re just continuing to heal. “It’s so important to me that this story is told,” Michael says. “Everybody’s at fault here — full circle. I’ve been disappointed so many times. This guy is a monster and nobody paid attention.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/teacher-sexual-assault-new-jersey-lawsuit-1235446051,Entertainment,Washington Post,Brenna Ehrlich,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leonia-NJ-Pedophile-teacher_FINAL.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00,349292459e8ca46004b7f6c039015cbbe299bbd5
22f146345c0c,‘Pokémon Legends: Z-A’ Is a Middling Evolution for a Franchise in Need of Saving,,"The world’s biggest media franchise has been evolving. Since transitioning to 3D graphics with Pokémon X and Y (2013), the mainline series had stumbled through a period of stagnation — their eight gyms, each tackled in a specific order ending up in a showdown with the elite four, has become stale to fans. Pokémon Legends: Z-A (out Oct. 16), a sequel to X and Y , is the third of a few attempts to shake things up, following Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (2022) and Pokémon Legends: Arceus (2022). The Nintendo Switch era has been turbulent for the franchise, to put it mildly. Fan frustration finds a new target with each new release, whether it was the bland and forgettable nature of Sword and Shield (2019), the poor technical performance of Legends: Arceus or the unforgivable buggy mess that Scarlet and Violet were upon release. For the developers at Game Freak, their greatest achievement would be not providing fans with a comically large stick to beat the latest entry with. Boasting a brand new battle system and a compelling alternative to the gym challenge, Legends: Z-A succeeds at making a Pokémon game with its own flavor, but frustratingly stumbles over some familiar hurdles. The dream of a modern Pokémon experience we can call great without heavy qualification remains elusive. Throwing Chaos into the Pokémon Battle Much like its predecessor in the Legends sub-series, Z-A looks to redefine the Pokémon battle . Arceus took the route of allowing the player to manipulate the order of the turn-based combat, something that had operated on a strict “their turn, my turn” basis in the mainline games. This allowed for more dynamic clashes, aided by compelling, unique animations. Z-A takes the dynamism of its battles to the extreme, discarding the turn-based nature of it entirely and opting for fast and chaotic action, a shift that longtime fans will take a bit of time to adapt to. There are no turns, it’s about getting as many attacks off as possible and draining the opponent’s health points (HP) before they can land a fatal blow. The first few battles are a disorienting experience. Before the player can figure out how to even select their attacks, the opponent has removed a chunk of their HP through a move that could burst flames, water or psychic energy across the screen. It’s impossible to know where to look. Pokémon muscle memory will have experienced gamers take some time to pick a move and watch their partner execute it. Real-time battles can be chaotic and require recalibrating how the player approaches combat. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company In Z-A , by the time that process is complete, the Pokémon’s HP could be halved and attack power weakened. Keeping track of what both Pokémon are doing, each of their health bars, the animations for each attack and the battle log (which shows whether or not attacks have landed) takes a long time to get used to. It may take a few hours of playtime but when this action-based battle system clicks, it feels amazing to play out. Not only does the player start to understand where to look and when, but they’ll start to see the depth of strategy in the game. Z-A splits moves into short range and long range attacks. To execute the move Tackle, the Pokémon will have to go right up to its opponent to deliver the blow, leaving it at risk of being countered immediately. On the other hand, Hyper Beam can deliver its might from far enough that the opponent will have to reposition themselves before attacking. Balancing things are cooldown times, meaning Tackle can be used every four seconds, but Hyper Beam will take 12 seconds before it can be used again. The player is forced to make risk-reward judgments on the fly, which is especially stressful in battles with Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon as well as Alpha Pokémon . The latter is a concept taken from Legends: Arceus describing huge Pokémon that have gone wild and aim their attacks at the trainer instead of their Pokémon. The same goes for Rogue Megas, except they take on an enhanced form, specialized to each Pokémon species, as introduced as the main gimmick in Pokémon X and Y . Having these giant beasts run straight past the Pokémon they should be fighting and directly at the player character (whose outfit they spent a lot of in-game money on) can be used to their advantage. Because of how much enemy Pokémon move around in Z-A , it’s very common for long range attacks to miss, almost like setting up a cannon to fire at a moving target. But by drawing the enemy Pokémon to the trainer, it gives the partner Pokémon a steady target to unleash its Flamethrower or Ice Beam at. Z-A Royale takes over the city each night with new trainers to face. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Mastery over battles will see trainers speed up the ranks of the Z-A Royale, a tournament unique to Lumiose City (where the entire game is played). The Z-A Royale stands in for the gym challenge and offers a fun, refreshing alternative. Every night the city is bathed in neon red as a purge-like event begins. Trainers will spot the main character in the street and begin battles on the fly, desperate to achieve A Rank and shape Lumiose in whichever sick and twisted way they want. Players skilled at raising strong Pokémon (or farming Rare Candies) should hardly have trouble clearing every battle they come across in Lumiose, which is why the Z-A Royale includes Bonus Cards. Tasks like “Sneak up on an opponent using only Flying-type moves,” or “Only defeat opponents with a higher rank than you,” offer bonus points that can help the protagonist get to the next rank more quickly. It remains engaging and exciting almost every time dusk falls over the city, whether the player is participating in the Royale or just trying to get on with whichever side quest they’re preoccupied with. A Walkable Open World Z-A follows the tradition set by Arceus and continued by Scarlet and Violet by being another open world game, but its approach to the genre differs from the industry standard in one significant way — traversal. In many open world games, Pokémon included, the protagonist gains different modes of traversal as they go along. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild , Link can paraglide and ride a horse. In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 , Peter Parker and Miles Morales can run, swing, or wind-glide through New York. In Legends: Z-A , the only way to get around (other than fast travel) is to walk. Lumiose City is self-contained but doesn’t provide much reason to explore on foot. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Being set in a single city means that the world isn’t so expansive that it would be a massive chore to walk everywhere, and Game Freak’s intention is for the player to get distracted on their way by a side quest or an item or a Pokémon to catch. As underwhelming Lumiose ends up being when measured against the expectation of a bustling metropolis like that of Pokémon Black and White’ s Castelia City, there is never a shortage of things to do in between main missions. However, with the load times being as short as they are on Switch 2 , it always feels more convenient to fast-travel past them, which is a failure of open world design. Fast travel is an option in Marvel’s Spider-Man , but nobody wants to miss out on how good it feels to swing through New York, even if their destination is on the other side of the map. The visceral feeling of it is what puts gamers in the shoes of the main character, clicking a button and appearing in a different region can break the immersion. The greatest asset of Z-A ’s open world are the Wild Zones, areas where the untamed Pokémon of Lumiose are cornered off in an attempt to craft a city where both species can co-exist. Wild Zones are time sinks, places where hours can be drained away, their greatness owed to a mechanic ripped straight from Arceus where catching Pokémon feels like landing consecutive headshots in Call of Duty . The same trigger the player would use to shoot a gun is used to throw Poké Balls at unsuspecting monsters, and there’s never been a mechanic in a Pokémon game that feels as immersive. It’s not unique to Z-A , but the game is stronger for including it. Wild Zones are the only areas where Pokémon can be caught naturally (by pelting them in the head). Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Many of Z-A ’s weaker moments have to do with its visuals, something the series has never gotten right since going 3D. While Arceus was a cool interpretation of an ancient world, shooting for a grainy, chalky style, Z-A has no real visual flare to speak of. It’s a game that looks to present information rather than do anything truly inspiring. Z-A never drifts into the realm of unbearable bugs as Scarlet and Violet did (on Switch 2 anyway), the worst offenders being the odd jittery animation in the distance and some noticeable pop-in. The lack of voice acting is another old problem that rears its head here, cut scenes depict characters awkwardly flapping their mouths to complete silence, robbing the plot of whatever drama it has. Nintendo fans have gotten used to the company’s other flagship franchises like Mario , Zelda , and Donkey Kong reaching euphoric heights during the Switch era and are looking to Game Freak to deliver the same. There’s an expectation that a cash magnet as large as Pokémon could invest more in making bolder and more exciting games, but that popularity is its prison. Pokémon ’s power comes from constantly being in the zeitgeist with a new product out regularly, conditions anathema to innovation. Evolution is incremental and Legends: Z-A is as significant as those increments can be within the confines of Game Freak’s condensed release schedule. It builds an exciting new battle system, maintains a dynamic gameplay loop and expands the lore around a beloved part of the universe. This will be enough to top the eshop charts, sell out stores and recover some of the reputation damage from Scarlet and Violet’ s botched launch. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Game Freak is capable of delivering a complete package. At this point, the Pokémon franchise remains one still desperately in need of saving.

c3a13f598a96,Barack Obama Offers Marc Maron Political and Professional Advice on ‘WTF’ Finale,,"Marc Maron has dropped the 1,686th and final episode of his long-running WTF podcast, with former President Barack Obama returning for Maron’s last interview. Maron managed to keep the identity of his last guest a secret until the episode dropped Monday morning, Oct. 13. In introducing Obama — who famously appeared on the show 10 years ago — Maron described him as the perfect person to help him bring WTF to a close. As Maron said in his intro: “I do a lot of talking about how I feel about the world , both interior and exterior; micro, macro; what’s going on in me, how am I reacting to what’s going on in the world. And it became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular. In that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we’re living in, as frightening as it is, with what’s happening. And how do we do it with some grace, and perhaps some hope and some focus, and really call what’s going on what it is. And that guest is President Barack Obama.” While Obama came to Maron’s house for their 2015 chat, this time Maron visited the former president at his office in Washington, D.C. During the conversation, the pair spoke at length about Trump, the state of the Democratic Party, the weaponization of the justice system, and prominent institutions like universities and law firms kowtowing to the current administration. “We have blown through, just in the last six months, a whole range of not simply assumptions, but rules and laws and practices that were put in place to ensure that nobody is above the law, and that we don’t use the federal government to simply reward our friends and punish our enemies,” Obama said. He added that “people are right to be concerned,” but said that just like during the McCarthy era and at other contentious points in American history, “What’s required in these situations is a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks. And then more people stand up and go like, ‘Yeah, no, that’s not who we are. That’s not our idea of America.’” Maron also took the opportunity to ask Obama for some advice — not just on how to navigate this moment politically, but also personally. He asked the former president how he contended with the weight of leaving his biggest job ever, with Obama recalling some advice he got at the time: “Don’t rush into what the next thing is.” He continued, “Take a beat and take some satisfaction. Looking back and saying, ‘You know what, didn’t get everything done that I wanted; it wasn’t always exactly how I planned it, but there’s a body of work there that I’m proud of.’” Following the interview, Maron said he hoped the interview was “helpful,” while also calling it an “honor” to interview Obama again. He then signed off for the last time, thanking fans for all their support, the numerous people who’d helped him put on the show, and, lastly, his beloved cats, especially all those who’d passed away. “Cat angels everywhere,” Maron said as the show drew to a close.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/barack-obama-wtf-last-episode-barack-obama-interview-1235445889,Entertainment,Washington Post,Jon Blistein,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2188444363.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-13T14:15:45+00:00,c18ffbcd0bbf7d5f60474b90f79e74c001c7ba40
b48bea4c9b21,7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’,,"7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’ From deep dives into the notorious killer to explorations of Psycho and the Holocaust, learn the real history behind Ryan Murphy’s Netflix hit Producer Ryan Murphy loves to blur the line between fact and fiction , and there’s no shortage of that in his most recent entry, Monster: The Ed Gein Story . Ostensibly, the eight-part Netflix show is about Gein (played by Charlie Hunnam), a small-town Wisconsin farmer who was discovered in 1957 to have killed at least two women, grave-robbed several others, and used their remains to make grotesque clothing and decor for his home. His story became national news, and even after he was sent to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life, it inspired young writers and filmmakers to create the archetype for modern horror: the monster hidden among us. In Monster , Murphy explores this idea by including dramatized scenes of the making of some of these films, including Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs . He also includes the fantasies Gein might have had about Ilse Koch, a Nazi who was accused of using the skin of her death camp victims to make lampshades and bind books. And like any good true crime series, the show leaves viewers wanting to know more. So, instead of spending hours scrolling and searching the web, we’ve curated seven podcasts that delve into the stories explored in Monster: The Ed Gein Story. The Compendium Podcast: Ed Gein: Monster, Murderer, and the Real Story Behind Hollywood’s Nightmares For a story like that of Ed Gein, whose crimes have become so deeply ingrained in American culture that they can sometimes be hard to see, it’s beneficial to have an outsider’s perspective. The Compendium Podcast is a little newer than a lot of the podcasts on this list — it launched in 2023 — but it’s done a good job establishing itself among a growing number of nerdy British buddy podcasts (check out The Rest Is History if you want the OG) by publishing well researched deep dives on everything from Ocean Gate and Heavens Gate to Princess Diana and Roald Dahl. In this episode, co-host Adam Cox walks the listener through the story, while co-host Kyle Risi offers reactions on Gein, his crimes, and the films he inspired. Last Podcast on the Left: Ed Gein Last Podcast on the Left is one of the longest-running comedy-true crime shows out there (quite possibly the only one). The hosts’ casual rapport can sometimes feel at odds with the seriousness of the crimes that they’re discussing, but the schtick of the show — one friend explaining a crime to a group of friends, a now-common premise they helped establish back in 2011 — works well with a crime like Gein’s, where there’s so much myth and rumor to discuss. Some points in this three-part series can feel a little dated (it was made in 2015, after all), but overall, it’s a detailed, deep dive into a complicated subject made by a group of podcasters at the top of their game. You’re Wrong About: Ed Gein and Slasher Movies For this episode of the excellent series You’re Wrong About , co-hosts Sarah Marshall and Michael Hobbes not only give a nice dive into Gein’s story, but use it as a jumping-off point to discuss horror cinema. Going down the rabbit hole on topics like America’s mid-century obsession with Freud, how 1970s horror films reflected changing opinions of the Vietnam War, and the transphobic message at the heart of Silence of the Lambs , it opens up new lines of thought in Monster ’s other story: that of Gein’s affect on American art. (If you’re curious about the themes explored in Monster ’s final episode, you might also check out Y ou’re Wrong About: Mindhunting where Marshall dives into the world of criminal profiling.) Unspooled: Psycho Unspooled , hosted by actor Paul Scheer ( The League, Black Monday ) and L.A. Times film critic Amy Nicholson, launched in 2018, initially working its way through the American Film Institute’s 100 best films of all time. Though they’ve long since branched out, on that original list was Psycho , clocking in at number 14. In this episode, Scheer and Nicholson only briefly touch on Gein himself, instead focusing more on a critical exploration of the film. But their discussions of the film — along with an interview with Alexandre O. Philippe, director of 78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene , a documentary entirely about that cinematic murder — reveal how important this work was in the history of film. Inside Psycho Wonder’s eight-part series Inside Psycho, which came out in 2017, follows the formula of a lot of that podcast production company’s early shows: Told chronologically, with a cinematic, omnipotent perspective, it goes through the production of the film, from inspiration through its effect on Psycho director Alfred Hitchcock’s life and career. Although only the first episode focuses on Gein himself, the podcast delves into the nitty-gritty of how writer Robert Bloch used his knowledge of the case to write his novel, Psycho , and the adaptation took on Hitchcock and the film’s star, Anthony Perkins. Murphy took a lot of liberties in his dramatization of this in Monster , but this podcast gets closer to the truth. The Holocaust History Podcast: The Trials of Ilse Koch with Tomaz Jardim Hosted by historian Dr. Waitman Wade Beorn, The Holocaust History Podcast is a serious and sobering look at the Nazi regime during World War II. In this episode, he sits down with fellow historian Dr. Tomaz Jardim, author of Ilse Koch on Trial: Making the ‘Bitch of Buchenwald,’ to separate truth from fiction around this larger-than-life Nazi villain. While they take care to remind the listener that Koch was a full-blown Nazi who was morally complicit in the atrocities, they get past the layers of the caricature she became after the war, particularly the allegations that she used the skin of Jewish victims to make lampshades and bind books. That cartoonish figure is what Gein would have read about — and what Murphy shows in Monster — but they show that hers was a more mundane evil, and one shared by many wives of the Nazis in power. Morbid: Ed Gein What’s a podcast list without a couple of women who call their beloved fans “Weirdos” and chat about true crime? Sisters Alaina Urquhart and Ash Kelley host this long-running podcast, breaking Gein’s story into three parts: His life and upbringing (they have particularly harsh words for his mom); his crimes and capture; and his life after conviction and legacy. Unlike some other chatty podcast series, Urquhart and Kelley go through the story with empathy and care, and often cite their sources. Like many of the podcasts on this list, they rely heavily on Harold Schechter’s 1989 book Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho .",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/monster-ed-gein-podcast-1235444428,Entertainment,Washington Post,Elisabeth Garber-Paul,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T15:00:00+00:00,3fdddc23f3e0caacb92bcea4c8dbb8e43dab054a
38a180547215,The 20 Best NES Games of All Time,,"The 20 Best NES Games of All Time From duck and vampire hunts to boxing and football sims, these are the titles that made the Nintendo Entertainment System legendary It was in October of 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System first hit North America, with an initial test run of 100,000 units being sold exclusively in New York City. Following the post-Atari video game market crash of 1983, no one was sure if there’d even be an appetite for yet another new digital toy to connect to the TV. But after the massive reception to the device and launch titles like Baseball and Duck Hunt , the potential was clear. It was a new era of gaming, and the Japanese company Nintendo was leading the charge. Within that first month, Super Mario Bros. also arrived, later becoming a pack-in title for the nationwide release of the NES the following year. With its killer app firmly established, the NES would begin its pop culture takeover that lasted well into the Nineties, amounting to a nearly 62 million units sold across all regions — a success so big, it’s credited with saving the home console market altogether. And although it was powerful enough for its time and introduced several hardware gimmicks (the NES Zapper is a stroke of genius), the NES’ legacy will always be defined by its downright ludicrous library of software. On top of its own first-party games like Mario , Metroid , and The Legend of Zelda , the OG Nintendo console was home to fledgling franchises from external partners like Konami, Capcom, and Tecmo — all of whom worked symbiotically (and at times antagonistically) with the Big N. Dragon Quest , Final Fantasy , Ninja Gaiden ; so many of today’s gaming dynasties began on the NES. It can be tough to narrow down which of the console’s games are its best. While nostalgia plays a factor, it’s just a fact that much of its lineup feels dated to play today. But looking back, there’s an astonishing number of NES releases that hold up to modern standards, and even the ones that may feel rough around the edges retain an undeniable impact. A bona fide classic can always be measured by how much you love it, even when it’s a pain in the ass to play. So, from groundbreaking platformers to slick shooters, these are the best NES games of all time. ‘Tecmo Super Bowl’ Image Credit: Tecmo Although most folks love RPGs or action-packed shooters, it’s impossible to understate the impact of sport games as a cultural juggernaut. There’s just something spectacular about bridging the gap between the cult of IRL sports with playable fantasy. The NES arrived with a handful of big ones like the bluntly named Baseball and Tennis , but 1989’s Tecmo Bowl brought it to another level. The first console game to officially strike a licensing agreement with the NFL Players Association, Tecmo’s sports sim let players control real athletes like Jerry Rice and Joe Montana to compete in the living room. Its sequel, Tecmo Super Bowl, upped the ante by also licensing the official team names, making for the most authentic football experience on the NES. Tecmo Super Bowl may feel rudimentary now, but the progenitor to franchises like Madden continued to be popular for decades thanks to an obsessive modding community that updated the game’s roster each season to give it an exponential afterlife. ‘Bionic Commando’ Image Credit: Capcom A key part of platforming games is the ability to jump, but Capcom’s Bionic Commando offers an alternative by letting players swing like Spider-Man using the protagonist’s robot arm. The game is challenging — especially during the learning curve of mastering the mechanics of grabbing, swinging, and climbing — but once it clicks, there’s few titles quite like it. Due to the angles required by the swinging system, Bionic Commando was one of the first games to emphasize eight-way aiming, although it’s limited to the grapple feature. Later entries would include the ability to shoot more directions and (thankfully) extend the arm mid-air, but the original remains a feat of ingenuity at a time when action-platformers were cementing their foundations. In a crowded field, Bionic Commando stands apart. ‘Blaster Master’ Image Credit: Sunsoft One of gaming’s greatest blessings is just how stupid a story can be as justification for the action. Sunsoft’s Blaster Master opens with a cinematic sequence that depicts a young man named Jason, whose pet frog breaks free and dives into a hole in the ground. Obviously, Jason follows and discovers a giant battle tank — which he immediately commandeers to slay a race of subterranean mutants. After its bizarre setup, Blaster Master quickly sets into one of the most kinetic experiences ever developed for the NES. Jason’s tank is extremely agile, allowing players to move quickly, jump nimbly, and aim freely in multiple directions. Each of its eight labyrinthine levels are dense with areas to explore, and the action remains constant. The mobile mech controls of Blaster Master feel so smooth, you’d almost be convinced they’re from a later era, feeling like the natural predecessor to contemporary mech-suit series like Armored Core . ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project’ Image Credit: Konami Although arcades were the true home of early beat ‘em ups, early consoles like the NES had their fair share too. One such gem was the NES-exclusive Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project , which arrived in 1991 just when turtle mania was at its apex. With controls based on the previous entry, which itself was built off the coin-up arcade version of TMNT , The Manhattan Project is a mechanically streamlined gauntlet of ass-kicking. The game can be played solo or as a pair and features the ability to toggle on and off friendly fire (depending on how much you want to agitate your siblings). Like other TMNT games, each level is filled with an array of baddies from the animated series like Bebop and Rocksteady, as well as many iterations of Foot Clan soldiers, all of which have unique abilities based on their colors. While its SNES sequel, Turtles in Time may be heralded as the best in the series, The Manhattan Project is a high point for NES-era beat ‘em ups. ‘Excitebike’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the best-selling games for the NES, Excitebike has one hell of a legacy. Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto for its 1984 Japanese release, the motocross racing game wasn’t just extremely well-designed in its own right, but its systems would influence other titles across genres for generations. Most directly, its 2D side-scrolling controls were adapted for Super Mario Bros ., giving the lead character his trademark inertia-building energy while running and jumping. Later on, its DNA could be felt in everything from Wave Race 64 to Flappy Bird , where strategically holding a button to gain altitude and angling the correct pitch for landing is key. But even if it hadn’t been so influential, Excitebike would still just be a damned fun game that holds up exceptionally well today. Dodging between lanes and correcting timing a jump boost is exhilarating, and the desire to best your own time always warrants another lap. ‘Super Dodge Ball’ Image Credit: CSG Imagesoft Long before the Ben Stiller movie introduced the idea of dodging a wrench as training for dodgeball, this spin-off of the River City game series made the gym class sport into a brutal proposition. Players control a six-man squad of ballers, with three populating the infield and another three surrounding the opposing team on the fringes of the court. Balls can be thrown plainly, but by initiating a sprint and properly timing the pitch, a superpowered special beans the opponent hard enough to propel them into the invisible walls. Like many games of the era, the visuals are janky. There’s almost never a moment when one or more characters are fully visible, constantly flickering and clipping in and out of frame. Yet the gameplay is smooth, precise, and surprisingly deep in its complexity. Traveling the world to conquer the dodgeball league is fun, but the real treat is the “bean ball” mode that boils the action down to a six-man free-for-all in a schoolyard where there are no rules or borders — only the ball and your killer instinct. ‘StarTropics’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the few titles developed for the NES to never be released in Japan, StarTropics is a strange mash-up of RPG exploration and dungeon-crawling that feels like multiple games blended into one. The story follows a 15-year-old named Mike Jones who is visiting his archaeologist uncle on a tropical island. After his uncle goes missing, Mike must follow the clues gleaned from conversations with various townspeople that lead into different multi-level dungeons filled with puzzles to solve and creatures to beat with his trusty yo-yo and baseball-inspired kit. At times, it feels like Zelda , with shades of Final Fantasy , but the game oddly shares much of its DNA with the Japanese-only release, Mother (1989), which also followed a boy armed with a yo-yo and baseball bat for a fantasy adventure. StarTropics ultimately spawned just one sequel, but its genre-mixing premise and lush environments would make for a great modern revival, should Nintendo be so inclined. ‘R.C. Pro-Am’ Image Credit: Rare You’d think that the best racing game on the NES would involve high-power motorcycles or spaceships, but in truth, all that’s needed is a set of remote-controlled cars. Developed by Rare well before they reinvented Donkey Kong on the SNES , R.C. Pro-Am is an inventive take on top-down racing that wringed every ounce of power out of its console for finely tuned controls and solid physics. The game is played from a three-quarter perspective rather than from the rear of the cars, making it possible to turn in a full 360 degrees — often by mistake. The POV is distinct, forcing you to focus on the track’s many curves and anticipate the positioning needed, but it’s generous in how easily one can course correct a miscalculation. Instead of leaning into speed or hazards on the horizon, the rally vibe of Pro-Am offer a different way to race that’s surprisingly enthralling despite its quaintness. ‘Duck Hunt’ Image Credit: Nintendo Duck Hunt needs little introduction. One of the key launch titles for the NES’ North American market, its appeal is obvious. Utilizing the Zapper peripheral, it brought shooting gallery games from arcades and bars to people’s homes, and became a sensation so big, it was paired with Super Mario Bros. in a single cartridge as the must-have Nintendo games for many years. Its concept is simple: players aim the handheld gun at their CRT screen (it unfortunately doesn’t work with modern flatscreens) and shoot either flying ducks or play pigeons round after round in carnival game fashion. It’s a lizard-brained kind of pleasure, and is enjoyable at any skill level — although children of the Eighties likely have memories of being scolded for sitting too close to the TV. (Not cheating!) ‘Life Force’ Image Credit: Konami A spin-off of the Gradius series, Life Force (called Salamander in Japan) is a classic side-scrolling spaceship shooter where players must battle waves of flying baddies and constant environmental hazards, powering themselves up with pick-ups along the way. While Gradius itself is the bigger name and would be worthy of inclusion on any list, Life Force is the superior choice for numerous reasons. Firstly, the game is more forgiving, allowing players to bounce back from death right where they fell rather than being sent back to an arbitrary checkpoint. Secondly, its power-up system is streamlined, and allows multiple items to be combined to create an insane arsenal. Fully playable in co-op, Life Force is one of the best two-person games available for the NES. ‘Punch-Out!!’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the most instantly recognizable names from the NES era, Punch-Out!! has seen multiple re-releases that will quickly pinpoint when someone picked up the game. The 1987 version featured then-World Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as its final boss, with a later 1990 release swapping out the at-times problematic (and pricey to license) real-life figure for the fictional creation, Mr. Dream. Adapted from Nintendo’s own arcade series, Punch-Out!! is arguably the best boxing game ever made. While it lacks the realism and depth of more contemporary franchises, its emphasis on rhythm and learning an opponent’s weakness was brilliant for the time. Aside from the entry-level fighter Glass Joe, bouts demand a deft balance of stamina management and reading each person’s tells, with specific behavior and character animations indicating when it’s time to dodge or strike, and in which direction. Endlessly playable, it’s a franchise that’s come and gone throughout Nintendo’s history, and there’s never a bad time to bring it back. ‘Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation’ Image Credit: Square Enix The NES as a platform was ground zero for numerous iconic roleplaying games like Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem , but the best of the bunch was Dragon Warrior ( Dragon Quest in Japan). The Americanized title has fallen by the wayside in recent years as Dragon Quest became more popular globally, and the third entry is considered by many to be the essential starting point. Featuring artwork from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama , and RPG mechanics that will be familiar to fans of tabletop and video games of all eras, Dragon Quest III may look visually modest, but it plays extremely well. With a sprawling open world that allows for non-linear exploration, a heavily detailed class system that lets new recruits choose their abilities, and an epic fantasy narrative, Dragon Quest III is the definitive NES RPG. ‘Contra’ Image Credit: Konami One look at Contra ’s box art will tell you that it’s going for peak late-Eighties machismo. Equal parts Rambo , Predator , and Aliens , the run and gun side-scrolling shooter pits players as meathead commandos Bill Rizer or Lance Bean (or both in co-op) on a jungle mission to wipe out an alien army. Some stages scroll left-to-right while others move vertically, but the game’s greatest strength is its kinetic set pieces where big enemies arrive at scripted intervals to fuck things up. While many shooters of the era can feel clunky, Contra remains slick, with players easily able to drop between different layers of each level and drop prone to dodge incoming projectiles. Its weapons upgrade system is straightforward, requiring just simple item pickups to suddenly give the commandos spinning flamethrowers and big-balled shotgun blasts. Even though it’s been iterated on countless times, the original Contra is the ultimate form of dumb fun. ‘Metroid’ Image Credit: Nintendo Although Nintendo’s early work was mostly rooted in cheery cartoon aesthetics, one game stood out as something decidedly darker. Heavily influenced by Ridley Scott’s Alien , Metroid dropped players into a desolate world with little direction and even less hope. Players take on the role of Samus Aran, a lethal bounty hunter on the trail of a faction of space pirates who are harboring a mysterious biological weapon (spoiler: it’s a metroid!). Although it might feel like a chore to play for many today, the original Metroid popularized a dizzying amount of video game mechanics and tropes that’re currently employed in games like Hollow Knight and even 3D series like Elden Ring . Samus starts extremely weak, with minimal abilities to traverse the mazelike terrain. Inching along chamber-by-chamber (and hopefully drawing a map), players must find new tools that will open up blocked paths in older areas. While its SNES sequel would perfect these ideas, the first game is no slouch, and is every bit worth revisiting, if only to see an early vision of gaming’s present. ‘Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse’ Image Credit: Konami It’s an odd trend in the NES era where the third entry of certain franchises ends up being chronologically a prequel, as is the case with Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse . While the second game in the series leaned more heavily into RPG elements, Dracula’s Curse reverted to a more straightforward action-heavy approach, letting players explore multiple branching paths but always solving problems with a simple crack of the whip. A first for the series, the game stars multiple protagonists that can be swapped on the fly: vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, sorceress Sypha Belnades, pirate Grant Danasty, and Alucard — the dhampir son of Dracula himself. With a rich gothic atmosphere and moody soundtrack, Castlevania III is among the most aesthetically pleasing titles for the NES, and one of the most rewarding to play. Its story was recently adapted into Netflix’s Castlevania anime series, driving many to go back to explore its 8-bit origins. ‘Ninja Gaiden’ Image Credit: Koei Tecmo During the Seventies and Eighties, ninjas were all the rage. Obviously, the shadowy warriors would inspire waves of video games, among the best of which was the Ninja Gaiden series. Tecmo’s side-scrolling action series was acclaimed at the time for its then-cutting edge cinematic cutscenes, which told the narrative in animated sequences preceding each stage. In action, the game’s action is razor-sharp and its platforming is innovative, letting players cling to walls and bounce between tiers with the agility of a shinobi. Compared to its contemporaries, Ninja Gaiden ’s combat is surgical, allowing the hero Ryu to strike down foes with a single slice, although they continually regenerate and can become quickly overwhelming. It can be extremely tough to best all 20 levels, but for those up to the challenge, Ninja Gaiden is a perfect slice of retro action gaming. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of Nintendo’s most prolific franchises, The Legend of Zelda has a long history of delivering some of the greatest games of all time . But it all began with the NES original, which presented many players with their first experience with a truly open world to explore. Starring the elf-eared hero Link, the game is all about discovery as users trek through the various biomes of Hyrule, stumbling across dungeons and secret chambers that house crucial items to reach new areas and combat enemies. The game’s open-ended environment is miraculous given the limitations of the NES, but it begins to make sense once players figure out the world’s grid-like regions. For many, the only way to solve its mysteries was to use a physical map, scribbling solutions, theories, and X’s to mark each critical spot. The NES was home to a multitude of grandiose fantasy adventures, but none were as legendary as Zelda . ‘Super Mario Bros.’ Image Credit: Nintendo There will never be another game like the first Super Mario Bros . While the NES debuted with a full lineup of bangers, the 1985 platformer blew the lid off the industry when it arrived, quickly being retrofitted as the pack-in title that warranted the purchase of the console itself. It was the Nintendo game, and in many ways, it still is. Designed by the maestro behind most of the company’s early classics, Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario Bros. plucked the playable hero from 1981’s Donkey Kong arcade game and gave him a complete overhaul. Firstly, he got a name (Mario!), as well as a brother (Luigi!), but most importantly, he gained the distinct ability to run and jump with extreme precision. Over the years, most players have completely memorized the various stages of the game to the point where you can see it with eyes closed, but it’s to the game’s credit that even if you (somehow) never tried it, it’s insanely easy to learn. Forty years after its release, Super Mario Bros . plays like a dream, with an incredible sense of momentum and tight control. And on top of inspiring thousands of games throughout decades, it almost singlehandedly saved gaming as the crown jewel of a console whose phenomenal popularity reinvigorated the industry. ‘Mega Man 2’ Image Credit: Capcom There’s something to be said for the value of player choice, and Capcom’s Mega Man series is built on the simple conceit of letting people pick how they want to tackle its challenges. At the start of each attempt, you’re presented with a list of eight levels to choose from, each with their own environmental theme and a special boss at the end. The hitch is that each of the bad guys can be more easily thwarted by another one’s abilities (which Mega Man himself gains after killing them). Which way do you start? What’s the ideal flowchart for beating them all? Sometimes, it just boils down to which ones you’re able to defeat. Mega Man 2 is the series’ best installment, famously perfecting the run and gun gameplay introduced by its predecessor while improving the level design. If Mario lets players rely on twitchy response time and frequently forgiving physics, Mega Man is all about methodical progression. Each level introduces entirely new elements, like conveyer belts of conflicting speeds and opposite trajectories that demand measured timing to traverse while being assailed by robots. The arc of the game is deeply memorable, a Jacob’s Ladder-like ascension through all levels into the endgame, which consists of a sequence of linear stages plus a second round with every one of the previous bosses. It’s a grueling gauntlet, but Mega Man 2 lives at the nexus of stellar action and platforming perfection. ‘Super Mario Bros. 3’ Image Credit: Nintendo How Nintendo managed to one-up its flagship title remains a marvel. The first attempt to create direct sequel to Super Mario Bros. was famously a bust. While the Japanese attempt mostly amounted to a more difficult expansion ( The Lost Levels ), the American one was literally a reskin of an entirely different game with the newly popular characters swapped in. Neither hit the mark, and for the third installment, Nintendo needed to think bigger. Super Mario Bros. 3 took everything the original did so well and exponentially upped the ante. Its levels are compact, dense with increasingly complex physical puzzles of dexterity whose solutions are taught organically in motion. Its visuals are lively; the many regions of the Mushroom Kingdom all feel distinct and packed to the brim with personality. The power-ups, from the Fire Flower to the Tanooki Suit, all give players an edge without making them helpless by losing them. While the 1985 game introduced the characters and world, it was Super Mario Bros 3. that cemented countless staples of the franchise that continue today. The world map lets players choose which routes to take between levels and provided bonus stages to hoarding items. The addition of new powerups let Mario take to the sky with the Super Leaf or throw projectiles in the Hammer Suit. Each of Bowser’s children, the Koopalings, provided a different threat as regional bosses rather than being different flavors of the same old thing. Generations later, gaming doesn’t get much better than Super Mario Bros. 3 . Despite its vintage, it’s a guaranteed joy to pick up and play, no matter how many times you’ve beat it. Although the NES would continue getting new releases well into the early Nineties, it ultimately peaked here. Super Mario Bros. 3 is the embodiment of everything that makes a Nintendo game great, and is easily the best of what the era had to offer.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming-lists/best-nes-games-of-all-time-1235442260,Entertainment,Washington Post,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NES_2-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,2452de7d2b8ba8741343c656008e604d6fd0529c
cd22c222aff4,"There’s Now a Casino in Everyone’s Pocket. For Some Young Men, It’s a Near-Fatal Gamble",,"F or Andrew Douglas, bottom was seven cops banging on the door of his apartment. He’d sharpened the knife “good,” filled the bathtub with water, and downed a vial of Coumadin to bleed out faster. Had his dad not sensed something and dialed 911, Andrew, a star baseball player turned gambling addict in college, would have quietly checked out at age 33, leaving his twin infant sons, his guilt-crippled parents, and many thousands of dollars in gambling debts behind. For Jonah, bottom wasn’t failing out of college and mulling suicide. Nor was it the month in a Florida rehab, where, for some fool reason, they let him have his cellphone and he bet money he’d stolen from family on four-legged parlay bets. (More on parlays later.) No, for Jonah, a lacrosse player at a powerhouse program, bottom was crossing the last bridge of honor: trading inside info with players at other schools to cover the over/under on games they bet. For the seven mostly young men sitting around this table, bottom was a grave of their own digging — a hole so deep that their cries for help went unheard. “My thoughts were too crazy, I thought that no one would get them,” says Marcus, a mid-twentysomething dressed like a gamer: black glasses, high-top Chucks, and a Playskool-colored sweatshirt. At his bottom, he was staring out the window of his apartment, weighing whether a fall from five flights up would kill or merely maim him. “I got to where suicide sounded sane.” (Excepting Andrew, above, the gamblers in this story spoke in exchange for anonymity.) We’re lunching at a sports bar in a Philadelphia suburb, picking at taste-free wings and waffle fries. It’s a curious place to bring a group of recovering gamblers, but the man at the head of the table has his reasons. Harry Levant has always been a rower against the river: a former criminal-defense attorney who lost his license, and nearly lost his life, to his own gambling jones a decade back; a second-chance crusader and addictions counselor who mainly treats folks gutted by gambling disorders; and a peripatetic opponent of the online gambling behemoths DraftKings and FanDuel , and the other sports-betting operators (hereafter, SBOs). Forty weeks a year, Levant’s somewhere in the air, lecturing state legislators and groups of physicians about the betting apps’ ploys and snares, as well as the harms he says they’ve levied on Gen Z males. That grail of Levant’s reads lonely and self-devouring: the mania of the gambler repurposed for public service. “Every addictive product has regulations,” says Levant. “Why is this the only one without them?” As his clients tell their stories, a loose narrative hangs together. With an exception here and there, most of these guys started gambling as teens, playing lunchroom hold-em and NFL parlays for a buck or two a throw. Then they got to college, rooming and running with older kids. Here, suddenly, everyone seemed to be in action, be it betting stupid sums on esports soccer or throwing 15 bucks at a five-legged parlay that paid out 20 to one but rarely cashed. (A parlay is a combo bet on two or more outcomes; to collect, you must win each outcome, or “leg.” Should you hit on four legs but miss the fifth, you lose whatever money you put down. Oh, and the odds of winning that five-legged parlay? Less than five percent.) Hospitalized after a suicide attempt due to gambling debts, Andrew Douglas says nurses turned on the NBA Finals and handed him his phone: “I gambled away my last $100.” The portals and drivers for much of this action were the giant sports-bet apps. On the party-colored killing floor of online gambling, FanDuel and DraftKings own most of the take, cornering 80 percent of the mobile bet market in this country. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion; by 2028, we’ll have bet — and lost — a trillion dollars since 2018. That was the year the Supreme Court reversed a federal ban on legalized gambling, freeing each state to partner with Big Sports Bet and feed their residents, especially the young ones, to the wolves. FanDuel and DraftKings wasted no time. They’d spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and the better part of a decade, carpet-bombing the airwaves with ads. Now, they paid kings’ ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and branding, and partnered with, or bought up, AI firms to help target their users’ browsing habits, favorite teams, and sports. “DraftKings, for one, bought SimpleBet, the biggest AI firm in this space, to turn data into in-game microbets,” says Levant. “Then they tracked and used their customers’ data to determine which of them preferred making constant, nonstop bets — and pushed those bets their way.” Bombarded by promos for FanDuel and DraftKings — “Get a $1,000 deposit bonus!” reads one DraftKings blast — underage boys pressed their parents to open accounts, often linked to dad’s ID and banking info, critics claim. Or they surreptitiously opened accounts without their parents’ knowledge, as teens have done with verboten vices since the dawn of time. “Young guys have always bonded around sports; it’s wired into their pack behavior,” says Levant. “What the apps do is monetize that pack behavior: Guys bond over sports bets, not sports, now.” Reached for comment on the matter, DraftKings and FanDuel pushed back on the contention that underage gambling is rampant on their apps, pointing to the safeguards they have in place. “DraftKings is committed to providing a legal, regulated, and responsible gaming environment for adults,” wrote a spokesperson for the company. “We employ advanced Know Your Customer (KYC) technology, relied on by the financial industry and law enforcement, to verify the age of our customers. Any use of our platform by minors violates both our Terms of Use and the law, and we actively monitor to detect and report this prohibited activity.” It bears noting that neither SBO agreed to on-the-record interviews for this piece. Instead, they responded with written statements, like the one from FanDuel, as follows: “As a legal, licensed and regulated operator, we ​have focused on the importance of educating college students on the risks associated with gambling. Notably, recovered problem gambler and national TV host Craig Carton brings lived experience and well-documented struggles with gambling to campuses through the FanDuel Responsible Gaming College Tour. Additionally, we have extended our education efforts to reach families by creating the Trusted Voices parent portal which provides tools and resources to talk to young people about gambling, associated risks, how to recognize warning signs and where to go for support.” To be clear, most adults who gamble on sports do so as a harmless time suck, a way to zest their weekend football viewing. And  countless teens put 10 spots on ballgames without getting dragged into addiction . “There are kids with a healthy relationship to money who can gamble casually on sports,” says Jody Bechtold, the CEO and founder of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh and a distinguished lecturer on gambling addiction. “But there are lots of other kids wired differently these days — high anxiety, ADHD, over-immersion in video games — who’re at much higher risk of addiction.” That’s especially so for kids “from affluent families who never learned the value of a dollar. Money’s supposed to hurt when you lose it,” but they were raised on “all things cashless: Venmo, PayPal, you name it.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports — though simple math tells us that the large majority of those bettors likely wouldn’t have been of legal age to do so. Worse, many engaged in a particularly rash form of gaming, making high-speed wagers on in-game action — a pernicious new product called microbetting. Last year, a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average. And who on campus is qualified to treat this gusher of gambling addictions? Essentially no one, per the experts I talked to. “Colleges aren’t set up to treat [six percent] of their students,” says Jim Lange, the executive director of the Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Drug Misuse Prevention and Recovery at Ohio State University. “That isn’t our business model, and never will be.” He added that most schools don’t even know they have a problem: Gambling is scarcely mentioned in the National Collegiate Health Assessment, the standard tool used by schools to track drug and alcohol misuse by students. None of those stats is news to the young men sitting at this table. “When I owed money to every kid I knew and was betting on Chinese ping-pong at 4 a.m., I tried going for counseling on campus,” says Marcus, the gamer kid. “As I’m talking to the counselor, she’s pulling a manual off the shelf, looking up [the definition of] ‘problem gambling.’” FanDuel and DraftKings have paid king’s ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and partnered with AI firms to help target users’ habits. Ron Vesely/Getty Images “In the hospital, where I was hooked up to a bunch of IVs [after his failed suicide bid], they turned the NBA Finals on and gave me my phone; I gambled away my last $100,” says Andrew, the ex-baseball player. Things were no better during his 30-day stay at an addiction clinic in Florida. “They didn’t touch on gambling at all.” So, too, for Jonah, the former lacrosse player, sent to an out-of-state facility at 21. “This place knew nothing about gambling addiction. They gave us two hours of phone time a day, and I set up a VPN to bet in Philly.” I hear a collective intake of breath as Jonah wraps his story. For all the suffering at this table, there’s a redemptive kinship as well, and a recognition that feels like rescue. The six percent of college kids who lose $500 or more in a day? “We used to be those kids,” says Marcus, to grunts and knowing head nods. “This is what it looks like, five years later.” Thousands of dollars stolen from a doting grandma. A bride empaupered months after her wedding. Betrayals so base they can’t be spoken to other people — but with this group, there are no secrets or judgments; only gratitude for the chance to come clean. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion “After all those months and years in the cold, here you’re among friends who know exactly what you’ve gone through,” says Levant. “And all I ask in return from these guys: Don’t make a bet today.” Andrew cuts in here to show me his phone. “Look at that top email, from Caesars,” he says. It reads, Your mystery bonus is here . “Four years since I shut down that app, they’re still tryna get their hooks in me.” “And that,” says Levant, “is why I chose this place.” He points to the flat-panels mounted above the tables, 50 or 60 sets tuned to Fox Sports 1 or the umpteenth rerun of “First Take.” Every last one of them posts a ticker at the bottom: Odds brought to you by either FanDuel or DraftKings. “This is what these guys have to live with,” says Levant. “They can’t run from sports or those fucking apps. All they can do is change their response.” A Caesars Sportsbook logo looms large over the scoreboard at Rate Field in Chicago. Patrick Gorski/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images MALIK BEASLEY, A SIZZLING SCORER and prime free agent, may never see the floor in another game. After nearly $60 million made in the NBA, he’s awash in debt and unwanted by teams after a federal DA poked through his gambling tabs. ( Recently cleared in that probe , he remains unsigned as basketball season approaches.) Emmanuel Clase is one of the best closers in baseball, but he won’t get to throw another pitch until the sport gets done scouring his prop-bet plays. Clase faces a lifetime ban if MLB can prove he engaged in spot-fixing, the practice of shading his own stat lines by intentionally sailing a slider over his catcher’s head. Jontay Porter could be headed to prison shortly: The NBA center copped to conspiracy to commit wire fraud recently for his part in a prop-bet ring. And Ippei Mizuhara is doing fed time already for stealing millions from his famous boss, Shohei Ohtani, to pay off gambling debts. If men who have everything can’t stop betting long enough to save their prized careers, how will we keep a generation of teens from taking a match to their futures? We find ourselves on the cusp of this disaster thanks in part to a petition brought in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey. Murphy and his predecessor, Gov. Chris Christie, filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to decriminalize wagers on sports in their state. They were suing to unleash a product so destructive that in 2013 the doctors and clinicians of the American Psychiatric Association added “gambling disorder” to the list of substance disorders in their revised standard text, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume 5. It was an extraordinary upgrade, says Levant, the first of its kind: warning readers of a “substance” they couldn’t smoke, shoot, or snort, but which was nonetheless “highly addictive” and “similar in nature to heroin, opioids, tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine.” “We reclassified gambling because it shared the symptomology of classic narcotic addiction, “ says Dr. Petros Levounis, past president of the APA. “We’re greatly concerned now because of the rise in sports betting. There’s a striking likeness to the tobacco and opioid industries — and there’s consensus among us that those industries committed crimes that resulted in suffering and death.” (Approached for comment, Murphy sent this boilerplate: “The Murphy Administration is concerned by the growing national epidemic of online sports-betting addiction, particularly among young men. What begins as occasional recreational betting too often spirals into financial instability, anxiety and depression, and high-risk habits. Our Administration is committed to mitigating the risks associated with problem gambling, including expanding treatment options and holding bad operators accountable.”) FanDuel and DraftKings have cornered 80 percent of the mobile sports-bet market in America. Rob Carr/Getty Images Harmful substances, such as alcohol and narcotics, are typically regulated and controlled. But when presented with what some experts call “the biggest public health threat since Big Tobacco,” SCOTUS killed the only law shielding Americans from the corporate bet sharks. That law, called PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), did precisely what its title proposed. It protected pro and college sports leagues from point-shave rings; kept the Mob (and enraged bettors) off the backs of the players; and put so much physical distance between gamblers and casinos that they couldn’t lose their shirts on a passing hunch. To be sure, problem gamblers found their way around it, opening accounts with offshore sportsbooks or a local guy-who-knew-a-guy. But the damage was contained to the vulnerable few, which is about the best you can hope for from a law. What followed, post-PASPA, was so predictable, you couldn’t have gotten odds for it at Vegas. A sanctimonious foe of sportsbooks for decades, the NFL immediately entered talks with FanDuel and DraftKings. For billions in betting revenue, the league leased those firms the rights to its stat packs, metrics, and branding. That proprietary data enabled the apps to launch a brand-new product: live, in-game wagers on practically anything that happened on field. No longer were kids forced to wait hours on an outcome; now, they could bet on every play and every player through AI-brokered props in real time. That phenomenon, called microbetting, forever changed gambling by turbo-boosting the speed of betting behaviors. The effect of microbetting, if not its intent, is to induce a fugue state that keeps users in action. “You lose track of time and space, and next thing you know, you’re betting Indian cricket at 4 a.m.,” says Marcus. “I don’t even know the rules of cricket. Those fuckin’ matches go on for three days!” Every major pro sports league followed football’s lead, selling their data for a slice of the sports-bet pie. The effect on problem gamblers was catastrophic. “I went from betting money lines on baseball games to betting the number of runs scored in every inning,” says Frankie, a client of Levant’s in his late twenties with a South Philly brogue and a shiny widow’s peak. “Any money left at the end of the night, I’m flipping to FanDuel’s casino. Then it’s slots and blackjack till I bust, and now I’m betting Chinese ping-pong at 3 a.m.” A year ago May, Frankie married his sweetheart in a grand Italian wedding. The guests sent them off with a pillowcase full of cash. Behind his wife’s back, Frankie lost all the cash, then defaulted on the mortgage for their house. “I didn’t know where to turn,” he says. “Suicide was my only option till I found Harry.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports Those microbets and parlay packs that hooked Levant’s clients are the SBOs’ profit centers. How do we know this? Because the apps themselves say so: They’re the bets featured in their ads. Kevin Hart, Rob Gronkowski, Tom Brady, LeBron James: You can’t shut them up and make them go away when they’re touting props and parlays in every promo. Nor can you squelch their motormouthed peers on the pods and sports-bet shows: the Bill Simmonses and Charles Barkleys and Scott Van Pelts, who’ve merrily boarded the gravy train as “ambassadors” for the SBOs. (Approached for comment, Simmons, Barkley and Van Pelt declined to speak.) “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product,” says Levant. “They’re accepting enormous sums to push [that] addictive product on an increasingly younger audience.” AFTER THE FALL OF PASPA, states raced one another to the betting window, smelling 10-figure windfalls in new taxes. Thirty-nine states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico passed bills that legalized the sports-bet racket. The ensuing carnage was swift and savage. New callers flooded the toll-free hotlines at 1-800-GAMBLER, and frantically searched the web for help, googling “gambling addiction” online. The state of New Jersey saw a nearly 300 percent spike in hotline calls in the first five years of legal betting. (Around six percent of its residents now suffer from gambling disorders — or three times the national average, per a Rutgers survey .) In Connecticut, the number of hotline calls increased 200 percent in the first two years — and the crisis was most acute among young men. “Forty percent of those calls are coming from twentysomething males,” says Diana Goode, the executive director of the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling, who likens the legalization of gambling to the opioid crisis. “It’s literally the same thing they did with pain pills. These companies hand out free samples [i.e., welcome bonuses] to get [young men] addicted to betting.” Gambling-addiction expert Jody Bechtold says young men are especially susceptible to the dangers of this culture because they’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps. Brett Carlsen/Getty Images I put the obvious question to clinician after clinician: Why are young people, males in particular, so susceptible to sports-bet apps? Bechtold, the founder and director of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh, began with the mile-high view. “This generation was basically bred for addiction, [having been] raised on cellphones inches from their faces.” The feeds on those devices “disrupted their neural wiring,” leaving them anxious, impulsive, and susceptible to “stims that are quick and constant onscreen.” Their online childhoods also robbed them of life skills best learned by leaving the house. Fiscal savvy gained by working part-time jobs. Risk awareness from running the streets, and an acquired sense of consequences from actions. “When these kids go bust, time after time it’s the parents who bail them out,” says Bechtold. “Every family I deal with, I say, ‘Quit giving the kid money!’ And Mom says, ‘Oh, I’m not ready to do that yet.’” Bechtold says these things not to shame her clients, but to name the preconditions that make them targets. They’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps; been chased across the web by their pings and promotions; and been told by the celebrities they trust most to think that betting’s how winners have fun. It normalizes gambling as “something cool to do with your friends,” she says. Now layer on the male-skewing lubricant of sports, and you’ve built “a mass addiction machine,” says Matt Gaskell, the clinical lead for the NHS Northern Gambling Service in England. “These companies engineered a product that exploits the reward pathways” of young brains. “The constant crackle of dopamine keeps them playing” — and then a big bump, equivalent to a “spike of heroin,” is triggered by “a win on their team.” Eventually, though, the wins and losses cease to matter. What keeps these kids in action is “that neurochemical feed that fires the desire centers in the brain.” Gaskell’s had a decade-plus jump on his peers: Britain legalized mobile sports bets in 2005. The fallout has been tragic. “We have an estimated one to two suicides a day in England, and many of the ones I know of are of young men from middle-class families with university training” he says. Rather than confront the SBOs by slapping limits on their ads and promos — “our kids see 1,600 gambling logos in a 90-minute [soccer] match onscreen,” says Gaskell — the British government lamely lists “gambling disorder” as an official cause of death. “This industry has captured our policymakers with its billions, as I expect it’s done with yours. So the warning from over here is, expect disaster.” EVER WONDER WHAT LIFE’S LIKE with a serpent on your shoulder, whispering in your ear to bet the Braves? For Andrew, the ex-third baseman in college, that forked-tongue enticer gave him no quarter, hissing Check the bonus! at 6 a.m. “Between the voice in my head and the texts from the sportsbooks, I wasn’t really sleeping a whole lot,” he says in his honey-maple drawl from the Carolinas. “Every night, I’d tell myself, ‘That’s your last bet.’ Then every morning, I’d get up, see the bonus on my phone, and bet double what I did the day before.” He’s calling from his flat in eastern Pennsylvania, a bachelor pad he’s put through the wringer. There are gashes in the walls he’s just getting around to fixing: holes he made throwing weights and plates after losing thousands of dollars in three hours. “I’ve never hit anyone in my life,” he says. “But I’ve got a hell of an arm.” Between September of 2020, when he moved up from Atlanta to join the mother of his unborn twins in Pennsylvania, and May of 2024, when he placed his last wager, he bet more than a million dollars, he says, on live, long-shot parlays and props. He’s not sure how much of that was lost on the apps, but concedes it was “a lot.” A study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average He says he stole cash from his parents on visits home to Greenville, and guilted them into stopgap loans he knew he’d never repay. On blue-sky weeks when he won more than he lost, he’d go out and buy himself something he cherished — a new titanium driver; a pricey pair of Jordans — then sell them on for half when he went bust. “I’d walk around my place whenever I hit zero, seeing everything I owned as dollar signs.” His beloved baseball glove; the cashmere quarter-zips his grandma bought him for Christmas — anything to raise a hundred bucks and feed the addiction. Andrew got addicted to betting in college, playing — and hitting — his first-ever backdoor cover. “I had Duke in March Madness, and was just about to lose,” he recalls. But then a ref blew the whistle as the buzzer sounded, giving Duke two meaningless free throws while up by four. With a make on the second, Duke won by five, miraculously beating the spread of 4 1/2, per Andrew’s telling. His brain went kablooey on dopamine. “I can’t even describe it — it was the best feeling ever. I thought it was gonna work like that all the time.” Gambling experts talk about the “first-win trap” — a neurochemical surge that swamps the pleasure center, sparking delirium only matched by high-test heroin. “The reward’s beyond anything in our day-to-day lives,” says Gaskell. “It’s literally off the scale we see in” brain scans. “There’s a reason we call gambling a substance disorder,” says Levant. “But the substance isn’t the dough — it’s the dopa.” Andrew gave up baseball, got a degree in health fitness, and earned a good living as a trainer in Atlanta. He was constantly in the hole, though, laying a dozen bets a day with the bookies or the offshore apps. Then he met a girl and moved her into his place. Months later, she was pregnant with their twins. “She’d no idea I gambled; no one did, till finally my parents caught on.” That’s the core difference between gamblers and other addicts. There’s nothing physical that gives them away: no unexplained weight loss; no cocktail-hour slurring. That secrecy, born of shame, can destroy a spouse and family. They don’t find out that their loved one’s stolen from them till the marshals are at the door with eviction papers. In 2023, the Public Health Advocacy Institute filed a class-action consumer-fraud lawsuit against DraftKings. A judge rejected the company’s motion to dismiss. Mark Cunningham/MLB Photos/Getty Images For every person hiding a gambling disorder, six people in their orbit are impacted financially, according to the World Health Organization. The collateral impacts of new gambling addictions are just now being charted by clinicians. Among states that have legalized sports-bet apps, bankruptcies are up by 30,000 a year, per a USC-UCLA study still in progress. A second study, from Northwestern, found that eight percent of the households in legal-gambling states were wagering on SBOs — and that every dollar spent on those apps cost households double in net-worth losses. And so states that took the bait of new-tax windfalls find themselves in a hole. Who’s going to cover the living expenses of families ruined by problem bettors? And who’s going to pay for those bettors’ treatment when, or if, they seek help? (Less than 10 percent of gambling addicts ever come in for counseling, per the National Council on Problem Gambling.) Of all the grim ephemera linked to legal gambling, this fact might be the starkest: For every dollar paid in taxes by SBOs, the states spend, on average, .0009 cents providing therapy for the addicts they’ve helped create, according to theNCPG . WHAT’S A YOUNG MAN TO DO when all the outlets he watches — ESPN, Paramount+, Peacock, Fox Sports — either own or have partnered with a sportsbook? When FanDuel and DraftKings push him their bet boosts while he’s scrolling reels? When SportsCenter plates him up a side of “Bad Beats” to pair with its “Top Ten Plays”? The effect of all that noise is to sell a tautology: that gambling is harmless fun when done in measure. It’s both the message and the method of the SBOs, who affix their buzzwords — “responsible gaming,” or RG — to the toe plate in all their ads. I called their collective trade rep, the American Gaming Association, to get a sense of RG in practice. Joe Maloney, a senior vice president, explained it to me — after expressing shock that kids use the apps. “The prevailing legal age for wagering is 21,” he told me. “We verify identities, we verify ages — and if a parent is opening [an account] for the use of a minor, that’s a violation of our terms of service. And if it’s found to have been done, then those individuals are banned from having accounts at these sites.” “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” I granted the point, and pressed him about RG. Maloney was just getting warm, however. “We have a code of conduct that includes not casting anyone under 21 in our ads, and ensuring that the known audience of paid advertising is believed to be above 73 percent 21 [or older],” he told me. “We ban all university partnerships. We ban all agreements with NIL [Name, Image and Likeness] athletes. There’s no leafletting and pamphlet dropping on college campuses. None of those things are permitted.” He went on like this for 15 minutes, laying out the Four Pillars of RG. “Stick to a budget. Bet legally [i.e., on their apps, not offshore sites]. Know the odds. And keep it fun. Do it in the company of others,” said Maloney. “This is not a wealth-creation exercise [or] an investment vehicle. This is entertainment.” Since grade school, we’ve been trained to blame the addict for addiction: a failure of will and want-to in the weak. Even when the truth emerges, we still default to that warhorse, character, as the root of personal ruin. It’s only when the operators are forced to pay out fortunes that we finally fault the poisoner, not the poisoned. Hundreds of billions recovered from the tobacco companies, not counting the giant verdicts they keep losing. More than 6.5 billion from the Sackler family. In America, the facts must defer to the funds. Our justice is a giant cardboard check. No one knows that lesson better than Dick Daynard, the godfather of tobacco litigation. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he founded a pivotal nonprofit, the Tobacco Products Liability Project, as a young attorney in the Eighties. TPLP became the tip line and database for the lawyers, reporters, and confidential sources who finally beat Big Tobacco in the mid- to late-Nineties. We’re sitting at a table in his offices in Boston, a quarter or so mile from Fenway Park. Joining us is Mark Gottlieb, Daynard’s voluble chief of staff, and the jet-lagged Harry Levant, just back from two symposia in Colorado. It was Levant who approached Daynard with his next crusade: suing the SBOs for the harms done to their users. Daynard, a laconic sort who wouldn’t order a hot dog without due process, tasked his staff to study the matter closely. “The doom loop of addiction?” says Gottlieb. “The losses that last till the customer drops? It wasn’t a tough decision to go forward.” Harry Levant is a longtime foe of the SBOs: “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product.” Thato Dadson/Courtesy of Harry Levant Through TPLP’s successor, the Public Health Advocacy Institute, Daynard’s team brought the first sports-bet lawsuit in Massachusetts in 2023. They picked DraftKings as their opening-round opponent. The complaint they filed was a strategic one: a tautly focused claim of consumer fraud. “Plaintiffs allege that the offer of the $1,000 bonus … was and is unfair and deceptive because, among other things, a new customer would, in order to get a $1,000 bonus, actually need to deposit five times that amount and then, within 90 days, place $25,000 in bets with only certain odds of return,” the suit reads. “In other words, the ‘$1,000 Bonus’ is structured so that it is inordinately expensive to obtain $1,000, and the new user is, instead, statistically likely to lose money by chasing the bonus.” “In what world would anyone call that ‘responsible gaming’?”  Daynard says. He filed the case, a class action, in Massachusetts, a state with stringent consumer-protection laws. DraftKings, for its part, filed a motion to dismiss. Its argument? “No reasonable consumer would have understood the Promotion in the terms that Plaintiffs allege.” That pleading was roundly denied by the judge; last summer, the case proceeded to discovery. Barring a settlement, the case heads to trial in two years. Meantime, Daynard’s colleagues are scouring DraftKings’ files, combing through tranches of court-compelled data to see if they can prove that DraftKings’ allegedly fraudulent ads are “deceptive to its target customers,” per the suit. To be clear: Gottlieb et al. aren’t bucking for prohibition. Legal gambling is here to stay, and they’re … OK with that. “Abolishing it at this point is DOA; there’s too much critical mass to take it down,” says Levant, who recently moved to Boston as the gambling-policy director of PHAI. “All we ask for are common-sense changes to the way these outfits do business.” For a list of those changes, I spoke to John Keenan, a reformer in the Massachusetts Senate. Keenan’s seen this rodeo before: He chaired the Senate’s Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse through the last two waves of the opioids crisis. “When you look at Purdue Pharma, what did they have? A new product they hawked relentlessly — and often falsely,” says Keenan. Same difference with Big Sports Bet, except “their marketing’s an onslaught: They’ve rewritten the book on selling addictive products.” So Keenan’s sponsored a bill called the Bettor Health Act. Besides raising the state-tax rate on SBOs from 20 to 51 percent, it would instantly ban all sports-bet ads during live, in-game broadcasts. Further, it would outlaw player props, i.e., a parlay on Steph Curry to hit more than four threes and exceed eight assists against the Lakers. (Keenan calls those bets “the crack cocaine” of gambling.) The bill would also slap affordability checks on the SBOs: “If [someone] bets more than $1,000 a day, the industry has to check [his] bank account” to be sure he can support that action, says Keenan. But maybe the best thing Keenan’s bill would do is force the apps to share their data with the state. “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” IT’S BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR now since Andrew placed a bet — but he’ll be the first to admit he’s been here before. “I quit cold turkey in 2020,” he says, “when my girlfriend found out she was pregnant.” Months of sobriety later, he rented a U-Haul and trucked their joint possessions to Pennsylvania. But driving across the line into Delaware — the first state, by a nose, to approve the apps — Andrew was beset by FanDuel radio ads and billboards. That night, he opened an account, grabbed the welcome bonus, and promptly lost his mind for four years. “The guy I became — I don’t know who that was,” he says. Depressed and withdrawn, “always snapping at my girl; all I wanted to do was go and hide.” He holed up in the spare room of the place they’d rented, betting like he’d never bet in Georgia. “Those offshore apps — yeah, I liked my parlays, but they just had the basics,” meaning money line, point spread, over/under. But FanDuel? “FanDuel was fuckin’ Disneyland, man. You could build your own parlay off a thousand different props — and the crazier the props, the bigger the payout.” That, he hastens to add, is how to tell you’re an addict: “We only play the long shots. Longer, the better.” Seven months after the couple moved north, Andrew’s girlfriend left him and took their three-month-olds with her. Andrew hasn’t seen his kids, now four, since; he relinquished his parental rights during that four-year spiral, failing to appear at visitations. Though he’s stable enough now to send her child support, he hasn’t pushed his ex for visitation. “I have no moral ground to be in their lives,” he says. “I burned every bridge and ruined every trust with everyone I ever knew. At this point, it’s just about living my life and trying to prove I can do better.” Though we’re speaking by phone, I sense his mood straying, drawn to the shadows of the past. There’s a species of forgetting when you’ve lived apart, a gap that can’t be filled by stepping back into the world. Of all the sunk assets, faith is the dearest: faith that you still matter out there, and still share a language with other people. To reclaim that faith, Andrew’s gone public with his story, telling it to anyone who’ll listen. He’s appeared, under his own name, on CNN and CBS; spent hours on the phone with me to be sure I get it all; and made himself available to the people he hurt, giving a ruthless accounting of his sins. He has no expectation that the truth will set him free, or serve as recompense for the past. “I’m just putting this out there [in hopes] that someone hears it and does something before a bunch of people die. The way these companies play you, chase and harass you till you’re worse than broke and get to thinking, ‘Maybe it would be better if I was gone.’”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mobile-sports-betting-gambling-addiction-fanduel-draftkings-1235444172,Entertainment,Washington Post,"Paul Solotaroff,Eli Senor",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bet-the-devil-LEAD.jpg?crop=0px%2C1697px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-12T13:00:00+00:00,2eec81bda5622269601c6dcb02515557adfd2b80
4aec03e0ed9c,What You Tell an AI Chatbot Could One Day Be Evidence in a Criminal Trial,,"On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht, who was federally charged for setting the blaze that eventually became the massive and deadly Palisades Fire, which ravaged coastal communities of Los Angeles County throughout the month of January. Authorities mentioned various pieces of evidence that they said supported the case against Rinderknecht, but they spotlighted a particularly novel one : records of his exchanges with ChatGPT . The 29-year-old Florida man allegedly prompted OpenAI ‘s chatbot to create images of cities and forests engulfed in flames, told it about feeling “liberated” after burning a Bible, and, shortly after igniting a brush fire just after midnight on New Year’s Day, asked it, “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes?” Rinderknecht has yet to enter a plea, but if he goes to trial, the case could offer a meaningful glimpse into how the proliferation of AI technology will affect criminal investigations and prosecutions in the future. Users have proven overly trustful of chatbots, treating them as therapists, confidants, and even romantic partners onto which they can unburden intimate secrets. The reality is that they are divulging sensitive information on platforms that offer no legal confidentiality, developed by companies that will readily turn their data over to law enforcement if served with a subpoena, warrant, or court order. A New Frontier All this makes chatbot records a potential bonanza for law enforcement, tech and legal experts tell Rolling Stone , perhaps more valuable than the text messages and social media footprints that currently serve as important areas of focus when authorities scrutinize individuals linked to a crime . Generative AI correspondence, too, is soon to be a regular part of criminal investigations and trials. “There is no doubt that AI chatbot logs are going to take center stage in evidentiary disputes across the nation,” says Kyle A. Valente, an attorney with the law firm Bressler Amery & Ross PC who published a paper on the topic last month. “Civil practitioners will want to obtain chat histories to show intent or motive in cases dealing with fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the like,” he says, while prosecutors are seeking to introduce these files to establish elements of a case such as mens rea , or a suspect’s knowledge of wrongdoing. Though a number of civil lawsuits related to user harm are currently pending against AI firms, criminal prosecutors have hardly begun to explore how they can leverage defendants’ chatbot usage to secure convictions. Valente cites one remarkable early precedent: a man from Roanoke, Virginia, was sentenced in September to 25 years in prison for first-degree murder after prosecutors argued that his messages with Snapchat ‘s My AI bot demonstrated premeditation in a 2023 slaying. Before fatally shooting another man in a petty dispute, the now convicted defendant, 18 years old at the time, told the bot he was going to “fight” and asked it, “What if I shot them if they step on my property with hostile intent?” (The chatbot replied that it could not “condone or encourage any violent or illegal behavior.”) ‘It’s Like Your Diary Times 10’ “DNA residue, fingerprints, everything you watch in all these crime shows pales in comparison to the private data that you have on your phone,” says Rob T. Lee, a digital forensics and AI expert at SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training cooperative. “What happens now with AI, you’re having a full conversation with these chatbots. It is no longer just a search for a topic.” Whereas criminal suspects in this past may have been incriminated by a Google query on, say, how to clean up bloodstains, a more comprehensive, detailed back-and-forth with a tool like ChatGPT gives investigators far more opportunities to prove intent and mindset, Lee explains. “All of that is logged, and it’s all sitting on servers,” he says. “It’s like your diary times 10.” “We saw this with social media, where all of a sudden, law enforcement started to understand that a lot of important, relevant evidence could be gleaned from social media posts and profiles,” says Meetali Jain, a tech and human rights lawyer who serves as director of the Tech Justice Law Project and is representing multiple parents in lawsuits alleging that AI products encouraged their children to commit suicide. “That became a standard part of a criminal investigation. I think we’re going to start to see that in this context too.” The difference, she says, is that this next development concerns “machine-generated outputs,” and there aren’t established rules around how this kind of material can or should be admitted as exhibits in court. “It’s very much a live issue,” Jain says. Valente concurs: “At this early juncture, the bounds are limitless until such a time as courts issue opinions that establish some framework for dealing with this type of evidence,” he says. A Fundamental Difference Vincent Conitzer, director of the Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and head of technical AI engagement at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI, also says that chatbot exchanges fundamentally differ from text messages with another person, who we would expect to take action to prevent a crime if told about it in advance. “Will we have similar expectations of a chatbot?” Conitzer asks. “Already the companies try to have guardrails so that their chatbots do not help someone commit a crime, though those guardrails are still very brittle.” Indeed, an NBC News report this week revealed that ChatGPT can be manipulated into giving directions on the assembly of chemical and biological weapons. And Matthew Livelsberger, the veteran who on New Year’s Day fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck parked in front of the Trump hotel in Las Vegas right before an incendiary device blew up the vehicle, used generative AI to help plan his attack. Lee notes that several AI companies have already indicated their ability to flag user activity that appears to foreshadow a crime. “They’re getting much better at detecting foreign adversaries using these systems for malicious ends, and I can only imagine that they’re doing similar for people [in the U.S.] that may be looking to kill or commit acts of terror,” he says. Human Review OpenAI has said it employs a human review team that is authorized to electively inform law enforcement when they come across content that “involves an imminent threat of serious physical harm to others.” How often they escalate to this level of alarm is unclear. “They’re not doing press releases on it,” Lee says, speculating that they prefer to spotlight efforts to disrupt state-affiliated threat actors in Russia, Iran, and China, “which is much easier to get a pat on the back for.” The major American AI players are much more tight-lipped, Lee says, on their ability to detect a possible school shooter, to take one example. And, as Jain points out, if they are picking up these warning signs, reporting them isn’t mandatory. “I think [the companies] are going to say, ‘Look, we can’t be responsible for what kinds of queries users pose to us through our chatbot, we can’t possibly know what he was going to do,’” Jain predicts. She is struck by the fact that when the Justice Department put forward its claims about how Rinderknecht had used ChatGPT before and during the Palisades Fire, they didn’t mention OpenAI or whether the program could have appeared to encourage “harm to others.” Chatbots are known to validate users’ obsessions and delusions , and most of the litigation around this phenomenon has so far pertained to self-harm, as in the suits Jain has brought against OpenAI and Character Technologies. The question of the role a chatbot might come to play in an episode of outward violence or destructive behavior is murkier still. “​​The focus is going to be on further substantiating the culpability of the individual, at the expense of really looking at how the companies designed their chatbots,” Jain says, likening the issue to entrapment, a scenario in which law enforcement induces someone to commit a crime. She envisions prosecutors homing in on a “gotcha moment” in a defendant’s chatbot logs, “without any sort of understanding of how the machine got to that output.” “I feel like it’s going to be a very one-sided story,” Jain adds. “I can’t imagine that a company is going to stick up for the rights of users.” Nevertheless, it seems there’s little the major AI players can do to avoid being drawn into criminal proceedings in the months and years ahead. Valente, for one, expects that their legal and compliance departments will take a “proactive” approach to the problem. What would that entail? “Revisiting privacy policies and updating terms and conditions,” he says. As always, the devil is in the fine print.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatbot-history-evidence-criminal-case-1235444944,Entertainment,Washington Post,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ai-chatbot-logs-in-court.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:54:26+00:00,4f82ed3df8908158028a9105a09b133a9ce160f8
a4ae316a5b1b,"Her Father Was a Notorious Serial Killer. Years After His Arrest, She’s Still Searching for Answers",,"For almost 30 years, the city of Wichita, Kansas was terrorized by a serial killer. He called himself BTK , a nickname patterned after the phrase “bind, torture, kill” — the signature way he would leave bodies for police to find. His victims varied, first a young family, then women of varying ages and economic backgrounds — sometimes going years between murders. Investigators were assigned and reassigned to the case, poring over clues and evidence. These included letters from BTK himself, taunting police on being unable to catch him. By 2005, BTK was considered one of the biggest cold cases in the entire state. Kerri Rawson — who had grown up in Wichita — was living in Michigan but hadn’t forgotten the moniker of the wanted murder. But when FBI agents showed up to her door on a snowy morning that February she couldn’t reconcile her knowledge of the serial killer with what the people in front of her were saying. BTK wasn’t a cold case anymore. A suspect had just been arrested, and it was her father, Dennis Rader. In June 2005, Rader pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first degree murder. He is incarcerated in the El Dorado Correctional Facility in El Dorado, Kansas , serving 10 consecutive life sentences. But for Rawson, her father’s secret double life — a religious family man in public and a sadistic serial killer in private — has haunted her since the police’s discovery. Now, she’s trying to reckon the man she knew with the murderer she despises. In the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer, the investigators, media, neighbors walk through their memories of the search for BTK — all while Rawson tries to plan out what her future looks like without him. Here are four things we learned from the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer . Stephen King’s interview about his book A Good Marriage inspired Kerri Rawson to break her family’s year long silence . Even after the FBI informed Rawson of her father’s arrest and history as a serial killer, there was a part of the Kansas native that didn’t believe her father could have done it. While reckoning with the news, neither Rawson nor her mother believed that police had the right person. Following the media storm, Rawson says in the documentary that she turned down major interviews with people like Diane Sawyer and Oprah. “I spent almost 10 years rotting inside after he was arrested. Not being able to speak, not thinking I was allowed to speak,” she says in the documentary. “In the Midwest code, you don’t ever air your dirty laundry publicly. You just keep it inside and you look appropriate on the outside.” But one night, while she was watching television, Rawson caught a 2014 interview with thriller author Stephen King . King was promoting his novella A Good Marriage , about a happy wife whose life is thrown into disarray when she discovers her husband is secretly a serial killer. King said he was inspired in part by Rader’s arrest, more specifically, by his ability to keep his murderous tendencies completely unknown to the rest of his family. Rawson felt like the book was exploitative of her father’s victims, and decided that it was finally time for her to share her own perspective. “I had been silent for so long,” she says. “And there was so much stuff that needed to come out.” Rader was known in his community as a kind and quiet man, but his family said he had a vicious temper. One of the biggest shocks after Rader’s arrest was how long the convicted killer was able to plan and execute serial killings in his own community without being arrested or even suspected. People in his community of Park City, Kansas — a small town outside Wichita — remembered Rader as a quiet, kind, and rule-following man. He worked as a compliance officer for the city, and was known by many people as the official dogcatcher. In addition to being a stickler for city ordinances, Rader was known to participate heavily in outside activities like leading his son’s Cub Scout group and doing administrative tasks at the Christ Lutheran Church. “He didn’t just fool his family,” family friend and neighbor Andrea Rogers says in the documentary. “He fooled a church. He fooled an entire city. He literally fooled everybody.” But even before his family was told about his extracurriculars, Rawson says that she, her mother, and brother were all aware that her father had an angry personality that the rest of the world couldn’t see. In the documentary, Rawson says that the family often left Rader choose everything from their activities to the movies they watched to where the children went in their free time, for fear of upsetting him. And they also knew that even the smallest of mistakes, like leaving their shoes out or someone taking his assigned seat at the kitchen table, could result in massive outbursts. “My father, on the outside, looked like a very well-behaved, mild-mannered man. But there’s these moments of Dad, [where] something will trigger him and he can flip on a dime,” Rawson says in the documentary. “And it can be dangerous.” Rader often used his family life as a cover for his murders . When police interviewed him following his arrest, Rader admitted that he used his family events as helpful cover for his murders, but noted that his busy schedule most likely kept him from killing more people. Though none of his family say they had any idea he was a serial killer, the clues were hidden in plain sight. When police first searched Rader’s house, they found his kill bag — a bag complete with a gun, ropes, and other break-in items — stored prominently in the entryway’s coat closet. In Rader’s office, evidence of his kills including personal items belonging to the victims, were kept accessible in an unlocked filing cabinet. Rader and his family were active and often took vacations and trips in popular tourist destinations like the Grand Canyon and the National Parks . They were also avid fishers, campers, and hikers, with Rawson noting she and her father both loved the outdoors. “He said later on that having kids slowed down his murders,” Rawson says in the documentary. “Dad said he got busy raising kids. I think he got busy chasing me.” One of the last letters of clues Rader sent police before his longest hiatus was mailed on the night of Rawson’s first birthday party. But many of those activities also helped Rader avoid initial suspicion in the murders. On Jan. 18, 1991, Rader went to a  Cub Scout event before sneaking away to kill 62-year-old Dolores Davis. After using his station wagon to store bodies and murder gear, he later gave it to Rawson in high school for her own personal use. “That was not okay,” Rawson says. Rawson helped police name Rader as the suspect for at least one additional murder . After Rawson learned that her father was the BTK killer, she says in the documentary that she went through a very long period of emotional upheaval. Days after Rader’s arrest, she and a large group of her extended family gathered in the same house, eating food and telling stories about their treasured memories while the media circus continued to swarm outside. Rawson says it was like a funeral but she still loved her father. Instead, she focused her anger on the media attention and people who were hounding her family. “Our lives were just gone,” she says in the documentary. “It was upheaval, totally insane. I was just mad at everybody.” After her father was convicted, Rawson reached out to him in prison and tried to continue some aspect of their relationship, letting him know she was always available to talk but that she desperately wanted answers. He didn’t answer her questions, but he did say he loved her and thought of her. Since Rawson and Rader had an open line of communication, police asked Rawson to aid them in finding if there were any more victims then the 10 he had claimed.  Rawson not only went through Rader’s personal notes and diaries, but met with him and asked him point blank about the possibility of other victims. Rader denied being involved. After going through his notes and personal belongings, police named Rader as the prime suspect in the 1976 disappearance of one other woman: 16-year-old Cynthia Kinney from Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Kinney was working at a laundromat when she went missing, a fantasy detailed extensively in one of Rader’s journals. Police have never found Kinney’s body, so any conviction would require stronger evidence linking Rader with Kinney. Rader still denies it. Rawson says she can’t reconcile her father with BTK — and she’s done trying to . According to Rawson, the Kansas native has spent much of her adult life trying to cope with the trauma of learning her father’s real nature. For a while, this was alleviated by trying to help police with their investigations, corresponding with her father, and working with organizations meant to help victims of violent and high profile crimes. In 2019, she wrote A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming , her first memoir. Her second, Breaking Free: Overcoming the Trauma of My Serial Killer Father , was published in 2023. Both of the books were national best sellers. But even after helping the police and victims advocacy groups, Rawson says she still struggled with her own repressed memories from her childhood. In the documentary, she describes having a period of night terrors and fearful periods where she was constantly paranoid of a home invasion. These lasted for months, often resulting in her wetting the bed and crying out for help. Now, Rawson thinks part of that may have been her somehow understanding her father’s actions. “I think my subconscious [has been] trying to get it out of me since I was a little girl,” she says. “Saying, ‘Hey, there’s a bad man in my house.’” Rader kept detailed notes about his victims and killings, but many of them were interspersed among writings about daydreams and fantasies. In one of his notebooks, Rawson found her own name next to a date and his codes for bondage and sex. Rawson confronted her father during a visit to his prison. He denied ever sexually assaulting her or any member of her family — saying he only fantasized about it — but Rawson says she exploded. She berated him about how intertwined his serial killing life and her life were. And when she was done, she left. She says the person sitting across from her at that table wasn’t a father she recognized. So she’s done spending so much time trying to make sense of why her father committed his crimes. Rawson says that she will always continue her work with victim advocacy groups, but for now, she’s exploring what her life, memories, and career look like without her father or his impact. At 80 years old, Rader is still serving consecutive life sentences and will never be released. Rawson doubts she will ever visit him again. “I’ll grieve those memories and that girl and that family. I lost all of it,” she says. “But I just didn’t really want to give him any of me anymore.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kerri-rawson-my-father-btk-serial-killer-kansas-documentary-1235443801,Entertainment,Washington Post,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/My_Father_The_BTK_Killer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:30:00+00:00,223000a1e29f13b60d46c7cb7b230bded6837439
4c9e2be19b07,Source: Players miffed over surface at Steelers' Acrisure Stadium,,"PITTSBURGH -- Players from the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns expressed ""outrage"" and concerns to the NFL Players Association about the ""embarrassing"" playing surface at last weekend at Acrisure Stadium, a union source told ESPN. ""The NFLPA has conveyed its concern to the NFL and will work to ensure that players are not put in that position going forward,"" the source said Wednesday. Some players said the field, which was already scheduled to be re-sodded after the game, was ""dry."" Steelers offensive lineman Broderick Jones was one of multiple players who said they ""kicked up chunks of grass"" when they made explosive movements. League spokesman Brian McCarthy said Wednesday that the NFL has ""been in touch with both the union and the club, which has taken steps to replace the grass surface."" ""I thought it was poor yesterday,"" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said Monday about the field conditions. ""I'm not concerned going forward. It's my understanding that that turf is going to be swapped out, but I certainly acknowledge it was a concern yesterday."" Steelers kicker Chris Boswell slipped on the turf as he attempted and missed a fourth-quarter field goal, and special teams captain Miles Killebrew suffered a ""significant"" non-contact knee injury as he planted on the turf. ""Honestly, it was s---,"" Steelers defensive captain and NFLPA team representative Cameron Heyward said Tuesday. ""I lost one of my teammates and kind of makes me sad about it."" Steelers kicker Chris Boswell slipped on the Acrisure Field turf as he missed a fourth-quarter field goal Sunday. AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar Heyward said he still prefers a grass playing surface to turf, which has drawn scrutiny at stadiums like New York's MetLife for high-profile injuries. But Heyward added Sunday's field was below standard. The league has stated that there was no difference in injury rates between synthetic turf and grass playing surfaces last season. There were also fewer ACL injuries last season on synthetic than grass surfaces and there has been no difference so far this year. ""I like grass, but that wasn't grass for playing,"" Heyward said. An NFLPA source echoed Heyward's sentiments about preferring grass to turf playing surfaces, but stressed that the quality of the grass matters. ""Players prefer grass fields, but all grass surfaces aren't equal,"" the source told ESPN. ""The conditions at Acrisure Stadium underscore why players have pushed for high-quality grass fields, and why the NFLPA continues to push for improved, shared maintenance practices of grass fields across the league."" The Steelers share a stadium with the University of Pittsburgh, but neither team had played at Acrisure the week before Sunday's game. Pitt hosted Boston College on Oct. 4, while the Steelers lone home game prior to the Browns game was against the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 14. While the Steelers had just one home game in that stretch, Pitt hosted four of their first five games at Acrisure.

7f6716261d55,Cavaliers unveil 'Classic Edition' uniforms for 55th anniversary season,,"The Cleveland Cavaliers are revisiting an iconic era in their franchise history with their 2025-26 Classic Edition uniforms. Cleveland unveiled the uniform Wednesday, a revamped version of the navy blue alternate threads the team wore from 2005 to '10 -- a period that notably includes the then- LeBron James -led 2006-07 team that made a run to the 2007 NBA Finals. The team is also using the jerseys to celebrate the franchise's 55th anniversary. The look, which the Cavaliers described as an ""exact replica"" in a news release, features a deep navy blue base, with wine and gold retro motifs. ""Cleveland"" is displayed on the chest of the jersey in the team's early 2000s-themed throwback font with a gold outline. Players' names and numbers are displayed in white lettering with a gold outline on the back. Shorts for the look include Cleveland's iconic throwback ""C"" logo that features a sword piercing. Both the jersey and shorts are trimmed with the wine, navy and gold striped trim. According to the Cavaliers, the original alternate uniforms were a nod to the ""Miracle of Richfield"" jerseys from the 1970s -- an old-school look with white, yellow and red striped trimming that honored the 1975-76 season. Cleveland will pair the jerseys with a Classic Edition court, which features elements from the 2000s-era Cavaliers' hardwood. The Cavaliers will sport the throwback look in 11 games, including during their Christmas Day matchup against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. They will debut the uniforms during their Nov. 5 home matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers .",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46604417/cleveland-cavaliers-2025-26-classic-edition-navy-blue-uniforms-55th-anniversary,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560534_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,d6e37da4ee4d147629d10580e20a019f3a831393

It Backfired.,"us foreign policy, economy, currency, election, stimson center, treasury department, javier milei, donald trump, argentina, us","As President Javier Milei of Argentina faced a deepening economic crisis, President Trump rushed to the rescue of his political ally with a generous $20 billion bailout. Then came the fine print. To secure help from the United States, Mr. Trump made clear on Tuesday, Mr. Milei’s embattled political party would have to first pull off a victory in what are emerging as momentous and challenging legislative elections this month. “If he doesn’t win, we’re gone,” Mr. Trump said as he welcomed Mr. Milei, who he has called his “favorite president,” to the White House. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.” In Argentina, those comments were taken by many as a clear attempt by Mr. Trump to put his thumb on a sovereign country’s electoral process. The fallout was swift. The peso tumbled as investors went on a panicked selling spree of Argentina’s currency. Mr. Milei’s political opponents railed against what they called American extortion, urging voters to reject his party at the polls. And Mr. Milei’s government rushed to try to assure Argentines that Mr. Trump wouldn’t abandon the nation based on Mr. Milei’s political fortunes. To many, Mr. Trump’s conditional economic support represented yet another attempt to influence, through economic sticks and carrots, the internal affairs of another Latin American country. The turmoil that followed also highlighted the risks Mr. Milei faces as he shackles his political fortunes, and Argentina’s economic future, to America’s deep pockets and Mr. Trump’s fickle friendship.

5303ef49e860,Fantasy Football,,"Oct 15, 2025, 12:38 PM ET Change could well be the name of the game in fantasy football over these next 20 days. The NFL trade deadline arrives at 4 p.m. ET on Nov. 4, and it represents one of those rare opportunities in fantasy football for the seasonal outlooks of players to instantaneously shift, often dramatically. The past three seasons alone have brought us the fantasy-relevant, in-season trades of Christian McCaffrey , Joshua Dobbs and DeAndre Hopkins , moves that affected both teams involved. Besides the impact on the players who were traded, their departures created opportunities or cleared the decks for D'Onta Foreman , Kyler Murray and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine , all of whom had their moments in fantasy in those years. Managers should be preparing for similar possibilities, however remote the chance. Bear in mind that many of the most prominent names rumored on the trading block in those years were ultimately not moved. Evaluate the prospective impact on trade candidates' outlooks, and stash players further down the depth chart who might benefit from an expanded opportunity. Examining Adam Schefter's list of top candidates to move , here are six of the players whose potential trades would have the biggest ripple effects across fantasy football. For each, a dream destination is proposed, as is a fantasy stash candidate in advance of any deal. Hall is one of a number of players who could be on the move before the NFL trade deadline. Evan Bernstein/Getty Images Dream destination for fantasy: Los Angeles Chargers . Jim Harbaugh's (and offensive coordinator Greg Roman's) offense prefers focusing on a strong running game, and Hall is one of the league's better and more underappreciated backs. He has gained 10-plus yards on 16% of his carries, second best among running backs (minimum 40 attempts). Hall could reclaim top-10 positional status with such a move. Back in New York, a trade benefits: Isaiah Davis . He took seven of his 25 carries (28%) for double-digit yardage over the final five weeks of 2024, and would see a much more sizable workload if Hall departs. Davis would become a matchups-oriented RB2/flex on a bad offense. If Kamara is traded, it would open the door for third-year back Kendre Miller. Kenneth Richmond/Getty Images Dream destination for fantasy: Kansas City Chiefs . It'd be quite the swing in team competitive states for Kamara, going from a bottom-5 offense to one in the top 10, not to mention the Chiefs' three straight Super Bowl appearances. He'd remain a clear starter in Kansas City, and his receiving chops would be put to good use by Patrick Mahomes (see: Jerick McKinnon 's 2022-23 receiving exploits). Back in New Orleans, a trade would benefit: Kendre Miller . He has a better explosive-run rate (10.9%) this season and has forced more missed tackles (21) than Kamara (9.6%, 17). The extent of the Saints' fire sale will have a big say in Miller's level of impact, but he's one of the most important players to stash in anticipation of a deadline deal. Dream destination for fantasy: Olave to the New York Giants . Any of the three would be better off in most of the rumored destinations in need of wide receiver help (Denver, New England, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Tampa Bay), but Olave and the Giants are a sneaky-intriguing match. Rookie Jaxson Dart has injected new life into the Giants' offense, and Olave, whose 74 catches on throws 10-plus yards downfield in 2022-23 were fifth most in the NFL, would give Dart a better field-stretcher than he has had since Malik Nabers (knee) was lost for the season. Back in New Orleans, a trade would benefit: Perhaps Juwan Johnson , but the correct answer might be ""nobody."" Multiple trades of any of the above means stripping this offense down to the studs, in which case Miller, Johnson and quarterback Spencer Rattler would be in for a rough final two months. Johnson, who averaged 9.3 targets and 14.2 PPR fantasy points from Weeks 1-3, is a worthwhile stash on the chance that a trade opens up more targets for him. Dream destination for fantasy: New England Patriots . Meyers' three best fantasy seasons (2021, 2023-24) have come with Josh McDaniels as either his coach or offensive coordinator, the latter the role he once again holds in New England. With Drake Maye blossoming as a passer (fourth in passer rating, seventh in Total QBR), Meyers could thrive as the Patriots' No. 1 target or, at the very least, create a 1a and 1b situation with Stefon Diggs . Back in Las Vegas, a trade would benefit: Jack Bech . Putting aside the 57.2% rostered Tre Tucker , the Raiders have additional intriguing youngsters behind Meyers on their depth chart at wide receiver (Dont'e Thornton Jr.) and tight end ( Michael Mayer ), but Bech is the one whose role has been quietly on the rise. Dream destination for fantasy: Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Baker Mayfield has targeted tight ends on 19.4% of his career throws, but you might not have known it due to his having effectively only Cade Otton and Payne Durham at his disposal during his three years in Tampa Bay. Andrews would significantly boost Mayfield's receiving options, and Mayfield's ability would help restore much of Andrews' lost value. Back in Baltimore, a trade would benefit: Isaiah Likely . Um, we'll keep trying to make fetch happen? Injuries have held Likely back this season -- his own as well as Lamar Jackson's -- but he's also a big target (6-foot-4, 245 pounds) who has proven his mettle before (11.1 fantasy PPG in games where he runs 20-plus routes). Dream destination for fantasy: Chargers. It wasn't long ago that the Chargers were a breeding ground for successful fantasy tight ends. In each of Justin Herbert's first three NFL seasons (2020-22), the Chargers' starting TE averaged 8-plus fantasy PPG -- and it was a different one each year ( Hunter Henry , Jared Cook , Gerald Everett ). Herbert would represent a massive upgrade for Njoku. play 1:38 Is Harold Fannin Jr. the tight end to add off waivers ahead of Week 7? Daniel Dopp and Field Yates analyze the fantasy prospects of Harold Fannin Jr. with fellow Browns tight end David Njoku banged up. Back in Cleveland, a trade would benefit: Harold Fannin Jr . Fannin, one of 2025's biggest rookie surprises, would also benefit if Njoku's knee issue lingers. Fannin's 16.7% target share ranks 16th at TE, and his 10.0 PPG ranks 15th at the position.",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/46596136/2025-nfl-trade-deadline-fantasy-football-targets-landing-spot,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560553_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,94961dece3e34c53c337614145f0b7fe810e2d96
ce39ec42da27,Knicks' Malcolm Brogdon retires after nine NBA seasons,,"New York Knicks guard Malcolm Brogdon has decided to retire from basketball after nine NBA seasons, he told ESPN on Wednesday. Brogdon, who averaged 12.7 points, 3.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists in a career-low 24 games for the Washington Wizards last season, was on track to make the Knicks' final roster, but he had been contemplating retirement and informed Knicks officials on Wednesday of his decision. ""Today, I officially begin my transition out of my basketball career,"" Brogdon, 32, told ESPN in a statement. ""I have proudly given my mind, body and spirit to the game over the last few decades. With the many sacrifices it took to get here, I have received many rewards. ""I am deeply grateful to have arrived to this point on my own terms and now to be able to reap the benefits of my career with my family and friends. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all who have had a place in my journey."" Brogdon, the No. 36 overall pick in the 2016 draft, was the NBA Rookie of the Year with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2017 and the NBA Sixth Man of the Year with the Boston Celtics for the 2022-23 season. He is one of two players to have won both awards, along with Mike Miller. Brogdon shot a combined 43% from 3-point range during the 2022-24 seasons, which ranked fourth in the league, but he fell to a career-low 29% last season. In his nine NBA season, Brogdon averaged 15.3 points, 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds in 29.1 minutes per game with the Wizards, Trail Blazers , Celtics, Pacers and Bucks.

385ebf73cd39,Pochettino's turnaround has USMNT no longer dreading World Cup,,"A little more than a month ago, the U.S. men's national team seemed to be in disarray. The results were poor, the individual performances offered little in the way of hope, and the push for competition within the team seemed based more on wishful thinking than reality. Yet with the October window now concluded, it's clear that the recent gathering of USMNT players was a success, and there has been discernible progress made in terms of the team's preparations for next summer's FIFA World Cup . The team's momentum has never been higher this cycle. Granted, that's a low bar given where they've been, but they're evolving nonetheless. The results have improved to the point that the U.S. is now unbeaten in its past three games, two of them wins, all against teams who have punched their ticket to the World Cup. More importantly, there is competition for places everywhere on the field. At forward, Haji Wright has emerged to challenge Folarin Balogun , even as the latter still has an edge in terms of securing a starting spot. The midfield seems jumbled, but in a good way. Before there didn't seem to be many candidates actually making a strong case for inclusion on a World Cup roster; now the likes of Tanner Tessmann , Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan -- the ultimate late bloomer if there ever was one -- all look capable of making a contribution on the biggest stage. The attackers sitting behind the central striker are making cases as well. Weston McKennie looks to have come in from the cold after being frozen out by manager Mauricio Pochettino in September. Against Australia , Diego Luna reminded everyone why he's a Pochettino favorite, with his high-energy and incisive play giving the USMNT a boost. Malik Tillman looked sharp against Ecuador . The backline, with the help of a 3-4-3 system (at times) looks to be more stable than what was on display in the sobering 2-0 defeat to South Korea barely a month ago. Yet for all the progress made, in some respects, the October window left one wanting more. Christian Pulisic was a bit-part player, limited to a total of 45 minutes over two games due to an ankle injury and a hamstring ailment sustained against Australia. Tillman was limited as well, unable to take the field against Australia due to a tender hamstring of his own. Alejandro Zendejas , one of the heroes of September, was sidelined with a knee issue. Left back Antonee Robinson , whose return from offseason knee surgery had been hugely anticipated, never made it onto the field, with his recovery from the aforementioned procedure dragging on and on. This is on top of players like Tyler Adams , Ricardo Pepi , and Johnny Cardoso also being absent, with the latter two ruled out due to injury. After nearly a year of struggles, Mauricio Pochettino appears to have the USMNT buying into his program. Omar Vega/Getty Images Getting all of the U.S. teams' best players on the field at the same time -- or even most of them -- remains an elusive goal, and there aren't many more opportunities to see what that looks like prior to the start of the World Cup. The positive is that despite these absences, the U.S. was still able to not only get results, but for the most part look good doing it. The competitiveness within the squad has also reached a point where those who were absent -- besides Adams and perhaps Robinson -- have fallen down the depth chart, and are at risk of being left behind. Harder to overlook is the USMNT's maddening habit of slow starts that have resulted in conceding the first goal -- something that has happened seven times in 16 matches in 2025 -- which was the case this window against both Ecuador and Australia. Even aside from the goal against the Socceroos, the USMNT seemed flummoxed by Australia's high defensive line. The U.S. recovered in both matches, even securing a comeback win against the Socceroos, the first come-from-behind win of the Pochettino era. The U.S. manager alluded to the ""good and not-so-good"" of the team's comeback ability. When the World Cup stars for real in June, the Americans won't be able to afford to make the kind of defensive mistakes that led to them falling behind in these matches. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now But the USMNT's resolve, oftentimes suspect this cycle, now seems to possess more solidity. Pochettino noted that ""it's no coincidence"" that the U.S. recorded a comeback win now that the team's culture is in a better place. ""Culture"" has long been one of those squishy, imprecise words that gets thrown around a lot to explain both successes and failures, but when Pochettino talks about it, the picture conjured up in the mind's eye is more like razor wire than a down pillow. There is steel behind his words and actions. The U.S. manager's message appears to have been received loud and clear by the players, with McKennie among those who have taken it to heart the most. The Juventus midfielder was active in both matches, and against Ecuador seemed especially adept at finding Balogun in behind the defense. The question now is whether he fend off the likes of Tillman and Zendejas to keep his spot on the field as an attacking midfielder. McKennie at his peak would be hard to displace from the lineup. That is the kind of battle that adds plenty of intrigue to the November window, which will include matches against Paraguay and Uruguay . The battle for the two double-pivot spots in midfield will be intense, too, as will the starting striker position. Health will play a part in determining who rises and falls. No team enters a World Cup completely injury free. There are always players who miss out. All the more reason why the sight of performers stepping up -- be it Roldan or Luna or Wright -- is encouraging. Now the U.S. finds itself on an upward trajectory again. The looming World Cup, once looked at with a certain level of dread, is generating excitement again. There is a greater sense that this team can do the country proud. Credit Pochettino for the turnaround, although he knows better than anyone there is still work to be done.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46606737/mauricio-pochettino-turnaround-usmnt-no-longer-dreading-world-cup,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560656_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,ca557b7f1f47167143bf52337c93b9f4e5d8b26d

In a statement, the Palestinian militant group said that it has “committed to what was agreed upon and handed over everyone it had in terms of living captives and what it had in terms of bodies that it could recover.” But it said that it needed “special equipment” to find and extract the remains of the rest of the deceased captives, adding that it was “making great efforts.” According to the terms of a cease-fire brokered by international mediators last week, Israel and Hamas would stop fighting and the militant group would return all the hostages it held — both living captives and the bodies of those who had died, totaling 48 people — in exchange for the freeing of Palestinians held by Israel, among other provisions. Hamas freed the 20 living hostages on Monday, and militants in Gaza had in the days since handed over the remains of eight people. Israel has identified six of those bodies as Israeli and one as Nepali. The identity of the eighth was not yet clear. The announcement that Hamas was unable to retrieve the remains of additional hostages came after the militant group handed over two more coffins to the Red Cross on Wednesday, putting the total number of bodies it has handed over at 10. That, however, left the remains of over a dozen people unaccounted for. While the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, acknowledged receipt of two coffins from the Red Cross late on Wednesday night, a representative for Mr. Netanyahu declined to immediately comment on Hamas’s latest statement. The truce agreement called for the immediate handover of all remaining bodies of hostages in Gaza — there were about 25 deceased captives thought to be held there before the cease-fire. But the deal acknowledged that some bodies could be difficult to locate and may take more time to retrieve because of the widespread destruction in the enclave. Two years of Israeli strikes have reduced much of Gaza to rubble. On Monday, the Israeli government had been weighing measures to penalize Hamas for not turning over more bodies, according to two diplomats briefed by Israeli officials and three Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics. On Wednesday, after Hamas’s announcement, the office of Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, said in a statement that he had directed the Israeli military to prepare a plan for the total defeat of Hamas in Gaza if the group did not abide by the terms of the deal unveiled by President Trump late last month, which also demanded Hamas’s disarmament. “If Hamas refuses to abide by the agreement, Israel, in coordination with the U.S., will return to fighting and work to completely defeat Hamas, change the reality in Gaza and achieve all the goals of the war,” the statement said. The question raised by Hamas’s latest statement is whether Israel and the United States will interpret it as a violation of the agreement. Mr. Trump had previously criticized Hamas on Tuesday, saying in a post on Truth Social that “the job is not done.” “The dead have not been returned, as promised,” he wrote. Mr. Trump also claimed that Hamas had agreed to disarm, though the group has not publicly confirmed that it would. In an interview with CNN earlier on Wednesday , Mr. Trump said that if Hamas refused to disarm, “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” suggesting that fighting in Gaza could resume. But Mr. Trump also celebrated the deal and said the long-term prospects for peace were positive, given regional support for his plan. Qatar, Egypt and Turkey were all mediators on the deal, along with the United States, and on Monday their heads of state and Mr. Trump signed a pledge to “work collectively” to implement the deal at a conference on the cease-fire held in Egypt and attended by dozens of world leaders. Under the terms of the deal, Hamas must share whatever intelligence it has about where bodies may be found, and there is still some chance that Israeli officials may accept what were the group’s expected protestations of being unable to retrieve the remains given the conditions in the Gaza Strip. The truce deal outlined how the remains of former hostages in Gaza might be located and returned if Hamas was unable to do so right away. It calls for the establishment of a joint task force, to include the United States and other mediators, that would share information and help find the remaining bodies, according to three Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak publicly. Those officials said Israel believed that Hamas knew the location of many, but not all, of the bodies.

3b93e3497381,Judge Throws Out Children’s Lawsuit Against Trump’s Energy Policies,"climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, us politics, lawsuits, decisions and verdicts, environment, pollution, judiciary, montana, our children's trust","A federal judge in Montana on Wednesday dismissed a novel lawsuit filed by 22 young people alleging that three of President Trump’s executive orders on energy and the environment violated their constitutional rights. Judge Dana L. Christensen wrote that he had “reluctantly” made the decision, despite convincing evidence presented by the plaintiffs during a two-day hearing last month showing that the executive orders would hasten climate change and exacerbate risks to the plaintiffs’ health and safety. In the 31-page decision, Judge Christensen wrote that the plaintiffs in the case, Lighthiser v. Trump, lacked a legal basis to bring the suit, largely because the harms they described could not be ameliorated by a judicial decision. The suit was simply too broad in scope and too amorphous to be actionable, he said. “Plaintiffs are effectively asking that this court order the United States to return to the environmental policy of the previous administration,” Judge Christensen wrote. The request for an injunction to block the three executive orders, he said, would require the court to monitor “an untold number” of federal agencies and determine whether their actions went against the court’s ruling. “This is, quite simply, an unworkable request for which plaintiffs provide no precedent,” the judge wrote. It was beyond the court’s remit, he concluded, to create environmental policy. He wrote that the case was similar to Juliana v. United States, a landmark case filed by some of the same plaintiffs in 2015. That case ultimately was dismissed after years of legal wrangling . The new lawsuit was filed in May by Our Children’s Trust and Public Justice, two public-interest law firms. They said on Wednesday that they would appeal Judge Christensen’s decision. “The judge recognized that the government’s fossil fuel directives are injuring these youth but said his hands were tied by precedent,” said Julia Olson, the founder of Our Children’s Trust and the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. She said the courts “cannot offer more protection to fossil fuel companies seeking to preserve their profits than to young Americans seeking to preserve their rights.” Judge Christensen dedicated long portions of the decision to recounting what expert witnesses and plaintiffs had testified about, including evidence that the climate is “changing at a staggering pace” because of the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide caused by the production and burning of fossil fuels. The Justice Department, which represented the president as well as the 12 federal agencies and their leaders named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The record further demonstrates that climate change and the exposure from fossil fuels presents a children’s health emergency,” the judge wrote. But in another passage, he said that while the court was troubled by the specter of climate change, “this concern does not automatically confer upon it the power to act.” Daniel J. Metzger, a senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said that the case was still a useful exercise despite its swift dismissal. “Briefing and arguing the case gave these plaintiffs the opportunity to explain the importance of these issues in a way captured public attention and blazed paths for future litigation,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/climate/montana-youth-trump-climate-lawsuit-dismissed.html,World,Washington Post,By Karen Zraick,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15cli-montana-lawsuit-htcp/15cli-montana-lawsuit-htcp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-15T20:19:37+00:00,4ac0e590266d725f150891f324df6c0d3f95c453
182e1cf9a0a5,"‘Doctor Mike,’ the popular YouTube creator, faults AMA communication strategies to counter misinformation","public health, stat summit","BOSTON — Mike Varshavski, a family physician and content creator who goes by Doctor Mike on YouTube, has made it his mission to combat medical misinformation. He’s attracted 14 million followers by communicating both clearly and entertainingly. He wishes leaders in medicine like the American Medical Association would do the same, he told attendees at the STAT Summit on Wednesday. While they mean well, he said they haven’t figured out how to reach a mass audience. One example: In a recent video, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sat back in his chair and claimed that doctors are profiting from keeping Americans sick. “And the AMA — which is the group that supposedly stands up for the physicians in America — issues a strongly worded tweet that reaches 5,000 people,” Varshavski said. “Or they get the president of the AMA to sit in front of a webcam with terrible audio, the screen reflecting in the glasses with no lighting, to also make a response video reading a script from a screen.” Earlier in the day, former high-ranking Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official Dan Jernigan, who resigned in August, also emphasized that professional medical organizations need to do more to counter unreliable statements from administration officials. Criticism of the country’s leading professional medical group is part of a wave of resistance from physicians to its historically quiet, behind-the-scenes advocacy strategy. Younger physicians in particular have petitioned AMA leaders to be more vocal about the way the Trump administration has pushed policies that aren’t adequately based on science or existing research. Varshavski also believes the group needs to be more approachable in its communication. “It’s not about putting on fancy outfits, it’s about being presentable [and] realizing that fancy cameras are no longer just for the top tier studios in Hollywood … I know how much AMA fees are each year and I know they can afford that,” Varshavski said. He believes that the administration’s high-quality videos and relaxed manner of speaking come off as more trustworthy to the general public or those who are less informed on the science. (The AMA declined to comment on Varshavaski’s remarks.) Before the Trump administration, federal health agencies weren’t successfully communicating with viewers either, Varshavski said. “How many times would I scroll past a CDC post with three likes on it? It’s literally the equivalent of not doing it,” he said. “Because if three people are seeing it, you’re just not doing anything valuable.” For years, there’s been a lack of “evidence-based voices online,” Varshavski argued, which left “a gap filled by grifters.” In the pandemic, he found this meant there weren’t enough doctors to fact check the rapidly spreading misinformation about the disease, how it spreads, and the vaccines. “As a result? People were confused. People were making bad decisions,” he said. Those same people have learned how to use social media platforms “while we all raise our noses in the health care community and say ‘we’re above this.’” Varshavski emphasized the value of infusing comedy and silliness into his “Doctor Mike” channel to encourage the platform’s algorithm to continue previewing his more serious content to potential viewers. A given comedic video can reach 5 or 10 million viewers. “Had I not made that silly video, they would be completely unaware of the fact that there was misinformation being shared with them at the highest levels,” he said. In this way, he looks to non-medical YouTube creators with huge followings like MrBeast for inspiration. “How do we crowbar some scientific education into these topics so that people are saying, ‘Wow, I normally watch MrBeast, but I could totally watch a Doctor Mike video,’” he said. Still, he is eager for public health leaders to join him in effectively bringing accurate medical information to the public: “I feel like my channel is just scratching the surface,” he said.",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/15/doctor-mike-mainstream-medicine-fight-misinformation-social-media,Health,Washington Post,Theresa Gaffney,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/R52_6644-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-15T21:01:45+00:00,4c264456d6f51eecca992104ce545de221e5c3c7
5e3e90533b25,Democratic governors form a public health alliance in rebuke of Trump administration,"covid-19, donald trump, public health","A group of Democratic state governors has launched a new alliance aimed at coordinating their public health efforts. They’re framing it as a way to share data, messages about threats, emergency preparedness and public health policy — and as a rebuke to President Donald Trump’s administration, which they say isn’t doing its job in public health. “At a time when the federal government is telling the states, ‘you’re on your own,’ governors are banding together,” Maryland Governor Wes Moore said in a statement. The formation of the group touches off a new chapter in a partisan battle over public health measures that has been heightened by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s advisers declining to recommend Covid-19 vaccinations , instead leaving the choice to the individual. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email that Democratic governors who imposed school closures and mask mandates, including for toddlers, at the height of the pandemic, are the ones who “destroyed public trust in public health.” “The Trump Administration and Secretary Kennedy are rebuilding that trust by grounding every policy in rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science – not the failed politics of the pandemic,” Nixon said. The initial members are all Democrats The Governors Public Health Alliance bills itself as a “nonpartisan coordinating hub,” but the initial members are all Democrats — the governors of 14 states plus Guam. Among them are governors of the most populous blue states, California and New York, and several governors who are considered possible 2028 presidential candidates, including California’s Gavin Newsom, Illinois’ JB Pritzker and Maryland’s Moore. The idea of banding together for public health isn’t new for Democratic governors. They formed regional groups to address the pandemic during Trump’s first term and launched new ones in recent months amid uncertainty on federal vaccine policy. States have also taken steps to preserve access to Covid-19 vaccines . The new alliance isn’t intended to supplant those efforts, or the coordination already done by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, its organizers say. A former CDC director is among the advisers Dr. Mandy Cohen, who was CDC director under former President Joe Biden and before that the head of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, is part of a bipartisan group of advisers to the alliance. “The CDC did provide an important backstop for expertise and support,” she said. “And I think now with some of that gone, it’s important for states to make sure that they are sharing best practices, and that they are coordinating, because the problems have not gone away. The health threats have not gone away.” Other efforts have also sprung up to try to fill roles that the CDC performed before the ouster of a director , along with other restructuring and downsizing. The Governors Public Health Alliance has support from GovAct, a nonprofit, nonpartisan donor-funded initiative that also has projects aimed at protecting democracy and another partisan hot-button issue, reproductive freedom. — Geoff Mulvihill and Mike Stobbe",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/15/democratic-governors-public-health-alliance-trump,Health,Washington Post,Associated Press,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25271075037671-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-15T20:23:38+00:00,8dbe2b2f1a620ab7e714e324d4c249f295ac5311
4f4e31557f83,Tua Tagovailoa apologizes to Dolphins teammates for comments,,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa apologized Wednesday for comments he made after Sunday's loss to the Chargers , when he criticized teammates for being late to players-only meetings. Tagovailoa opened his news conference Wednesday by apologizing for his comments and taking responsibility for their impact on his teammates. ""I've made a mistake and I'm owning up to that right now,"" he said. ""I've talked to guys on the team about it, talked to the leaders about it, and they know my heart. They know that the intent was right. But no matter the intent ... when things get misconstrued or however the media wants to portray it, that leaves a void of silence and a lot of questions for the guys on our team now being 1-5. We talk a lot about, 'All right, we got to get this going, come in excited to go to work, forget about the noise.' And I feel like I just added onto that for our guys. ""I've got to look at myself as the leader protecting the team. I don't feel like I did that to the best of my abilities. I felt like I let the emotions of the game get to me after the game. And that's something that I can learn from as a leader on this team and what happens in-house should be protected and none of that should have gotten out."" Shortly after Miami's 29-27 loss Sunday, Tagovailoa was asked how players would refrain from feeling sorry for themselves after a 1-5 start. He said the team's player leadership needed to clearly define expectations for the rest of the team -- and those expectations needed to be met. ""We have guys showing up to players-only meetings late, guys not showing up to players-only meetings,"" he said. ""There's a lot that goes into that. Do we have to make this mandatory? Do we not have to make this mandatory? ""It's a lot of things of that nature that we've got to get cleaned up, and it starts with little things like that."" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Monday that Tagovailoa's comments were ""misguided"" and were made in an improper forum. Multiple players, including Rasul Douglas , Aaron Brewer and Patrick Paul , declined to comment on Tagovailoa's public message from Sunday, saying team issues should be kept in-house. Defensive tackle Zach Sieler , who is a team captain like Tagovailoa, said everyone has a ""right to our opinion"" but otherwise said he didn't want to critique the quarterback. McDaniel said he hasn't had an issue with player attendance at team meetings, and that Tagovailoa's comments pertained only to players-only sessions. The Dolphins had an issue with tardiness and absences from team activities in previous seasons, but multiple players and coaches say those issues are behind them. ""There's been stuff in the past we have absolutely fixed,"" Sieler said. ""We have a lot of new guys on my side of the ball ... and I think we have a lot of guys that want to buy in. They're buying into the culture, they're trying to put their best foot forward. We aren't making some of the plays we need to make, and the best thing we can do is be present, deliver every practice to really hone in on those plays to make it as game-like as possible so on Sunday we start making those plays."" Tagovailoa said he made his original comments out of frustration, and conversations with his teammates opened him up to perspectives that he hadn't previously thought of. Miami's start to the season is its worst since 2021, when it started 1-7 before finishing 9-8 and one game out of the AFC playoff picture. Tagovailoa said adversity like what the Dolphins are currently facing teaches players a lot about each other -- but the rough start hasn't torn them apart just yet. ""I would say first and foremost, you get to see who a person really is as you're going through the hardships, right?"" he said. ""You get to see, 'OK, does this person start pointing fingers? Does this person take it upon themselves every time? How does everyone go about that?' I think you kind of get a good gauge about the team that you have as well with that. ""But I would say there hasn't been any bickering or pointing of fingers lately. There's just guys that are putting their head down, trying to work and do the best that they can to put us in the best position to win games.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46607089/tua-tagovailoa-apologizes-dolphins-teammates-comments,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560675_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,938e1f061018a5ffe9c487f8499d8b8d8975918c
73c84cb977dd,Eliminator power rankings: Use the Chiefs or Broncos in Week 7,,"Mackenzie Kraemer Close Works at ESPN Stats & Information Oct 15, 2025, 04:43 PM ET ESPN Eliminator Challenge is one of the most fun games to play this NFL season. The rules are simple: pick one team, and as long as they win (or tie), you advance to the next round. If they lose, you are out. The caveat is you cannot pick the same team twice. If you've made it this far, give yourself a pat on the back. For the fifth time in the first six weeks, at least 70% of remaining Eliminator Challenge entries survived in Week 6. After underdogs went 9-5 in Week 5, favorites bounced back to go 11-4 in Week 6, though one of those losses came when the Philadelphia Eagles fell to the New York Giants on Thursday. Overall, 13% of all entries remain this week, including people who tailed this column after the Green Bay Packers won as the biggest favorites last weekend. The Kansas City Chiefs are the biggest favorites according to the betting market and predictive models from both ESPN Analytics and Mike Clay, making them the clear pick in Week 7. The Chiefs will be the most popular choice, but given a tricky remaining schedule and a lack of other appealing options, it's hard not to eat the chalk. Mike Clay's Eliminator Challenge cheat sheet The Chiefs are now ranked as the No. 1 team by ESPN Analytics, however, they have only two games left against teams ranked in the bottom half of the NFL after this week -- Week 18 against the Raiders and Week 16 against the Tennessee Titans -- meaning there is less value in saving them for later. With their next easy game not coming until close to Christmas, it's fine to eat the chalk and take the biggest favorites on the board. Mike Clay chance to win: 89% ESPN Analytics chance to win: 79% ESPN BET line: Chiefs -12.5 (-1000 money line) Eliminator Challenge: 29% selected The Broncos are the second-biggest favorites this week according to both ESPN BET Sportsbook and ESPN Analytics. While the Giants are 2-1 since switching to quarterback Jaxson Dart , both wins came at home, with the only loss on the road against the struggling New Orleans Saints . The caveat with Denver is that they are also the biggest favorites in Week 10 (vs. Raiders), so burning the Broncos now could leave you exposed then. Mike Clay chance to win: 84% ESPN Analytics chance to win: 66% ESPN BET line: Broncos -7.5 (-425 money line) Eliminator Challenge: 6% selected The Titans are 4-19 since the start of last season, which cost head coach Brian Callahan his job, however there could be the possibility of a bounce-back. Since 2015, teams are 13-12 outright after replacing their coach midseason despite being underdogs in 19 of those 25 games. The Patriots are also in an unfamiliar role in their biggest road favorite role in four years. New England also has two games left against the New York Jets , plus games against the Cleveland Browns , Cincinnati Bengals , Miami Dolphins and Giants, so there will be more chances to use them. They are still one of the biggest favorites this week, but there are plenty of reasons to be wary of this spot. Mike Clay chance to win: 86% ESPN Analytics chance to win: 66% ESPN BET line: Patriots -7.5 (-360 money line) Eliminator Challenge: 11% selected Facing the No. 30 team according to ESPN Analytics at home is always a strong target in Eliminator Challenge. However, despite their three-game winning streak, the Bears still rank No. 22 themselves, and Mike Clay's model is significantly lower on the Bears than the other options on this list. The Bears have three potential usable games down the road -- Week 9 (at Bengals), Week 10 (vs. Giants) and Week 15 (vs. Browns) -- but they aren't among the top five favorites in those weeks according to ESPN Analytics. Mike Clay chance to win: 69% ESPN Analytics chance to win: 65% ESPN BET line: Bears -4.5 (-240 money line) Eliminator Challenge: 17% selected The Bengals are the second-worst team according to ESPN Analytics, even with the quarterback move to Joe Flacco , who ranks No. 31 in Total QBR this season, one spot behind Jake Browning . A short week is tough for Flacco to gain chemistry with his new team, and the Steelers have played the Bengals well recently, covering each of the past four meetings. On the other hand, the Steelers are trending to be the biggest favorites in Week 11 (again vs. Bengals), so there is a cost to using them this week. Though the Giants upset the Eagles last week as a Thursday home underdog, there is no historical uptick in performance for Thursday home underdogs.

45824671be60,China’s Own Immigration Backlash,"international relations, foreign workers, communist party of china, china, donald trump, nicolas maduro, venezuela","China may not be ready for an influx of foreigners In the race for global talent, it can often appear that China is gaining ground on the United States. While President Trump cuts research funding for universities, China is pouring money into science. The number of high-profile scholars who have left the U.S. for China is growing; Chinese students who once dreamed of an American education are now choosing to stay home. So when China introduced a new type of visa , called a K visa, for young science and technology workers, just as the Trump administration introduced steep new fees for highly skilled worker visas, many around the world saw it as another way that China may be pulling ahead in an economic rivalry that encompasses trade, tariffs and talent. Then came the backlash . The response to the K visa seems to have caught even the Chinese government by surprise. It helps illustrate why predictions that China is on the verge of becoming the next global talent hub may be premature. A hard country for foreigners As news of the visa spread across Chinese social media, the dominant reaction was not celebration but horror. High-profile commentators worried that China would become a country of immigrants — not, in their eyes, a good thing. Racist and xenophobic comments spread furiously, especially about Indians, who make up a significant share of the high tech work force in the U.S. Others worried the visa would worsen already record-high youth unemployment in China. China has virtually no history of inbound immigration. Foreigners provoke a range of reactions, including curiosity and suspicion influenced by geopolitical tensions between China and the West. There are also practical challenges. The ability to speak Mandarin is crucial to navigating daily life. Getting a visa and work permit can be cumbersome. Even routine tasks, like renewing a home Wi-Fi contract or buying concert tickets, can be more difficult for people without Chinese ID cards. Heavy censorship of the internet and a rigidly controlled political environment can also be hard for people from other countries to get used to. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

f62d98740fae,"49ers QB Brock Purdy (toe) returns to practice, though limited",,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy returned to practice Wednesday, the first significant step in the direction of a potential return from the toe injury he aggravated in Week 4. Purdy, who will be limited in practice this week according to coach Kyle Shanahan, initially injured the toe in a Week 1 win against the Seattle Seahawks . He missed two games and returned against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sept. 28 but aggravated the injury in that game and has not played or practiced since. The absence of Purdy paired with injuries to backup Mac Jones (knee/oblique) has left the Niners practicing without their top two quarterbacks for chunks of the season. Jones was also limited Wednesday, though Shanahan indicated Jones would do more than Purdy. ""Brock is more limited than Mac,"" Shanahan said. ""Injuries frustrate people, but Brock is handling it right like he does everything. I know he's itching to get back."" Before that Week 4 contest, the opposite was true as Jones was more limited during the week than Purdy with Purdy eventually starting. Purdy and Jones will continue to be monitored as the week goes on with the Niners having a bit of extra rest because they play the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday night with an 8:20 ET kickoff. There's a chance that whichever quarterback starts against the Falcons will have a key part of the offense returning in the form of tight end George Kittle . The Niners officially opened Kittle's 21-day practice window on Wednesday and are hoping to have Kittle available against Atlanta. Even during the team's Wednesday morning walkthrough, multiple Niners said Kittle's energy was palpable as he works his way back from what Shanahan called a ""big"" hamstring pull. ""I think it would be great [to get Kittle back],"" running back Christian McCaffrey said. ""His presence is felt in every aspect of the game and his energy is so great, so it would be great to have him back out there."" Meanwhile. Linebacker Fred Warner had surgery on his dislocated and broken right ankle Tuesday. Shanahan has indicated the recovery process could take about three months but said it's too early to set a definitive timeline. ""Just talking to everyone, they said [surgery] went great,"" Shanahan said. ""I just threw out there three months, but we haven't thought about that yet. He just had surgery yesterday, so we'll see how that goes but not thinking about that right now."" Elsewhere on the 49ers' injury report, receivers Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Skyy Moore (ankle) were not expected to practice, per Shanahan. In addition to Purdy, Kittle and Jones, other Niners slated to be limited are receivers Jauan Jennings (ribs, ankle, shoulder) Jordan Watkins (calf), guard Dominick Puni (knee), defensive tackles Kevin Givens (pectoral), CJ West (thumb) and Kalia Davis (hand) and cornerback Renardo Green (neck).",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46608014/49ers-qb-brock-purdy-toe-returns-practice-limited,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0326%2Fr1469719_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,2063d602099007d23f7f888b5afda44bb1ed2d9c
c1b00f9eb047,Virginia Giuffre Recalls Jeffrey Epstein’s Abuse and Trafficking in Harrowing Memoir Excerpt,,"Virginia Giuffre recounts her recruitment by Ghislaine Maxwell at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort , the first time Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused her, and being allegedly trafficked to billionaires, academics, politicians, and even Prince Andrew in the first excerpt from her posthumous memoir, Nobody’s Girl , published in The Guardian . Giuffre, who died by suicide this past April, spent the last few years of her life working on her memoir, reportedly completing the manuscript last fall. It’s now set to be published on Oct. 21 . As one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers , many of Giuffre’s most harrowing allegations have already come out in lawsuits and court documents. And while the book still finds her offering an extensive account of her time being trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell, she also reflects on the abuse she suffered as a child, and her decision to come forward about Epstein and Maxwell. As she writes in the new Nobody’s Girl excerpt, Giuffre fell into Epstein’s orbit after taking a job at Mar-a-Lago, where her dad also worked. She briefly describes meeting Trump at the resort, and how the future president — and known Epstein associate — helped her find additional work babysitting for wealthy friends who lived nearby. A few weeks before turning 17, Giuffre writes that Maxwell spotted her walking towards the spa at Mar-a-Lago, holding a book on anatomy, which the teen had “jammed with sticky notes.” Picking up on Giuffre’s interest in learning massage, Giuffre says Maxwell invited her to meet Epstein later that night, as the financier was “looking for a massage therapist to travel with him.” Giuffre recalls how the walls of Epstein’s home were “crowded with photos and paintings of nude women.” She also remembers Epstein was already naked on a massage table when she met him for the first time. Giuffre says Maxwell taught her how to massage Epstein, and at one point “put her hands on top of mine and guided them to [Epstein’s] rear.” She writes: “Only later would I see how, step by practiced step, the two of them were breaking down my defenses. Every time I felt a twinge of discomfort, one glance at Maxwell told me I was overreacting. And so it went for about half an hour: a seemingly legitimate massage lesson.” During the massage, Giuffre says Epstein asked her increasingly probing questions, including whether she took birth control and the first time she had sex. When Giuffre alluded to having spent time on the street as a runaway, she says Epstein teased her for being a “naughty girl.” When Giuffre rebuffed him, Epstein replied, “It’s OK. I like naughty girls.” At that point, Giuffre writes, Epstein “rolled over onto his back” and revealed his erection. Giuffre says Maxwell kept showing her how to massage Epstein, who then began to masturbate and asked, “You don’t mind, do you?” Giuffre says this was “the moment that something cracked inside me,” describing her memories as “jagged shards”: “Maxwell peeling off her clothes, a mischievous look on her face; Maxwell behind me, unzipping my skirt and pulling my Mar-a-Lago polo shirt over my head; Epstein and Maxwell laughing at my underwear, which were dotted with tiny hearts. ‘How cute — she still wears little girl’s panties,’ Epstein said. He reached for a vibrator, which he forced between my thighs, as Maxwell commanded me to pinch Epstein’s nipples as she rubbed her own breasts, and mine.” The excerpt continues: “I could feel my brain begin to shut down. My body couldn’t escape from this room, but my mind couldn’t bear to stay, so it put me on a kind of autopilot: submissive and determined to survive.” Not long after this encounter, Giuffre says Epstein convinced her to quit her job at Mar-a-Lago and work for him. She says he gave her money to move into her own apartment and not-so-subtly threatened her to keep quiet about what happened inside the house. Giuffre claims Epstein showed her a blurry photo of her brother at his school, and claimed to “own the Palm Beach police department.” She then writes about when Epstein and Maxwell “began lending [her] out to their friends.” These included: A billionaire with a pregnant wife, a “psychology professor whose research Epstein was helping to fund,” academics, scientists, “a gubernatorial candidate who was soon to win election in a western state, and a former U.S. senator.” Giuffre says Epstein did not introduce these men to her by name, and she only learned some of their identities “years later, when [she] studied photographs of Epstein’s associates and recognized their faces.” The excerpt ends with Giuffre recalling her first alleged encounter with Prince Andrew in 2001. (Andrew has long denied Giuffre’s allegations and settled a high-profile sexual assault suit with her in 2022.) Upon introducing them, Giuffre says Maxwell encouraged Andrew to guess Giuffre’s age. After he correctly guessed 17, Giuffre writes that Andrew allegedly told her, “My daughters are just a little younger than you.” Giuffre says Maxwell then joked, “I guess we will have to trade her in soon.” After a night out, Giuffre says Maxwell instructed her, “When we get home, you are to do for [Andrew] what you do for Jeffrey.” Recalling Andrew’s alleged behavior that night, Giuffre writes that he was “friendly enough, but still entitled — as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.” Giuffre says Epstein gave her $15,000 “for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy.’” Gifuffre recalls two other alleged encounters with Andrew, one at Epstein’s townhouse in New York, the other on Epstein’s infamous private island. The latter she describes as “an orgy,” quoting a previous deposition where she said it included Epstein, Andrew, and “eight other young girls.” In the memoirs writes that Epstein told her that Jean-Luc Brunel, the late French modeling agent, “supplied the other girls who took part.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/virginia-giuffre-epstein-abuse-prince-andrew-book-1235448211,Entertainment,Washington Post,Jon Blistein,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2207574917.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-15T21:27:23+00:00,48b3e7a9a3fa5faf96d12949cc2f47ffca623f92

Thousands of mourners crammed the narrow pathways between rows of uniform stone graves in the military cemetery on Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl. They had come for the burial, after sunset, of Capt. Daniel Peretz, a tank commander killed in battle on Oct. 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack that ignited the two-year war in Gaza. Earlier on Wednesday, Guy Iluz, a sound technician who was shot and taken hostage while fleeing a music festival during the October 2023 attack, was laid to rest in his hometown, Ra’anana, in central Israel. It has been a long goodbye for Captain Peretz’s family. The soldier, who was 22, was killed defending the border with his crew against waves of gunmen from Gaza. One member of the four-man crew was found dead afterward, but the three others, including Captain Peretz, were gone. Months later, in March 2024, the Peretz family received notification from the military that Daniel was dead and that his body was in Gaza. The family held a partial funeral for him then, burying his blood-soaked uniform. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

You can reach Tara on Signal at tarabannow.70. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is pausing Medicare payments to doctors, as negotiations tied to the government shutdown drag on. CMS announced the pause in a notice on its website but didn’t say when it would end. It’s happening because Congress needs to reauthorize certain Medicare payment programs related to telehealth and rural providers, and that reauthorization has gotten wrapped up in the overall deal to reopen the government. It’s not clear why all physician payments have been cut off rather than just the programs that need to be renewed. CMS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oct 15, 2025, 06:05 PM ET The Baltimore Orioles , seeking a new manager to guide their young, emerging core, have expressed interest in future Hall of Fame first baseman Albert Pujols, sources told ESPN. The Orioles have yet to formally interview Pujols but are expected to as they seek a replacement for Brandon Hyde, who was fired in the early portion of what became a disappointing 87-loss season in 2025. Tony Mansolino, who took over as interim manager after Hyde was let go in May, is among the candidates for the full-time position, but the Orioles are also conducting an external search. Orioles president of baseball operations Mike Elias was a scout for the St. Louis Cardinals while Pujols starred for the organization in the latter half of the 2000s. Pujols, 45, still shares a close relationship with former teammate Matt Holliday, father of Jackson Holliday , the 21-year-old infielder who is now one of the Orioles' foundational players. The Los Angeles Angels still appear to be the most likely destination for Pujols and remain the only team he has formally interviewed with, industry sources said. Pujols met with Angels general manager Perry Minasian in St. Louis last Thursday and is still highly considered for the job, though former All-Star outfielder Torii Hunter is also a serious candidate. The Angels' hiring process, however, might be slowed by owner Arte Moreno and president John Carpino's involvement in the civil trial over the death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs . It was only a couple of years ago that the Orioles looked like a team on the rise, emerging from an aggressive rebuild to win 101 games and capture the American League East title in 2023. They returned to the playoffs with a 91-win season in 2024 but got swept out of the wild-card round and were not aggressive in their pursuit of starting pitching during the ensuing offseason. A 15-28 start led to Hyde's firing on May 17. The next 4½ months weren't much better, but the Orioles are nonetheless an attractive destination due to a young, promising position-player core featuring Holliday, Gunnar Henderson , Adley Rutschman , Coby Mayo and Samuel Basallo . At the moment, they are among eight teams with manager openings, along with the Angels, Atlanta Braves , San Francisco Giants , Washington Nationals , San Diego Padres , Colorado Rockies and Minnesota Twins . Pujols has expressed strong interest in managing at the big league level for years and led a Dominican winter ball team, the Leones del Escogido, to a championship in January. Pujols was previously named manager for his native Dominican Republic in next year's World Baseball Classic, though he would likely rescind that role if he lands a big league job this offseason.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46608255/baltimore-orioles-interested-albert-pujols-manager,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560752_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,f24bd1a993d339a89cdd7c6ffbb40eb47391a2a6

His replacement, Rico Dowdle , complicated the situation with 473 yards from scrimmage -- a two-game team record -- in wins against the Miami Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys . Dowdle had 389 rushing yards, falling 17 yards shy of becoming only the fifth back in NFL history to have consecutive 200-yard games. His rushing total alone was 172 yards more than the 217 that Hubbard had in the first four games as the starter. ""I believe in full transparency,'' coach Dave Canales said when pressed about who might start. ""I believe in having these conversations early on to talk about what it may look like and give the guys the benefit of the doubt to say, 'OK, let's look at the situation that we currently are in. Let's deal with the facts and let's move forward from there.' ""I don't like to paint myself into a box to say a guy can't lose his job to injury. That's a dangerous spot to put yourself in when a person shows you what they can do."" Pushed further about whether Dowdle had earned the right to start, Canales said that he's ""earned the right to help this team, and he will."" Canales said the coaching staff will ""find a way to do that,"" but didn't give details. Dowdle and Hubbard made it clear it didn't matter who started. ""We're both very talented players,'' Hubbard said. ""I can't say what it's going to look like exactly or how it's going to be. I'm not the coach. But obviously, two great backs. Anytime you can put us on the field, let's do it."" Dowdle was equally humble about who gets the ball first, saying it doesn't matter who starts ""as long as we all are getting the ball and things like that ... helping the team win."" Dowdle said there are benefits to having both backs play, even though both admitted the more repetitions a back has, the easier it is to get in a rhythm. ""It's going to allow us both to be fresh throughout the whole game,'' Dowdle said. ""We've seen the past two games. I've cramped up late.'' Hubbard was listed as limited Wednesday in his first practice in more than two weeks. ""He's got a real focused look in his eyes,'' Canales said. ""He's hungry and can't wait to get back out there.''",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46608068/panthers-face-choice-chuba-hubbard-rico-dowdle,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0523%2Fr1497202_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,7783ca008d00db318f63ce6d4590d21e8c2e39f4
45259182fb6a,Guatemala Welcomes U.S. Help in Gang Crackdown After Prison Break,"guatemala, bernardo arévalo, prison escape, prison, us foreign policy, gang, barrio 18, el salvador, nayib bukele, deportation","Days after it was revealed that scores of accused gang members had escaped unnoticed from a maximum-security prison, President Bernardo Arévalo of Guatemala called for an overhaul of the country’s prison system, where gangs are believed to operate unchecked amid rampant bribery and corruption, and said the United States would provide support. “We will have the support of the F.B.I. and other United States security agencies, whose experience and technical capacity will strengthen our security systems and make our fight against organized crime more effective,” Mr. Arévalo said in a national address on Wednesday afternoon. “We are not alone in this fight,” the president added. The inmates who escaped from Fraijanes II prison, a maximum-security facility outside Guatemala City, were described by officials as high-ranking operatives from the Barrio 18 gang, which has long been linked to organized crime and violence around Central America and which the Trump administration designated as a foreign terrorist organization in late September. The designation places Barrio 18 on the same list as MS-13, a rival group in neighboring El Salvador, as well as the region’s most powerful drug cartels. The escape was initially revealed on Sunday by Guatemala’s director of prisons, who said that prison officials had only detected the scheme — in which inmates may have slipped out one by one, or in pairs — after hearing rumors and checking inmates’ biometric data. The revelation immediately erupted into a political crisis, with the head of prisons dismissed and Guatemalans threatening to protest. On Wednesday, Mr. Arévalo announced that several senior officials — including Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez — would also be replaced. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

b4011dc25dd0,NBA,,"Sacramento Kings forward Keegan Murray has agreed to a five-year, $140 million rookie contract extension with the franchise, representatives Mark Bartelstein and Kyle McAlarney of Priority Sports told ESPN. Murray, the No. 4 pick in the 2022 NBA draft, secures a long-term extension to remain a key two-way wing in Sacramento through 2030-31. Murray hit the ground running with the Kings in his first season, making the All-Rookie team and helping Sacramento end its playoff drought as a full-time starter. His offensive numbers have plateaued some since that season, but he has developed as a strong defender, a big need for an offensively slanted Kings team. He is one of three players to record 500 3-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals over the past three seasons, along with Minnesota's Anthony Edwards and Boston's Derrick White , according to ESPN Research. He serves as the Kings' primary perimeter defender, guarding 2025 All-Stars for 1,005 half-court matchups last season, fifth most in the NBA. Murray averaged 12.4 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 34.3 minutes in 76 games last season. The 25-year-old had been remarkably healthy through the first three years of his career, having played 233 out of 246 total games, starting all but two of them. However, he will miss at least the first 10 games this season after suffering a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb during a preseason game and undergoing surgery. Murray is one of seven players to make at least 150 3-pointers in each of his first three NBA seasons, according to ESPN Research. His absence means the Kings will be without a crucial floor spacer and their most trusted stopper in the opening month as they look to compete for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. Murray is the sixth player to agree to a rookie extension this year ahead of Monday's 11:59 p.m. ET deadline.

The hearing officer was Jordy Nelson, who was jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association. The NFL on Monday suspended Branch for one game without pay for unsportsmanlike conduct after he struck Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and set off a brief fight Sunday night. ""Your aggressive, non-football act was entirely unwarranted, posed a serious risk of injury, and clearly violated the standards of conduct and sportsmanship expected of NFL players,"" NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan wrote in a letter to Branch explaining the suspension. ""Your conduct reflected poorly on the NFL and has no place in our game.""

3d8b886d2e22,Bears' Caleb Williams 'could care less' about outside criticism,,"LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Bears quarterback Caleb Williams on Wednesday said he ""could care less"" about commentary about his play following Chicago's victory on ""Monday Night Football."" ""People are going to say what they have to say,"" Williams said after the Bears extended their win streak to three games after a second straight come-from-behind victory against the Washington Commanders . ""We win, we lose; people have stuff to say. It was lucky, it was not lucky; people have stuff to say. Have a bad game, have a good game; people have stuff to say. ""It doesn't matter. We're only worried about what's going on here within this building and with these guys. That's all I can say about that."" Williams on Wednesday was questioned about how his performance was characterized as being ""off"" during ESPN's ""Monday Night Football"" broadcast. Analyst Troy Aikman said Williams needed to do a better job of where he was throwing the ball to his receivers to allow them to gain more yards after the catch. As the Bears rallied from an eight-point deficit in the fourth quarter, Williams threw a short pass to D'Andre Swift , who went 55 yards for a touchdown to cut Washington's lead to two. Of the play, Aikman said that Commanders safety Quan Martin missed a tackle, which led to Swift being as open as he was, and that receiver DJ Moore pushed cornerback Marshon Lattimore into Martin, who was supposed to be covering Swift. ""Just some luck on Chicago's part,"" Aikman said on the broadcast. ""It really wasn't so much intended to be a pick [play], but it turned into that based on how it was defended."" Williams, saying he was ""messing around,"" poked fun at Aikman's characterization of the touchdown in an Instagram post Tuesday. ""Nations Cap, good being back!"" Williams' caption said . ""It was lucky"" -TA. Whooptie Doo [laughing emojis]."" ""D'Andre made a great play and obviously [Aikman] had some stuff to say about us or me and, I mean, we came out victorious in the end,"" Williams said Wednesday. ""Made a little fun moment of it. That was about it."" Caleb Williams threw for 252 yards and accounted for two TDs against the Commanders while leading the Bears to their second straight come-from-behind victory to extend their win streak to three. Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images Bears coach Ben Johnson told team broadcaster Jeff Joniak that he caught a portion of the broadcast Tuesday morning while his children watched the second half of the game while getting ready for school. ""It sounded like from that game the other night, a few people weren't particularly pleased with how we are winning right now,"" Johnson said. ""But listen, in this league, any way you can find a way to win is a big deal."" When later asked whether Aikman's tone surprised him, Johnson said, ""Maybe I just had it on mute."" ""We need to go earn that respect from not only the rest of the teams in the NFL, but everybody,"" Johnson said. ""Everyone is going to have their own opinion on us as a team and each player, each coach individually. You do your best to block the outside noise. We know what we're building here. We're starting to believe in each other. The more time that we get together, I feel that. I feel it building, and I think that's the most important thing. ""Ultimately, you do want the respect of your peers -- in particular, the people you're working with -- and I think that trickles outside the building as well with how you compete and what you put on the tape as well. So, yeah, that's a good thing. But at the same time, we're more concerned about what we're doing on a daily basis and what we're doing for each other."" Asked Wednesday if he met with the ""Monday Night Football"" broadcast team ahead of the game against the Commanders, Williams said that he did not because of a schedule conflict and then was unable to connect with Aikman at a different time. Williams did speak with ESPN's Laura Rutledge on the sideline pregame. A source told ESPN that Williams also did not participate in meetings with the broadcast team prior to the Bears' appearance on ""MNF"" in Week 1. A person with knowledge of ESPN's production meetings said it is considered ""very rare"" for starting quarterbacks to not meet with the broadcast crew. Williams anticipated that the perceived criticisms of his game would be used as motivation going forward. ""When you're in a competitive situation like Coach is, or myself, or other teammates, when people have stuff to say about you, whether it's that week or a whole year or whatever the case may be, I think you do use it as a little bit of fuel, as a little bit of motivation,"" Williams said. ""I think that's always a part of it as a competitor. ... But you don't put too much into it to where it affects you negatively.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46608923/bears-caleb-williams-care-less-criticism,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559830_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,eb2cd5317c2005cb5d97ea286c62ad74988f2463
20a95274322c,George Pickens noncommittal on future with Cowboys after '25,,"FRISCO, Texas -- George Pickens ' start to his first season with the Dallas Cowboys has many wondering whether he would want to remain with the organization after 2025. ""I wouldn't mind it,"" Pickens said Wednesday. ""The guys in the locker room are super cool. The energy is great. But, like I've said, I always want to showcase my talents, most definitely."" Pickens, acquired in a trade from the Pittsburgh Steelers in May, is set to become an unrestricted free agent after the season. Pickens has 32 catches for 525 yards, and he has scored six touchdowns over the past five games. His six touchdowns are a career high, and if he scores again Sunday against the Washington Commanders , he would become the first Dallas wideout with a receiving touchdown in six straight games since Terrell Owens in 2007. Pickens and Amari Cooper are the only Cowboys receivers to record at least 500 receiving yards and six touchdowns in their first six games with the Cowboys. Asked whether the looming contract situation makes him nervous, Pickens said, ""I probably wouldn't say all that because I'm definitely in the middle of the season, so I'm not fully, fully thinking about it. I kind of just want to keep going and see how far we can get as far as the playoffs and things like that."" Cowboys Pro Bowl receiver CeeDee Lamb makes $34 million a year. Lamb has missed the past three games with a high left ankle sprain but is expected to return Sunday against the Commanders. He was listed as limited Wednesday. Asked what he needs to see from Lamb in order for him to play Sunday, coach Brian Schottenheimer said, ""Yeah, if he's breathing, I'd feel pretty good. ... Honestly. Nah, I mean CeeDee knows how to play football. If he runs around and catches a pass or two, I'm good."" Lamb's return, plus Pickens' productivity, should make the league's No. 1 offense in yards and No. 3 in points better. ""Way more dangerous, way more explosive, too, when you got other guys like CeeDee and [ KaVontae Turpin ] out there,"" Pickens said. ""It's another component of explosiveness that you can't really describe."" Pickens, who turns 25 next March, figures to be one of the most sought-after receivers in free agency should he become available. The Cowboys also could look to use the franchise tag on him. On Tuesday, owner and general manager Jerry Jones did not want to get into whether the team would like to open talks on a new contract with Pickens now, but he said he is pleased with how the trade has worked out. ""In every aspect of it, he's doing more than we did expect or that we could have expected,"" Jones said. ""And what's really special is he's a real plus to have around the team. He's a real plus around his teammates. He's a great plus around those coaches, and the coaches really think highly of him. So he's not only doing it on the field, he's doing it as part of the team concept, and that's very important and, in his particular case, should be noted. ""You know, we'll weigh that. We knew full well that if things really went like we want them to go, that certainly we needed to think about having some room available if we were going to pay a second receiver at that level.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46608737/george-pickens-noncommittal-future-cowboys-25,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559226_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,bfb8d35f0f0660446563704be7d35b8b05c1a7c0
75dda2e6f796,Get ahead of fantasy football's Week 8 bye-mageddon by stashing these players today,,"Fantasy Football Week 7 begins Thursday and fantasy managers must replace Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens in this week's lineups. Two teams.  Meh. That's nothing compared to next week, when six teams will not be playing. They are the Detroit Lions , Las Vegas Raiders , Los Angeles Rams , Arizona Cardinals , Seattle Seahawks and Jacksonville Jaguars . In fantasy, these weeks are known as bye-mageddons, and fantasy managers should aim to plan for this inevitability, if possible. We are here to help. If you've got the bench room, here's some moves you make now to avoid next weeks waiver-wire rush. Quarterback Jared Goff and Sam Darnold are the highest-scoring QBs (entering Week 7) serving a Week 8 bye, with Goff rostered in more than 75% of leagues. New York Giants rookie Jaxson Dart (41.7%) may not feel like an appealing option for Week 7 at the Denver Broncos , but he has a rematch with the sputtering Philadelphia Eagles in Week 8. Dart scored 23.6 PPR points in Week 6 against the Eagles. Add him now and keep him around. Other readily available QBs to add in advance include Minnesota Vikings starter (if healthy) J.J. McCarthy (29.5%) against the Los Angeles Chargers , Atlanta Falcons left-hander Michael Penix Jr . (15.5%) at home against the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals 40-year-old Joe Flacco against the New York Jets . Running back Things are more difficult at this production-starved position with no Jahmyr Gibbs , Ashton Jeanty , Kyren Williams and Travis Etienne Jr . off in Week 8. Start with this week's top pickup, Los Angeles Chargers fill-in Kimani Vidal (58.5%). Add him now before you miss out. Houston Texans rookie Woody Marks (56%) should see an uptick in volume this week, and in Week 8 he faces the San Francisco 49ers . After that, it is mostly about backups, with Pittsburgh Steelers surprise Kenneth Gainwell (59.5%), the Atlanta Falcons' Tyler Allgeier (34.2%), the Tennessee Titans' Tyjae Spears (27%) and New Orleans Saints' Kendre Miller (23.3%). Wide receiver The three highest-scoring WRs in PPR formats will not play in Week 8 ( Puka Nacua , Jaxon Smith-Njigba , Amon-Ra St. Brown . Read that one again! It will be tough replacing 20 PPR points per game. The Green Bay Packers play in the Week 8 Sunday night game in Pittsburgh, making Romeo Doubs (59.4%) and potentially Jayden Reed (44.7%) attractive. The Indianapolis Colts are hosting the Tennessee Titans , making Josh Downs (46.9%) and potentially Alec Pierce (2%) worth a look. Atlanta's Darnell Mooney (42.6%), San Francisco's Kendrick Bourne (41.9%), New England's Kayshon Boutte (20%) and Denver's Troy Franklin (33.7%) are other options with reasonable matchups. We can only guess which Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be available in a week to face the Saints, but Sterling Shepard (17.2%) and Tez Johnson (9.4%) are out there today. You may not need them this week, but you may in Week 8. Tight end Arizona's Trey McBride , arguably the top option at the position, is off in Week 8, along with Sam LaPorta and Brock Bowers (who may be off this week as well). Cleveland Browns rookie Harold Fannin Jr . (46.3%) faces the Patriots in Week 8. The Jets' Mason Taylor (29.5%), Tampa Bay's Cade Otton (17.5%) and Houston's Dalton Schultz make sense as deeper-league additions as well. D/ST Many may wish to keep the Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions units rostered because they enter Week 7 having scored among the most PPR points in fantasy. That is a reasonable decision, under the circumstances. Punt the others. Readily available units worth streaming for Week 8 include the Buffalo Bills (51.4%) at Carolina, the Los Angeles Chargers (23.6%) versus the Minnesota Vikings and the Atlanta Falcons (9.2%) hosting the Miami Dolphins . And please don't ask about kickers. Never keep a kicker on the bench. Just replace them.",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/46607981/fantasy-football-waiver-wire-adds-bye-week-fills,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560619_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,7ccfe3a7511664a11b9250b0a6e29a848bd3278c
7711ded32cd4,Chelsea's Champions League response vs. Paris FC comes at right time,,"LONDON -- Chelsea finally showed their best after a string of lackluster performances with a 4-0 victory over Paris FC to boost their confidence ahead of the international break. It is a result that has come at the best time for Chelsea. It is funny to say, but things looked rather bleak heading into the UEFA Women's Champions League clash with Paris FC, given they had points on the table in the competition -- only one following a 1-1 draw with Twente -- and comfortably at the top of the Women's Super League table by a point. But it was their performances and low scoring that were puzzling fans. Several poor results -- a 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur , 1-1 draw with Manchester United and 1-0 win over Leicester City -- has plagued them this season despite boasting one of the best attacks in Europe. - Chelsea in Women's Champions League: Fixtures, results, news - Watch every Chelsea UWCL game from this season on Disney+ - UWCL recap: Chelsea and Barça cruise, USWNT's Thompson and Yohannes impress The team were in a rut, failing to convert their chances and looking complacent in the final third. Against Spurs, they failed to convert 24 of their 25 chances and even broke the league record for touches in an opposition box, yet fell short of adding to the score line. Manager Sonia Bompastor admitted she was strong with her players after a run of performances that she deemed were not up to their normal standard. Though she says she is with them and will back them, she also knows when to demand more. ""I'm someone who is quite direct and honest and open with my players, so I will always protect them here in this room, but when I have to analyze the game and I think maybe we don't perform at our role, I'm quite direct and honest with them,"" she said, asking what caused the turnaround. ""I'm really pleased with the reaction we showed on the pitch from, as I said, the last two games. I think in both games, we were a better team. We created a lot. We couldn't score more than one goal at the weekend, but at least we created a lot of chances, and I think if we stay at that level, we'll be the better place in the future. ""The only thing we can do is keep working hard, but our mentality, as you could see tonight, it was better in a better way."" Before breaking the deadlock against Paris FC, Chelsea squandered six chances. It looked at one point that it was going to be another game in which the Blues misfired in the final third. Credit to the Paris goalkeeper Mylene Chavas , who pulled off several exceptional saves to keep Chelsea at bay, but had it not been for a contested penalty on Sjoeke Nüsken , which Sandy Baltimore converted with precision, the hosts could have been looking at another poor evening. The penalty broke the deadlock and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd netted a header, which did not look like she meant for it to end up goalward, before Alyssa Thompson -- her first goal since signing for the club in the summer -- and Sam Kerr -- whose last Champions League goal, a hat-trick no less, came against Paris FC two years -- to add to the comfortable performance. It feels like Chelsea's players are hitting their stride at the right time, too. Kerr endured a 22-month absence while recovering from an ACL injury and related setbacks. Though she will have a consistent, phased return in order to build her fitness and minutes, scoring her second goal after returning to action -- her first came in her first game back against Aston Villa -- could not have come at a better time for a tired squad, who face four more crucial Champions League matches before the knockout phase at the start of next year. Here reintroduction has felt like a bonus new signing. Chelsea get their first win of the Women's Champions League campaign, after beating Paris FC 4-0. (Photo by Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty Images) Having carved space in a stacked team to start six games since her club record signing, Thompson also netted her first goal, vindicating why the Blues worked so hard to secure her signature. With 26 shots and nine chances on target, a four-goal performance is more consistent with the Chelsea side that cruised to a domestic treble last season, despite missing key figures like Ellie Carpenter , who was rested following the tight turnaround from Sunday's league game, Lucy Bronze , who has begun a phased return to play, Mayra Ramírez and Naomi Girma . It is a mark of a champion that even when they weren't at their best or racking up big scores, Chelsea were able to secure points and grind out wins. Bompastor admitted that staying at the top, especially after reaching new heights last season, is far harder when balancing minutes following a strenuous summer tournament. ""If you drop five, 10% of your energy, your mentality, you will be in trouble,"" Bompastor said. ""So I think that's the most difficult thing in football sometimes, to stay at that level. Especially when you are coming from the summer, where a lot of players were really busy. So mentally, physically, when you come back to the club, it doesn't go just like this. All of ESPN.

We had some big injuries with some big players in the squad, also. I think when we analyzed that block one [September until October], I think in terms of results, especially, it was a really good block and finishing with these two games was a perfect way to finish that."" Chelsea's broader bounce-back has come at a key time. While the break will arguably stall this momentum a little, it will allow the players to rest before returning to a cohesive, more confident side off the back of the comfortable win. When they return to league action, they will host newcomers London City Lionesses , who have picked up form at crucial times, before facing Arsenal at home, who, despite winning the competition, have lacked form and cohesion. Reflecting on this block of games, Bompastor said she is ""really pleased"" with how her team looks. Time will tell if this new-found form is going to stick.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46608928/chelsea-women-uefa-champions-league-paris-fc-sonia-bompastor,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560785_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e2d93ecb20952d43faa1d426a093d3b089f247c9
12166ae06434,Man Accused of Setting Devastating Pacific Palisades Fire Indicted By Federal Grand Jury,,"A federal grand jury indicted the 29-year-old man accused of starting a fire that eventually became the deadly Pacific Palisades wildfire that killed 12 people and destroyed large swaths of Los Angeles earlier this year. Jonathan Rinderknecht, who was arrested in Florida but previously lived in the Pacific Palisades, was charged with three counts related to the alleged arson, including arson affecting property used in interstate commerce, destruction of property by fire , and timber set afire, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. If convicted, Rinderknecht faces up to 45 years in prison, with a minimum sentence of five years. This original blaze that Rinderknecht allegedly started was known as the Lachman Fire, and it was quickly suppressed. But unbeknownst to firefighters and other authorities at the time, embers of the Lachman Fire continued to burn underground, and on Jan. 7, heavy winds caused the fire to surface and spread. The ensuing Palisades fire was one of the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles history, destroying 23,400 acres of land and nearly 7,000 homes across the Pacific Palisades region. It caused an estimated $150 billion in damages. Rinderknecht was arrested earlier this month. According to an affidavit from an investigator for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Rinderknecht was working on New Year’s Eve as an Uber driver. While it’s unclear when exactly he allegedly set the fire, Rinderknecht allegedly drove to a Pacific Palisades trailhead, near where he used to live, and then walked to an area known as the Hidden Buddha clearing. The fire was first detected by the University of California at San Diego environmental sensing platforms about 12 minutes after midnight. Rinderknecht also allegedly tried to call 911 around the same time, but the call did not go through because of poor cell service. He attempted to make several more calls, and by the time he finally connected with the police, the fire had already been reported by others in the neighborhood. During his call with police, Rinderknecht also allegedly typed a question into ChatGPT: “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarette?” ChatGPT allegedly responded “Yes,” with an explanation. As Rinderknecht drove away, he allegedly passed firefighters on their way to tackle the fire. He later told investigators that he turned around and offered to help the firefighters, which the ATF agent characterized as “highly unusual conduct.” In the affidavit, the ATF agent noted that “arsonists sometimes like to watch firefighters respond to the fires that they have set.” The document also contains other potential evidence of Rinderknecht’s intentions, including several fire-related ChatGPT requests.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/pacific-palisades-fire-man-accused-of-setting-fire-indicted-1235448368,Entertainment,Washington Post,Jodi Guglielmi,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-arrest.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-16T02:50:27+00:00,c132267955c02f2655d2c1fd8a79238fbd133887
3fb4f23c48ae,"Blue Jays smash 5 HRs in rout, trim Mariners' ALCS lead to 2-1",,"SEATTLE -- Somewhere along the 2,100-mile flight from Toronto to Seattle, the Blue Jays found their bats. Somewhere along the journey west, Blue Jays hitting coach David Popkins also sent manager John Schneider a video of the 1996 World Series -- a series in which the New York Yankees lost the first two games at home only to rally and win the next four. The message: This series is not over. The Blue Jays, after losing the first two games of the American League Championship Series at home, tattooed baseballs all over T-Mobile Park on Wednesday evening, smashing five home runs and four doubles in a 13-4 rout of the Seattle Mariners to get back in the series and avoid facing an elimination game Thursday. After mustering just eight hits in the first two losses, the Blue Jays knew their game plan: Get the ball in the air more often -- and hit it hard when you do, like they did against the Yankees in the ALDS, when they hit .338 and scored 34 runs in four games. They did just that, with absolute authority. Across those first two games against Seattle, the Jays hit just 10 total balls in play at 100 mph or higher. In their five-run explosion against George Kirby in the third inning, there was nothing cheap. They had four hits alone in the inning of 103-plus mph, with No. 9 hitter Andres Gimenez starting the attack with a two-run home run to right field and Daulton Varsho finishing it off with a two-run laser beam of a double off the wall in right. The exclamation points came on George Springer 's 431-foot blast to center field in the fourth ... and then Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 's home run to center in the fifth ... and then Alejandro Kirk 's three-run opposite-field home run to right in the sixth. The Blue Jays had Mariners fans in the outfield bleachers scattering like the seagulls looking for scraps at Ivar's Acres of Clams on Alaskan Way. All told, the Blue Jays had 13 balls in play of 100-plus mph -- and 11 of them went for hits. Springer's home run was the loudest, his 22nd career postseason home run and 40th career extra-base hit, just the sixth player in postseason history to reach 40. The Blue Jays jumped all over Kirby early in the count, especially on his fastball, knowing he would pound the strike zone with both his four-seamer and sinker. Gimenez's home run came on an 0-1 four-seamer, Varsho's double came on a 1-1 four-seamer, Springer's home run was off a first-pitch sinker and Guerrero's home run was against a first-pitch slider. Ernie Clement 's double in the third that started the inning was also on a first-pitch sinker. All eight hits off Kirby came when the count was 1-1 or earlier. Swing early, swing hard. George Springer's 431-foot blast in the fourth inning was his 22nd career postseason home run and 40th extra-base hit. He became just the sixth player in postseason history to reach 40 extra-base hits. Abbie Parr/AP Everyone seemed to get in on the act for the Blue Jays. As part of an 18-hit attack, they had six different players with multiple hits and at least one RBI, the first team to do that in a playoff game since the Texas Rangers in the 2011 ALCS. The five home runs matched the most ever for an American League team in a playoff game -- something the Blue Jays also did in Game 2 of the ALDS against the Yankees. (The eight combined home runs also tied the MLB record for most in a postseason game, matching Game 3 of the 2015 NLDS between the Cubs and Cardinals and Game 2 of the 2017 World Series between the Dodgers and Astros .) Meanwhile, after serving up a 414-foot, two-run home run to Julio Rodriguez in the bottom of the first inning, Shane Bieber settled in and showed why the Blue Jays acquired him at the trade deadline, even though he was still in the final stages of recovery from his 2024 Tommy John surgery. Rodriguez had connected with a fastball. After the first inning, Bieber shifted to a steady diet of sliders, curveballs, cutters and changeups, throwing just 20 fastballs out of his 84 pitches across six innings. Since his return in August, Bieber had thrown about 37% fastballs, but he ended up just 23% in this game. It worked: He induced 17 swings and misses -- more than his past two outings combined, his final start of the regular season and his start against the Yankees in Game 3 of the ALDS, when Schneider pulled him in the third inning after he allowed five hits and three runs. For the Mariners, their dreams of clinching the first World Series trip in franchise history at home now means they'll have to win the next two games -- or the series shifts back to Toronto, where the Blue Jays had the best home record in the AL in the regular season.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46611073/blue-jays-smash-5-home-runs-game-3-rout-mariners-cut-alcs-deficit-2-1,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1016%2Fr1560907_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,4db69123714d53611aa0fe8683c523881a1e2f45
01062e6529ba,MLB,,"LOS ANGELES -- Shohei Ohtani 's entrance song, ""Feeling Good"" by Michael Bublé, played at Dodger Stadium in an otherwise quiet moment Wednesday afternoon. Ohtani then emerged from the dugout for a rare session of on-field batting practice, drawing a sarcastic round of applause from his teammates. The Los Angeles Dodgers ' two-way phenomenon proceeded to uncork prodigious home runs, one of which clanked off the roof that sits beyond the right-field bleachers. That Ohtani put himself in that situation, taking batting practice at Dodger Stadium for the first time since joining the team two years ago, might have spoken to the urgency of the situation. The Dodgers have continued to roll through these playoffs, but Ohtani's hitting slump has merely persisted. Since the wild-card round, he is just 2-for-25 with 12 strikeouts. His seventh-inning RBI single in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Tuesday snapped a hitless streak of 15 at-bats, the second longest of his career. Speaking before Wednesday's workout, Ohtani denied that performing as a two-way player in the postseason has impacted his hitting. ""I don't necessarily think that the pitching has affected my hitting performance,"" Ohtani said through an interpreter. ""Just on the pitching side, as long as I control what I can control, I feel pretty good about putting up results. On the hitting side, just the stance, the mechanics, that's something that I do -- it's a constant work in progress. I don't necessarily think so. It's hard to say."" Ohtani homered twice in two wild-card wins against the Cincinnati Reds but was overwhelmed by a Philadelphia Phillies team featuring three devastating left-handed starting pitchers, going 0-for-13 with seven strikeouts against Cristopher Sanchez , Jesus Luzardo and Ranger Suarez . The Milwaukee Brewers have tried to follow a similar formula, throwing their best lefty relievers at him as often as possible. Aaron Ashby opened Game 1 of the NLCS, but Ohtani drew a walk. Ohtani later faced another lefty reliever in Jared Koenig and grounded out. In Game 2, he singled off Ashby and struck out against another lefty reliever, Robert Gasser . Of Ohtani's 40 plate appearances in these playoffs, 22 have come against lefties. He has reached base just three times against them. ""I think it makes sense strategically on their side that they would put a lot of left-handed pitchers against me,"" Ohtani said. ""I'm really all focused on just putting up better-quality at-bats. I think in that sense, that's what I'm always going to be working on."" Ohtani started Game 1 of the NL Division Series on the mound, pitching six innings of three-run ball. He was lined up to pitch Game 1 or 2 of the NLCS -- with Game 2 preferable because an off day would follow him filling two roles -- but has instead been held back to Game 4. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said the decision had more to do with lining Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto up to potentially pitch twice in the series than it did with helping Ohtani shake a hitting slump. Roberts called Ohtani's at-bats in Milwaukee ""fantastic,"" even though he went just 1-for-7. ""I think he's controlling the strike zone, I think he's still staying aggressive when he gets his pitch,"" Roberts said. ""There was a lineout to right field and there was three walks. There was the base hit in a run-scoring opportunity. Those are positives for me."" Ohtani chartered the 50/50 club in his first season with the Dodgers in 2024 and was just as impactful an offensive player when transitioning back to pitching in 2025, slashing .282/.392/.622 with 55 home runs and 20 stolen bases. A fourth MVP in five years is a given. On the 14 days he also pitched, though, Ohtani's slash line took a slight dip to .222/.323/.556. Asked whether he has found himself needing to get reacclimated to a two-way role, Ohtani again demurred. ""I know I might sound like I'm saying the same answer again,"" he said, ""but yeah, I don't really necessarily think it has really affected. I do feel like I was able to just have a pretty good season offensively, being able to have quality at-bats throughout the season. It's hard to say. But yeah, same answer as before.""",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46610898/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-pitching-not-cause-hitting-slump,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560293_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,af69334e87050b5e10daadbd7b9a47f11f800098

After being helped to her feet by athletic trainers, Rodman appeared unable to put any weight on her right leg before being helped to the sideline while in obvious distress. After being replaced by Brittany Ratcliffe in the 41st minute, Rodman was seen heading to the locker room on crutches at halftime. She was spotted on the field after the game in a full-length knee brace and still on crutches. Spirit coach Adrián González said he didn't have an update on Rodman other than she will undergo scans Thursday. With Wednesday's victory, the Spirit won Group B and clinched a berth in the Champions Cup semifinals. Rodman has been sidelined multiple times because of a back injury in recent months. She has appeared only once for the U.S. women's national team since the gold-medal winning effort at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The 23-year-old had scored seven goals in 13 games for the Spirit since her return. ""I'm super excited to have Trin back with the group -- but a healthy Trin I think is the important thing,"" Hayes said at a news conference.

86201f916805,Mavs' Kidd noncommittal about keeping Cooper Flagg at PG,,"LAS VEGAS -- Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd praised Cooper Flagg 's performance as the starting point guard in the team's final two preseason games but stopped short of committing to opening the season with the 18-year-old rookie filling that role in a supersized starting lineup. ""There's a lot of good, positive stories here, and so we have some time to make a decision,"" Kidd said after the Mavs' 121-94 win Wednesday over the Los Angeles Lakers at T-Mobile Arena, in which Dallas rallied after a slow start against an opponent resting most of its regular rotation players. The 6-foot-8 Flagg shifted to point guard after starting the first two preseason games at forward, the position he played at Duke. He averaged 12.0 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists during his two starts at point guard in a lineup alongside 6-6 Klay Thompson , 6-7 P.J. Washington , 6-10 Anthony Davis and 7-1 Dereck Lively II . ""He's got to keep an index of who got shots, what was the last shot, and that'll come with reps,"" said Kidd, who started offseason free agency addition D'Angelo Russell at point guard in the Mavs' first two preseason games. ""But I think [Flagg] has done an incredible job of handling the situation of running the team. And the other thing that I think that is going unnoticed is that his teammates enjoy him running the team."" But Kidd said he thought the Mavs' offense was too stagnant early in Wednesday's game, when the Lakers jumped out to a 22-10 lead before Flagg subbed out midway through the first quarter. There are spacing concerns with that lineup because of a relative lack of playmaking and perimeter shooting, as the Mavs' starters shot 3-of-15 from 3-point range against the Lakers. ""Just continuing to get comfortable,"" Flagg said. ""I made some mental lapses today, time and score situations. Got to know [and] be aware of what's on the clock at all times. Just got to stay more attached [defensively]. Can't let a hot player keep getting looks. So some of those things you can definitely clean up."" Flagg, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, struggled early in Wednesday's game while defending Gabe Vincent , who had 18 points and hit five 3s in the first 4 minutes, 9 seconds. ""No matter if you're 6-4, 6-2 or 6-8, when you're in a pick-and-roll in this league against guys who know how to run the pick-and-roll, it's hard,"" Kidd said. ""It becomes a two-man game, and we'll get better at that. But [with] his competitiveness, he's going to figure it out sooner than later, and the more he's in these situations, I think the long run he's going to benefit.""",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46611956/mavs-kidd-noncommittal-keeping-cooper-flagg-pg,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1016%2Fr1560950_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,f5f1b4346aaf309b59d3a163f6fa965d1ffe07cc

Join us for the latest transfer news and rumors from around the globe. Transfers homepage | Done deals | Men's grades | Women's grades TOP STORIES - Sources: Man United may extend Casemiro but salary key - Sources: Barça, Madrid tracking Mexican teen Mora - Botafogo disputing $21m fee to Atlanta for Thiago Almada Harry Kane has scored 103 goals in 106 games for Bayern since moving in 2023. Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images TRENDING RUMORS - Tottenham Hotspur are willing to pay Harry Kane 's release clause, which sources told ESPN is worth €60 million, and meet the wages required to bring the striker back from Bayern Munich , according to TEAMtalk . The 32-year-old is reportedly keen to return to the Premier League in a bid to chase down Alan Shearer's league record of 260 goals, having scored 213 himself before moving to Germany . Manchester United also want to sign Kane and view him as a key player for their rebuild, but any chances of signing the England international hinge on improving their league position. - Liverpool are set to make contact with Borussia Dortmund over center back Nico Schlotterbeck , reports Christian Falk . Dortmund have offered the 25-year-old a new contract worth around €8m gross per year, but the Reds would be able to go higher and need to cover for Giovanni Leoni ' s injury amid long-term doubts surrounding the future of Ibrahima Konaté , who has been linked with a free transfer to Real Madrid next summer. Crystal Palace 's Marc Guéhi is also on Liverpool's radar, while Bayern Munich could also move for Schlotterbeck. - Manchester City are planning a £75 million move to sign Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson but are likely to face stiff competition from Chelsea , according to The Daily Star . The 22-year-old has emerged as one of the top options if Pep Guardiola opts to strengthen his midfield in the summer, with Nico González having struggled since joining from FC Porto and questions lingering over Rodri ' s long-term future. - Chelsea, Arsenal and Barcelona are all watching Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz , reports Gazzetta dello Sport . Juventus are set to offer the 20-year-old a contract renewal that will run until 2030, but they haven't yet agreed on the finances. And Chelsea haven't given up after seeing a €67 million offer to sign Yildiz rejected in the summer, while Arsenal and Barcelona are preparing to compete with them. - Real Madrid and Barcelona both want to sign center back Dayot Upamecano as a free agent when his contract at Bayern Munich expires in the summer, reports Footmercato . Los Blancos are looking to replace ageing duo Antonio Rüdiger and David Alaba , while the Barcelona could let Ronald Araújo depart and need cover. Manchester United are among the English clubs also interested in Upamecano, but the prospect of him staying at Bayern hasn't been completely ruled out either. EXPERT TAKE ESPN's Sam Tighe explores the future for Bayern striker Harry Kane. When Kane finally sealed his blockbuster move to Bayern Munich in 2023, it only ever felt like ""goodbye for now"" to the Premier League. Many assumed he'd be back at some point to chase down Alan Shearer's record goal tally of 260 -- and despite claiming to have never felt more settled in Bavaria, scoring 23 goals in all competitions for club and country as he hits top form, the rumours of a return grow ever stronger. Kane's brilliance is built on a natural goal-scoring instinct, pure ball-striking, game intelligence and a frankly incredible level of creativity for a No. 9. None of that will dim with age, so if harnessed correctly -- i.e. not in some manic high-pressing system where he's asked to sprint around -- the 32-year-old has plenty of years left at the top. He's so good that teams like Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United should be happy to re-wire their entire tactical setup around him, ensuring he has pacy wingers to pick him out with long passes and room to drop deep and receive the ball wherever he wishes. Typically speaking, you'd be mad to spend €60 million to sign a player who will turn 33 in 2026, but Kane is no typical case.

2b8801ac7d25,Armed With Anemones: How Some Young Fishes Survive in the Sea,"fish, animals, photography, oceans and seas, animal migration, florida museum of natural history, journal of fish biology, florida, virginia, your-feed-animals","Every night after dusk, one of the world’s largest migrations begins, as deep sea creatures rise to the surface to feed. For blackwater divers, who dive into offshore waters at night, the migration offers an opportunity to glimpse tiny animals. “You’re just out there drifting with the current and checking out all this life that’s in the ocean,” said Rich Collins, a blackwater photographer and diver affiliated with the Florida Museum of Natural History. But blackwater photographs capture more than glamorous fishes . By studying the photos from Mr. Collins and other divers, scientists have found that young fishes and anemones are interacting in ways rarely seen before. In a new study published last month in the Journal of Fish Biology, scientists documented larval and juvenile fishes hiding behind or carrying larval sea anemones, close relatives of jellyfish that also have the ability to sting. Adult anemones attach to the seabed, but the larvae float freely in the ocean. By holding an invertebrate that can be toxic, the young fishes might be scaring predators away, said Gabriel Afonso, a doctoral student at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who led the study. “The fish sometimes seem to be using the invertebrate as a protection,” he said. In the photos, larval fishes from species such as pomfrets and filefishes are seen holding larval tube anemones, which belong to a class of marine invertebrates called anthozoans, in their mouths. Four families of fish were documented interacting with anthozoans in the open ocean, also known as the pelagic zone. The strategy amounted to a “poison pill defense,” Mr. Collins said, adding, “‘Go ahead and eat me, but you’re going to eat this little poison pill at the same time.’” For the anemone, the interaction might provide a means of dispersal, although more studies are needed to understand whether and how each species benefits. The study gave other fisheries scientists “something new and interesting to think about,” said Simon Thorrold, a marine biologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved in the research. “I had no idea that there was this much diversity in the relationship between fishes and anthozoans.” Beyond the benefit to individual fish, Dr. Thorrold wondered, how important was the interaction to the survival of the population? That is one of the many avenues of research that blackwater diving is opening up. Traditionally, baby fish have been studied by examining specimens caught in mesh nets, leaving scientists to guess at their behavior and interactions in the open ocean. “It’s hard enough studying whale sharks, who are 30 feet long, let alone a larval fish that might be 10 millimeters or an inch long,” Dr. Thorrold said. The larval stage is an important part of a fish’s life cycle and history, in part because the mortality rate during this stage determines how many fishes survive to adulthood. “Marine fish larvae can be as different from the adults they will become as caterpillars are to butterflies,” said Carole Baldwin, the curator of fishes at the National Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the research. For the study of larval fish, blackwater photography is a “game changer,” Dr. Baldwin said. From photos, scientists can glimpse new behaviors, larval stages, colors and interactions not typically gleaned from fish in a jar collection. Blackwater photos are “like a gold mine,” Mr. Afonso said. Marine scientists often scour social media groups, looking for photos that reveal new species or behaviors, then contact the photographer. The collaboration between scientists and the diving community is “really beautiful,” Mr. Afonso said. Ai Nonaka, a researcher at the National Museum of Natural History, said that blackwater photos and improved scientific techniques were reshaping how scientists study and understand the early life stages of marine fishes. At the museum, she added, “we now house over 500 larval fish specimens collected directly by blackwater divers.” Mr. Collins, who has made hundreds of dives in the Gulf Stream off the coast of Florida, estimated that he had collected 1,000 specimens for the Florida Museum of Natural History. “It’s turned into sort of an avocation, as opposed to just a hobby,” he said. “The thing that people don’t recognize is just how much life there is out there, just beneath the surface,” Mr. Collins added, “and that there’s this amazing migration that happens every day.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/science/marine-biology-blackwater-anemones-fishes.html,World,Washington Post,By Alexa Robles-Gil,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/00hs-fish-anenome-02-vzmc/00hs-fish-anenome-02-vzmc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:03:22.422000+00:00,f561f686564be70533ccdb820a1fe7e4b23eb87d

Carrying whatever they could pack, they piled into a small Syrian Air jet. Only an hour earlier, they were part of an elite cadre that formed the backbone of one of the world’s most brutal regimes. Now, in the wake of President Bashar al-Assad’s sudden fall and escape from the country, they were fugitives, scrambling with their families to flee. Among the passengers was Qahtan Khalil , director of Syria’s air force intelligence, who was accused of being directly responsible for one of the bloodiest massacres of the country’s 13-year civil war. He was joined by Ali Abbas and Ali Ayyoub , two former ministers of defense facing sanctions for human rights violations and atrocities carried out during the conflict.

856b277621e3,Abandoned Mansions and Facebook Photos: Reporting on the Top Officials Who Fled Syria,"vis-video, syria, bashar al-assad, war;armed conflicts, war crimes;genocide;crimes against humanity, your-feed-visual-investigations","A photograph of a lavish Damascus home, posted to a neighborhood Facebook page. The name of a small village on Syria’s coast mentioned in a sanctions document. A phone number, with a Russian country code, discreetly shared with reporters. Over ten months, The New York Times gathered these and other fragments to uncover what happened to some of the high-ranking Syrian officials who, for years, helped former President Bashar al-Assad’s regime carry out its atrocities. After the government’s fall in December and with accountability looming, most of these officials fled or hid. Rumors swirled in their wake, leading to many dead ends. But in some cases, these clues brought us directly to their doorsteps. All these fragments were combined with additional journalistic legwork: document sifting, lead chasing, door knocking and conversations with dozens of sources, including members of the former regime, their family members and staff, Western officials and legal experts. While some Assad henchmen have come into clearer focus, others remain enigmas, and our reporting continues. As we embarked on this investigation, we were immediately faced with a challenge: whom to focus on when so many played a role in the Assad regime’s brutal 13-year civil war that left half a million people dead. We began with a list of hundreds of individuals facing sanctions by the United States, the European Union and Britain for their connection to crimes committed under the Assad regime. We gathered background information on these officials by referencing reporting from media outlets and nongovernmental organizations, including Syrian Free Press, Zaman Al Wasl, the Association of Detainees and Missing Persons of Sednaya Prison and Pro Justice. The Syria Justice and Accountability Centre and the Syrian Archive shared internal research with The Times that tracked which individuals held certain roles throughout the war. These databases allowed us to narrow our focus to those at the highest levels of responsibility. We prioritized individuals with ties to the military, intelligence and Syria’s chemical weapons program and excluded those facing sanctions primarily for financial or administrative roles. That still left hundreds of names. We then identified nine flashpoints that were especially emblematic of the regime in terms of scale, brutality and repercussions, from the killing of peaceful protesters to chemical weapons attacks. Determining the senior-most officials linked to all of these allowed us to narrow the list down even further, to 55. Syrian civil society groups and nongovernmental organizations, who have spent years laying the groundwork for accountability efforts, provided research on the 55 individuals, deepening our understanding of their roles and actions during Assad’s reign. We drew on the expertise of the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression and the human rights lawyer Anwar al-Bunni. Both are behind some of the highest profile legal cases in European countries against Syrian officials — including some of the officials we identified in our reporting. Nidal Shikhani, the director of Same Justice and the Chemical Violations Documentation Center of Syria, shared information his team has collected on those at the highest levels of the regime’s chemical weapons program, and connected The Times to sources familiar with the inner workings of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, the government agency responsible for chemical weapons development. Much of the Visual Investigations team’s reporting uses open-source information — that is, information that is openly available on the internet, though not necessarily easy to uncover or connect. While we engaged with sources and experts in the field, we were also digging through social media accounts, Syrian state media and other online resources for information about our individuals of interest. Despite facing sanctions by multiple Western governments, some of these individuals were rarely, if ever, seen or photographed in public, making it much easier for them to move under the radar. By combing through hundreds of images from social platforms, state media and expert sources across Syrian academia and civil society, we managed to pinpoint visuals of several of these shadowy figures. We also verified their names through signatures, identity cards and other official documentation, correcting errors in spelling and transliteration seen even in sanctions lists drawn up by Western governments. To help verify that photos from various sources depicted the same individuals, The Times asked Hassan Ugail, a professor at the University of Bradford in Britain who specializes in facial recognition, to analyze the images. For example, Bassam Hassan , one of Mr. Assad’s most senior henchmen, has long been misidentified by media outlets and online. But we uncovered several old Facebook photos that seemed to show Mr. Hassan as a younger man. Mr. Ugail compared those images with a more recent photo of Mr. Hassan we obtained to establish that they all showed the same person. Suhail al-Hassan , a senior military official, presented a different challenge: a changing appearance that led some Syrians to speculate that he had undergone plastic surgery. Here too, The Times conducted its own analysis and consulted Mr. Ugail, who indicated the various photos were highly likely to be of Mr. al-Hassan. This work opened new doors, allowing us to more easily trace some former officials’ presence online to learn more about who they are and how they may have operated during their time in power. We scoured funeral announcements for the names of their potential family members and collected phone numbers and email addresses. We called those phone numbers found online or passed to us by contacts. Some connected directly to the former Assad officials we were investigating. Satellite imagery and ship and aircraft tracking data helped us to trace rumored escape routes used by officials in the hours and days after the Syrian opposition took control. We corroborated these routes with witness accounts from those directly involved in the escape efforts. We used artificial intelligence tools to translate and transcribe more than 13,000 documents photographed inside Syria by Times reporters and freelance journalist Lynzy Billing. A few documents contained orders linking some of our 55 former officials to suspected atrocities. One directive to withhold news of detainees’ deaths from their families is signed by Mohammed Kanjou al-Hassan , who issued death sentences for civilians and political dissidents. We traveled to Lebanon, France and Belgium, and multiple times to Syria to meet with experts and sources, knock on doors and visit the hometowns of the former officials. Most of the men were gone, but their opulent homes remained, each telling a different story of the regime’s chaotic fall. Current government officials and family members granted us permission to walk through dozens of villas, complete with swimming pools and behind high walls. Some were looted, others occupied by new top brass or families displaced by the war. A few homes sat in eerie silence, guarded and maintained by distant relatives awaiting a return that might never come. A few had even been transformed into military outposts. Inside these abandoned homes, we often found what we were looking for: clues the occupants unwittingly left behind in haste. We photographed an expired credit card, a utility bill with a full name, family portraits — each providing an insight, however small, about who our subjects were and where they may have gone. Through these efforts, we’ve learned the whereabouts of high-ranking regime officials across the world, locating at least a dozen of our 55 people of interest. Still, none of these individuals have been apprehended. Some are living quietly in plain sight, while others have disappeared into networks of protection and secrecy in places like Russia and the U.A.E. We continue to investigate their alleged crimes inside Syria and activities since the regime’s fall. Christina Goldbaum contributed reporting. Ishaan Jhaveri contributed document analysis.

6bf9a7efb178,Baby KJ’s doctors will ask FDA this winter to OK a clinical trial of pioneering gene editing approach,"crispr, patients, rare diseases, stat summit","BOSTON — It was an ordinary moment, but it meant everything to the father of a little boy with the rarest of diseases. Last month, in the final seconds of a Sunday night football game, as Eagles defensive tackle Jordan Davis blocked a Los Angeles Rams field goal attempt to lock up a victory for Philadelphia, an exultant Kyle Muldoon lifted his 1-year-old son, KJ, in front of the TV in their living room. KJ, startled by the gesture, started to cry. As he apologized to the small child sporting an Eagles jersey Muldoon had bought him on the day he was born, he started to tear up too. “This is what we thought we would never get,” he said on Wednesday. Speaking at the STAT Summit, he and his wife, Nicole, shared an inside look at how their family went from heartbreak to cautious hope, to finding themselves at the center of one of the biggest medical stories of 2025. When KJ was born at the University of Pennsylvania last August, he arrived prematurely but seemingly healthy. Within days though, the infant was rushed across the street to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), where doctors diagnosed him with CPS1 deficiency, a rare urea cycle disorder that prevented KJ’s liver from breaking down ammonia, which can build up and cause permanent brain damage or death. He was intubated and put on dialysis. To have any chance of a somewhat normal life, KJ needed a liver transplant. Instead, he got a visit from a team of doctors with a transformative technology they wanted to test in a patient. Six months later, with Nicole in the hospital crib beside him, KJ received an infusion of a gene editing treatment designed to fix the ultra rare genetic glitch in his liver cells. Vials of components were flown to Philadelphia from Iowa and North Dakota and Canada, each of them designed and manufactured just for KJ. The treatment, which has not cured KJ but has given him a much milder form of the disease, has been hailed as a landmark in the five-decade quest to read and repair the code of life. It has also reignited long-simmering questions about how to safely and equitably scale personalized treatments. By the end of the parents’ story, there were few dry eyes in the audience. But KJ was all smiles as he squirmed about in a toddler-sized tuxedo, giggling at Kiran Musunuru, the geneticist who led development of his treatment, and gazing out at the packed room from the lap of Karen Ahrens-Nicklas, the physician who administered it. Since news of KJ’s successful treatment broke in May , the research team behind it has received thousands of pleas from other rare disease patients and their families. And though they write back to every family, for most of them there is little they can do. The drug they designed for KJ fixed a single misspelled letter in his DNA, and though it has produced miraculous results, it required massive investments of time, expertise, and capital that aren’t easily replicated. Leading researchers in Boston like Ben Kleinstiver at Massachusetts General Hospital and David Liu at the Broad Institute pitched in to improve the ability of the editing tool, a version of CRISPR called a base editor, to make the right DNA swap. Fyodor Urnov, at the Innovative Genomics Institute at University of California, Berkeley, helped the teams at CHOP and Penn to forge an ambitious public-private partnership to marshal resources from Aldevron, IDT, Acuitas Therapeutics, and the Jackson Laboratory. “We need to be able to scale this,” Ahrens-Nicklas said. “In our country, to do that, you have to have an approval so that the drug product can be reimbursed and we can actually subsidize this to be able to help patients around the country. The technology is there, we just need the infrastructure to evaluate it and deliver it.” That’s what she and Musunuru have spent the last few months racing to get off the ground. This winter, Musunuru said, they intend to ask the Food and Drug Administration to start a formal clinical trial that would be open to patients with seven different urea cycle disorders, as long as their mutation is amenable to treatment with base editing. It would be a new kind of “umbrella-of-umbrella” approach, allowing for individualized treatments to be tested in a single trial. After treating five patients, the team would plan to move to a Phase 3 trial, which could enable a conditional approval of base editing as a platform technology. “That is absolutely key,” Musunuru said. “Not to, you know, say that everything’s great after that, there will be many more challenges after that. But if you can’t get to that point, this whole thing falls apart, and we won’t be able to help all the kids who need help.”",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/16/baby-kj-crispr-gene-editing-personalized-medicine-at-scale,Health,Washington Post,Megan Molteni,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CR5_0450-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-16T08:30:00+00:00,ed29be05ee1101b9239c7ae1dae6a05663211d1a

ec0eb889d4c5,This scientist is revealing the immune system in our nasal passages,"covid-19, infectious disease, research, scientists, vaccines","Sydney Ramirez vividly remembers that Wednesday in March. Her future adviser, scientist Shane Crotty, was supposed to be in Italy for a conference. And Ramirez, a physician and immunologist, wasn’t supposed to join Crotty’s lab at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology as a postdoctoral fellow until July. But it was 2020, and very little was going as planned. Instead, they were in Crotty’s office, and Covid-19 had just been declared a national emergency; in two days, the institute would shut down. Ramirez, then in the  infectious disease fellowship program at the University of California San Diego, had planned to study the shingles vaccine with Crotty, who researches how the immune system reacts to vaccines. But it was clear that her crucial expertise — she happened to have spent her Ph.D. studying coronavirus virology — might help answer the pressing early questions about SARS-CoV-2. Would people have any immune response to the virus? Who would get the most sick? Would it ever be possible to make a vaccine? Within 48 hours, Ramirez joined Crotty’s lab and got to work. And within weeks, she and her colleagues would publish a key paper that provided early insight into SARS-CoV-2 immunity in people. More than five years later, Ramirez, who was recently named a STAT Wunderkind, is both an instructor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and an infectious disease physician at UCSD. She’s still studying respiratory viruses, and has helped lead the way in understanding a critical part of the immune system: the upper airway. Containing the nose and throat, it is the part of the body respiratory viruses encounter first, before they reach the lungs — but it has long been overlooked. Understanding how the immune system works in the upper airway could help researchers design everything from more effective vaccines to immune-monitoring approaches and personalized vaccination schedules. And Ramirez is just getting started. An urgent search When the immune system encounters a virus, it mounts two kinds of immune responses. The first, called innate immunity, is a rapid, nonspecific defense against the pathogen. The second, adaptive immunity, takes longer and builds up a memory of infections. In the initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic, understanding this biological memory — how it formed in response to SARS-CoV-2, whether it was protective or harmful, and the cells involved — was essential for vaccine developers and public health officials. At LJI, however, acquiring the patient samples to study that memory was proving difficult. By March 2020, Crotty said, “labs at LJI had been working on coronavirus for at least six weeks already, but hadn’t managed to get a single sample into the building from a patient.” Ramirez turned to colleagues Steven Rawlings and Davey Smith, infectious disease physician-scientists at UCSD. Rawlings and Smith had begun obtaining the approvals and protocols to recruit patients in February, after Smith heard about a new respiratory virus while on vacation in Australia and started planning for its arrival in the U.S. “I remember [it] clear as day,” Smith said. “You can’t contain a respiratory illness.” Joining onto the framework from Rawlings and Smith, Ramirez began urgently searching around San Diego for Covid-19 patients. She reviewed medical charts and sent out patient portal messages. She talked to patients who were scared but willing to help, sometimes collecting and processing blood samples herself. “It’s really hard to be a good clinician, and it’s really hard to be a good scientist, and it’s very hard to do both,” Crotty said. Ramirez “was able to enroll people in these clinical trials when nobody else was able to enroll them because she was able to connect with people.” Using those samples, a team of researchers across LJI, UCSD, Mount Sinai, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that people who’d had Covid-19 showed signs of developing immunological memory; a majority had CD8 + “killer” and CD4 + “helper” T cells that responded to parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In just two months, on May 14, 2020 — Ramirez’s birthday — the study appeared online in Cell. “Everything was moving so fast. I don’t think I’ve ever contributed to a paper where it came out within two months,” she said. “[It took a] huge team effort, lots of long hours, everybody working together.” The impact, Crotty said, was immediate: Twitter threads erupted, the paper made international news, Anthony Fauci waved a copy before Congress . As one of the first studies of immune responses to the virus, the paper offered hope that people could develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2 — that a vaccine might be possible. Ramirez and her colleagues savored the recognition, proud to have met the pressure to publish more quickly than ever before without sacrificing scientific rigor. But there was plenty more to uncover. New sacrifices amid the pandemic By 2020, Ramirez was used to long hours. The daughter of two pediatricians, she’d chosen an M.D.-Ph.D. program at the University of Texas with no illusions about its workload. Then, after her second year of medical school in 2010, she gave birth to her daughter Aliya. Finishing her degrees now meant juggling maternity leave with graduate classes and trips to the lab with daycare pickups and drop-offs. Ramirez’s dad rented a house down the street to help with child care, and Aliya was independent from the start — she grew up insisting on carrying her own lunchbox to school. Still, there were the holidays Ramirez spent in the lab running T cell assays, the cell incubations she couldn’t cut short. She found herself apologizing for not being home. The pandemic demanded new sacrifices. By now a clinical and research fellow in infectious disease at UCSD, Ramirez knew she could not stop working. To keep her family safe, Ramirez sent Aliya, then 9, to live with her mother in Sacramento, Calif. At night, on the weekends, and in the mornings before clinic, Ramirez gathered data, often driving across town to collect samples. When she had time, she drove to parts of San Diego she hadn’t seen before, where the beaches were full of birds and other wildlife. “It was so peaceful and quiet,” she remembered. “It was just a really good mental break from everything.” Ramirez had gravitated toward biology as an undergrad for its variability, the way two genetically identical mice didn’t behave the same way in the lab. Now, she wondered why some people got sicker than others. She’d seen 90-year-old patients with Covid-19 who’d never developed symptoms. Understanding why meant studying patients with a range of disease severity, as soon after infection as possible. This time, the team studied all three arms of the adaptive immune response : killer and helper T cells, plus antibody-producing B cells. Patients with a coordinated response — from antibodies and both kinds of T cells, rather than from just one or two of these groups — fared better than those with a poorly coordinated one. People who were 65 and older were also more likely to have less coordinated responses and severe disease, in many cases potentially because they had fewer T cells that could respond to new viruses. Ramirez performs spectral flow cytometry to examine immune cells present in a donor sample. La Jolla Institute for Immunology Searching for missing pieces The outlines of the human immune response were emerging, but Ramirez still felt that pieces were missing. As a respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2 infected the upper airway first. It would make sense if the body could clear the upper airway to prevent the virus from descending into the lungs and causing more severe disease. But Ramirez couldn’t find studies on immune cells in the upper airway, and most “atlases” of the immune system left out anything above the neck. To fill that gap, there were technical challenges. Could she get enough immune cells from the back of the throat? Many medical schools taught that the adenoids — immune tissue behind the nose — disappeared after childhood. At first, when Ramirez’s deep-nasal swabs picked up what looked like immune cells from the adenoids, Crotty was skeptical. But when they used an endoscopy camera to follow the swab during collection, the results were incontrovertible. They were sampling adenoid tissue. From more than 300 patient swabs over a one-year period, Ramirez and her colleagues wrote in a 2024 paper that both T and B cells with memory of the virus stayed in the nasal passages for at least six months. To Ramirez and Crotty, that was exciting. A population of immune cells that lived in the upper airway for months or even years would be powerful — primed and ready to eliminate viruses more quickly than cells from the bloodstream. Understanding those cells could help researchers design more effective intranasal vaccines and better understand patient responses to vaccines that already exist. “There’s a lot we just don’t understand about mucosal immunity, because people weren’t really looking before,” Ramirez said. “This is a time where we have the technology, we have the resources, we have the understanding that we can actually start asking these questions.” Newsletter Weekdays Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email To start, Ramirez wants to know just how long those T and B cells stick around, and whether that changes with new viral exposures. She and her collaborators are studying the responses of these cells to newer SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccinations. Other researchers want to study the role of airway immune cells in other conditions such as autoimmune diseases, respiratory-related allergies, and cancer. Understanding how these cell populations change — and what baseline levels are — could be useful in the clinic, to diagnose disease or monitor how well a patient is responding to treatment. Ramirez hopes that doctors could one day use their sampling techniques to monitor a patient’s immune memory and personalize their vaccination schedule. High-risk patients would receive booster shots, for example, while patients with immune memory could wait. “We have general guidelines, but it’d be nice to actually be able to tell someone their immune status or immune protection status,” she said. “That might take more than five years to figure out.” But, she said, “it would be great to know more about our bodies.” ‘That’s all I could have asked of myself’ Already, Ramirez’s work studying Covid-19 and the upper airway has earned her the marks of academic success: a Burroughs Wellcome Fund award, other competitive grants, her name on highly cited papers. But forging her own path as a physician-scientist — particularly as a single mom — continues to be hard. “There are definitely days where I feel like I’m doing one ‘job’ better than the other,” Ramirez said. On those days, she tries to put aside her feelings of guilt, of not being good enough, and focuses on making the best use of the samples patients have entrusted to her. “[I] tell myself, if, at the end of the day I did the best I could do — that’s all I could have asked of myself,” she said.",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/16/sydney-ramirez-wunderkinds-covid-upper-airway-immune-system,Health,Washington Post,Allessandra DiCorato,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sydney-Ramirez-8-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-16T08:30:00+00:00,6656dec573ede28122946865100c270b905ed70f
58bcfb85503b,France’s Government Survives No-Confidence Vote,"france, sébastien lecornu, emmanuel macron, legislature, france unbowed","France’s government survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament on Thursday by a thin margin, giving the country a brief respite from intense political turmoil before what is expected to be another brutal battle over its budget. The no-confidence motion, which was filed by the far-left France Unbowed party, drew the support of 271 lawmakers in the 577-seat lower house — shy of the absolute majority of 289 votes required to topple Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu and his cabinet. Mr. Lecornu’s survival gave France a moment to breathe after weeks of political instability that plunged the country into deep uncertainty over its future and weighed on its economy . Had the no-confidence motion against Mr. Lecornu succeeded, this would have been the second time in less than two weeks that the government had collapsed. The results on Thursday, however, were largely expected after Mr. Lecornu offered this week to delay an unpopular pension overhaul that raised the age of retirement. That move was a major concession to the moderate left-wing Socialist Party, whose support Mr. Lecornu needed to ensure the no-confidence motions would not pass. The government of Mr. Lecornu, a centrist and close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, is France’s fourth in less than a year. Mr. Lecornu resigned last week after less than a month in office, only to be reappointed just days later, which angered opponents who wanted Mr. Macron to call snap legislative elections or to resign. The French president has firmly ruled out resigning, but he threatened to call new elections if Mr. Lecornu were toppled. The government’s survival on Thursday averted that outcome, at least for the time being. But the respite could be short-lived. Mr. Lecornu must now get a budget passed through a cantankerous lower house, where the main forces — an assortment of divided left-wing parties, a tenuous centrist coalition, a reduced conservative party, and a far-right bloc — agree on very little. Additional no-confidence votes are likely in the coming weeks and months. There is no working majority in the lower house of Parliament, known as the National Assembly, and France has been governed over the past year by a succession of unstable, center-right minority cabinets appointed by an increasingly unpopular Mr. Macron .",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/europe/france-lecornu-no-confidence-vote.html,World,Washington Post,By Aurelien Breeden,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16int-france-politics-vzcb/16int-france-politics-vzcb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T09:44:05.498000+00:00,8d43716d58cc76289a9fb74be2ad8749a310d360

Today, Beijing portrays itself as fighting a different but no less existential battle with its old rival, as the two countries engage in a deepening trade war that threatens to engulf the global economy . The latest round includes U.S. threats of 100 percent tariffs — a response to Beijing’s announcement last week of new export controls over rare earth minerals — as well as port fees levied by both countries, Chinese sanctions on U.S. shipping subsidiaries and a possible U.S. ban on Chinese cooking oil imports. Faced with the breakdown of what was a fragile truce between the two countries after months of tit-for-tat retaliation, China’s propaganda machine went to work this week, rallying citizens with messages of resilience and patriotism. At the same time, state media and officials have held back from more strident language — a sign that the Chinese leadership is still leaving room for reconciliation with the United States. “They don’t want to box themselves in,” said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago who researches Chinese politics. He said that years of hawkish “wolf warrior” diplomacy had taught China’s leaders the dangers of fanning nationalism. “Sometimes, when public sentiment was so mobilized, it was hard for the authorities to de-escalate and sometimes, in the process, that made them look bad,” he said.

4d7bdd66db44,Israel Marks Two Years Since Oct. 7 as a Fragile Cease-Fire Holds,"israel gaza war, israel, hamas, gaza strip","Israel marked a national day of commemoration on Thursday for the victims of the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, and for those who died in the ensuing war, almost a week after a cease-fire in Gaza was declared. A central state ceremony was held Thursday, which was two years after the 2023 attack according to the Jewish calendar. It took place at the national cemetery, Mount Herzl, in Jerusalem. Several hundred people attended, many in Israeli military uniforms. Since the cease-fire, Hamas has released the 20 remaining living hostages who had been held in Gaza, and Israel has freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from its jails. Among those freed were 250 Palestinians convicted of terrorism offenses or acts of violence against Israelis and roughly 1,700 more who were detained in Gaza during the war and held in Israel without charge. On Thursday, Israel said it had identified the bodies of two more people that Hamas handed back on Wednesday. Israel said the two had been killed in the October 2023 attack and taken into Gaza. Last week’s truce agreement called for the immediate handover of all remaining bodies in Gaza, though both sides acknowledged that some could be difficult to locate and may take more time to retrieve because of the destruction across the enclave. The Palestinian militant group has so far handed over at least nine bodies that Israel has identified, while 19 more bodies remain in Gaza, according to a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister’s office. Israel has returned at least 90 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, according to statements by the International Red Cross. The Israeli military has withdrawn some of its forces to an agreed-upon line inside Gaza, and some Gazans have begun returning to their homes — or to where the homes once stood. About 1,200 people were killed on Oct. 7, including Israeli civilians and security personnel, and about 250 were taken hostage. In the subsequent war in Gaza, at least 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Over 460 Israelis have been killed in the war since it started, according to Israel’s National Security Council.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-october-7-attack-hamas-ceasefire.html,World,Washington Post,By Natan Odenheimer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/16int-israel-ceremony-zvgl-cover/16int-israel-ceremony-zvgl-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T11:05:00.654000+00:00,db64c74bc4d5dd180697a705da91b096ac4a18b5
12ad08e7e208,Review: Proton Mail,"shopping, reviews, review, privacy, software, email","Further, Proton automatically identifies these mailing lists as “newsletters” and puts them in their own view. There, you can see how many messages they’ve sent, move addresses to different folders, and unsubscribe. Proton also shows the services you’ve already unsubscribed from. After unsubscribing from probably 100 mailing lists, I had at least half a dozen companies still sending me emails. I was able to chase them down and properly get off their lists. (Gmail also recently added a system for managing subscriptions .) The difference with Proton over other clients is that these tools are brought to the forefront. I had only five email addresses that it didn’t recognize as mailing lists. The vast majority of emails were categorized properly, and the app itself pushed me to use the tools available. A Cozy View Proton Mail via Jacob Roach The look of Proton is familiar. By default, you have a list-style inbox reminiscent of Gmail, with options for standard or “compact” spacing, the latter of which will squish down each line. You can use the column layout, which moves your inbox to the left of the screen with a view for each message on the right, similar to the default Outlook view. You also get a toolbar on the right that will show your contacts and calendar, and a menu on the left that shows your labels and folders. You’ve used an interface like this before. Proton Mail via Jacob Roach Once you start digging around, there are some important differences. When composing an email, you’ll find a handful of buttons at the bottom of the screen. One allows you to set a password, encrypting the email to its destination regardless of the server it travels through. Another lets you set an expiration date for messages, as well as attach your public key; more on that later. I don’t use AI writing assistants, but Proton allows you to run its writing assistant locally, which is an important distinction compared to nearly every other email service with a similar feature. Most AI features run on remote servers, so when you enter prompts with Google’s AI, for instance, those prompts and the responses are stored on Google’s servers. With Proton, you can keep that all local, no remote server involved. You’ll need a PC that meets certain system requirements, and generating text isn’t as fast as on Proton’s servers. But having the option is huge. Proton Mail via Jacob Roach As for reading emails, Proton goes out of its way to make things as straightforward as possible. By default, messages load in full rich text, including images. However, Proton will block images from loading if there are trackers tied to them. It will also, by default, ask for confirmation when you click a link, showing the full URL before it’s loaded. That’s important, especially on mobile devices where you can’t hover over a link to check whether an email is legitimate or a phishing attempt . Most of the features available in the web app or on desktop are available in Proton’s mobile app, which, at the time of writing, was very recently overhauled on Android and iOS. You can bind actions to swiping left or right to quickly archive or organize messages, as well as use offline mode, which is a new addition. My only issue with the mobile app is that it doesn’t provide the same tools for unsubscribing from mailing lists. They’re completely absent, so you’ll need to handle all of that through the web or desktop app.",https://www.wired.com/review/proton-mail,Technology,Washington Post,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eff0fa1cba2fbcf693a46d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/proton-mail-app-Credit-Jacob-Roach.JPG",2025-10-16T07:00:00-04:00,87d4c63aa61c913a4d3f4df73c3ee03e6ecc3450
310687720108,Here’s What Your Browser Is Telling Everyone About You,"shopping, browsers, privacy, chrome, firefox, vpn, websites, the web","The problem with browser fingerprinting is that it's probabilistic in nature. It looks at a treasure trove of data to track you online, not any individual piece of information. A VPN, for instance, can hide your IP address and make you appear in a different location. If enough of the other data in your fingerprint is consistent, however, it can still be used to track you. Your IP address may be different, but just about everything else about your browsing is not. There may be practical use cases for fingerprinting, but you really don’t have much say in the matter. Even with protections like the GDPR, the moment you load a website, there are likely a few dozen (if not more) trackers copying the information your browser shares for their own purposes. Services like Fingerprint leverage that information to create an identifier, but make no mistake, the data is always there. How to Get Around Browser Fingerprinting You can’t get around browser fingerprinting, at least not without significant compromises to your browsing experience (more on that later). Even if you were to spoof or obfuscate every piece of data your browser sends along, that’d probably work against you. The goal with avoiding fingerprinting is to become a Jane Doe online; you want to disappear in the crowd, so every piece of data that makes you stand out sends up a red flag. The best way to fight back against fingerprinting is to hide or rotate enough information so that it’s more difficult to track you, not impossible. And that starts with a VPN, though it doesn’t make you fully anonymous. The clearest online fingerprint you leave is your IP address and physical location, and VPNs hide both. More importantly, many of the best VPNs today include additional tools to combat fingerprinting. ProtonVPN , which is what I use myself, includes NetShield to block trackers, ads, and malware. It doesn’t prevent fingerprinting, but NetShield can at least capture and block requests from well-known trackers to make you a bit more private online. NordVPN has a similar feature, as does Surfshark . The most robust version of this type of blocker comes from Windscribe . Through its browser extension, you can do things like rotate your browser’s user agent to make it appear as if you’re using a different browser, as well as spoof your language, time zone, and GPS information to match the VPN server you’re connected to. Again, this will not make you fully anonymous online. But an extension like the one Windscribe offers makes tracking your fingerprint more difficult.",https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-browser-fingerprinting,Technology,Washington Post,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68f003a5e97d71d6bb451db5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/browser-fingerprint-2-Jacob-Roach.jpg",2025-10-16T11:00:00+00:00,391fe430825fec1edb2319d0a56f294aad68cd62

I started driving that around, and I'm like, I kind of like this. I put an order back in for the Cybertruck and I started building the excitement after that. How do you feel about it now? Oh, I love it. Now, everything else to me—and I'm not talking down on anybody else's stuff, I still love a lot of other vehicles out there—but everything else, to me, those soft lines and everything, it all kind of blends together. And the Cybertruck obviously stands out. I mean, we take the trailer out a lot, and I can go to a campground and there's 50 kids that come out: “Cybertruck, Cybertruck, Cybertruck.” I carry little toys inside the frunk so I can pass them out and give them to kids, and they love it. It's a lot of fun. Anything you don’t like about it? I can't really see the front out of the windshield because it’s so long. What’s the Cybertruck community like? When I had my Bentley and I met other people with Bentleys or Rolls-Royces, it was exclusive. They were a little standoffish to other people with other vehicles. I've learned that with Cybertruck owners, it's like, “Hey, you want to see it? Come on. You want to test drive? Come on.” They're more inclusive. What’s the biggest reaction you’ve gotten from someone while driving it? A couple of months ago, I think it was in Idaho, my son and I stopped at this place where they had a bunch of bears. It was almost infested with bears, it was kind of gross. This person literally drove through the grass, through the bears, and cut off the other cars and was behind me following me out.

Baby Einstein

Amazon

Lowe's

Walmart

Target

The Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother has been in rotation in our house since day one. It’s part sensory toy, part sound machine, and doubles as a tummy time prop with its glowing lights and gentle motion. At night, the machine attaches to the crib and plays lullabies with a soft glow. I love that it combines multiple uses into one machine, so it’s a small but mighty tool that gets a lot of use during both playtime and bedtime. —Nicole Kinning

SweeTooth

Amazon

The SweeTooth Teether feels a little extra, but it’s totally worth it. Shaped like an ice cream cone, it’s just the right size for little hands to grab, and it happens to be the teether my daughter reaches for every time. Maybe it’s the subtle sweet vanilla scent that reels her in—can you blame her? Bonus: It’s easy to clean and dishwasher-safe, which makes me love it almost as much as she does. —Nicole Kinning

730 Project

Amazon (3-pack)

I skipped sippy cups altogether and went straight to straw training with this Amazon dupe of the Honey Bear cup . It’s simple but effective: Give the bottle a little squeeze to help your baby learn how to use the silicone straw. It fits neatly in a diaper bag’s bottle pocket, and it made the transition to straw cups pretty seamless. It’s also easy to take apart and clean—no fussing with tiny pieces—and it’s sturdy enough to survive the occasional roughhousing or chewing. —Nicole Kinning

Kids Preferred

Amazon

Barnes and Noble

This Goodnight Moon soft book is one of those things I picked up on a whim, thinking it wouldn’t make a difference in my day-to-day life as a mom. Boy, was I wrong! This crinkle book has kept my baby entertained on countless road trips, in restaurants, or any time I realize I forget to pack a little distraction for her in the diaper bag. It’s packed with textures, sounds, flaps, and even a teether on the corner, and it clips right onto a stroller or car seat. Selfishly, the condensed story is also nostalgic for me (I grew up with the classic), while my daughter just loves to grab, chew, and crinkle to her heart’s content. —Nicole Kinning

Grownsy

Amazon

Grownsy

Walmart

A baby bottle washer is worth every penny. I said it. In fact, I wrote a whole guide to them , and this was my top pick. This gift might be geared toward parents, rather than babies, but let’s be honest: The less time spent washing bottles, the more time you get with your baby. The Grownsy’s deep interior fits everything from 8-ounce bottles to pump parts, so you can load up a day’s worth of gear at once. With customizable wash modes, this machine quietly and efficiently handles all the work of cleaning grimy bottles without soaking, scrubbing, or chapped hands. —Nicole Kinning

Mushie

Amazon

Mushie

This swaddle was the superhero gift of my baby shower. My son used it every day for his first two years. He was a summer baby, and receiving two of these from his aunt was an absolute necessity to have something to wrap him in without making him too sweaty. We were constantly using it as a layer between him and us so that we wouldn't just sweat all over each other when he wanted a contact nap. These swaddles were large enough to help cover his infant car seat from sunshine in the car or stroller, and now that he's a toddler it's still big enough to use as a summer blanket for bedtime. It's winter now, and we're still using these swaddles as one of his blankets at bedtime. I can't rave enough about them. If you're giving these as a gift, grab two so that Baby will have a backup when they spit up on the first one. There are a ton of pastel colors and cute prints to choose from. — Nena Farrell

Tiny Love

Amazon

Target

My favorite thing to do when my son was really small was place him on different colorful blankets and play mats and watch him experience the kaleidoscope of entertainment 2 inches from his face. His favorite play mat was a hand-me-down from my own childhood, but I've been testing Tiny Love's massive, beautiful mats with my best friend's baby. The Super Mats are super for a reason: They're huge! We're talking over 3 feet on one side and just under 5 feet on the other. But that means plenty of room for Baby to wiggle and explore. The mat is nice and soft, too, which is great to gift to a friend with hardwood floors. There's tons of built-in entertainment, like a little mirror and chewable attachments, which Baby can learn to crawl to as they explore. — Nena Farrell

Munchkin

Amazon

Munchkin

If your favorite baby is a pacifier lover, gift them this little sanitizer so Mom and Dad can keep those pacis clean on the go. It comes with a little strap to hook it onto a diaper bag and uses UV light to sanitize the pacifier in about a minute. It's a handy gadget to have on the go after the pacifier is dropped yet again. You'll still need a wipe handy to clean off any true dirt or grime, but I loved using this to feel like I at least tried to get rid of unseen germs. — Nena Farrell

Walmart (Dragon)

Amazon (Spider)

Target

Look, babies destroy books. I can't tell you how many books in my son's room no longer have covers, or have ripped-off flaps and straight-up eaten-away corners. But one of the sturdiest book series my son has loved is this colorful one by Rosie Greening. There are a handful of different ones, all with similar titles: Never Touch a Spider , Never Touch a Dragon , Never Touch a Polar Bear … the list goes on. It's all about never touching a certain animal or creature unless it's doing something silly that they'll only find in the pages of this book. These books are great for so many reasons: Nice and short! Fun and colorful! Lots of sensory parts to the pages! Hard to rip! My son got one as a gift, and now I'm just continually adding more to our collection. — Nena Farrell

Guidecraft Jr.

Amazon

Target

Guidecraft

I waited too long to get one of these for my kid. He was still into it at age 2 ½—it was his favorite spot to eat dinner, mix cupcakes, and even draw or use Play-Doh at our kitchen island. But I missed out on how we could've had all this kind of fun so much sooner. Especially since this Step-Up Tower from Guidecraft is the new junior version, and it's slimmer than the usual one. That slimmer size makes it easier to add to my kitchen, letting it fit in nicely size-wise without causing any obstructions, and the smaller size makes a smaller kiddo feel more secure. The tower is designed for 18 months and up, and if I have another kid, this tower will be ready and waiting on their half birthday. — Nena Farrell

Jellycat

Amazon

Jellycat

Everyone has heard of Jellycat stuffed animals these days; even the teens want their own. They make a great gift for newborns and toddlers, first as just a little buddy they can look at, and eventually a snuggly friend for bedtime and couch cuddles. Don't be afraid to get a fun Jellycat just because it's for a baby, either: My son has half a dozen of these, but his number one favorite is Grizzo Gremlin. — Nena Farrell

Infantino

Amazon

Target

Walmart (Activity Station)

These aren't real Lego bricks. These building blocks, which have a Lego look, are made by Infantino from a super soft, squishable plastic (BPA-free!) that's easy to stack, squeeze, or even chew on. It's a fun sensory toy as well as a chance to learn to stack and build Lego-style without needing to worry about sharp corners or Baby eating the pieces. My son mostly wanted me to build stuff he could knock down, but I'm hoping the early exposure leads to a love of Lego and building that we can enjoy together for years to come. — Nena Farrell

Vivobarefoot

Vivobarefoot

We're big fans of barefoot shoes around here, and it turns out babies can enjoy them just as much as adults. My son loved Vivobarefoot's Pluma Knit shoes right after he got the hang of walking. These shoes were nice and comfy to pull over his chunky feet, and he used the barefoot texture to his advantage to learn to climb up the slide at a ridiculously early age. He noticeably slipped less when wearing these, so I highly recommend them for new walkers. He had these right after turning 1 in a size 6, but they come in smaller sizes if the baby you're shopping for will be walking sooner (or has less-fat feet than my kid!). Plus, these shoes get a ton of compliments on the playground. — Nena Farrell

Fisher-Price

Walmart

Kohl's

Macy's

We play a lot of video games in our house, so it's no surprise we wanted to snag this baby video game controller for our kid. But it's been a fantastic toy to bring for long drives or when waiting at a restaurant for the food to come out. There are two settings—Learn and Game, per the name—each with its own set of sounds, so it doesn't get too boring to use repeatedly. It's small enough to throw in just about any diaper bag. My son has liked this version a lot better than the similar remote control toy ($15) .  — Nena Farrell

Fisher-Price

Amazon

Barnes and Noble

This little record player is for 18 months and up, but that didn't stop my son from playing with it as soon as he could belly-worm his way over to it. The Fisher Price Record Player comes with five colorful records, each playing two songs, and is sturdy enough to survive the following: constant chewing from a teething baby on both the records and the player, said records being ripped from the player mid-song multiple times, and an unknown number of bumps and throws to the device itself. My personal favorite song is “The Ants Go Marching.” It's a bop. — Nena Farrell

Early Rider

Early Rider

Made for ages 10 months to 2 years old, the Early Rider Bella Velio is an indoor balance bike that's fun for the little ones and pretty enough that no one will mind it's been abandoned in the middle of the rug again. The massive wheels are easy to maneuver while still providing plenty of challenge for a toddler to learn how to stay upright and go in the direction they want. The low profile means they won't have far to fall, and starting indoors where there's soft carpet is less stressful on Mom and Dad. — Nena Farrell

Little Tikes

Wayfair

Walmart

I bought my son a water table for his first birthday, and he's loved it both summers of his little life. I actually bought him the Step2Rain Water Table ($85) and added on this rechargeable water pump ($17) so that water would constantly rain down. But if I could go back in time, I'd get him the Foamo 3-in-1 Water Table instead. It's got a bubble machine and a foam machine built into it, and let me tell you: Toddlers go crazy for it. My son's friend has one, and he has never been so focused (or quiet, praise be) as when he's playing with foam on this water table. It's designed for 2 and up, but my 1-year-old was obsessed. — Nena Farrell

John Deere

Amazon

Target

Walmart

This cool toy, made for 18 months and up, lets a toddler disassemble and reassemble a dump truck with an included toy drill and large screws that attach the truck's pieces together. The hardest part for my son, even now as a 2-year-old, is remembering how to switch the drill's direction to either put the screws in or out. It's a really cool toy that will satisfy the mind of any budding builder or puzzle solver. — Nena Farrell

Yoto

Amazon

Yoto

Technically, the Yoto Player ( Read our review here ) isn't for children under 3 years old. My 2-year-old loved the Mini, though, and I wish I'd gotten it sooner to use as a music box or storyteller in his room during the months of being too young to do more than tummy time and another walk around the block. The Yoto uses cards with an NFC tag that you register with the Yoto app, and then they can play a variety of music and stories. My son's favorite cards are the Super Simple Songs Collection ($35) , followed by the Moana soundtrack ($15) You can even buy blank cards ($18) and make your own custom playlist of content. While the device is designed for ages 3 and up, there are still cards you can buy designed for babies and toddlers; you just need to be the one clicking the buttons. But before you know it, they'll be the DJ. — Nena Farrell

Newton

Amazon

Babies are so cute, and so gross. One minute they're sleeping peacefully, next they've managed to spit up all over the bed and themselves. Get your favorite baby an extra couple sets of sheets for those nights when accidents happen, because nothing's worse than running out of sheets at 2 am after another spit-up or leaky diaper incident. I like this set from Newton Baby ($40) since it's soft, organic, and comes with two crib sheets, plus there are lots of color combos to choose from for Baby's nursery.

Another good backup is extra swaddles or sleep sacks, depending on how old Baby is. (Swaddles are for newborns who can't roll, while sleep sacks are for all other baby stages!) I really like Kyte's gorgeous sleep sacks—they're nice and long, so my son didn't grow out of them as fast as he did Halo sleep sacks . I'd recommend a 1.0 TOG weight for most times of the year, but 0.5 is great for summer, and 2.5 is good for winter. — Nena Farrell

As soon as my son could walk and start grabbing things, he wanted the kitchen broom. My mom saved the day by buying us this Melissa & Doug toy cleaning set that gave him his own pint-sized broom, mop, duster, hand broom, and dustpan. It's been great to placate him when he sees me sweeping or for him to grab on his own. It also works well enough that I can use it in place of my own broom when he won't give it back. Kids learn fast, so don't make my mistake and have a cat bowl nearby. They'll realize the mop is perfect for dipping into it. — Nena Farrell

Lovevery

Lovevery (Every Two Months)

Nervous you won't find a gift that's perfectly age-appropriate? Especially with how much babies can change between just 3 and 6 months, it can feel intimidating to try to find a toy they'll love and be able to use. Lovevery's Play Kits are organized in two- or three-month increments (e.g., 3-4 months, 5-6 months, 22-24 months), making it easy to nail a gift that's right for their developing skills. My son really loved the toys he tried from the various 1-year-old boxes, and the options range from newborn to 5 years old. — Nena Farrell

4912f4defc13,FIFA: U.S. govt to determine 2026 World Cup city safety,,"Oct 16, 2025, 05:34 AM ET FIFA has acknowledged that the United States government has the final say on determining the safety of World Cup host cities. The news comes after U.S. president Donald Trump said FIFA president Gianni Infantino would ""very easily"" move 2026 World Cup matches away from designated host cities if he asked him to. Trump also indicated he would seek to move the 2028 Olympic Games away from Los Angeles if he felt the city was not safe. The U.S. president has previously spoken about moving World Cup matches away from what he deemed ""dangerous"" cities, previously naming Seattle and San Francisco. ""Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide,"" a FIFA spokesperson said. ""Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety. ""We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements."" FIFA has said that decisions on World Cup host city safety lie with the U.S. govt Annabelle Gordon/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images On Thursday, Trump said there had been ""street takeovers"" in Boston and claimed FIFA would move matches for next summer's finals if he asked. ""If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, 'let's move it to another location',"" he told reporters in the U.S. on Tuesday. ""And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily. ""He'd do it and this is the right time to do it. ""I could say the same thing for the Olympics. If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location. ""If I had to on that one, I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that."" -Trump threatens to pull World Cup games from Boston over unrest -All 87 national teams that could win next summer -2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it FIFA president Infantino has developed a close relationship with Trump and most recently attended a Middle East peace summit alongside him in Egypt earlier this week. FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani said ""FIFA makes those decisions"" when asked earlier this month about Trump's original threat to move matches. Montagliani told Leaders Week London: ""With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans."" FIFA is understood to believe there are no issues with any of the 16 host cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in response to Trump's comments: ""The Olympic Games LA28 have the full support of the President of the United States , the Governor of California and the Mayor of Los Angeles. ""All of them are being extremely helpful in the preparations for these Games. This is mirrored on the operational level of the administration. There are three years to go and we are confident that LA28 will be great Olympic Games.""",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46612518/fifa-us-government-host-city-safety-2026-world-cup-donald-trump,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1016%2Fr1560959_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,2fb8f186a01623e66c6fc84d1c390a77a719bcf6

Anthony Devlin/Getty Images Former boxing world champion Ricky Hatton was found hanged at his home, a coroner's court heard Thursday. The 46-year-old was discovered ""unresponsive"" by his manager, Paul Speak, on the morning of Sept. 14 at his house in Hyde, Greater Manchester, the Stockport Coroner's Court was told. The details were given during a brief 10-minute hearing as the inquest into the death of the popular former boxer was opened and adjourned until March 20 by Alison Mutch, senior coroner for Manchester South. ""The provisional cause of death is given as hanging,"" Mutch said. The court heard some details of the discovery of Hatton's body given by police coroner's officer Alison Catlow. The court was told Hatton was last seen by his family on Sept. 12, when he appeared ""well."" But on the morning of Sept. 14, after Hatton did not attend an event as expected, his manager arrived at his home to take him to Manchester Airport to catch a flight to Dubai and found him unresponsive. Hatton's family insisted the former world champion was ""in a good place,"" a doting father and grandfather who had plans for the future including his bags packed for a comeback fight in Dubai in December. His death left his family heartbroken and his army of fans stunned.

Last week, celebrities including Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, former England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen, and boxers Tyson and Tommy Fury attended a memorial service at Manchester Cathedral. Likeable, humble and a joker, Hatton, also known as ""The Hitman,"" was regarded as a ""People's Champion"" and adored by thousands of fans.

7f488a5fb188,NHL,,"Sports can provoke all sorts of emotions. New York Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad , for example, couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry after his team was shut out in their first three home games of the season -- something that had never happened previously in NHL history. Overall, the Rangers are currently 2-3-0 under new coach Mike Sullivan; but those two wins came against the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins , so the jury is still out on whether the Rangers can be goal-scoring threats (who pumped in 10 over their pair of road victories) or if they can't covert against tougher competition (specifically in their own barn). Consider New York an early-season enigma. And they're not the only group drawing all manner of overreaction from around the hockey world. That's our time-honored sporting tradition though, to build up and tear down teams after only a few outings in a months-long season. The 2025-26 NHL campaign is only in its second week, and there are things to discuss -- such as, what clubs are overachieving early? Which ones are cringe-inducing off the bat? And of course, what's going on in the mushy middle? It's a short shelf life for observations of a tiny sample size. Get the takes while they're hot in a quick spin around the league to highlight a few teams in each category -- starting with the happy ones. POSITIVE SURPRISES What's happened: Boston jumped out to a 3-0-0 record -- matching the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers for the best statistical start of the season. Not bad for a Bruins team that finished with 76 points last season, missed the playoffs and generally wasn't saddled with high expectations going into this new season. Boston is wearing its underdog status with pride. Why it happened: Well, it's worth mentioning that last season was ... odd in Beantown. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Jeremy Swayman vastly underperformed after a combative contract negotiation bled into the preseason. Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm suffered injuries that cratered Boston's blue line prospects, and by March there wasn't much GM Don Sweeney could do but send players elsewhere -- including Brad Marchand to the aforementioned Panthers. Somehow the lower expectations heading into 2025-26 have been freeing. Boston has benefitted from a light schedule thus far, topping the Chicago Blackhawks and Sabres out of the gate, but hey, you play who's on the schedule. The Bruins are fifth in goals against, giving up just 2.25 per game, and that's with Lindholm being out with an injury again. David Pastrnak is averaging over a point per game, an excellent sign for Boston's offense. And Swayman is 2-0, with a .966 save percentage. Even though the Bruins fell to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday for their first defeat of the season, it wasn't an altogether bad effort. Just an indication that if Boston wants to stay on track, they'll need to not be too self-satisfied by what they have achieved. Will it continue? It would be easy to dismiss the B's after their Lightning loss as incapable of stacking up against tougher foes. That may prove to be the case -- especially when their starts are that lethargic. The best-case scenario for the Bruins from here is staying in the playoff contention mix, and working in as many prospects as they can to get experience when stakes are lower than they've been in some time for a perennial contender. They haven't resigned themselves to falling for top draft prospect Gavin McKenna just yet. What's happened: Seattle went from bringing up the Pacific Division's rear last season to scrambling their way up the standings with a strong push into this new campaign. That's included already topping one key divisional opponent -- the Vegas Golden Knights -- and doing so without a singular superstar in the mix. Intriguing! Why it happened: The Kraken have cracked down defensively. Seattle is tied for sixth-fewest goals against per game (2.33) and they're averaging fewer than 30 shots on goal per game. Even when the Kraken are making errors, it's in wildly entertaining games like their overtime thriller in Montreal that ended with Seattle's first loss of the season. The Kraken have gotten strong goaltending from Joey Daccord (.918 SV%), but the impressive thing about Seattle is they don't exactly have a stable of top-end skaters. They appear to excel by the committee approach. Jared McCann and Vince Dunn pace the team with four points each, and the Kraken already have seven different goal scorers. Seattle wasn't meant to be a head-turner this season, but their slow and steady approach could yield more positive dividends. Will it continue? The Kraken's lack of elite talent may eventually catch up to them as other squads get their defensive games in order. Seattle has an uphill battle given who's in their division -- hello, Edmonton! -- and they'll need to keep proving themselves against tougher competition. The same could be said for other teams, though. Consider the Kraken to be an underdog who will at least contemplate making additions instead of subtractions prior to the trade deadline. What's happened: Nashville was not a good surprise last season. That could change this season. The Predators sputtered about in 2024-25 despite Steven Stamkos coming aboard -- in what was, admittedly, a disappointing individual campaign for him. Nashville vowed to regroup under now second-year head coach Andrew Brunette, and the Predators have looked (mostly) true to their word with a 2-1-1 record, a sensational goaltender, and stars ready to stay alight. Why it happened: Don't let that third period against Toronto define your opinion of the Predators. They were tied 2-2 with the Maple Leafs going into the third period on the second half of a back-to-back with No. 2 netminder Justus Annunen making his first start of the season. Nashville showed resiliency coming back from a 2-0 deficit and they grinded to the finish line. What's been working for the Predators is spreading the wealth offensively. Ryan O'Reilly is a commanding top-line center (with two goals in four games), while Erik Haula and Jonathan Marchessault (both with a pair of markers) are clicking on their third unit. The real revelation though is goaltender Juuse Saros . He's off to a 2-0-1 start with a .947 SV%. Saros has been Nashville's savior in years past, and it's hurt them to rely too heavily on his contributions. If Nashville can supplement it's goaltending with solid defense -- led by the often-impeccable Roman Josi -- and even more offensive firepower -- Stamkos and Filip Forsberg are still coming along -- then the Predators can stay on the right side of surprise this time. Will it continue? Nashville can't afford to be one-dimensional. Saros can't carry them to the point that they are winning one-goal games every time out. And at some point, the power play will have to get rolling (5.9% isn't going to cut it). What Nashville is showing so far is character. They've got some juice. How far does it take them? Possibly to a wild-card playoff spot -- the Central Division is a beast, after all -- and that's more likely to happen if the Preds dedicate as strongly on the defensive side as they do offensively. This team is having a whole lot of fun (and not just because they passed out some incredible Wild Wing-inspired masks to fans this week). Anaheim seems to have found new life under first-year head coach Joel Quenneville. And so too has veteran forward Chris Kreider , who joined Anaheim in an offseason trade from the Rangers, and has four goals through three games. He's been aided by rising star Leo Carlsson -- one of those high draftees (second overall in 2023) who seemed destined to always be deemed ""underrated"" by those less engaged with the Western Conference -- and Cutter Gauthier -- who has found the fresh start he was looking for outside Philadelphia. The Ducks have the league's fourth-ranked offense (averaging four goals per game) and the second-best power play, at 36.4%. To splash a little water on the party, Anaheim is also allowing the sixth-most goals per game, and they aren't exactly a defensive powerhouse yet, despite some seasoned veterans like Radko Gudas and Jacob Trouba on the blue line. Their 2-1-0 record to open the season is something to note as the Ducks perhaps begin sprinting towards daylight at the end of their rebuild. SURPRISING STRUGGLERS What's happened: The Sabres weren't necessarily counted among the elite Stanley Cup contenders heading into this season. But it took Buffalo fans all of three games to start ""Fire Adams!"" chants and wear paper bag adornments on their heads. So, aside from an out-of-character outburst on Wednesday night, not much good is going on right now. Breaking News from Emily Kaplan Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why it happened: Injuries have certainly played a role in Buffalo's bumbling. Josh Norris -- who arrived with health concerns when the Sabres acquired him in a trade last season for forward Dylan Cozens -- is sidelined for at least eight weeks with an upper-body injury. Zach Benson was unavailable the first three games, defensemen Michael Kesselring and Mattias Samuelsson are out, starting goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen is ailing and Jordan Greenway is still rehabbing from a summer surgery. That's quite the full infirmary. Regardless, Buffalo still has most of its top players available, and they aren't doing nearly enough. The Sabres were outscored 10-2 in their opening 0-3-0 skid (to average a league-worst 0.67 goals per game). Their power play went 0-for-11 in that span. Alex Lyon has stepped up in net with Luukonen out, but he can't make up for the Sabres' lack of offense. Tage Thompson and Alex Tuch have one goal apiece; Jason Zucker is the real standout, with three (!). and Rasmus Dahlin has tossed in a trio of assists. However, most of that output came in Wednesday's game against Ottawa, where Buffalo showed signs of life against a team depleted by the loss of captain Brady Tkachuk . Can that momentum translate against other clubs? We shall see. The Sabres haven't shown they necessarily have the depth to account for their injured parties and it's an indictment on Adams' management (hence those jerseys flying onto the ice). Buffalo doesn't have the defensive details to hold their opponents at bay without further goal support. And it's put them behind the eight ball early. Will it continue? The Sabres aren't hurting for talent; they're starved for execution. Benson returned for Wednesday's game and that was a boost Buffalo needed. One bad week (or two) won't define a season for Thompson, Tuch or Dahlin. It's really whether the Sabres can command confidence through their struggles that might determine success from here. It's been 14 years since Buffalo made the playoffs. It's not a benchmark players want to hear about every day, but that's what comes up when your start is this shaky. Negativity can galvanize a group, though. If the Sabres can rally around one another and push back against their critics, they can stop their slide before it avalanches. Unfortunately, history isn't exactly on their side. What's happened: The Canucks' sputtering stars have led to a lackluster start that's fallen well below what level their talent should be capable of achieving. As it is, Vancouver is 1-2-0 to hold a share of the Pacific Division basement. The enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Why it happened: Vancouver's top line has been a disaster. Jake DeBrusk , Elias Pettersson and Brock Boeser clearly don't complement one another. There's no real ""worker"" on that unit to go in the corner and dig pucks out; all three are looking to score. Which is good -- but only if you've got the puck long enough to do so. In general, Pettersson isn't proving to be the true first-unit pivot that Vancouver needs. The Canucks' highest-paid player is coming off a woeful 2024-25 season where he scored just 15 goals in 64 games. Vancouver isn't exactly reveling in a bounce-back showing now. Pettersson -- with one assist and three shots to his credit -- is mostly invisible on the ice offensively (although he's only been on for one goal against). The Canucks can't thrive without him finding a rhythm, with or without his current linemates. Vancouver's power play has yet to convert too, and that's left them to languish with the league's 24th-ranked offense (averaging 2.67 goals per game). The Canucks are fortunate to have an all-world defenseman in Quinn Hughes and a possible Team USA Olympian goaltender in Thatcher Demko , who is 1-1-0, with a .944 SV%. Until Vancouver's offense generates a spark, the defensive efforts won't be enough to carry the Canucks up the standings. Will it continue? It's fair to say there are growing pains for plenty of teams with a new coach. Adam Foote took over this season, and he's still putting his mark on this group. Vancouver has the raw material. The Canucks' fourth line has been particularly solid. Vancouver needs more of that work ethic from the rest of their skaters. Self-inflicted wounds and giving up response goals have hurt the Canucks as well. It's their details more than anything that aren't sharp. Scoring breeds confidence though, and if Vancouver can light the lamp a little more -- and serve up fewer odd-man opportunities the other way to torpedo their progress -- there will be brighter days ahead here. If we're going to call out the Canucks for top-line chemistry issues, it's only fair to note they are not the only Pacific Division club dealing with those difficulties. The Golden Knights acquired Mitch Marner in a trade with Toronto then signed him to a massive eight-year, $96 million extension, with the intention Marner would ride shotgun with Jack Eichel to dominate offensively. That hasn't happened -- yet. Eichel and Marner worked together throughout the preseason but after three games, coach Bruce Cassidy had to separate his stars -- as least temporarily. Those two are pass-first players (and excellent ones at that), but someone must do the scoring, and it can't be on Ivan Barbashev alone to get that job done when they're a trio. Cassidy must find some way to get Marner and Eichel to click. Vegas starting 1-2-0 probably wasn't what GM Kelly McCrimmon was envisioning when he went after the star winger. The good news is that Vegas has endless potential; all that's required is tapping into it.",https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/46606038/nhl-2025-26-shock-surprise-best-worst-teams-stats-standings-playoffs,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560671_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,fc297e9a8195b378b888c4377c341f5f78245fbe
ccc0cfd68af3,India Tiptoes Around Trump’s Latest Claims on Russian Oil Purchases,"international relations, us foreign policy, india, us, oil and gasoline, tariff, narendra modi, donald trump, russian invasion of ukraine (2022)","The Indian government on Thursday appeared to push back against President Trump’s claim that the country would halt buying Russian oil but stopped short of explicitly rejecting his comments, as it seeks to resolve a trade dispute with Washington by avoiding a public confrontation. In a statement, India’s foreign ministry made no mention of any such promise by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but noted that the country had always sought a diverse range of suppliers for its oil imports. The nonconfrontational response is a sign of how Mr. Modi is seeking to find a delicate resolution with the Trump administration to lift hefty U.S. tariffs, in the hopes of restoring calm to a relationship between the countries that was carefully nurtured over two decades. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the Indian leader had “assured me today that he will not be buying Russian oil,” which his administration has said was fueling Russia war in Ukraine. In August, the Trump administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on imports of Indian goods as punishment, on top of a 25 percent tariff it had already put in place. Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesman for the Indian foreign ministry, said in a news conference on Thursday that he had no knowledge of a call between the two leaders in recent days. But unlike a few months ago, when the government issued a firm pushback after Mr. Trump made a similar claim about Russian oil purchases, Mr. Jaiswal walked a more careful line. Earlier, he had issued a statement that amounted to a denial, without challenging the president directly. The statement said that India’s oil imports are guided by a “consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario.” It added that the country has been “diversifying as appropriate,” including buying more oil from the United States. The ties between the country’s two leaders, who had long touted their close bond, has been thorny during the second Trump administration. The relationship worsened after India denied Mr. Trump’s claim that he had brokered a cease-fire between India and Pakistan after a military conflict between the countries this spring. Any admission that Mr. Modi called off his military operation under pressure from America would be politically risky to the Indian leader’s strongman image at home. But Mr. Trump, who has been focused on his image as a peacemaker deserving of the Nobel Prize, saw the denial as ungrateful. He narrowed in on India’s purchases of Russian oil, which New Delhi has said were encouraged by American officials before Mr. Trump took office to keep market prices in check. The decision to impose the tariffs that has all but grounded relations between the countries. Indian officials have described the tariffs as unfair since other major importers of Russian oil, like China, have not faced similar penalties. “If Trump wants India to behave a certain way, going public about it is the worst thing he could do,” said Harsh V. Pant, a visiting professor of international relations at King’s College London. “It makes it difficult for a policymaker in a country like India to be seen to be toeing a particular line under American pressure.” In recent weeks, the two sides have focused on quiet diplomacy to try and get things back on track. The trade delegations have resumed negotiations and Mr. Modi was among the first global leaders to celebrate Mr. Trump’s role in brokering the hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas. The Indian leader called Mr. Trump on Oct. 9 to congratulate him and to review “the good progress achieved in trade negotiations.” Sergio Gor, a Trump confidante who was recently confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to India, made a four-day trip this month to the country ahead of starting his posting. He held meetings with Mr. Modi and other top officials, even though it is unconventional for an ambassador to do so before he has officially presented his credentials. S. Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, told a gathering in New Delhi this month that the two sides were working on resolving their outstanding trade issues so they do not “percolate into every dimension of the relationship.” “There are problems, there are issues, nobody is in denial of it,” Mr. Jaishankar said. “Those issues need to be negotiated and discussed and resolved, which is exactly what we are trying to do.” Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of Mr. Modi’s economic advisory council, said India had chosen to stand its ground on its interests and not respond to “snide remarks and sometimes what could be deemed as racist remarks against India” by advisers of Mr. Trump. “We have in general been quite restrained,” he told an economic forum this month. Indrani Bagchi, a foreign-policy analyst and chief executive of the Ananta Aspen Center, a think-tank, in New Delhi, said Mr. Trump may be trying to exert leverage through his remarks. “If it’s pressure tactics, I don’t think India is going to fold,” said Hari Kumar contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/world/asia/india-trump-russia-oil.html,World,Washington Post,By Mujib Mashal and Pragati K.B.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16INT-INDIA-TRUMP-OIL-01-qpbh/16INT-INDIA-TRUMP-OIL-01-qpbh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-16T12:00:18.327000+00:00,b9646cb8ecc78aaa5cce827c0b170b79b13b26e8
01ecbfc423c0,Review: Yamaha True X Surround 90a Dolby Atmos Soundbar System,"audio, home entertainment, speakers, review, soundbars, shopping, yamaha","Another baffling omission, especially on a high-end system with surround speakers that can be placed almost anywhere: There’s no room correction. Limited Streaming Yamaha MusicCast via Simon Cohen Yamaha MusicCast via Simon Cohen Music streaming is a mixed bag, largely because of Yamaha’s limited options. The True X Surround 90A supports Apple AirPlay, Tidal Connect, and Spotify Connect, but it doesn’t work with Google Cast or Alexa Cast. It works with DLNA servers, but unlike some other Yamaha products, there’s no Roon support. I found that the MusicCast app’s native support for streaming services proved to be the most reliable high-quality option, though sadly, it’s a very limited set: Amazon Music, Qobuz, Deezer, SiriusXM, and Pandora. Bluetooth is also an option, but with only SBC and AAC codecs, it’s best for casual listening. Still, listening to lossless, hi-res FLAC tracks from Amazon Music and Qobuz was exhilarating, especially when using the All listening mode. Bottom line? Yamaha’s True X Surround 90A can enthrall you with its clarity and precision. It adds breathtaking realism to movies and shows, often revealing details that lesser soundbars obscure. Much of that performance translates to music, too, as long as you don’t mind its streaming service limitations. The fully wireless surrounds provide excellent immersion and a lot of flexibility, both in terms of placement and use as a secondary sound system. But Yamaha charges a hefty price for the True X Surround 90A, and with a big investment comes big expectations. The lack of inputs, the lack of control over the center channel level, and the absence of room correction are serious omissions. Apple Music subscribers who want to get the highest-quality audio should also note the absence of any way to get a lossless or Dolby Atmos signal to the soundbar, without the use of an intermediary device like an Apple TV 4K. That’s a lot of compromises. This makes it hard to give the True X Surround 90A an unqualified recommendation.

Sign up here . Good morning. To clarify: Editors are well-dressed too! In fact, some of STAT’s best-dressed folks are editors. Happy Summit day two! Medicare backs off plan to pause doctor payments The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said late last night that it was not pausing all Medicare payments to doctors, after a statement hours earlier had asserted that it would. Instead, the agency will only wait to process claims that are related to programs that have expired, such as some telehealth or rural services. For background: The agency had said yesterday it was pausing all Medicare payments to doctors as negotiations tied to the government shutdown drag on, a move that surprised and worried clinicians, community health centers, and other health care providers. STAT’s Daniel Payne and Tara Bannow have the updated details . CDC leaders, a YouTube sensation, and the cutest baby It was a lively first day at the STAT Summit here in Boston. Here are some of the highlights: Emma Walmsley, CEO of the drugmaker GSK, downplayed the company’s role in the FDA’s effort to update the prescribing information of the long-shelved drug leucovorin so that it can be used to treat a condition often associated with autism. GSK no longer makes the treatment, but the move to update the drug label will allow generic manufacturers to update their labels as well. Read more from STAT’s Elaine Chen. Former CDC leaders Rochelle Walensky and Dan Jernigan stopped short of saying they no longer trust the CDC. But they did say it’s been harder to trust CDC guidance under the Trump administration, and that physician groups should step up to fill the void. Read more from STAT’s Chelsea Cirruzzo. And they weren’t the only ones with this point of view. YouTube sensation “Doctor Mike” Varshavski had some spicy comments on messaging for the American Medical Association as well as federal health agencies. “How many times would I scroll past a CDC post with three likes on it? It’s literally the equivalent of not doing it,” he said. Particularly when it comes to the AMA, Varshavski’s criticism is part of a wave of resistance from physicians to its historically quiet advocacy strategy. Read more from me. Kyle and Nicole Muldoon shared an inside look at how their family went from heartbreak to cautious hope after their son KJ was diagnosed with a rare urea cycle disorder and underwent gene therapy treatment. A story about celebrating a Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle brought many in the audience to tears. “This is what we thought we would never get,” Kyle said. Read more from STAT’s Megan Molteni. What to expect at Summit day two These are the panels I’m most looking forward to today: First thing this morning, STAT’s Chelsea Cirruzzo will talk with American Medical Association president Bobby Mukkamala. And between the flurry of HHS news, the CMS confusion above, and yesterday’s criticism of the AMA from Doctor Mike, there’s plenty to discuss. Later, STAT’s Anil Oza will speak with former NIH leaders and a data analyst who is tracking the impact of health agency funding cuts about the upheaval at the agency since January. To prepare for the session, consider revisiting the science team’s project on the impact of the Trump administration’s first 100 days . Joe Kennedy III, a former Massachusetts Democratic congressman, will talk with STAT’s executive editor Rick Berke about efforts to protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, the importance of expanding access to mental health care, the government shutdown, and more. Rick asked some great questions from the audience yesterday (at one point energetically rebutting a speaker who wished him a happy birthday: “How about for my birthday you answer my question?”) so I have a feeling it’ll be great to see him flex his reporting muscles on stage with a Kennedy. An ex-vegan Texan restauranteur puts a MAHA vision to the test After decades of dishing out raw vegan bowls to stars at his family’s California restaurants (including the famously kitschy Cafe Gratitude in L.A.), Ryland Engelhart decided to take up a new life as a “regenerative” farmer in Texas. Until he can coax some native plants to grow, Engelhart is cover-cropping (a process that involves planting fast-growing grass to keep weeds at bay without herbicides) while shuffling a small flock of sheep around the fields so they can fertilize naturally , if you know what I mean. (See above.) Sovereignty Ranch hits all the buzzwords of the Make America Healthy Again movement: it’s a decentralized, small-scale, family-owned, chemical-free farm. STAT’s Isabella Cueto visited Engelhart at the ranch last month and attended its first “Food is Medicine” summit. Engelhart has known Kennedy for years — their relationship goes back to a sweat lodge, Isa writes, as many MAHA stories do. Read Isa’s story for an up-close look at how Sovereignty Ranch may serve as proof-of-concept for MAHA’s farms of the future. Large LGBTQ+ health center will stop gender-affirming care for those under 19 Fenway Health, a Boston-based health center devoted to LGBTQ+ inclusive care, announced Monday that the system will stop providing gender-affirming care to patients under age 19 “due to a change in federal requirements that went into effect October 1, 2025.” It appears to be the first major LGBTQ+ clinic to submit to Trump’s executive order from January on gender-affirming care for children and young adults, following multiple stoppages of care at children’s hospitals across the country. Last month, the Health Resources and Services Administration — which provides funding to federally qualified centers like Fenway — said that it would deprioritize funding programs that engage in gender-affirming care. The move from Fenway came as a shock to trans patients and others. “I was previously on the board of this organization and I’ve never been so disgusted with their leadership cowardly capitulating like this,” Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, said in a post on BlueSky.

ef1dd217bebe,2025 NFL trade deadline: Proposing 13 offers that make sense,,"It's one of the best times of the year. NFL trade winds are blowing, and we've already seen a number of players move in midseason deals. Most in-season trades involve a player on the bottom of an NFL roster moving for a swap of Day 3 picks, but we've also seen an interesting swap of starting cornerbacks in Greg Newsome II and Tyson Campbell , plus a starting quarterback switch teams in Joe Flacco (which was apparently enough to irk Mike Tomlin in his news conference on Monday). After a handful of trades last week, though, there have been no notable swaps this week. I'm here to help. As general managers get on the phone and try to piece together deals, I've come up with 13 moves that make sense for both teams. I've aimed for realism over sheer entertainment. So while I'd love to dial up a bunch of superstars being shipped around for fun, the goal here is to find deals that could actually happen in real life before the trade deadline at 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Nov. 4. Subscribe: 'The Bill Barnwell Show' Last year, the league was listening! In the 2024 version of this column , I started by suggesting the Chiefs send a fifth-round pick to the Titans for DeAndre Hopkins . Six days later, the Chiefs sent a fifth-round pick to the Titans for the legendary wide receiver. I also had the Steelers landing Mike Williams in a trade with the Jets , though they sent a fifth-rounder when I thought a seventh-rounder was a more realistic return. Not all of the moves came true -- I'm guessing the Panthers are happy they didn't send Bryce Young to the Dolphins -- but I bring those moves up as a sign that we're on the right track. In this year's column, we have a legendary quarterback, a handful of former first-round picks and a first-team All-Pro on the move. Let's dig in. Jump to an intriguing trade candidate: Trey Hendrickson | Jaelan Phillips Jakobi Meyers | Russell Wilson Riq Woolen | Taysom Hill | Kyle Dugger Chargers shore up their RB room Chargers get: RB Jerome Ford , 2027 seventh-round pick Browns get: 2027 sixth-round pick The Chargers weren't expecting to need a running back after they added Najee Harris and Omarion Hampton this offseason, but plans change. Harris is out for the year with a torn Achilles , while Hampton is on injured reserve and sidelined indefinitely with an ankle injury . The Chargers got a 124-yard game out of Kimani Vidal in last week's win over the Dolphins , but Vidal is a second-year pro the Chargers released at the end of training camp before adding him to the practice squad. Even if he is going to figure into the rotation, the 4-2 Chargers are going to want to add help in their backfield. With Alvin Kamara reportedly preferring to stay in New Orleans, there's no high-profile veteran likely to be available right now. I thought about someone like Rico Dowdle , whose path to starting work might be squeezed once Chuba Hubbard returns, but the Panthers are 3-3 and in real contention for a potential playoff berth in the NFC. It might be logical to get peak value on a back coming off consecutive 200-plus-yard games from scrimmage, but Dowdle will have a meaningful role over the rest of the season. That brings us to the Browns, who have turned to Quinshon Judkins as their starter and have no intentions of contending in 2025. Ford has become a passing-down back for Cleveland; while he played 31 offensive snaps in last week's loss to the Steelers , 29 of those snaps were on Dillon Gabriel dropbacks. The two exceptions were Ford's only two carries of the game. Ford's due only $1.2 million over the rest of 2025, and he has averaged a respectable 4.4 yards per carry as a pro, often with dismal passing attacks. As a veteran back who can soak up meaningful touches now and complement Hampton after the rookie returns, Ford fits the sort of profile the Chargers would be looking to add via trade. The Browns would need to find another back to help absorb some of the pass-down workload behind Judkins, but the draft picks are worth more to Cleveland than guys who are going to help their 2025 roster. Giants get an impact WR Giants get: WR Jakobi Meyers , 2026 fourth-round pick, cash considerations Raiders get: CB Deonte Banks , 2026 fifth-round pick Meyers has been quiet for the Raiders this season. After a 98-yard day for Las Vegas in the opening-week win over the Patriots , Meyers has averaged just 46 yards per game since. The 28-year-old is in the final year of his three-year, $33 million deal , and while Meyers requested a trade in camp, the Raiders declined to deal their top wideout. This will likely be his last season in silver and black, and Vegas probably wouldn't mind moving the $7 million remaining on Meyers' deal in 2025 elsewhere. The Raiders would have to eat some of that money to get this deal done, but let's say they pay $3 million as part of this trade and open up a spot in their lineup for second-round pick Jack Bech . In return, they would land the fourth cornerback off the board in the 2023 draft in Banks. Still only 24, Banks has the size (6-foot-2) and frame that Pete Carroll typically loves in his CBs, a position where the Raiders are hardly settled. Eric Stokes is on a one-year deal, while Kyu Blu Kelly has allowed a 122.5 rating in coverage , per Pro Football Reference. The Giants clearly liked Banks enough to use a first-round pick on him, but he has never put things together in New York. The Giants stripped Banks of his starting job this season, rotating him with Cor'Dale Flott across from Paulson Adebo . And over the past few weeks, Banks was beaten on a double-move for a touchdown by the Chargers' Quentin Johnston in Week 4 and then committed a 25-yard pass interference penalty early in the Week 5 Saints game against Chris Olave . He has played just 10 defensive snaps over the past two weeks, seemingly falling out of the rotation at cornerback. Banks is owed $3.9 million guaranteed over the next three years, so the Giants would shed some money as part of this deal, too. They would add a much-needed receiver for Jaxson Dart , who is down his top wideout with Malik Nabers out for the season . Darius Slayton is also battling a hamstring injury . Meyers is probably best in the slot, where the Giants prefer to use Wan'Dale Robinson , but he took the majority of his snaps out wide in 2024 and still managed a 1,027-yard campaign. I'm not sure I would typically advocate for a 2-4 team to add a 28-year-old receiver about to enter free agency, but given how much the heads of the Giants organization have riding on Dart's success in 2025 for their own futures, this might be an exception. Seahawks, Eagles swap corners Eagles get: CB Riq Woolen , 2026 fifth-round pick Seahawks get: CB Kelee Ringo , 2026 fourth-round pick Let's swap frustrating cornerbacks. The Seahawks have seemingly fallen out of love with Woolen, who was benched for stretches in 2024 and got off to a rough start in 2025. The 6-foot-4 cornerback gave up a big gain to Ricky Pearsall and was out-jumped for the game-winning touchdown by Jake Tonges in Week 1 . He has already committed six penalties in five games, including two flags for pass interference. In the final year of his deal, Woolen's likely going to be wearing another uniform in 2026. He could wear an Eagles uniform in 2025, though. Philly desperately needs a third cornerback to play on the outside across from Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean , and though Woolen has struggled to match what was a sterling performance as a rookie, he's going to offer more upside than just about anybody the Eagles can acquire at the deadline. The other corners on the market are going to be either similarly frustrating young prospects ( Cam Taylor-Britt of the Bengals, Joshua Williams of the Chiefs) or replacement-level journeymen (Saints corner Isaac Yiadom or Commanders corner Noah Igbinoghene ). Woolen is a shot worth taking and a potential project for Vic Fangio over the rest of the season. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The Seahawks would get some draft capital and their own developmental prospect in Ringo, who hasn't been able to regularly crack the starting lineup in Philadelphia. Ringo has one extra year of team control, and he would slot in as a reserve cornerback when star Devon Witherspoon is healthy. The Seahawks would also lock in some draft capital, which wouldn't be guaranteed if they let Woolen leave in free agency. They might see this move as addition by subtraction, frankly. Lions land big-time pass rusher Lions get: Edge Trey Hendrickson , 2026 fourth-round pick Bengals get: 2026 second-round pick Let's see the Lions make their all-in move. General manager Brad Holmes comes from Los Angeles, where the Rams sent second- and third-round picks to the Broncos to add Von Miller in 2021, paying extra to get Denver to eat virtually all of Miller's remaining salary. The eight-time Pro Bowler had four sacks and six knockdowns during the Rams' push to the Super Bowl . Holmes had already made his way to Detroit by the time that all happened, but I don't think he'll be naive to the impact of adding a second great pass rusher to a roster. The Lions have one superstar up front in Aidan Hutchinson , but they've never really landed that second one. Alim McNeill has been a solid disruptor on the interior, but the defensive tackle is still recovering from a torn ACL and just returned to practice last week. Marcus Davenport is on injured reserve with a chest issue . Al-Quadin Muhammad has 4.5 sacks, but the well-traveled veteran had just 15 sacks in his first seven pro seasons -- and 2.5 of his sacks in 2025 were on plays where he was either unblocked or cleaned up as part of a coverage sack. Muhammad's a useful player, but I think the Lions could upgrade across from Hutchinson. Furthermore, the Lions are dealing with a secondary that's already battered by injuries. Free agent addition D.J. Reed (hamstring) is on injured reserve , while Terrion Arnold narrowly avoided a multimonth shoulder injury . Arnold, a 2024 first-round pick, was struggling even before he went down hurt. One way to help that secondary is to have a more efficient pass rush, especially without needing to blitz. If the Lions are ever going to make that all-in swing, this is the year. Holmes has more than $25 million in cap space and a bevy of players coming up for contracts after this season. Hutchinson, Jahmyr Gibbs , Brian Branch , Sam LaPorta and Jack Campbell are all likely to sign extensions over the next 12 months, which will eat up significant cash and cap space. Trading for a player on a short-term contract such as Hendrickson is a luxury the Lions can afford now. It will be much more difficult in the years to come. And while Holmes and coach Dan Campbell are very careful about establishing a culture in Detroit, Campbell would have crossed paths with the talented defensive end when he and Hendrickson were both in New Orleans. This wouldn't be as risky as it seems. play 1:36 Schefter: NFL trades will happen this week Adam Schefter details to Pat McAfee the buyers and sellers in the NFL trade market. I've pitched a Hendrickson to the Lions trade before, and it's come with more draft capital going to the Bengals. This wouldn't be as lucrative of a deal. Why? Timing. If the Lions were going to acquire Hendrickson during the offseason, it would have been as part of a move to sign the star pass rusher to an extension. Now, with Hendrickson in the final year of his deal, this would be a pure rental. The Bengals are closer to losing Hendrickson for nothing in free agency. The Bengals have to be realistic about their chances of competing for a title without Joe Burrow , who is out indefinitely with a toe injury . They've lost four straight without their star quarterback and by an average of more than 21 points per contest. The Bengals have a three-game homestand against the Steelers , Jets and Bears to come before their Week 10 bye, but the chances that they'll hold on with Joe Flacco at quarterback well enough to stay in the playoff race by the time Burrow comes back are slim. If they're going to lose Hendrickson this offseason, trading him now could lock in a second-round pick in the 2026 draft as opposed to landing a potential compensatory pick in 2027. It also saves the Bengals nearly $11 million in cash. And while I could be cynical and say that it's money the Bengals would be in position to pocket, that's real money the Bengals could push toward making the 2026 team better as opposed to wasting it on a 2025 team that's dead on arrival without Burrow at quarterback. And in a division where the Packers added Micah Parsons and promptly blew out the Lions , would Hendrickson shift the balance of power back toward Detroit? Lions land another big-time pass rusher Lions get: Edge Jaelan Phillips , 2026 seventh-round pick Dolphins get: 2026 fourth-round pick Sorry, I should have clarified: I'm arguing that the Lions should go all-in . This team experienced what it was like to lose Hutchinson and virtually every one of its other ambulatory pass rushers last season. Its secondary is battling injuries. No team has ever made it into January and complained that it had too many pass rushers. Detroit ranks 27th in quick pressure rate when it rushes four or fewer at the quarterback, per NFL Next Gen Stats. So the Lions could very comfortably stand to add two impactful pass rushers to their roster between now and the trade deadline. Phillips' stats aren't overwhelming, as the 2021 first-round pick has just one sack and three knockdowns through five games, but there's a lot more to like under the hood. His 14.5% pressure rate and 6.8% quick pressure rate, both per Next Gen Stats, are well above league average for edge rushers with 100 or more snaps this season. Phillips' average pressure comes after just 2.6 seconds, the seventh-fastest rate among that cohort. He has battled a series of injuries, including an Achilles tear and a pair of ACL tears , but he has been healthy this season. play 1:22 Why Stephen A. puts Dolphins' woes on McDaniel, not Tua Stephen A. Smith explains why Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel needs to be fired after Tua Tagovailoa expressed his frustrations. Adding Phillips would give defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard more depth at edge rusher and the ability to present some exotic looks and real problems for guards on passing downs. Watch the highlight of Ladd McConkey 's 42-yard catch late in the fourth quarter against the Dolphins last week, and you'll see the 26-year-old immediately roast Mekhi Becton on the interior, blowing up the play. Justin Herbert does a great job of shrugging off Phillips to find McConkey, but creating pressure is the best indicator of future sacks. With Hutchinson and Hendrickson on the outside, Phillips would be a terrifying matchup for guards alongside McNeill. It would hurt the Lions to trade multiple draft picks for Hendrickson and Phillips on short-term contracts, but they would likely be in position to recoup some of those selections later on. Given the amount of money they'll need to spend over the next 12 months to keep their young talent around on new contracts, it would be a surprise if the Lions were heavy spenders in free agency this upcoming offseason. Hendrickson and Phillips should both be in position to garner Detroit compensatory picks in the 2027 draft. Those picks won't make the trade free, but if the Lions send second- and fourth-round picks out in 2026 and get fourth- and seventh-rounders in 2026 to go with fourth- and fifth-round compensatory picks in 2027, that's not an arduous price to pay to add two talented pass rushers to a team with Super Bowl aspirations. For the Dolphins, this would be about saving money and clearing up opportunities. Trading Phillips would save a sinking Miami team $8.8 million in cash and open up a starting role for second-year edge rusher Chop Robinson , who has been limited to 38% of the defensive snaps this season while playing behind Phillips and Bradley Chubb . Robinson was one of the best pass rushers in the game after he entered the lineup as a rookie; he needs to play. The Dolphins are unlikely to sign Phillips after the season. They're also more likely to be active in free agency than the Lions, which could cause any potential compensatory pick for Phillips to be nullified. This would be a little less than what the 49ers sent the Commanders for Chase Young a couple of years ago -- another young, talented edge rusher with a significant injury history. It feels like a logical move for both sides. Colts get QB insurance Colts get: QB Russell Wilson Giants get: 2026 seventh-round pick Getting one former Giants quarterback has worked out well for the Colts, with Daniel Jones currently leading the NFL in QBR (79.7). Why not try to collect the whole set? In all seriousness, Indy needs a backup behind Jones, who has completed a full season as a starter without missing time with injuries just once in his seven-year pro career. Jones' sack rate is thankfully way down, but he's still taking hits on 13.3% of his snaps this season.

Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . This was probably already a need before Anthony Richardson Sr . fractured his orbital bone in a freak pregame incident before Sunday's win over the Cardinals and was put on injured reserve. If Jones did go down, the next man up would be former Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard , who was taken in the sixth round of this year's draft. It's fun to think about GM Chris Ballard pulling out his old quarterback Rolodex and calling up Andrew Luck or Philip Rivers to come play for a playoff team, but the Colts don't want to be stuck turning to an untested rookie if Jones gets hurt. Enter Wilson, who is clearly surplus to requirements in New York after being benched for Jaxson Dart. Wilson has made fill-in appearances twice over the past three weeks while Dart was being evaluated for injuries, but the Giants could easily turn that role over to Jameis Winston , who has been the third quarterback all season. Wilson didn't look great for most of his brief tenure in New York, but we did see him torch the Cowboys for 450 yards and three touchdowns in Week 2 . We've also seen Jones look much better after leaving the Giants to join the Colts (after a brief stop in Minnesota last season). I wouldn't expect the same sort of leap out of Wilson, but could he be a passable starter if the Colts need someone to step in? It wouldn't be expensive to find out: Indianapolis would be giving up only a seventh-round pick and would owe Wilson about $1.3 million over the remainder of 2025, which will likely be the 36-year-old's final season of professional football. Steelers find more speed at WR Steelers get: WR Rashid Shaheed , 2026 fifth-round pick Saints get: 2026 fourth-round pick The Steelers need another wideout across from DK Metcalf . Calvin Austin III averaged a middling 1.5 yards per route run this season before suffering a shoulder injury . Roman Wilson , the team's third-round pick in the 2024 draft, has two catches in six games across his first two pro campaigns. Ben Skowronek is an ideal fourth or fifth wideout given his work as a blocker and on special teams, but he has played 45 offensive snaps in five games. Though Metcalf had an 80-yard touchdown on a long catch-and-run against the Vikings , the Steelers could use a burner who will threaten teams downfield, especially when they line up in their multi-tight-end sets and sell the run to set up play-action. Austin ran a 4.32 40-yard dash at the combine, but he has just three catches on passes thrown 30 or more yards downfield in his first two-plus seasons as a pro. The Steelers are one of just two teams that haven't completed a single pass traveling 30 or more yards in the air this season, and Aaron Rodgers has attempted only one such throw through five games. (It was a duck to an open Metcalf, but Rodgers' arm has generally looked fine this season.) play 2:24 Is Stephen A. putting the Steelers on upset alert vs. Bengals? Stephen A. Smith previews the Steelers' matchup vs. the Bengals in Week 7. Enter Shaheed, who is a free agent after the season. Since entering the league in 2022, the undrafted Weber State product has averaged 15.6 yards per reception, fourth best in the NFL over that span. He has also been a return man in the past, something the Steelers wouldn't mind adding after taking rookie Kaleb Johnson off kick returns in September. Shaheed will make $2.8 million over the remainder of 2025, a very reasonable price for what he brings to the table as a secondary option in the passing game. The 1-5 Saints value Shaheed's impact downfield, but they've already invested a lot at wide receiver. Chris Olave is locked in as their No. 1, and they paid Brandin Cooks to play regular snaps in 2025. GM Mickey Loomis traded a fourth-round pick to the Broncos for Devaughn Vele , but the second-year pro has just four catches through five games. And though he battled a hip injury in September, Vele has played just 35% of the snaps over the past two weeks. The Saints also swapped late-round picks with the Patriots for Ja'Lynn Polk , hoping to get value on a 2024 second-round pick who looked impressive at Washington. Polk is on injured reserve with a shoulder injury , but he's expected to be part of the wide receiver rotation in 2026. The Saints have shipped out too much draft capital for a 1-5 team with no aspirations of contending. Getting some of that back in a Shaheed deal would make sense, and though they could potentially land a compensatory pick if Shaheed leaves in free agency, this is an organization that will likely be spending on the open market and canceling out compensatory picks next offseason. The Saints seem resistant to big moves of veterans like Alvin Kamara and/or Carl Granderson , but there's another one that might make sense ... Hill rejoins Payton Broncos get: TE Taysom Hill , 2028 seventh-round pick Saints get: 2028 sixth-round pick Let's reunite Hill with his biggest fan. Sean Payton's Broncos have plenty of playmakers, but they could always stand to add another threat on short yardage and in the red zone. Evan Engram has been a disappointment so far (137 yards), and though the Broncos have occasionally gotten Adam Trautman and Nate Adkins involved in the passing game, there's nobody in the league quite like Hill. Your League, Your Rules Create a league and customize league size, scoring and rules to play in the league you want to play in. Create a league today! Back on the field after tearing his left ACL a year ago, Hill has seen a handful of snaps over the past two weeks, scoring a touchdown on a pin/pull sweep against the Patriots in Week 6. He's 35 years old and in the final year of the four-year, $40 million deal he signed with the organization in November 2021. The Saints are on the hook for $13.7 million in dead money in 2026 if they trade Hill now, but they're already expecting to eat that money once Hill's contract voids after the 2025 campaign. The Saints would save $2.8 million in cash by trading Hill. And while Kellen Moore would obviously prefer to have a player with Hill's unique talents on the field, the Saints would add a little bit of extra draft capital in the process. Hill would get a chance to go play for a team with meaningful football ahead in the final days of his NFL career, and I suspect he wouldn't need too much lead time to learn their playbook. A change-of-scenery gamble Raiders get: OT Braxton Jones Bears get: Edge Tyree Wilson Let's make bets on two frustrating players. Jones entered the season with a potentially massive contract riding on his performance at left tackle for the Bears, but the Ben Johnson regime quickly soured on the player it inherited on Caleb Williams ' blindside. Jones split time in practice at left tackle during preseason. Though he was the Week 1 starter, Jones didn't last long in the lineup. He was pulled in the first half against the Raiders in Week 4 and didn't play a single offensive snap against the Commanders on Sunday night. Even mediocre young left tackles can be valuable, as Dan Moore Jr .'s free agent contract showed, but Jones' future is likely elsewhere. The Bears will go with Theo Benedet as their left tackle for now, and second-round pick Ozzy Trapilo is entrenched as Chicago's swing tackle and the next man up. Tackle depth is always nice to have, but the Bears could use help elsewhere. Jones would step in at left tackle on an emergency basis for the Raiders, who are going to be without Kolton Miller for an extended period of time after he suffered a serious ankle injury in that loss to the Bears. Stone Forsythe has been at left tackle and allowed sacks and quick pressures in each of his first two games. He's not a viable solution. The Raiders have another option in third-rounder Charles Grant , but he is more of a developmental player and hasn't played a single offensive snap so far in 2025. It's unclear if the Raiders can or will actually trust him to protect Geno Smith , who needs more help up front. Even a below-average left tackle like Jones would be a massive upgrade on what the Raiders are likely to run out over the next couple of months, and they could potentially land a compensatory pick if Jones leaves after the season. Adding what might be essentially a short-term tackle could seem odd for a team out of playoff contention in the AFC, but the Raiders just need to be able to reliably run their offense right now. Las Vegas would simultaneously move on from another of their former disappointing first-round picks in Wilson, who simply hasn't developed into a starting-caliber player since being drafted with the seventh pick in 2023. Even after Malcolm Koonce missed all of the 2024 season with an ACL tear , the Antonio Pierce regime was willing to use Wilson on only 50% of the defensive snaps a year ago. Pete Carroll has him at 42% so far this season, with Wilson racking up two sacks and three quarterback knockdowns in six games. With their pass rush managing just seven sacks through five games, the Bears need to add more help. Their expensively assembled edge rush duo of Montez Sweat and Dayo Odeyingbo has more roughing the passer penalties (two) than sacks (one) so far this season while playing starter workloads. Adding Wilson would be taking a swing on a dynamic prospect who just turned 25 in May. At the very least, Wilson might reduce the workload of the starters, helping to keep them fresh for passing downs. He's owed $4.2 million in guaranteed money next year and has a potential fifth-year option available in 2027, though it would take a dramatic turnaround for the Bears to pick up that year given Wilson's existing form. Bills add more safety help Bills get: S Jason Pinnock , 2027 seventh-round pick 49ers get: 2027 sixth-round pick The Bills badly need help at safety. Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp have struggled both in coverage and with tackling this season. The Bills aren't going to give up on Bishop, a second-round pick in last year's draft, but so many of the big plays they've struggled with this season have come in moments where Buffalo's safeties either missed tackles or weren't in position to even attempt one. Rapp was run over at the goal line by Tyler Allgeier on his 21-yard touchdown Monday night , while Bijan Robinson cut back against a Bishop tackle attempt for 22 yards and then ran through a Bishop tackle on the sideline for his 81-yard touchdown. The safeties aren't the only problem in Buffalo, but they've definitely been a concern. And with Damar Hamlin on injured reserve , there isn't really any viable alternative for the Bills. Safety has been an issue with a lot of competitive teams around the NFL this season. There just aren't many rosters with serious safety depth that could justify a trade. One of the few exceptions is a team that has injury issues just about everywhere besides safety right now. The 49ers started Pinnock in September, but that was always going to be a temporary solution. He fell out of the lineup altogether last week, with the Niners preferring Marques Sigle , Ji'Ayir Brown and the returning Malik Mustapha at safety to him. play 0:52 Jeff Saturday: Bills' loss to Falcons a bad sign Jeff Saturday explains his concerns about the Bills after their loss to the Falcons. Pinnock's not going to transform the Bills' defense, but he has been passable as a center fielder as a pro and would offer the Bills some depth. Bishop had to briefly leave the Falcons game, leading the Bills to turn to 34-year-old veteran Jordan Poyer for a handful of snaps. Poyer was once an essential part of Sean McDermott's defense, but those days have come and gone. The 49ers would add a little bit of draft capital with this deal, something they could use to address one of the eight or nine positions on their roster that have been riddled with injuries this season as part of another deal. Texans also add more safety help Texans get: S Kyle Dugger , cash considerations Patriots get: RB Dameon Pierce One of the few safeties who is very clearly available for trade is Dugger, who surprisingly was benched by the Patriots before the season. The only reason Dugger wasn't released was his $9.8 million base salary, which was already guaranteed before Week 1. The Patriots have used Dugger in a reserve role, but after playing one defensive snap in the win over the Bills , Mike Vrabel was forced to start Dugger with Jaylinn Hawkins injured on Sunday against the Saints . New Orleans promptly ran Chris Olave past the 2020 second-round pick for a 53-yard completion on the opening snap of the game, with Spencer Rattler 's throw the only reason it wasn't a 75-yard touchdown. Not ideal. Dugger's not that far removed from being a valuable player for Bill Belichick in New England, though, and while the 29-year-old's previously elite traits might have slipped after an ankle injury, there are just too many teams in need of help at safety. The Patriots would need to eat most of the $6.5 million remaining on Dugger's contract, but I'm not sure they really trust him to be on the field in games that matter unless it's absolutely necessary. Nick Caserio was part of the team that drafted Dugger in the 2020 draft, and the Texans have been a reliable home for former Patriots players in the past. The Texans have a strong secondary, but they're thin at safety after releasing C.J. Gardner-Johnson , who made $7.3 million for his three games in Houston. Jimmie Ward 's still recovering from offseason foot surgery, which has left M.J. Stewart as the starter by default. With Dugger's salary a sunk cost, the Patriots would eat about $5 million of what's left on his contract for 2025 as part of this deal, making Dugger a palatable backup behind Stewart for the Texans. In return, the Patriots would land running back depth in Pierce, who ran for 939 yards as a rookie before falling down the depth chart with DeMeco Ryans' arrival. Pierce has played just 23 offensive snaps this season and would be the replacement for Antonio Gibson , who is out for the year with a torn ACL , as the third running back in New England. Commanders shore up the CB corps Commanders get: CB Cam Taylor-Britt Bengals get: CB Noah Igbinoghene , 2026 seventh-round pick The Bengals might want to be finished with Taylor-Britt, a 2022 second-round pick who hasn't lived up to expectations in Cincinnati. He has flashed at times during his pro career, with seven interceptions between the 2023 and 2024 campaigns, but he has been benched at different points in each of the past three seasons. In Week 4 , Taylor-Britt lined up against Courtland Sutton in the second quarter and couldn't make a tackle on the veteran wideout, leading to a 22-yard gain. He didn't play a single snap in the second half. But then again, Taylor-Britt played 80% of the snaps two weeks later against the Packers , and though he allowed a 35-yard completion to Matthew Golden up the sideline, it came on a play where Taylor-Britt didn't do a bad job in coverage. In the final year of his rookie deal, Taylor-Britt is owed $2.4 million. It would be a surprise if he returned to the Bengals next season, so this would be an opportunity to move somewhere with a meaningful track record of turning around frustrating careers. He would step in as a reserve cornerback on the outside for the Commanders, who are allowing more yards per dropback without pressure than any other team in the NFL. play 1:43 Stephen A.: Cowboys need a win more than Commanders Stephen A. Smith explains why the Cowboys need a win more in Week 7 than the Commanders. Washington's secondary has been wildly disappointing all season, so it has been a surprise that the Commanders haven't been willing to turn to Igbinoghene, who did a solid job for them as their starting slot cornerback in 2024. Although the former Dolphins first-round pick played 26 snaps in Week 3 against the Raiders , Igbinoghene has been limited to 10 defensive snaps across Washington's five other games. With $780,000 left on his deal and free agency looming after the season, there's no real benefit to having the 25-year-old on the bottom of the roster if he's not going to play on defense, as Igbinoghene is only an occasional special-teamer. Dan Quinn needs to consider making changes given how the likes of Marshon Lattimore and Mike Sainristil have played so far this season. Adding another cornerback with Taylor-Britt's coverage ability (when things go right) and feel for the football would give the Commanders another option if they do decide to sit one of their starters for any period of time. And adding Igbinoghene would give the Bengals a more reliable option in the slot, which would allow them to move Dax Hill back outside, where he would be most valuable in the long run. Chargers roll the dice on the OL Chargers get: OT/G Evan Neal , 2028 seventh-round pick Giants get: 2028 sixth-round pick Let's move one more disappointing first-round pick off the Giants' roster. Neal was a massive miss for Joe Schoen with the seventh pick of the 2022 draft. After struggling to stay healthy or play well during his first two years in the league, Neal lost his right tackle job to Jermaine Eluemunor and spent the first half of 2024 on the bench. The Giants moved Neal to guard this offseason, but after an unimpressive summer, he hasn't been active for a single game in 2025. Neal's owed only $666,667 over the remainder of the season, so he wouldn't be an expensive option for a team that needs a backup offensive lineman, most likely at tackle. We're not that far removed from Neal looking like a potential franchise tackle at Alabama, and there should be teams with optimistic scouting reports on him from his college days willing to take something close to a free look at the 25-year-old. Yes, 2028 picks might feel free right now, and if there's any team desperate for another option at tackle, it's the Chargers. Rashawn Slater 's out for the year with a knee injury, Joe Alt is out indefinitely with a high ankle sprain, and swing tackle Trey Pipkins III missed the win over the Dolphins with a knee injury. Jamaree Salyer , whom the Jim Harbaugh administration seems to prefer at guard, was also sidelined for the Dolphins game. In their win, the Chargers started Austin Deculus at left tackle and Bobby Hart at right tackle. Deculus started one game in three years with the Texans, who were desperate for linemen and still didn't get him in the lineup, while Hart hadn't played an offensive snap in an NFL game since 2022 before lining up and playing every single down for the Chargers on Sunday. This wasn't the plan for the Chargers, but it's tough to feel like they have enough protecting Justin Herbert. Neal's leaving New York after the year, so this would be a brief chance at auditioning for the Chargers -- and 30 other teams -- in advance of free agency in 2026.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46599869/2025-nfl-trade-deadline-barnwell-offers-proposals-hendrickson-phillips-wilson-meyers,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560692_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,dfcd9ba6573fa45abf07c626b85cb82b4011554b
54007b4bda3f,How Penn State unraveled under James Franklin,,"Oct 16, 2025, 07:00 AM ET STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- Two nights before James Franklin's final game at Penn State , an unranked Clarkson University men's hockey team scored on the fourth-ranked Nittany Lions a minute after puck drop. Behind the net, students erupted into chants of ""Fire Franklin"" -- and resumed the chant after every goal in a 6-4 Clarkson win. On Saturday, during Penn State's stunning 22-21 loss to Northwestern , the ""Fire Franklin"" chants echoed through Beaver Stadium -- and never let up. After a third straight loss, Franklin looked defeated. As if saying goodbye, he stood on the 10-yard line and hugged every remaining player on the field before heading through the south tunnel for the last time as head coach. There, his wife and daughter waited. He sent them ahead -- perhaps so they wouldn't hear the vitriol that awaited him -- as he passed fans lined up on either side of the underpass to the locker room. ""How it all turned so bad so fast,"" one Penn State athletic department source said, ""I don't know."" The Nittany Lions began the season ranked No. 2 in the AP Top 25. They poured millions into building a loaded roster and a seasoned coaching staff that Franklin called his best yet. While the other Big Ten powers were set to debut new quarterbacks, Penn State boasted a three-year starter in Drew Allar , who opened as one of the Heisman Trophy betting favorites. Coming off a CFP semifinal appearance, Penn State seemed poised to chase its first national title in 39 years. Yet with those expectations came unprecedented pressure on the Nittany Lions, who under Franklin had repeatedly wilted in big games. As one former Penn State staff member put it, ""They were either gonna win it all -- or they were gonna implode."" Six games into Franklin's 12th season, the Nittany Lions imploded. They lost in double overtime at home to Oregon , which dropped Franklin to 4-21 at Penn State against AP top-10 opponents, including 1-18 in Big Ten games. They fell at winless UCLA -- a team that had already fired its coach and hadn't led once all season. Then, they lost to an unranked Northwestern, making Penn State the first team since the 1978 FBS-FCS split to lose consecutive games as 20-point or more favorites. ""It's 100 percent on me,"" Franklin said afterward. ""We got to get it fixed -- and I will get it fixed."" By then, Penn State was too broken. On Sunday, Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft fired Franklin . It was a difficult, emotional parting, as Kraft had a strong relationship with Franklin and respect for how he had built the program. Sources inside the program indicated culture wasn't the problem -- as evidenced by the decision of 10 star players to turn down the NFL draft and return for another season. ""This is not a three-game thing,"" Kraft said Monday. ""This is really diving into where we are as a program -- what is the trajectory of this program?"" That drove Kraft to make the call despite Franklin's $49 million buyout -- the second largest in college football history behind Jimbo Fisher's $76 million Texas A&M payout. Franklin, who didn't immediately respond to texts or calls from ESPN, won 149 games and reached double-digit wins six times in 11 seasons at Penn State, including the previous three. Yet no matter what he or the program tried, the Nittany Lions couldn't win in the games that mattered most. And after Penn State failed to beat Oregon, the bottom finally fell out -- the school's fan base and power brokers gave up on its coach ever getting the Nittany Lions over the top. ""I'm here to win a national championship,"" Kraft said. ""And I believe our fans deserve that."" Interviews with program insiders detail how a season that began with such promise in Happy Valley spiraled out of control -- and what comes next for Penn State. Penn State fired James Franklin six games into his 12th season at the school. Imagn Images THE NITTANY LIONS reeled off seven wins to begin last season, setting up a November top-five clash in State College against Ohio State . Penn State jumped to an early 10-0 lead, but the Nittany Lions failed to score another touchdown. Twice, the Ohio State defense stoned Penn State inside the 5-yard line on the way to a 20-13 victory. The Buckeyes went on to win the national championship. Penn State's brass had seen how Ohio State's massive financial investment the previous offseason paid off in big moments, from the victory in State College to a dominant run through the playoff. The Buckeyes sank $20 million into their roster. They kept key players from bolting early for the NFL and landed several star players in the transfer portal. They even hired away UCLA coach Chip Kelly to be offensive coordinator. This offseason, the Nittany Lions emulated that blueprint. They found the money to keep Allar and standout running backs Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen on campus. They also hired away Ohio State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles, who had transformed the Buckeyes defense into the best in college football. After a one-point loss to Ohio State in 2018, Franklin noted that Penn State had gone from a ""good football team to a great football team."" But the Nittany Lions still weren't on an elite level -- like Ohio State. ""Right now, we're comfortable being great,"" he said then. ""I'm going to make sure that everybody in our program, including myself, is very uncomfortable. ... We are going to break through."" This year, that breakthrough seemed possible. As one Penn State source said, Kraft and the administration ensured that Franklin had ""everything he needed to win a national championship and get rid of that stigma. ... You want to keep those running backs? Let's do it. We need a wide receiver? Let's f---ing do it. Jim Knowles is out there? How much is it gonna cost? What do you need? Let's go do it."" Penn State sources noted that the program's funding began matching that of Ohio State, Alabama and Georgia . Underscoring that, the Nittany Lions are in the middle of a $700 million renovation to Beaver Stadium, which is set to be completed by the 2027 season. ""There was a lot of momentum trending our way,"" one university source said. ""But the echo chamber of how good we were started to echo against itself. Like, we're not just going to make the playoff, we're going to win the national championship. It just got bigger and bigger, where the expectations were just massive."" Instead of overwhelming the opposition, though, the Nittany Lions played tense. They struggled under the weight of those expectations, even during the first three wins over Nevada , Florida International and Villanova . All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The vaunted running game sputtered, and the defense wasn't suffocating the opposition as the players adjusted to Knowles' system. Even then, alarm bells were going off inside the Lasch Football Building. ""The culture had gotten really tight,"" one athletic department source said. ""People around here were like, 'We're going to get f---ing crushed by Oregon.'"" One NFL personnel executive who had scouted those first three games wondered the same. ""They stunk,"" he said. ""It was like, what's happening with them?"" Still, coming off a bye, the Nittany Lions had a prime opportunity to prove they were over their big-game flops of the past with the Ducks traveling in for a Sept. 27 prime-time showdown in front of a White Out Beaver Stadium crowd. ""This is going to be a statement game for our season,"" Allen told ESPN the week before. Instead, it was more of the same. They didn't get crushed, but struggled for long stretches. The offense under second-year coordinator Andy Kotelnicki never established the running game. Allar couldn't find a rhythm. And while Oregon coach Dan Lanning aggressively went for it on fourth down five times alone in the first half, Franklin managed the game conservatively. Facing fourth-and-9 from the Oregon 36-yard line, Franklin sent in the punt team. The ball landed in the end zone, resulting in a touchback. The Ducks capitalized, scoring their first touchdown, then another on their ensuing drive to take a 17-3 lead in the fourth quarter. That's when the first ""Fire Franklin"" chants began to reverberate around Beaver Stadium. ""When you're more talented than the other team, that doesn't hurt you,"" said an NFL personnel executive, who's scouted the Nittany Lions this season. ""But in these close games where the talent [gap] gets a little bit smaller, it comes down to a few of those decisions that you make in terms of what position you put your team in ... you could see Lanning stacking decisions and setting up different things they wanted to do throughout the game. The strategy was clear. ... For all of James' strengths, recruiting and leadership, his major weakness -- in-game decision-making -- showed up in every close game."" Allar finally came alive in the fourth quarter and led the Nittany Lions on back-to-back touchdown drives to send the game to overtime. But then on Penn State's first snap of the second overtime, he threw an interception, handing the Nittany Lions yet another loss in a top-10 matchup. As fans emptied out of Beaver Stadium, many could be heard chanting ""F--- Drew Allar."" In the 12-team playoff era, Penn State's season technically wasn't over with one loss. Under Franklin, the Nittany Lions had usually responded well after crushing big-game defeats. After the setback to Ohio State last year, Penn State responded by hammering Washington and Purdue by a combined score of 84-16. After losing to Michigan late in the 2023 season, the Nittany Lions finished off the regular season by dispatching Rutgers 27-6 and Michigan State 42-0. But with so much riding on this season, the Oregon defeat was an emotional blow that sent the Nittany Lions to the mat. They never got back up. ""It's so hard mentally when you expect something big to happen,"" a Power 4 assistant of Penn State said. ""When that gets devastated so early, some dudes just don't handle it very well."" play 2:01 Stephen A.: Penn State was justified to fire James Franklin Stephen A. Smith explains why Penn State made the right decision by firing James Franklin. THE NITTANY LIONS traveled to Pasadena, California, hoping to get their season back on track against winless UCLA. The Bruins had recently fired coach DeShaun Foster and both coordinators after getting thumped by New Mexico 35-10. But one source close to Penn State described the Nittany Lions as ""emotionless"" after Oregon. ""The team needed inspiration and confidence,"" the source said. ""But it was all hesitation."" The Bruins were 24-point underdogs. They had scored just 57 points in their previous four games combined. But UCLA scored on its first five possessions to take a 27-7 lead into halftime. ""Wide receivers weren't finishing routes, guys weren't finishing blocks, the defensive line not being where they're supposed to be -- things that were always done at Penn State weren't happening,"" a program source said. The Nittany Lions tried to fight back in the second half, but a curious fourth-and-2 call from the UCLA 9-yard line ended the rally. Kotelnicki dialed up an end-around zone-read, and the Bruins buried Allar behind the line of scrimmage. That play call proved emblematic of Penn State's offensive struggles under Kotelnicki, who had thrived with gimmicks at Kansas , but failed to fully embrace Penn State's hard-nosed tradition or get the best out of Allar's skill set. ""He tries to do a lot of stuff with movement and motions, but it just didn't play well,"" a coach who faced Penn State said. ""With the running backs they have and the skill guys they brought in at receiver, you'd have thought they would have been able to get more production out of that group. ... [In turn], Drew regressed."" Afterward in the Rose Bowl tunnels, UCLA's defensive linemen taunted Allar, saying ""first round [quarterback], what?"" Franklin, partially blaming the cross-country travel for the way his team played, was asked if he still believed this was the best combination of coaching and talent he'd had at Penn State. ""How am I supposed to answer that,"" he replied, shaking his head. ""Obviously I felt that way or I wouldn't have said it. But after two losses, it's hard for me to answer that question and say that that's the case."" Allar was asked if the Nittany Lions still had a chance of making the playoff. ""What do you think?"" he fired back. ""Yes."" One Penn State source called the lackluster performance ""mind-blowing."" Another said the Lasch facility ""felt like a morgue"" leading into Northwestern. Over the summer at Big Ten media days, Allar said it was time for Penn State ""to get over that hump"" in big games. Suddenly, the Nittany Lions couldn't win the smaller ones, either. The pressure had gotten to them. ""It wasn't fair to the kids,"" a source close to the program said. ""It's just not, because you're not at your best when you're worried about making a mistake, and you've got to be perfect. Then you lose the love of what you do, and you lose your confidence and you're just a shell of yourself."" That applied to Allar, whose production dipped. Allar had strongly considered leaving for the NFL after last season. Multiple scouts said they believe Allar would've been a first-round pick last year and noted several teams had him in the second tier, behind No. 1 pick Cam Ward , with Jaxson Dart , who went 25th overall to the New York Giants . ""People were very excited about him,"" one NFL personnel executive said of Allar. But after throwing a costly interception in the CFP semifinal, setting up Notre Dame 's game-winning field goal, Allar opted to come back. This season, fair or not, Allar came to symbolize Penn State's tentative, uncertain approach. At 6-foot-5, 235 pounds, boasting a powerful arm, Allar often played -- or had been instructed to play -- like a quarterback with far fewer natural gifts, said one source close to the program. ""You could just tell he had a self-monologue of, 'Don't screw it up, don't throw a pick,' just not playing very confidently,"" a coach who faced Penn State said. ""They just feel like a team that doesn't know who they are."" When Allar arrived at Penn State, he showed promise of becoming the player who had eluded the Nittany Lions. From Sean Clifford to Christian Hackenberg, Penn State had signed prototypical quarterback prospects before. But none under Franklin had developed into a passer capable of leading the Nittany Lions to a national championship or turning into a first-round pick. As a sophomore in 2023, Allar threw 25 touchdowns with just two interceptions. The following offseason, Franklin hired Kotelnicki to unlock Penn State's downfield passing attack. Last season, Allar ranked 16th nationally with a QBR of 77.5. He also averaged 8.44 yards per attempt. But this year, Allar's play declined. He ranks just 91st with 6.9 yards per passing attempt, only a notch above the 6.8 he averaged two years ago. Allar also has an off-target passing rate of 13.3% this season, 12th worst among Power 4 quarterbacks. ""His accuracy was off all year,"" a defensive coordinator who faced Penn State said. NFL sources added that they felt the Nittany Lions operated like they didn't fully trust him. ""And they have more information than we do,"" one NFL personnel executive said. ""When they needed him to put it on his back, you just never saw that. ... But the other side of the argument is, his career so eerily mirrored Hackenberg, you do wonder if there's a quarterback development issue."" As if it couldn't get any worse for Allar, late in the fourth quarter against Northwestern, while trying to run for a first down, he suffered a season-ending left leg injury. Having played more than four games in each of the past four seasons, Allar has exhausted his eligibility. On Monday, tears welled in Kraft's eyes as he spoke of Allar. ""Anyone who ever doubts that young man's commitment to Penn State and Penn State football, you don't know what the hell you're talking about,"" Kraft said. ""He's one hell of a young man and he puts up with a lot of crap. ... He wants to win in the worst way. To see it end that way, you never want that."" DESPITE PENN STATE'S nightmare season, Kraft projected optimism about the program's future. ""We have invested at the highest level,"" he said. ""Ultimately, I believe a new leader can help us win a national championship."" Sources close to the program expect Kraft to swing for the fences in hiring a new coach. Possible candidates could include Indiana 's Curt Cignetti, Iowa State 's Matt Campbell, Texas A&M's Mike Elko and Georgia Tech 's Brent Key. But all eyes will be on Nebraska coach Matt Rhule, who worked under Kraft at Temple . The two remain close. Rhule won 10 games in 2015 and 2016 at Temple before taking the head job at Baylor . In 2024, he led Nebraska to its first winning season in seven years; this fall, the Huskers are 5-1. Yet, those who have worked with Rhule in the past call Penn State ""his dream job."" This week, Rhule, a walk-on linebacker for the Nittany Lions under Joe Paterno in the 1990s, didn't rule out a return to his alma mater. ""I love that place,"" Rhule said. ""I love Pat. I love James Franklin and am sad that came to an end. I wish him the absolute best. But I'm really happy here."" Said a former Penn State staffer of Rhule: ""They're probably a perfect marriage. If you're Pat, you hope Matt finishes really strong, and you can parade him in front of your donors. ... [They have] to hire somebody who infuses confidence into the fan base."" While Rhule enjoyed success at Temple and Baylor, taking the Bears to the Big 12 championship game in 2019, he too has struggled to win big games. Over his stints at Temple, Baylor and Nebraska, Rhule is 0-11 against AP top-10 opponents and 2-23 against the Top 25. He had 18 upset wins and 13 upset losses during that time. Only 53 years old, Franklin's coaching career is likely far from finished. On Sunday, he addressed the players in what sources characterized as an emotional meeting. ""The players really did love him,"" one source said. Penn State center and captain Nick Dawkins praised Franklin's ""contagious energy, fighter's spirit, toughness and grit"" on Tuesday. ""All the flak and criticism and boos and chants in the face of adversity, he remained a strong shoulder, remained stone cold for his players, for the university,"" he said. ""Standing tall for those that are standing with you.""

4463d9814894,"Five Heisman contenders, key conference matchups and more",,"Oct 16, 2025, 08:00 AM ET The third Saturday in October delivers a lot of good things in college football, and not just Tennessee - Alabama , as the Vols try to break their Tuscaloosa curse and win there for the first time since 2003. The SEC figures to dominate the spotlight, as it often does, as Ole Miss and Georgia tangle between the hedges. Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin took a shot at Kirby Smart's waistline this week, giving the Georgia coach and his team even more fuel to avenge last season's loss in Oxford. Diego Pavia and Vanderbilt have had two weeks to stew over the Alabama loss, and now welcome offense-challenged LSU to Nashville. There is also non-SEC action to monitor, including the USC - Notre Dame rivalry, which hopefully will extend long beyond Saturday, and the Holy War, featuring No. 15 BYU and No. 23 Utah . There are also sneaky-good matchups such as undefeated Georgia Tech visiting a surging Duke team. Here's a look at what's on tap in Week 8. -- Adam Rittenberg Jump to: Heisman contenders | Big 12 title race Baylor-TCU rivalry | Key matchups Quotes of the Week Midseason Heisman Trophy contenders After a tough Week 1 loss to Florida State, how has Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson been able to bounce back and rank atop the Heisman contenders list? Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire 1. Ty Simpson , QB, Alabama: You know it's a wild Heisman race when a quarterback who lost his first career start to a now-floundering Florida State team sits atop the list. But Simpson and the Tide have bounced back nicely from their struggles in Tallahassee. Simpson is completing 70.9% of his passes for 1,678 yards with 16 touchdowns and only one interception. He's one of only four FBS quarterbacks to record multiple passing touchdowns in every game he has played, and has 200 or more passing yards in all six. Simpson completed all 17 of his attempts against UL Monroe and had only five incompletions the following week against Wisconsin . He showed toughness in a road win against Georgia, and then outplayed fellow Heisman candidate Diego Pavia the following week. Simpson has endured one of the tougher first-half schedules, especially for a first-time starter, and has spread the ball around nicely to his targets while showing strong leadership skills. 2. Carson Beck , QB, Miami : The biggest name in last year's quarterback transfer cycle entered the fall with a good degree of uncertainty, joining a new team with a new offense, and coming off of UCL surgery in December . But Beck has looked a lot more like the quarterback who propelled Georgia's offense in 2023, and projected as a top 2025 NFL draft pick. He has completed 73.4% of his passes for 1,213 yards and 11 touchdowns, and helped Miami to a 5-0 start despite facing three FBS opponents from within the state -- Florida State, Florida and South Florida -- as well as Notre Dame. Beck had four touchdown passes in a win at Florida State and has spread the ball around well in coordinator Shannon Dawson's offense to Malachi Toney , CJ Daniels and others. He has completed at least two-thirds of his passing attempts in all but one game and ranks sixth nationally in QBR. 3. Fernando Mendoza , QB, Indiana : Another notable name in the quarterback transfer portal, Mendoza has been a fantastic addition to an Indiana team seeking a second consecutive College Football Playoff appearance, and a deeper postseason run. The Cal transfer has completed 71.2% of his passes for 1,423 yards with 17 touchdowns and two interceptions. After an uneven opening performance against Old Dominion , Mendoza put together one of the best three-game stretches by an Indiana quarterback. He recorded 782 passing yards, 14 touchdowns and no interceptions, while completing 58 of 68 passes in wins against Kennesaw State , Indiana State and then-No. 9 Illinois , which Indiana routed 63-10. Mendoza then helped Indiana grind out a road win against Iowa , before completing 20 of 31 attempts in a 30-20 win last week at No. 3 Oregon . The 6-foot-5, 225-pound Mendoza is a bona fide NFL draft prospect and a main reason why Indiana could be an even better team than its 2024 version. 4. Jayden Maiava , QB, USC: He plays for the right coach (Lincoln Riley), in the right offense and at the right school, as USC has eight Heisman winners, more than any other program. Maiava became the starter late last season and didn't enter this fall with as much hype as other quarterbacks, but he has delivered consistently for the Trojans. The junior leads the nation in QBR (93.1) and has completed 71.9% of his passes for 1,852 yards with 13 touchdowns and two interceptions. He has connected on at least two-thirds of his attempts in five of six games, and showed remarkable accuracy in last week's win over Michigan , hitting on 25 of 32 attempts. Maiava has multiple touchdown passes in five of six games, leads the nation in yards per pass attempt (10.8) and leads the Big Ten in passing yards (1,852), passing average (308.7) and passing yards per completion (15.1). He has a big showcase opportunity ahead this week at No. 13 Notre Dame. 5. Jeremiah Smith , WR, Ohio State : The Heisman doesn't always go to the best player in the sport, for a multitude of reasons, especially when that player isn't a quarterback. Smith entered the season with the designation of being No. 1, and his established star power should help his contender status with a big second half. The true sophomore still has 40 receptions through Ohio State's first six games, and has a receiving touchdown in the past five, ranking second nationally with seven scoring catches. He has five or more receptions in every game and two 100-yard receiving performances. Smith ranks in the top 10 nationally in total receptions, receptions per game and touchdowns scored. He also isn't disappearing from the radar as the face of the nation's No. 1 team and the defending national champion. Smith needed only 19 games to reach 1,500 career receiving yards, and is the fastest Ohio State player to record 22 touchdown catches. -- Rittenberg Big 12 title implications No. 7 Texas Tech , No. 15 BYU and No. 24 Cincinnati all enter the week 3-0 in conference play, but it's clear that Texas Tech has emerged as a heavy favorite to win the Big 12. The Red Raiders have what previously seemed like a difficult test this week at Arizona State , but after the Sun Devils fell 42-10 against Utah last week, some of the luster is gone. If quarterback Sam Leavitt is sidelined again, Texas Tech should be in good shape. The most intriguing matchup of the week is, of course, the Holy War between BYU and Utah. Utah has been rolling since it fell apart late against Texas Tech a few weeks ago and will head to Provo needing a win to remain a serious contender to reach the conference title game. BYU, meanwhile, is 6-0, but those wins haven't exactly come with style points. The Cougars had a miraculous escape at Arizona last week to conclude the first half of their schedule, which was significantly easier than what they'll see the rest of the way (Utah, Iowa State , Texas Tech, TCU, Cincinnati, UCF ). Cincinnati has run off five straight wins since dropping its opener to Nebraska and gets reeling Oklahoma State this week. The Bearcats don't have Texas Tech on the schedule but will see both Utah and BYU later in the year. -- Kyle Bonagura Going deep into the Baylor-TCU rivalry Baylor quarterback Sawyer Robertson will face close family friend and TCU coach Sonny Dykes on Saturday. David Buono/Icon Sportswire Baylor quarterback Sawyer Robertson might have a little extra on the line in the recently renamed Bluebonnet Battle against TCU . It's a key Big 12 game for both teams. The teams are both 4-2, though Baylor is 2-1 in the conference and TCU is 1-2. They also have a deep history and have played 120 times. There's plenty at stake. But then there's the matter of some paternal pride. Robertson is from Lubbock, Texas, where TCU coach Sonny Dykes and Sawyer's dad, Stan, were both standout baseball players in the same corner of West Texas at the same time. Stan Robertson was drafted by the Montreal Expos out of high school and set off for the minor leagues, while Dykes went to Texas Tech on a baseball scholarship. After two years in the minors, Stan decided to return home, where he also went to Texas Tech -- on a football scholarship to play for Sonny's dad, Spike. The Robertson and Dykes families have been close for decades. Sawyer grew up a Red Raiders fan, and even attended the same high school Sonny did. So when Sonny recruited Sawyer -- he offered him first a scholarship as a sophomore when Dykes was at SMU -- there was an easy rapport. Maybe too easy. During the process, a little family secret might have been unearthed. ""When I was getting recruited, Sonny would always tell me that he hit a home run off my dad, and my dad hated it so much,"" Sawyer said, laughing. ""But that's Sonny."" ""I did hear that,"" Stan said, about Sonny's claim. ""I don't really remember that."" Dykes just smiled and said he wasn't sure where that story came from, which made Sawyer laugh when told of Dykes' memory. ""Well my dad wasn't the one who brought it up, I can promise you that,"" Sawyer responded. Our independent investigation didn't turn up any box scores between the Coronado Thunderbirds and the Plainview Bulldogs to verify or dispute the claim. The truth might forever be lost to history. Sawyer ended up picking Mississippi State to play for another Red Raiders legend, Mike Leach. Then when Leach died in 2022, Robertson entered the transfer portal and Dykes again recruited him, this time to TCU. But Robertson said both times, Dykes' quarterback situations were good and he was honest with him, and said the calls to let him know he was going somewhere else were the hardest. At TCU, he admired quarterback Josh Hoover and thought the Frogs had their guy. On Saturday (noon ET, ESPN2), he'll face off against Hoover and Dykes as he and Hoover rank No. 1 and 2 in the nation in passing yards. Dykes said he has been incredibly impressed with Robertson's development and the way he's playing now, leading the country in all the major passing categories. And on Tuesday, during his news conference to discuss Baylor, he conceded that Stan was ""a lot better [baseball] player than I was"" and said Sawyer was a ""first-class kid in every sense of the world"" and he roots for him every Saturday -- except this one. The Robertson and Dykes families will stay friends no matter what happens Saturday. But Robertson has one chance to make it all right for Stan. ""It's all right, Pops,"" he told him, ""I'll avenge you."" -- Dave Wilson Biggest things that need to happen in each matchup LSU-Vanderbilt: Can Vanderbilt's high-flying offense be effective against a high-level SEC opponent? Will LSU's offense ever take off in 2025? These are the central questions to an intriguing October matchup in Nashville on Saturday. The Diego Pavia-led Commodores are scoring more than all but six offenses across the country (43.3 PPG) and enter Week 8 ranked second nationally in third-down conversion percentage (57.9%). But Alabama provided the blueprint for slowing down Vanderbilt in its 30-14 win over the Commodores on Oct. 4; if LSU's 21st-ranked run defense can make Pavia one-dimensional and keep Vanderbilt out of short-yardage and third-down situations, the Tigers could find themselves in the kind of low-scoring game that has generally suited them this fall. Meanwhile, LSU's struggling offense -- which ranks 78th in yards per game and 86th in scoring -- remains an issue with a banged-up Garrett Nussmeier under center. Facing a Vanderbilt defense giving up only 90.7 rushing yards, this probably isn't the week for the Tigers to sort out their bottom-of-the-SEC rushing attack. That leaves the onus again on Nussmeier and top pass catchers Aaron Anderson and Barion Brown to spark things for LSU, especially if the home-favorite Commodores manage to make this a high-scoring game. -- Eli Lederman Ole Miss-Georgia: Can Georgia's defense get off the field on third down to get the ball back to its offense? Can Ole Miss' offense keep moving the chains the way it has for much of the season? The Rebels are converting more than 50% of their third downs, and the Bulldogs have allowed opponents to convert about 40%. Mobile quarterbacks have given the Bulldogs fits over the past few seasons, and the Rebels have two of them in Trinidad Chambliss and Austin Simmons , who has been slowed by a sprained ankle. Georgia had three turnovers and couldn't run the ball in last season's 28-10 loss to Ole Miss. The Bulldogs couldn't protect quarterback Carson Beck in that game, and they'll have to do a better job with what has been a banged-up offensive line. If Georgia is going to win, it can't afford another slow start, which put it in big holes against Tennessee, Alabama and Auburn . The Bulldogs have made great adjustments at halftime, but getting off to a fast start might be imperative in this one. -- Mark Schlabach USC-Notre Dame: Which defense will bend and which will break? Coming into this game, both USC and Notre Dame sport two of the best offenses in the country -- per SP+, the Trojans are ranked first and the Irish are ranked fourth and both are led by two of the most impressive quarterbacks in Jayden Maiava and CJ Carr . Their respective defenses (ranked 45th and 23rd) are less accomplished so far this season, giving Saturday's top-20 matchup the potential for a shootout. USC's defense has been more inconsistent and shaky than its counterpart, but it's coming off a game in which the Trojans were able to dominate Michigan in the trenches. The Trojans will need to do the same against a more talented Notre Dame front on the road. The running game, in particular, will be crucial. USC has two injuries to its top two backs ( Eli Sanders and Waymond Jordan ) and will turn to walk-on King Miller -- who broke out for 158 rushing yards and three total touchdowns against Michigan -- while the Irish have the luxury of handing off the ball to Jeremiyah Love . Love has nine total touchdowns over the past four games; even with an improved defensive unit, USC might not be able to stop him. -- Paolo Uggetti Quotes of the week Will coach Lane Kiffin and Ole Miss remain undefeated in conference play following its matchup against Georgia on Saturday? Jason Homan/Icon Sportswire ""I don't know, that's a good question. I walked by the TV and saw his press conference today, so I don't think he's burned too many calories. But he does have a lot of energy in games and he coaches really passionate. I've given him heat before about the weight loss part. He says he's too stressed to work out."" -- Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin, when asked if he or Georgia coach Kirby Smart burns more calories during a game. ""You know, I'm just going to focus on us this week. Our guys, our coaches. So I'm not going to give much thought on the opponent this week. So, really, you have to ask them what they think of Bear."" -- Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, when asked what he has seen from BYU quarterback Bear Bachmeier ahead of its Holy War rivalry game. ""Halt! No. We haven't tried it. Let's be real now. We have not tried it. I'm not going to get into what we do have. We have not tried it. All due respect to everybody who put forth their effort. We have not tried it. Not at a Division I level. Forget Big Ten level, we have not done it at the Division I level. Let's be clear on that."" -- Rutgers coach Greg Schiano, on the school's efforts to be competitive in NIL. ""Look, there's three things you go through when you're a coach. You're in the honeymoon phase, you're in the 'please don't leave' phase and you're in the 'please leave now' phase."" -- Duke coach Manny Diaz, reacting to the firing of his former boss, James Franklin, at Penn State . ""I don't know if I'm going to walk outside and my car is going to start or not, I think it is. I have an expectation it will. But if my car doesn't start enough, then I will evaluate that and make decisions about my car. But that's not my expectation at this point about our football program."" -- Auburn athletic director John Cohen, when asked whether he expects Hugh Freeze to be the Tigers' head coach in 2026.",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/gamedaykickoff101625/2025-college-football-gameday-kickoff-week-8-heisman-contenders,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560761_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,4f0fa05f4546f17717d211d0bb59f8c24dde3b46
5bf88ed28ec7,Why this season is extra special for Steelers' Jonnu Smith,,"FORTY-FIVE MILES south of Pittsburgh, a man will click on the TV in his room just after 8 p.m. Thursday to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Cincinnati Bengals in a prime-time divisional matchup. It's a scene not unlike thousands unfolding across Western Pennsylvania, though there are differences. He won't be wearing a black and gold jersey or twirling a Terrible Towel. Those aren't allowed here. That's because this man is watching from his cell at State Correctional Institute-Fayette, a maximum security prison that currently houses 1,991 incarcerated men from across the commonwealth. Unlike many of the men at SCI-Fayette, who watch the night games in their cells or gather for Sunday afternoon kickoffs in the day rooms, this man is not a lifelong Steelers fan, but he does have a lifelong bond with one of the players suiting up for Pittsburgh this season. Wayne Smith, the older brother of Steelers tight end Jonnu Smith , will be intently watching Thursday's game, relishing the opportunity to watch his little brother live out his dreams on the biggest stage. For most of his 10-year stint at the prison, following his conviction in 2015 of third-degree murder and other charges, Wayne has watched Jonnu in only a handful of games, most of them prime-time national broadcasts. But this year, coincidentally his last year of incarceration, Wayne has been able to watch every single one of Jonnu's games, including the Thursday night game for the first time since the games moved to Amazon in 2022. That's because the prison is in the Steelers' local broadcast market, which means that not only does Wayne get access to Sunday games, but he can also watch the simulcast of the Thursday night game on local television. It's a moment Wayne, 35, started imagining since learning that Jonnu, five years his junior, was being traded to the Steelers from the Miami Dolphins over the summer. ""It was God moving the chessboard,"" said Karen Smith, Wayne and Jonnu's mom, who spoke with ESPN this week. ""I was stunned. And all of us just talked about it, the entire family, we could not believe it, because they'll be in the same state now. How ironic is that? And they'll be able to see each other more. He'll be able to watch his brother play. And even Wayne said that, 'I get to see him play the entire game, not just the highlights.'"" A week ago, another moment the two brothers envisioned came to fruition, too, when Jonnu brought a group of six Steelers teammates to the prison not only to visit with Wayne, but also to meet with more than 100 inmates, listen to their stories and introduce them to resources that could help with their reentry to society after release. For the brothers, the visit wasn't just about their family, it was also the continuation of a commitment to service and second chances that Jonnu has embodied and prioritized throughout his life, and it set a foundation for unprecedented outreach by the Steelers organization to the often underserved and stigmatized prison communities. ""His heart wants to help people,"" Karen said of Jonnu. ""Naturally, he has that in him. Some of our ways are just innate. We're just born with it. Jonnu has a heart to help others. He will do outreaches for everyone. When he did this, I knew he and Wayne talked about it. And I know that it was something that they wanted to do, but it was not just for Wayne. Jonnu is interested in people evolving for the better."" THE PAST NINE months of Jonnu's life were punctuated by two phone calls. The first came in January as Jonnu played in his first Pro Bowl Games. He was in Orlando, Florida, when he got the call that Wayne's sentence was eligible to be reduced. ""It just obviously made the weekend far better than I ever imagined,"" Jonnu said. Convicted in 2015 of third-degree murder and charges of aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime and carrying a firearm on public streets stemming from his role in a 2010 street fight that resulted in fatal gunshot wounds to David Dial, Wayne was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in 2015 after the first trial ended in a hung jury and the second in a conviction. Though Jonnu was playing college football at FIU during the second trial and embarking on his NFL career as a 2017 third-round pick as Wayne began his sentence, Jonnu worked tirelessly to give his brother a second chance. He found and paid for attorneys better equipped than public defenders to file appeals and covered his brother's expenses in prison. Then, thanks to the Conviction Integrity Unit introduced by Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner, Wayne was granted the right to a new trial because of previously undisclosed evidence. Instead of relitigating the case, Wayne accepted a new sentence of 16 to 32 years. Because he already served 15 years -- 10 at SCI Fayette and five in county prison during his trials -- he is now set to be released in July 2026. That first call was the culmination of years of work by Jonnu to get Wayne a second chance, whether through a reduced sentence or a new trial. Once shielded by his older brother from the rough realities of growing up in North Philadelphia, Jonnu reversed their roles and fought for his brother throughout Wayne's incarceration. ""[Jonnu] spearheaded leading these attorneys to doing this, and this is how my son gets to come home next July,"" Karen said. ""And this is how that happened. His brother did become [Wayne's] guardian. [Jonnu] became the one helping him and guiding him."" Karen Smith said she couldn't be happier that her two boys, Jonnu and Wayne, are able to see each other more often now that they're located in the same state. Courtesy of Jonnu Smith When the boys were growing up, Wayne embraced guiding Jonnu as Karen worked multiple jobs to provide for her two sons and four daughters after a tow truck accident killed her husband, Wayne Sr., when Jonnu was 4. Karen knew the bond between her boys was special from the moment 5-year-old Wayne Jr. held his newborn baby brother. ""You know how kids look at their little siblings, and they just love them? I saw that from day one,"" Karen said. ""All they did was play all the time. Wayne was like Jonnu's protector."" When Wayne ""started to learn what the streets had to offer,"" Karen said, that's when the two brothers became a little distant. Even so, Wayne still looked out for Jonnu. ""[Wayne] always sent his brother home,"" Karen said. ""He always made sure [Jonnu] didn't do what he did. They were going on two different paths, but [Wayne] was still trying. [Wayne]'s doing wrong things, but he was still making sure his brother did not."" Their paths forked when Wayne was arrested in June 2010 following the fatal street fight. Two days later, Jonnu was on a plane to Ocala, Florida, to live with his aunt. He stayed with her through high school, attending West Port High School before earning a scholarship to FIU. ""I have to send Jonnu away because these streets will swallow him up,"" Karen remembered telling her sister in a panicked phone call. ""They will chew you up and spit you out."" ""I sent him to my sister's, and his path went in a good direction."" THOUGH THE BROTHERS' paths diverged as Wayne served his sentence and Jonnu pursued a football career, the two talked nearly every day in Wayne's 15-minute allotments. Separated by thousands of miles and living worlds apart, Jonnu leaned on Wayne for advice as he got married, had two kids and played for four NFL franchises. At the same time, Wayne worked to better himself so he would be ready for the next phase of his life, whenever it arrived. ""Everything happens for a reason,"" Jonnu said. ""We say this, and we really believe this, but [Wayne's downfall] made him a better man, and changed his life in a way where it changed my life. And if things didn't happen the way they did for his life, I probably wouldn't be where I'm today."" Eventually, their paths converged again when Jonnu got his second life-changing phone call of 2025. Jonnu learned in late June that he was going to be traded from the Dolphins to the Steelers, reuniting him with Pittsburgh's Arthur Smith, his position coach and offensive coordinator from the team that drafted him, the Tennessee Titans , and also with the Atlanta Falcons . More importantly, the trade placed him an hour's drive from Wayne during his brother's final year of incarceration. ""When Omar [Khan] and Mike [Tomlin] brought it up to me, the potential of [the trade], I told them a lot about him and about our history, and I did bring it up,"" Smith said. ""I told them about his brother. Jonnu and I had talked about it, and it's kind of a unique full circle in life, the timing that he's up there. I know that means a lot to probably his brother. I've never met his brother, but I feel like I know him through Jonnu."" Steelers tight end Jonnu Smith earned his first Pro Bowl selection after last season, when he had 88 receptions for 884 receiving yards and eight touchdowns with the Miami Dolphins. Mark Alberti/Icon Sportswire When Wayne called for their daily chat on June 30 -- the day of the trade -- Jonnu gave him the news. ""He just couldn't believe it,"" Jonnu said. ""He was like, 'Wow, are you kidding me?' As men of faith, we definitely believe that this was a God-ordained moment."" No longer would Jonnu have to wait until the offseason to fly to Philadelphia and then drive hours across the state with his family to visit Wayne. Now, he could visit more frequently, though the Steelers' off day is Tuesday and SCI-Fayette doesn't allow visitors on Tuesdays. The proximity to Wayne gave Jonnu another idea: What if he and some of his Steelers teammates and members of the organization visited the prison and held an outreach event with the inmates? In August, he approached Blayre Holmes Davis, the Steelers senior director of community relations, and administrators at SCI-Fayette to inquire about the possibility. ""In 26 years of service in the Department of Corrections, I've never had a player himself reach out,"" said SCI-Fayette Superintendent Tina Walker. ""... When high-profile athletes like the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jonnu Smith request to come to the prison and speak with inmates, it shows a commitment from them for community engagement and rehabilitation. ""It sends a message to our inmate population about second chances and personal growth and accountability and choices that you make maybe don't always define your future."" The visit came together on Oct. 7, when Steelers players Pat Freiermuth , Connor Heyward , Corliss Waitman , Matt Sokol and Calvin Anderson met Jonnu at the prison on their day off following their Week 5 bye. ""Jonnu invited some of us, and I couldn't not go to that,"" Heyward said. ""I saw how much it meant to him, and he told us it meant a lot when we got there, and even prior, before going, he was just like, this is very close to his heart. So anytime somebody has something like that, especially with his brother in that situation, it was just special though being there and being able to take that all in."" Jonnu Smith speaks to a group of 100 inmates as part of the Steelers' outreach with the prison, as well as his own personal visit with his older brother, Wayne Smith. Courtesy Pennsylvania Department of Corrections The six Steelers players first met with a small group of 12 inmates, including Wayne, for half an hour. Each incarcerated individual shared his story and what he'd done to rehabilitate himself for entry back into society. Then, the players went into the prison's gymnasium for a larger program attended by 100 inmates. Community Kitchen, a Pittsburgh nonprofit that assists in food services training programs and opportunities for people with employment barriers, gave a presentation on its services, and the players answered questions posed by inmates about topics like how they overcome adversity, how they stay focused and what other ways they're giving back in the community. ""Our mission was to come to inspire, but ultimately we were the ones that were inspired,"" Jonnu said. ""... Outside of me being traded, there hadn't been a Pittsburgh Steeler to step foot in that prison. And those guys, it changed their day and some lives and how they see things and how they look at things. But for us, the visitors, the outlook that we got on life was that, man, your situation doesn't have to define you."" Anderson, a six-year NFL journeyman, has done prison outreach work throughout his career. He has seen the challenges to reaching an often underserved community, and he has grown to understand the value in the work. ""There's a lot of red tape involved with getting in, but then there's also a stigma around people that are in prison,"" Anderson said. ""And I think in general, I try to look at people as humans, and one bad mistake can lead to pretty significant changes in your life experiences. And so I think you have to kind of take away the judgment when you walk into settings like that and just try to see people for the humans that they are. ""Any of us can make bad decisions that lead to significantly bad outcomes. The goal is to try to see if you can use some of the things you've learned in life to give people inspiration so that they can make better decisions and they can see life different and hopefully not end up in those situations."" Walker, who has been the superintendent at SCI-Fayette since 2023, has received positive feedback from inmates in the week since the visit from the Steelers and the special program.

Karen, too, got a glowing review of Jonnu's visit from her older son. ""[The players] probably think, 'Oh, it was nothing,' but they really don't know what it is that they did for someone else. Or maybe they do, but it was bigger probably than they can imagine,"" she said. ""Wayne talked about it for days afterwards. He's still talking about it. He said, 'Mom, that was the best day of all the days that I've spent in jail. That was the best day. That was it. Those men, the Steelers coming, my brother and those players coming up to talk to us, Mom, it was such a good day.'"" JONNU DOESN'T NEED to circle the date on the calendar for a visual reminder that it's on the horizon. On July 18, 2026, Wayne is scheduled to be released after 16 years of incarceration. Jonnu is under contract in Pittsburgh through the 2026 season, but because he's turning 31 years old on Aug. 22 with a $10.8 million cap hit, his future in Pittsburgh beyond this season is anything but certain. In five games this season, Jonnu has 17 catches on 20 targets and one touchdown. What is certain, however, is that he's going to be alongside his brother every step of the way as Wayne transitions to the next phase of life. But that doesn't mean Jonnu is going to leave the prison community behind. Jonnu envisions continuing to work in the prison-reform space with his brother and through his nonprofit, the Nu Family Foundation. ""July 18th, 2026 is going to be, up until that point, the happiest day of my life,"" Jonnu said. ""He's got his whole life ahead of him. ... He went to jail when he was 20 years old. He was a baby and had to kind of become a man on his own. ""And I'm proud of the man that he's become, because the man that he's become impacted this man right here.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46608099/why-2025-season-extra-special-pittsburgh-steelers-jonnu-smith-brother-wayne-smith,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560630_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,073a5923efc67cf627cf61c3f2e504e7850a5cee
d41e73686990,Joe Flacco vs. Aaron Rodgers is historic battle of QBs over 40,,"CINCINNATI -- As a young NFL quarterback, Joe Flacco had a number in mind that signaled what a long and successful career in the league might look like. But the more games and seasons he banked, he realized he might have set the bar a touch too low. The number was 15, which he reached three years ago. The man who entered the league as a clean-shaven prospect out of the University of Delaware now sports a strong patch of gray in the stubble around his chin. Flacco is 40. And on Thursday, he'll be the younger of the two starting quarterbacks. Aaron Rodgers is 41. And when the two square off in an AFC North contest between Flacco's Cincinnati Bengals and Rodgers' Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday (8:15 p.m. ET, Prime Video), it'll be somewhat historic. They will be just the second quarterback pairing in the Super Bowl era to start against each other as 40-year-olds, something Drew Brees and Tom Brady did three times during the 2020 season. Aaron Rodgers showed he still has some wheels at 41. Charles McQuillan/Getty Images ""The biggest thing that I've learned in terms of wanting to play a long time in your career is that you've made a decision that football's important to you,"" Flacco said this week. ""Somewhere inside of you, you've told yourself that you want to play a long time."" Ten days ago, Thursday's matchup between these two seemed improbable. Flacco started four games this season for the Cleveland Browns before he was benched in favor of rookie Dillon Gabriel heading into a Week 5 game against the Minnesota Vikings . Cincinnati, with a need at quarterback after Jake Browning struggled to fill in for the injured Joe Burrow , made the rare move of trading within the AFC North to make Flacco a starter again. After a slow start, Flacco threw for 219 yards and two touchdowns in a loss against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. Rodgers' situation is not much different. After spending his first 18 seasons with Green Bay, he played the 2023-24 seasons with the New York Jets . He tore his right Achilles in the 2023 opener and had a relatively nondescript second season. The Jets released Rodgers in the offseason before he joined the Steelers. His first game with his new club was a 34-32 victory over the Jets. ""There were probably people in the organization that didn't think I could play anymore,"" Rodgers told reporters after the game. ""So, it was nice to remind those people that I still can."" Flacco and Rodgers have notable things in common. Like Brees and Brady, both were Super Bowl MVPs. Each player also has a strong throwing arm, an asset that Bengals coach Zac Taylor believes helped play a role in their long careers. ""I know [Flacco] still got a lot of power in there and a lot of juice and understanding where to throw it and the timing,"" Taylor said. ""He definitely is classified as above-average arm strength. ""Same with Aaron. Those guys have a chance to continue to play."" Since the turn of the century, there have been 10 quarterbacks who have played in at least five or more games as a 40-year-old, according to ESPN Research. Matt Hasselbeck is one of them. In 2015, Hasselbeck started eight games for the Indianapolis Colts in place of the injured Andrew Luck. In June, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce asked Hasselbeck about playing in the twilight of one's career. Hasselbeck's response: Sleep better and recover better. To extend his career, Hasselbeck wore compression socks after practices and made sure to eat and recover properly after a hard workout. Flacco's typical recovery routine includes massages from team trainers. Preventing small aches from turning into painful ones has been crucial. Packers QB Jordan Love was 8 years old when Joe Flacco began his NFL career in 2008. AP Photo/Morry Gash Speaking to reporters in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, Rodgers said he has significantly tweaked his offseason training as he has gotten older and also embraced external work, too. When the team was off two weeks ago, Rodgers saw his body work specialist, who he plans on seeing a few more times this season. That has put him on a positive trajectory during a strong start with the Steelers. ""I think I'm kind of going like this body-wise,"" Rodgers said, flattening his hand and angling it upward. ""I'm just getting healthier."" Flacco said while recovery is important, lifting heavy as many times during the week is great at working out any stiffness and soreness. It's a tenet that helps with the grind of a 17-game NFL season, no matter the age. ""You can't forget what got you there,"" Hasselbeck told ESPN. ""Some guys lift really hard -- they power clean, they squat, they deadlift to get themselves there, and then they get paid. ""[Then] they go, 'Oh, the strength coach isn't making me do that.' They get a little soft and they do yoga."" Because ultimately successfully being an older quarterback isn't about having the strongest arm, Hasselbeck said. It's about taking a beating and being able to protect yourself and adjust one's playing style as they get older. It's why Rodgers has helped the Steelers (4-1) off to a strong start and why Flacco could help the Bengals (2-4) stay afloat until Burrow returns from his turf toe injury. That timeline hasn't been determined. When it comes to how long he'll keep playing, Flacco isn't setting yearly benchmarks anymore. It's not about hitting 20 years in the league. It's a matter of taking it a year at a time and seeing how things shake out. In his first news conference with the Bengals, Flacco said the reason he's still playing is because of how hard he's worked to be in the NFL, something he doesn't take for granted. ""I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror when I'm 50 years old and be able to say that I gave it everything that I had,"" Flacco said.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46606954/nfl-cincinnati-bengals-joe-flacco-pittsburgh-steelers-aaron-rodgers,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560659_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,c0993bd1d09a392c2c636f645e0a9264d3b070dc
88ed620ef4bd,How five NFL quarterbacks look with their new teams in 2025,,"Oct 16, 2025, 06:25 AM ET The 2025 NFL offseason featured plenty of quarterback movement via free agency and trades, but five moves stand out from the rest. Sam Darnold signed with the Seahawks, Justin Fields signed with the Jets, Daniel Jones signed with the Colts, Aaron Rodgers signed with the Steelers, and Geno Smith was traded to the Raiders. All five are currently starting for their new teams to mixed results. How have these quarterbacks performed at their new destinations? We called on our NFL Nation reporters to evaluate both the positive and concerning signs from each passer so far. Then, national NFL reporter Dan Graziano sized up the likelihood that each quarterback will stick with his new 2025 team in 2026. The five signal-callers are listed below alphabetically, starting with a player who has continued his redemption arc in a new city this season. Jump to a quarterback: Darnold | Fields | Jones Rodgers | Smith 2025 stats: 11 passing touchdowns (tied for fifth), 1,541 passing yards (third), 78.5 QBR (third), 70.8% completion percentage (tied for sixth) What has gone right this season: Darnold is a hair behind Daniel Jones and Dak Prescott for third in QBR, showing that his breakout season in Minnesota was neither a fluke nor solely a product of Kevin O'Connell's coaching. He leads the NFL in both air yards per attempt (9.0) and yards per attempt (9.6), while owning the sixth-lowest sack rate (4.1%). That means he's pushing the ball downfield with success and not holding on to it too long. Despite operating in the league's most run-heavy offense, several of his passing touchdowns have come on plays in which he has escaped pressure and made accurate throws on the run. That's proving to be perhaps his best skill. What has gone wrong this season: Both of the Seahawks' losses included a Darnold turnover in the final minute when they had the ball with a chance to win. In Week 1 , he drove Seattle to the 49ers' 9-yard line before right tackle Abraham Lucas got beaten badly by defensive end Nick Bosa for a game-ending strip sack. In Week 5 , his hurried attempt at a throwaway bounced off a defender for an interception. Tampa Bay drove for a game-winning field goal, and Darnold said postgame he could have changed the protection to account for the free rusher. Although each mistake had extenuating circumstances, quarterbacks are defined by their ability to deliver in the clutch. Darnold didn't do it in those losses, but he did lead a game-winning drive in Week 4 against the Cardinals. -- Brady Henderson Likelihood of Darnold staying in 2026: 80%. Darnold has been everything the Seahawks could have hoped when they traded away Geno Smith and signed him in free agency. He's scheduled to earn $27.5 million in 2026, but none of that money is guaranteed. And $17.5 million of it becomes guaranteed five days after the Super Bowl, so if the Seahawks are in the Super Bowl, they'll have only five days to decide on Darnold. (Of course, if they're in the Super Bowl, they've probably already decided to keep him by then.) He could get an extension that tears up the final two years of his deal if he continues to play like this and the Seahawks continue to win. -- Graziano 2025 stats: 4 passing touchdowns (tied for 28th), 799 passing yards (29th), 36.5 QBR (29th), 65.0% completion percentage (22nd) What has gone right this season: Not much. If there's a positive, it's that Fields has brought a unique dimension to the position. He has already rushed for 235 yards, so he should easily break the team record for most rushing yards by a quarterback (Al Dorow had 453 in 1960). Fields has kept some plays alive with his open-field ability, including a brilliant 43-yard touchdown run against the Dolphins in Week 4 . Actually, he could have much more yardage, but he's not keeping the ball as much as he did early in the season. What has gone wrong this season: Fields received a vote of confidence this week from coach Aaron Glenn, but he could be losing his grip on the starting job. He looked lost and reluctant to pull the trigger on Sunday against the Broncos. He held the ball too long and took nine sacks. He's inconsistent as a pocket passer -- the story of his career -- with his lowest QBR since his rookie season (31.4). The Jets gave Fields a two-year, $40 million deal -- essentially, a one-year audition to see if he's the long-term answer. So far, he has provided no evidence he can be that guy. -- Rich Cimini Likelihood of Fields staying in 2026: 25%. Fields has had a couple of good games, a couple of disastrously bad games and missed one game due to a concussion . If the Jets cut him after this season, they'd still owe him $10 million in guaranteed 2026 salary and would have paid him $30 million for one (presumably disappointing) season. The Jets are 0-6, which means they're almost certainly not a playoff team and could have a very high draft pick. There's time for Fields to turn things around in terms of his individual play and convince the Jets he's their future at the position. He's only 26 years old, after all. But the Jets can get out of the contract with minimal pain if this season continues to be as rough as it has been so far. -- Graziano 2025 stats: 8 passing touchdowns (tied for 17th), 1,502 passing yards (seventh), 79.7 QBR (first), 71.7% completion percentage (third) What has gone right this season: Just about everything. Jones certainly expected an upgrade in his supporting cast in Indianapolis compared with New York , but who could have predicted he'd be leading the NFL in QBR and see his yards per attempt jump from his career mark of 6.6 to 8.3 this season? If you're looking for explanations, you can start with coach Shane Steichen's masterful game plans and Jones' league-low 2.7% sack rate (his career rate is 8.1%). What has gone wrong this season: This is a bit of a nitpick, but Jones does have to be mindful of his ball protection after recent games. He went three games into the season without a turnover, but he has had three interceptions in the past three games, including an ugly one in last Sunday's win over the Cardinals. Jones also committed two fumbles in that three-game stretch, though the Colts recovered both. Efficiency and turnover margin have factored into their offensive success, so they need that to remain part of the winning recipe. -- Stephen Holder Likelihood of Jones staying in 2026: 80%. Jones has played very well, and the Colts are 5-1, which has led to some chatter about a possible contract extension. Jones is on a one-year, $14 million contract that could get over $18 million if he hits all of his incentives, and then is eligible for free agency at year's end. The Colts still have 2024 first-rounder Anthony Richardson Sr ., but if they keep winning with Jones, a new contract or a franchise tag are strong possibilities for 2026. -- Graziano 2025 stats: 10 passing touchdowns (tied for ninth), 1,021 passing yards (25th), 49.0 QBR (23rd), 68.8% completion percentage (11th) What has gone right this season: More than has gone wrong, that's for sure. The early returns of the Rodgers experiment are positive since he signed a one-year deal with the Steelers in June. That's because Rodgers is playing smart football within the offense and integrating seamlessly in the organizational culture. Defensive captain Cameron Heyward said this year's team has been closer from top to bottom, and he said Rodgers has been a big part of that. What has gone wrong this season: The biggest knock on the Rodgers-led offense is the lack of deep passes. Rodgers is last in air yards per attempt (5.3), but the Steelers' playmakers lead the lead in average yards after the catch per reception (7.3). The Steelers have 15 receptions of at least 20 yards, but they have just two passes of 20 air yards or more. -- Brooke Pryor Likelihood of Rodgers staying in 2026: 5%. It's this low because Rodgers has basically said this will be his final year. It's this high because people sometimes change their minds or don't really mean the things they say. Everything is going quite well for Rodgers in Pittsburgh, where he's playing on a one-year, $14.15 million deal. But he does turn 42 years old in December, and it would stand to reason that he'd at least be considering retirement, even if he might eventually change his mind. -- Graziano play 1:09 McAfee: This is the best Aaron Rodgers has looked in years Pat McAfee is very impressed by what he has seen from Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers offense this season. 2025 stats: 7 passing touchdowns (tied for 21st), 1,350 passing yards (11th), 37.8 QBR (28th), 66.1% completion percentage (20th) What has gone right this season: There are not a lot of positives from Smith's performance on the field. However, the Raiders' Week 6 win over the Titans might have provided a blueprint for getting him back on track. It wasn't a pretty showing, but the offense struck a balance between the run and pass game. Ashton Jeanty rushed for 75 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries, and Smith leaned heavily on the short and intermediate passing game. He completed 17 of 23 passes for 174 yards, with a touchdown pass and an interception. Putting Smith in a position where he doesn't have to win games with his arm is the best path forward for him and the Raiders. What has gone wrong this season: Turnovers, simply put. Smith has thrown 10 interceptions through six games. The last NFL QB to throw at least 10 INTs in the first six games of a season was Kirk Cousins with the Vikings in 2020. Smith threw an interception for the third straight game Sunday. ""I told coach [Pete Carroll] I need to go jump in the lake, or ocean or something,"" Smith said postgame. ""It's just a lot of bad-luck stuff happening to me, but I'm in control of that."" -- Ryan McFadden Likelihood of Smith staying in 2026: 50%. At this time, $18.5 million of Smith's $26.5 million 2026 salary is guaranteed. The remainder becomes guaranteed in March of next year. So, if the Raiders want to move on and eat the $18.5 million (and not have to eat all $26.5 million), they'd have to decide by the time the league year starts. Smith has played poorly and just turned 35, so it's not out of the question the Raiders could go in a different direction if things don't turn around. -- Graziano",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46603629/nfl-quarterbacks-2025-season-free-agents-trades-darnold-fields-jones-rodgers-smith,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560606_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,38d10917a70abaa84e4d5733b4b36bf0c978ec67
05692f5a8e3c,MLB,,"LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers didn't just fall short of lofty expectations during the regular season. For a large chunk of it, they were basically mediocre. They began with a 23-10 record and ended, after a well-timed meeting by their manager , with 15 wins in a stretch of 20 games. But in between, from May 4 to Sept. 7, the Dodgers were 56-54, a mere two games above .500 in a 110-game sample. Their rotation was hurt, their bullpen was a mess, their lineup was inconsistent, and until the very end, they displayed scant signs of a team equipped to defend a championship. Now they're a juggernaut. The Dodgers have steamrolled through this postseason, winning seven of eight and going 4-0 away from home. They breezed past the Cincinnati Reds in the wild-card round, outscoring them 18-9, then faced a Philadelphia Phillies team widely considered the most talented in this playoff field and dispatched it in four games. They have since taken control of the National League Championship Series with back-to-back road wins over the No. 1-seeded Milwaukee Brewers . Barring the unforeseen -- teams that have won the first two road games in a best-of-seven format have prevailed in that series 25 of 28 times -- the Dodgers will become the first club since the 2009 Phillies to return to the World Series a year after winning it. Six more wins and the Dodgers will become baseball's first repeat champions in a quarter century. Nothing is guaranteed, but that they're even in this position -- with Shohei Ohtani slumping offensively, no less -- is remarkable when considering recent circumstances. The Dodgers were on a 91-win pace as they approached the final week of the regular season. Had that remained the case and had they not ended it on a five-game winning streak, they would've tied for the lowest full-season wins total since Andrew Friedman took over baseball operations at the end of the 2014 season. In other words, the team many believed might challenge the wins record was making a case as the franchise's worst in a decade. Friedman acknowledged that reality then, but countered by expressing his belief that this might be the best roster he has ever taken into October. That has borne out, and there are four main reasons why. The starting pitching has been dominant The Dodgers' rotation hasn't just been dominant, actually -- it has been historic. Its postseason ERA stands at just 1.54 , on pace to be the second-lowest all time among teams that played in at least eight playoff games. Only the 1983 Baltimore Orioles posted a lower mark. In other words, the Dodgers' foursome of Ohtani, Blake Snell , Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow has been better -- so far, at least -- than the 1996 Atlanta Braves of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. Better than a 1912 New York Giants staff, led by Christy Mathewson, which pitched in the dead ball era. Better than a 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks team that rode the dominance of Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling to a title. Better, even, than a 1981 Dodgers rotation featuring Fernando Valenzuela, Jerry Reuss and Burt Hooton. One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » That '81 Dodgers team set a franchise record with 11 games of starting pitchers going at least six innings and allowing no more than three runs in their march to a championship. The 2025 Dodgers, despite existing in an era of heavy bullpen use, have already received seven such starts. The only time they didn't was in Game 3 of the NL Division Series, when Yamamoto's outing was abbreviated by a prolonged fourth inning. Six days later, he went to Milwaukee -- the place where he failed to escape the first inning on July 7 -- and threw the first postseason complete game in eight years. ""I don't know if you can write enough words in your stories about our starting pitching,"" Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman said. ""It really has been amazing. They seem to feed off each other."" Any complaints about the Dodgers' spending, and the perceived imbalance it has caused, begin with the rotation. During a 10-day stretch in December 2023, they signed Ohtani to an unprecedented contract ($700 million guaranteed, with $680 million deferred), acquired and extended Glasnow (for more than $130 million over five years) and lavished Yamamoto with the largest deal ever given to a starting pitcher (12 years, $325 million). Then, they won the World Series behind a patchwork rotation, targeted Snell and landed him on a five-year, $182 million contract less than 12 months later. The Dodgers, who later lured Roki Sasaki from Japan and brought Clayton Kershaw back for one more season, began the year with thoughts of fielding one of the best starting staffs in baseball history. But Sasaki struggled, Ohtani's pitching progression played out methodically as he returned from a second elbow repair, and Glasnow and Snell missed extended time with shoulder injuries. It wasn't until around late August that the strength of the Dodgers' rotation truly revealed itself, and it did so emphatically. Dodgers starters posted a 2.07 ERA over the last month of the regular season, by far the lowest in the majors, and have somehow reached another level ever since. Snell has limited the Reds, Phillies and Brewers to two runs on six hits in 21 innings. Yamamoto -- four earned runs on 13 hits in 19⅔ innings -- has been nearly as dominant behind him. Glasnow, the Game 3 starter, shut the Phillies out through six innings in L.A. Ohtani, the Game 4 starter, allowed three runs in six innings against them in Philadelphia. The four have combined to limit Elly De La Cruz , Trea Turner , Kyle Schwarber , Bryce Harper , Christian Yelich , Brice Turang and William Contreras to six hits in 59 at-bats, with 23 strikeouts. ""It's just incredible,"" Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy said. ""We said before this postseason started -- our starting pitching was going to be what carried us. And so far, it's been exactly that."" Sasaki went from disappointing starter to lights-out closer There might not have been a bigger development in this Dodgers season than what took place at their Arizona complex in early September , when Rob Hill, their director of pitching, and Ian Walsh, their pitching performance coordinator, got Sasaki to flex his back leg to prevent his pelvis from tipping forward and thus recapture the life on his fastball. As the regular season winded down and their title defense approached, the Dodgers found themselves with few answers late in games. Tanner Scott , the free agent splurge who was supposed to anchor the back end of their bullpen, had been a dud in his first season in L.A. Kirby Yates , another offseason pickup, wasn't much better. The likes of Blake Treinen , Michael Kopech and Evan Phillips , catalysts in their bullpen-fueled run last fall, were either bad, inconsistent or injured. By the end of the regular season, Dodgers relievers had combined for a 4.27 ERA and 27 blown saves. Then, Sasaki closed out the wild-card round by overwhelming the Reds with a triple-digit fastball and gravity-defying splitter, capturing the imagination of a team that had grown desperate in its search for a ninth-inning solution. That he did it twice more in Philadelphia, recording the final out in back-to-back road wins to begin the NLDS, then pitched three perfect innings in the Dodgers' clinching victory over the Phillies in Game 4, only worked to solidify a crucial point: How the Dodgers fixed Roki Sasaki After a disastrous MLB debut, L.A.'s new ninth-inning man has unleashed jaw-dropping stuff in October. Jeff Passan » The Dodgers' most glaring weakness had suddenly become one of their greatest strengths, all because of one improbable turnaround. ""Since coming back, coming in from the bullpen, he's honestly one of the best pitchers I've ever seen,"" Glasnow said. ""His stuff is incredible. He's locked in around the strike zone. For him to start the season how he did and then come back now -- it's one of the craziest things I've ever seen."" The industry widely anticipated growing pains when Sasaki transitioned to the States, but they were more amplified than expected. He struggled through his first eight major league starts, then spent four months on the injured list with a shoulder impingement, went to Triple-A and was throwing his fastball in the low 90s. Hill and Walsh identified an important cue, but trainer Travis Smith worked diligently to help Sasaki add strength to his wiry frame, and Sasaki himself fully embraced a high-leverage bullpen role, exhibiting a poise that has inspired confidence in those around him. Now, so much seems to hinge on Sasaki's success. If he remains dominant, the Dodgers look unbeatable. If he falters, their late-game model crumbles. Outside of Emmet Sheehan , another young starter who's still adapting to a bullpen role, Alex Vesia , who has been used a lot this season, and Treinen, who has been inconsistent, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts doesn't seem to trust anybody else to hold leads late. His hope is that Sasaki's wobbly ninth inning in NLCS Game 1 -- when he issued two walks, a double and a sacrifice fly before exiting -- was more an anomaly than the start of a troubling trend. Sasaki was pitching four days after his nine-out, 36-pitch relief appearance, and his fastball velocity was slightly down. The Dodgers certainly noticed. ""We're still in sort of uncharted territory with him,"" Roberts said. ""We're still gathering information, and he's certainly doing everything he can to stay ready and be ready and be productive. But it's something that's certainly on our radar."" Mookie Betts learned shortstop and fixed his swing Betts poured himself into the task of becoming a major league shortstop over the offseason -- taking ground balls daily, traveling to high school and collegiate fields all over Southern California, seeking input from infield coach Chris Woodward, close friend Ryan Goins and even former All-Star Troy Tulowitzki -- but whether he would be able to stick at one of the sport's most demanding positions remained an open question when games began to matter again. Even to him. ""I just didn't know,"" Betts said. Seven months later, Betts has not only made it through an entire season at shortstop, a transition that, as a former right fielder in his 30s, was largely without precedent; he has somehow become an asset at the position. Betts contributed five outs above average during the regular season, tied with the likes of Geraldo Perdomo , Willy Adames and Francisco Lindor . His 17 defensive runs saved were tied with Taylor Walls for the major league lead at the position. On Wednesday, he was announced as one of three Gold Glove finalists. But what really ignited the Dodgers was Betts getting back to who he has always been offensively. Betts began the season with an illness that caused him to shed close to 20 pounds and navigated the worst four-month stretch of his career, slashing .240/.313/.369 by the end of July. Then his season took a drastic turn. In August and September, Betts slashed .294/.351/.478, once again serving as a catalyst between Ohtani and Freeman. In two wild-card games, he accumulated six hits in nine at-bats. Betts needed time not only to regain his weight and strength, but to sustain it while navigating the rigors of a season. ""I finally got all that back and was able to fix a couple of mechanics and didn't really have to try and add on power anymore,"" Betts said. ""I could just swing and let it do its thing."" His mindset also helped. On Aug. 8, Betts snapped a 23-game homerless drought and later made a declaration. ""My season's kind of over,"" he said. It began with the debilitating stomach bug but also included a broken toe and the death of his stepfather. He admitted to spiraling at times. In his mind, the numbers would not be salvaged. Accepting that allowed him to focus on team-first at-bats and not get bogged down by his stat line. It was freeing. ""I think he was resolved to just let that go, play for the present and the future and play to help the team win,"" said Roberts, who shares a close relationship with Betts. ""I think that just took a lot of pressure off him."" Betts has made every defensive play in this postseason, including a handful of difficult ones to his left. Playing shortstop now, he said, feels like playing right field, where he accumulated six Gold Gloves. He no longer has to think about it. And though his bat has slowed in these past two rounds -- he was 4-for-24 against the Phillies and Brewers -- the Dodgers can be confident it has more to do with the difficulty of hitting at this stage than it does Betts' own struggles. They execute when it matters Champagne and beer flowed inside a tarped-off batting cage after the Dodgers advanced to the NLCS on Oct. 9, the third such celebration in a span of two weeks, and Enrique Hernández was asked to reveal the secret behind the Dodgers' success. ""The talent we have,"" Hernández said, identifying the obvious -- but he added a caveat. ""Talent on paper is one thing, but in reality, that's not what wins games,"" Hernández said in Spanish. ""What wins games is what goes on inside the lines. We've created an incredible culture here where we play baseball the right way. We play winning baseball. There's a lot of teams throughout the league that are super talented, but they don't play the right way. They don't do the little things."" The Big Dumper ... and some magic? Seattle has never won a World Series. Or even an American League pennant. Could a little bit of alchemy change that? Alden Gonzalez » Hernández didn't single out any teams. But he could have been talking about the New York Yankees , who fumbled away a championship with a comedy of errors in the fifth inning of Game 5 in last year's World Series, including a dropped fly ball, an errant throw and some ill-timed miscommunication. He could have been talking about the Phillies, whose 2025 season ended when one of their relievers, Orion Kerkering , threw wide of home in a pressure-packed moment. Really, though, he was talking about the Dodgers, who have been through so many of these games together that they seem more adept at navigating the pressure and the noise than most. Never was it more evident than in the ninth inning of NLDS Game 2, when the Dodgers halted a furious Phillies rally by perfectly executing the wheel play on a sacrifice bunt to get the lead runner at third base, prompting their second of four straight road wins in these playoffs. ""A lot of our guys have been through things, and we don't panic,"" Roberts said. ""We sort of stay the course."" Their offense might slump, their pitchers might struggle, even their defense might falter. But the Dodgers have seemingly become masters at managing the calamity that October tends to present. Hernández, with a postseason OPS 178 points higher than his regular-season one, stands as a prime example. Others -- Snell, Tommy Edman , Teoscar Hernandez -- have shown a knack for elevating their games in the playoffs. On the whole, though, a Dodgers team that was long defined by postseason failures has in recent years earned a reputation for doing the exact opposite. It doesn't matter if their rotation is in shambles, or their bullpen is a mess, or their first baseman is hobbled, or their best player is in the midst of a prolonged slump -- they find a way. ""Two years ago we went through the worst, last year we went through the best,"" Enrique Hernández said, referencing a 2023 team that was eliminated in the NLDS for a second straight year. ""When you go through the worst and you go through the best, you learn a lot about each other. You learn to care more and more about each other as teammates, as a team. We're just a team that -- we're gonna figure out how to win a ballgame.""",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46604427/mlb-2025-playoffs-los-angeles-dodgers-repeat-dynasty-milwaukee-brewers-nlcs,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,c6657bdd4de5806820af4efc1ae36464b2211327
83de4511692f,Inside the billion-dollar Middle East race to control the future of basketball,,"ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -- It's a few minutes before tipoff in the first NBA game of any sort in the 2025-26 season and the basketball court inside Etihad Arena is overflowing with training camp-sized rosters of Knicks and 76ers players and officials. On the sideline, Patrick Ewing is shaking hands with a man from Beirut who is wearing a vintage No. 33 Knicks jersey. Derrick Rose, who was flown in for the event, is posing for photos with a group of Filipino fans. Steve Harvey and Patrick Schwarzenegger, among other invited celebrities, are being escorted to courtside seats. Throughout the crowd, many Emirati men are wearing kanduras, traditional ankle-length white robes, but they are vastly outnumbered by ex-pats from dozens of other countries, including a teenager from Riyadh a few rows behind the 76ers bench, wearing an Anthony Edwards Team USA jersey and a pair of the newest version of Edwards' Adidas signature shoes, which technically hadn't even been released yet. But perhaps the most interesting interaction taking place is between two Americans. Next to the team benches are two of the most powerful men in the NBA, Knicks owner James Dolan and commissioner Adam Silver, laughing and chatting, warmly embracing the evening together despite years of frosty relations . Standing between Dolan and Silver is the man who brought them together: His Excellency Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, who has spent the past decade developing relationships and directing growing investment dollars to bring top stakeholders in the sport to Abu Dhabi. That Silver and Dolan are aligned on their partnerships with Al Mubarak is one of the signs that the future of global basketball is being brokered now amid the giant cranes and rising cities in the Middle East. Despite their differences at home, Dolan and Silver are united in knowing this is a vitally important relationship to nurture. International basketball is on the cusp of a new, richer and expansive era that is aiming to deliver more of the sport to underserved fans and -- perhaps more importantly -- capture vast sovereign wealth fund capital that is seeking a place to invest in the sport. Some legacy leagues are in danger of being left behind. Some new leagues are trying to rise up. The NBA is focused on defending and strengthening its position as the biggest dog. And, despite the scrutiny it might create , that means deepening relations with Abu Dhabi and its wealthy neighbors. ""WHEN I CLOSE my eyes, I can see an NBA game being played in front of 22,500 people at the Sphere,"" Al Mubarak says as he leans back in a chair in a glittering building on the expansive NYU Abu Dhabi campus. He's not talking about Las Vegas. ""We will have the world's greatest technology where we can immerse the fans in the experience and they can feel the game on a new level."" Al Mubarak, or ""the chairman"" as he is often referred to by colleagues in his various cultural and leadership positions in Abu Dhabi, has engineered partnerships with the likes of Pope Francis, renowned architect Frank Gehry and UFC CEO Dana White. But he loves American sports and is an active NBA fan. ""I have some mixed feelings on the [Luka] Doncic trade,"" Al Mubarak says, referencing his favorite team, the Lakers. ""I am a believer in the importance of the traditional big man and Anthony Davis was such a part of the [2020] championship. But I know that Luka is motivated and he is one of the most talented players in the game."" Over the summer, the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) Abu Dhabi, of which Al Mubarak is the chairman, finalized a massive deal with Dolan's Sphere Entertainment to construct and operate a new venue in the UAE, with rights to build more in the Middle East and North Africa over the next 10 years. The original Sphere, which opened in Las Vegas in 2023, cost Dolan's company $2.3 billion to construct and has since lost more than $1 billion, according to its public financial disclosures. Dolan declined to comment for this story. Dolan turned to Abu Dhabi, where he found willing partners, both in the Sphere and in the Knicks, after a six-year effort to build a second Sphere in London failed in 2024 amid a tangle of red tape and political pushback. Last season Abu Dhabi's tourism arm, Experience Abu Dhabi, became the Knicks jersey-patch sponsor in a multiyear lucrative deal, but that was an appetizer to the Sphere partnership that came later. More NBA-linked deals are in the works in Abu Dhabi. This fall, the NBA is expected to finalize a long-term extension of its relationship with the DCT that will guarantee annual preseason games in Abu Dhabi and establish a new NBA Global Academy at NYU's Abu Dhabi campus, where top prospects from around the world will be sent to live, get an education and develop their games. The deal is expected to last well into the next decade, sources told ESPN. It is also a precursor to another large and potentially pivotal deal. The NBA is in discussions with Al Mubarak and other leaders about investing in NBA Europe, which has emerged as a league priority over the past year. In what could prove to be a signature move of Silver's tenure, the NBA is investigating launching a new NBA-branded European league as early as 2027, with a mix of existing teams recruited away from other leagues and expansion. Abu Dhabi is considering the possible launch of a team in Manchester, where they have owned and turned Manchester City Football Club into a global leader in soccer with world-class infrastructure. ""It is a possibility,"" Al Mubarak said of investing in an expansion team in NBA Europe. ""The NBA is the world's best basketball league and we have a deep commitment and track record of success in the [Manchester] community."" The NBA is seeding the ground ahead of the potential investment in Manchester. Last summer, the league conducted its first-ever Basketball Without Borders event in the United Kingdom by bringing top teen boys and girls to Manchester. In the 2026-27 season, the league is exploring bringing NBA teams to play at least one game in Manchester, sources told ESPN. Silver and deputy commissioner Mark Tatum traveled to London and Paris over the summer for meetings about placing teams in both cities. They also met with leadership from Real Madrid about recruiting the legacy team to the NBA Europe league. In August, NBA Hall of Famer Tony Parker, who owns ASVEL, a team based near Lyon, France, indicated his interest in jumping to the new league by telling reporters: ""NBA Europe league for me is just a matter of time. They are coming, and it's going to happen."" In recent weeks, leadership in legacy European teams Alba Berlin in Germany and Galatasaray, a large multisport conglomerate in Istanbul, have confirmed publicly their interest in NBA Europe. But having Abu Dhabi invest, be it in Manchester or elsewhere, is a huge boost for the concept. And with a potential expansion fee in the hundreds of millions to join the league, it could set an important standard for other investors as the new league establishes its footing. ""They are the lead investors in Manchester City. And they've had tremendous success there. They've demonstrated they are innovators in sport. They've demonstrated that they're in it for the long term, that they're not just financial investors, that they're active participants,"" Silver said as he stood with Tatum and George Aivazoglou, the NBA's head of Europe and the Middle East, all of whom came to Abu Dhabi to continue discussions about the future. ""So they are dream investors."" Such foreign investment -- across many industries -- has sometimes drawn criticism. The NBA is far from alone among high-profile American companies with ties to Abu Dhabi, including Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., the Cleveland Clinic and ESPN parent company Disney, which earlier this year announced a partnership with Abu Dhabi for a theme park not far from where the new Sphere will be constructed. The NBA, for its part, has previously faced concern about partnerships with countries and leaders whose values don't necessarily align with those publicly supported by the league itself . In launching its Basketball Africa League in 2021, the NBA came under congressional scrutiny for partnering with Rwandan dictator Paul Kagame . Earlier this year, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo called for the NBA and other international sports leagues and teams to sever ties with Rwanda and questioned whether the NBA's ""commitment to social justice and respect for human rights"" aligns with its business ties to Rwanda. Last year, as the NBA's ties with Abu Dhabi deepened, Human Rights Watch issued a warning , saying, in part: ""The NBA should be aware that the U.A.E. hosts high profile sporting, entertainment, and cultural events to promote a public image of openness and tolerance at odds with the government's rampant systemic human rights violations."" These include what HRW calls unequal rights for women. The NBA has responded to these claims in the past by saying the league follows ""the lead of the U.S. government as to where it's appropriate to engage in business around the world,"" as deputy commissioner Tatum said in a letter to U.S. senators last year. Through the building of courts and investments in new programs, the NBA has fostered growth in basketball in Rwanda , including for many women. The NBA also has championed the Middle East partnerships' effect on basketball participation in the region, citing studies that show a 400% increase in participation in the UAE and 50% in the Middle East over the past five years among boys and girls. Formula 1, the European Tour and WTA Tour also have long-standing relationships with and hold major events in Abu Dhabi. ""I think that what we share with the leaders [in Abu Dhabi] is this belief in the power of sport, and that as we look around the world, very few things that create commonality, empathy, understanding in the way sport does,"" Silver told ESPN. ""For example, I think many people outside the region might be surprised to see that there are an equal number of girls and boys in the youth programs here. And that there are universal values that are being taught in terms of respect, discipline, hard work, teamwork, understanding -- all fundamental values that we share. And at a time when so much divides us, it's nice to be focused on things that bring us together."" Basketball is on the cusp of a new, richer, expansive era. And, despite the scrutiny it might create, that means deepening relations with Abu Dhabi and its wealthy neighbors. EPA/ALI HAIDER TWO NIGHTS BEFORE the NBA opened its season in Abu Dhabi, a seminal event took place 75 miles down the E11 highway, in the sprawling metropolis of Dubai. There, two-year-old Dubai Basketball hosted its first-ever EuroLeague game against Serbian basketball power KK Partizan at the modern Coca-Cola Arena. The EuroLeague, the most competitive league in the world outside the NBA, is facing an uncertain future with NBA Europe looming and threatening its markets. In response, the EuroLeague took the extraordinary step of giving the brand-new Dubai team a five-year wild-card berth into the league. The deal, according to reports in Europe, includes covering the traveling expenses of European teams that will fly up to seven hours for the away games. Bringing major Western sporting events to the UAE is a goal of all this investment.

Sign Up Now After 15 years as title sponsor of the EuroLeague, Turkish Airlines was replaced this season by Abu Dhabi-owned Etihad Airlines on a four-year deal that will assist in the travel. Emirates Airline, the Dubai-owed rival of Etihad, signed a long-term deal with the NBA in 2024 to become the title sponsor of the NBA Cup. Still, the league doesn't currently have plans to base an NBA Europe team in the Middle East and playing the NBA Cup final in Dubai isn't under consideration, Silver told ESPN. Recently, the league announced changes to the NBA Cup schedule, including moving the semifinals to home team markets from Las Vegas starting in 2026, with the final at a neutral site. Last spring, the EuroLeague held its final four in Abu Dhabi, another deal put together by Al Mubarak, to sold out crowds, the first time the event had ever been held outside Europe. The future of European basketball, it is increasingly clear, runs through the UAE. As he stood in Abu Dhabi in early October, NBA commissioner Adam Silver outlined how Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak and his group have built the Manchester City club and have been innovators and active participants. ""They're dream investors,"" Silver said. David Dow/NBAE via Getty Images LAST APRIL, IN a news release that made some noise in the private equity world, TWG Global announced a $10 billion investment from Mubadala Capital with the proceeds ""to be used by TWG to capitalize on its attractive set of proprietary investment opportunities."" TWG Global is the holding company for the investments of Los Angeles businessman Mark Walter and his partners. Mubadala Capital is the asset management wing of Abu Dhabi's largest sovereign wealth fund. Two months later, this development contributed to enormous noise in the sports world when Walter, via TWG Global, agreed to buy the controlling share of the Los Angeles Lakers for a $10 billion valuation. The future of the NBA's most prized franchise, it seems, is also linked to the UAE. The Middle East interest in new basketball ventures goes deeper. Two years ago, the Qatar Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of the wealthy Gulf nation, bought 5% of the Washington Wizards' parent company. That same year, Qatar won a bid to host the 2027 FIBA World Cup. The fund is also the controlling owner of European soccer power Paris Saint-Germain, which in March 2025 confirmed it had been in talks regarding NBA Europe. Like Abu Dhabi with its Manchester City property, PSG could launch an expansion team under the same brand and act as an anchor tenant. Over the summer, in a move that could ultimately dovetail with such an eventual basketball investment, PSG made a landmark agreement to expand a partnership with NBA superstar Kevin Durant in which Durant got a small ownership stake in PSG. ""This club has big plans ahead and I can't wait to be a part of the next phase of growth,"" Durant said at the time. ""And to explore new investment opportunities with [Qatar]."" There are other ventures also seeking investment from Middle East sources. All of ESPN. All in one place.

Sign Up Now In February, the Financial Times reported the sovereign wealth funds of both Singapore and Saudi Arabia were among the potential backers behind a new global circuit basketball league. In the months since, the extent of the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund's (PIF) proposed involvement in the new basketball league has not been formally made public. Sela, a Saudi events company owned by the PIF, did confirm its involvement with the startup league. Multiple player agents, current and former league executives and support staffers told ESPN they'd been recruited to join the league ahead of a possible 2026 launch and, in some cases, were required to sign NDAs. At times, this recruitment involved superstar LeBron James' longtime business partner Maverick Carter, who worked as an adviser to the league for months. Last week, Carter confirmed to ESPN he had left the venture, which calls itself Project B and its representatives said in media interviews it is now focusing on starting a women's basketball league to rival the WNBA. The PIF and Sela did not respond to requests for comment on their level of involvement. A spokesperson for Swiss banking giant UBS, which announced it was advising the startup league earlier this year, declined to comment on its current relationship with the project but confirmed the fledgling league was still a client. James' representatives, including agent Rich Paul, told ESPN that James himself was not connected to the venture. James has developed a relationship with Saudi Arabian leaders and the PIF over the past few years, though. James held a clinic at Al-Azem Academy in Riyadh in 2023 as a guest of Saudi Minister of Culture Bader bin Farhan Al Saud. Last January, James became a team owner in E1, a global electric boat racing circuit that was launched by the PIF. Tom Brady and Rafael Nadal are also affiliated with teams in E1. At a recent conference hosted by Front Office Sports, Silver said he was not following those developments, but added: ""Competition is good. It keeps everyone on their toes."" Silver, however, is focused on his Middle East partners in Abu Dhabi. How and where all the money might flow and the impact it could have remains to be seen. But what is known is that the connection between the NBA and the Middle East is real, and an expansion of the relationship is coming, and the league is shoring up support with rivals, both seen and unseen, across the region. ""We are thinking about the long term, not just the next couple of years,"" Al Mubarak said. ""I believe that this partnership with the NBA will outlive me.""

3b6b0800c6b6,NBA,,"Bobby Marks Tim Bontemps Close Tim Bontemps ESPN Senior Writer Tim Bontemps is a senior NBA writer for ESPN.com who covers the league and what's impacting it on and off the court, including trade deadline intel, expansion and his MVP Straw Polls. You can find Tim alongside Brian Windhorst and Tim MacMahon on The Hoop Collective podcast. Oct 16, 2025, 07:00 AM ET The NBA season begins Tuesday, but that isn't the only thing on the minds of league executives in the coming days. The deadline for rookie extensions (and for veterans signed past this season) is 6 p.m. ET Monday, roughly 24 hours before the Houston Rockets travel to face the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder to tip off the 2025-26 season. Heading into this season, we've already seen several players from the 2022 draft class sign extensions with their teams. Paolo Banchero , Chet Holmgren and Jabari Smith Jr . -- the first, second and third picks in that draft by the Orlando Magic , Thunder and Rockets, respectively -- signed long-term deals with those teams in July. As did Jalen Williams (No. 12 by OKC) this offseason and Nikola Jovic (No. 27 by the Miami Heat ) last month. On Wednesday, the Sacramento Kings and Keegan Murray (No. 4) settled on a five-year, $140 million pact, per ESPN's Shams Charania. Of the 15 players from that class who remain extension eligible between now and Monday, how many will also land long-term deals with their current teams? Keep in mind, 14 out of the 25 players who signed rookie extensions in 2023 and 2024 signed on the last day eligible. And by Monday, teams will also have to reduce their rosters to 15 on standard contracts. With all that in mind, we assessed the market for 10 of the biggest names in the rookie extension pool, laid out the most interesting negotiations left on the board and explained how we think they will each play out Dyson Daniels , Atlanta Hawks Hawks guard Dyson Daniels has been a huge success story for Atlanta. Troy Taormina-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Daniels is a huge success story for Atlanta. He came to the Hawks last summer as part of the trade that sent Dejounte Murray to the New Orleans Pelicans and became the NBA's Most Improved Player last season while leading the league in steals (229, the most in a season by any player since Gary Payton in 1995-96). The Hawks were able to get a deal done at the deadline with Jalen Johnson last year, and it wouldn't be hard to see them find a way to get one done for Daniels. -- Tim Bontemps Why it might not: His agent, Daniel Moldovan, is using the five-year, $150 million extension Jalen Suggs signed last year as the comparison for Daniels, while also assessing Trae Young 's uncertain future in Atlanta. Daniels was named first-team All-Defense, finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and increased his offensive production from 5.8 to 14.1 points. But Young has a $49 million player option next season and has been eligible to sign an extension since mid-June. -- Bobby Marks What I would offer: Five years, $125 million. The contract would remain flat at $25 million per season. Factoring in the new contract for Daniels, and Young's player option, Atlanta would be $26 million below the luxury tax and comfortably beneath both aprons. -- Marks Will it happen?: If last year's negotiations with Johnson are a guide -- where the two sides haggled over it and then got a deal done right before the deadline -- then this one probably will go right up to Monday's deadline. The guess here is something gets done, but landing on a number both sides agree on could be difficult. -- Bontemps Christian Braun and Peyton Watson , Denver Nuggets Why an extension could get done : Braun has become an integral part of Denver's operation, helping the Nuggets win their first NBA title as a rookie and then stepping into the starting lineup last season in Kentavious Caldwell-Pope 's spot at shooting guard. He's the one clear long-term building block the Nuggets have. Watson, meanwhile, is a pogo-stick athlete who also brings an interesting skill set alongside Nikola Jokic , making him appealing for a long-term deal. -- Bontemps Why it might not: The Nuggets shaved nearly $17 million off their cap ledger for next season after they traded Michael Porter Jr . for Cameron Johnson . But Denver is projected to be $24 million below the apron, not including new contracts for Braun and Watson, as they enter the first year of Aaron Gordon 's extension. They could get $10 million in salary relief, but at the cost of waiving Jonas Valanciunas . The veteran's contract is guaranteed if he is on the roster past 11:59 p.m. ET on June 29. -- Marks Breaking News from Shams Charania Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . What I would offer: Let's first address the elephant in the room. Even if the Nuggets waive Valanciunas, Denver is still a second apron team if both Watson and Braun extend, and then the roster is filled out with players on minimum contracts. There is no dancing around that financial hurdle unless there is a trade to clear out money. As for Braun, team executives pointed to the five-year, $150 million extension Suggs signed with Orlando as the number to watch. But two red flags come with that. First, Suggs earned second-team All-Defense in 2024 and was paid because of his impact on the defensive end. Braun, on the other hand, averaged career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks last season and became the first player since Buddy Hield in 2018-19 with at least 400 fast-break points. Second, Orlando at the time had the financial wiggle room to start Suggs at $35 million per season and the flexibility to improve its roster. The Nuggets do not have the same flexibility. A five-year, $126.5 million extension for Braun that starts at $21.8 million would be a solid compromise for both sides. Braun's salary next season ranks in the top 15 of shooting guards. Watson's extension is more difficult to project because of his upside (he just turned 23) and his role coming off the bench. A four-year, $54 million extension would be team-friendly, considering next year's salary is $3 million below the non-tax midlevel exception. -- Marks Will it happen?: Braun's deal feels most likely to happen. He's too important to what Denver is trying to do, and cost certainty on his deal ahead of restricted free agency next summer will be critical. Though Watson is an intriguing player, given how Zeke Nnaji 's extension has aged for the Nuggets, it would be a bit surprising if Denver does a similar thing with Watson now, particularly with how their finances look going forward. -- Bontemps Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren , Detroit Pistons A deal for both Jaden Ivey (23) and Jalen Duren (0) will be difficult to accomplish. Grace Smith/USA TODAY Network via Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Ivey was showing signs of improvement before an unfortunate leg injury cost him the final few months of last season. His skill set could pair nicely with Cade Cunningham in the backcourt moving forward. For Duren, the argument is simple: He's a 21-year-old who averaged a double-double in his first season under J.B. Bickerstaff, and both sides hope he can continue to improve this season and beyond. -- Bontemps Why it might not: How much do the Pistons consider the broken left fibula Ivey suffered on Jan. 1? GM Trajan Langdon said before the start of training camp that there are no restrictions on Ivey, but that does not mean Detroit should take an aggressive stand with his next contract until it can evaluate him during the regular season. Duren's future comes down to not wanting to pay a center the high premium. Since 2020, there have been only two bigs -- Alperen Sengun and Jaren Jackson Jr . -- who have signed a non-max rookie extension starting at $20 million or more. -- Marks What I would offer: The Pistons handed out a five-year, $269 million extension to Cunningham in 2024 but still have financial runway to sign both players to lucrative extensions and flexibility to improve either in free agency or a trade. A five-year, $112.5 million extension for Duren would start at $25.6 million and decline to $19.4 million in the last season. The contract takes into consideration what Duren accomplished in his first three seasons and also his upside. He is one of five players in NBA history with at least 100 career double-doubles before turning 22. The Ivey extension would be four years, $86.5 million, with an up-and-down structure. The first year's salary would start at $23.9 million, then decline to $19.3 million in the last year. Including a prior injury exclusion (exhibit 3) would protect Detroit if Ivey suffers another injury to the same leg. -- Marks Will it happen?: It feels unlikely either of these will get done. There are just too many complicating factors in getting to a fair number for Ivey, making it more likely both sides will let this season play out and revisit next summer. And while Duren is young and showed improvement last season, there are questions about his rim protection long term and making a big bet on him now feels beyond what Detroit will ultimately do. It is also worth noting that this front office didn't draft either of these players. -- Bontemps Tari Eason , Houston Rockets Why an extension could get done: Eason is an analytical darling who has been consistent for the Rockets since being drafted No. 17 in 2022. Though it's likely he again comes off the bench this season, combo forwards with his skill set and ability to disrupt play at both ends are highly valued, and Houston has shown an ability to continually get its young core players locked into good contracts. -- Bontemps Why it might not: The Rockets probably will consider Eason's season-ending surgery on his left leg in the 2023-24 season and the 22 games he sat out last season because of the same leg. He played all 82 games in his rookie season but only a combined 59 in the past two. Eason has started only 16 games and probably will be in that sixth-man role again this season. Houston also signed Jabari Smith to an extension that starts at $23.6 million next season, and is expected to sign Kevin Durant to an extension. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $80 million. The apron era has taught teams to prioritize their own pending free agents and balance future finances. With Amen Thompson eligible to sign an extension next summer, it is hard to justify an average salary of $20 million or more for a player coming off the bench. -- Marks Will it happen?: This feels as if it will get done eventually. With Eason's injury history, locking in some long-term financial security makes sense. Houston has locked up its young players under general manager Rafael Stone, so expect the Rockets to continue to do so. -- Bontemps Bennedict Mathurin , Indiana Pacers Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said over the summer that Bennedict Mathurin, above, was going to be a starter with Tyrese Haliburton out for the season. Trevor Ruszkowski-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said over the summer that Mathurin, the first single-digit draft pick the Pacers have had in a couple of generations, was going to be a starter with Tyrese Haliburton out for the season. For a team that tends to keep its talent in-house, getting a deal done with Mathurin could make sense. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Mathurin's minutes and production should increase this season with Haliburton out. But can Indiana afford to pay the wing starter money when $80 million is already committed to Haliburton, Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell next season? Mathurin came off the bench in 60% of games played in the past three seasons. An extension would also put Indiana over the luxury tax and near the first apron in 2026-27. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $68 million. Mathurin's production over the past three years should warrant an extension that pays an average of $17 million. The wing is one of four players of his draft class to score at least 3,000 points and he averaged 16 points for a second time in his three seasons in 2024-25, while leading all reserves in postseason points. But as we mentioned above, playing time next season and the Pacers' payroll have to be taken into consideration. -- Marks Will it happen?: This one feels unlikely. Indiana, a team that hasn't paid the luxury tax in decades, already has $160 million committed to seven players next season -- leaving the Pacers with about $40 million to fill out the roster below the luxury tax, and without a clear starting center among the players currently under contract. Getting something done that Mathurin would accept now feels too rich for the Pacers within those constraints. -- Bontemps Mark Williams , Phoenix Suns Getting Mark Williams on a long-term contract with the Suns makes sense after they sent two first-round picks to get him from the Charlotte Hornets in June. Photo by Juan Ocampo/NBAE via Getty Images Why an extension could get done: Phoenix has already shown a commitment to Williams by sending out two first-round picks -- the No. 29 pick this past June, plus a 2029 first-rounder -- to get him from the Charlotte Hornets . So, with that investment already in the bag, getting Williams on a long-term contract with the franchise would make some sense. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Williams' health might be the most scrutinized in the NBA. The Lakers traded for Williams in February, only for him to fail his physical. After the trade was rescinded, Williams averaged 28.6 minutes, 15.1 points, 10.7 rebounds and a career high 1.3 blocks. He has never played more than 45 games in any season and has missed 116 games with various injuries (back, left foot and thumb). A likely approach is to evaluate Williams this season and then engage in contracts next summer when he is a restricted free agent. -- Marks What I would offer: A three-year, $51 million extension. The contract would be a flat $17 million per season and include exhibit 3 (prior injury exclusion that protects the Suns if Williams has a foot or back injury). The last year of the contract would be non-guaranteed but would have a minutes clause that partially or fully protects the salary. For example, if Williams plays in 55 games in 2025-26, 2026-27 and 2027-28, the contract would be fully guaranteed. If Williams reaches the criteria in one of the next three seasons, the protection would increase from zero to $5.66 million. -- Marks Will it happen?: It's hard to see it happening, even with the investment in draft capital the Suns put in to get Williams. He's a talented lob catcher, but since he's already dealing with injury issues out of the gate and has played in only 106 games in his career, this seems as if it will be a wait-and-see situation. -- Bontemps Shaedon Sharpe , Portland Trail Blazers Guard Shaedon Sharpe is a 6-foot-6 multifaceted wing who averaged 18.5 points last season. Troy Wayrynen-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Sharpe was general manager Joe Cronin's first draft pick in 2022, and will play this season -- his fourth in the NBA -- at just 22 years old. He's also a 6-foot-6 multifaceted wing who averaged 18.5 points last season. Add that up, and it's easy to see why Portland would want to keep him as part of its program moving forward. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Cap flexibility next offseason. Even after trading for Jrue Holiday and then signing Damian Lillard , Portland has $129 million in salary. The salary cap is projected to be $166 million. But Sharpe has a $25.2 million cap hold as a free agent, meaning Portland is already over the cap. The Blazers would have to let Sharpe walk in free agency to free up room. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $105 million. The contract seems rich, but I am betting on Sharpe's upside. In his first two seasons combined, he scored 1,299 points, and scored 1,335 points last season. He became the first Trail Blazer to have seven career 30-point games before turning 22. The contract would start at $29 million and then decline each season, with the last year being $23.5 million. The Trail Blazers would be $40 million below the luxury tax, leaving them enough room to sign Toumani Camara to a contract and also have access to the non-tax midlevel exception. -- Marks Will it happen?: The bet here is this one gets done. The Blazers have added veterans to augment their young core, but Portland has expressed a belief that it can build upon its strong second half from last season. Keeping Sharpe and building on that momentum moving forward is part of that plan. -- Bontemps Walker Kessler , Utah Jazz Getting Walker Kessler’s extension done would ensure Utah’s rebuild would be anchored by a player who has shown dominant rim protection prowess under coach Will Hardy. Rob Gray-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Getting Kessler's extension done would allow the president of basketball operations, Austin Ainge, to ink a player who was a key part of the Rudy Gobert trade three years ago and keep him with the franchise through the end of the decade. It would also ensure Utah's rebuild would be anchored by a player who has shown dominant rim protection prowess under coach Will Hardy. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Getting selected outside of the lottery and then outplaying your first-round contract comes with a downside. Because Kessler was selected with the 22nd pick in 2022, his free agent cap hold next season is a modest $14.7 million. That means if the Jazz signed Kessler to a starting salary of $25 million for next season, they would then lose $10 million in cap flexibility. Including the Kessler hold, Utah projects to have a minimum of $50 million in room. -- Marks What I would offer: Five years, $116 million. The extension would be a win-win for both sides. For Kessler, the $20 million starting salary next season ranks in the top 15 among all centers. The Jazz, on the other hand, would lose only $4 million in cap flexibility next summer. -- Marks Will it happen?: This one is unlikely.

b10c61259092,WNBA,,"Last season, Lauren Betts and the UCLA Bruins advanced to the Final Four for the first time in the NCAA era. Now Betts wants a return trip. But the senior has a lot to aim for individually as well, including being the No. 1 pick in the 2026 WNBA draft. Much must be settled before then. The WNBA is negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the union, the story that has dominated the narrative around the league all year. The draft lottery, expansion drafts for Toronto and Portland and a mammoth free agency that will include most players not on rookie contracts all will have to take place before the 2026 draft. In short, ESPN's mock draft now during the WNBA Finals is an exercise in many hypotheticals, a picture that gradually will become clearer over the next seven months. Here, we've listed the top five teams in order of their lottery odds and slotted the expansion teams in after them. Five of our top six selections in this mock were eligible to go in the 2025 draft, but all opted to return for another college season. UCLA | center | 6-foot-7 | senior Dallas' No. 1 pick in 2025, UConn guard Paige Bueckers , won Rookie of the Year honors but the Wings won just 10 games and finished tied for last with Chicago. Last month, the Wings fired Chris Koclanes after one year as coach. If the Wings win the draft lottery, it would mark their third No. 1 pick in six seasons, though their top pick in 2021, Charlie Collier, is no longer playing in the WNBA. Betts was a first-team All-American last season, averaging 20.2 PPG, 9.5 RPG and 2.9 BPG while shooting 64.8% from the field. She is a traditional center who doesn't shoot 3-pointers. WNBA teams must decide if that's a major drawback or something she can add to her strong low-block play. TCU | point guard | 5-foot-10 | senior All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Miles enrolled early at Notre Dame during the pandemic-affected 2020-21 season, playing six games. Then she played three full seasons for the Irish but sat out 2023-24 with a knee injury. Many saw her as a 2025 lottery pick, but instead she transferred to TCU for her last season of eligibility. She averaged 15.4 PPG, 5.6 RPG and 5.8 APG last season and appears to be the top point guard pick among college seniors. The Lynx played in the 2024 WNBA Finals and had the best record in the league this year. But they are in the lottery thanks to a 2024 trade with Chicago. UConn | shooting guard | 5-foot-11 | senior After injury issues during her first three years at UConn, Fudd had an overall healthy 2024-25, playing in 34 of the Huskies' 40 games. She averaged 13.6 PPG and shot 43.6% from behind the arc for the national champions. Fudd's talent has never been a question: She is an elite player when healthy, especially as a perimeter scorer. Spain | center | 6-foot-4 She looks to be the top international prospect in this draft. Fam, who turns 20 next June, started playing with a Spanish pro club when she was 15 and helped lead Spain to the EuroBasket final against winner Belgium this summer, averaging 8.7 PPG and 4.2 RPG. Fam's potential is high; she might elevate all the way to the No. 1 spot by the time of the draft. LSU | shooting guard | 5-foot-10 | senior Johnson has said she hopes to elevate her status to a potential No. 1, and that confidence is part of what makes her an appealing player. A national champion as a freshman, last season she had career bests with 18.6 PPG and 38.3% shooting from behind the arc. She also averaged 5.6 rebounds and 2.5 assists. Flau'Jae Johnson, right, is a projected lottery pick. Janiah Barker, left, is projected as the No. 10 pick to Indiana. Steph Chambers/Getty Images South Carolina | shooting guard | 5-foot-8 | senior We don't know what order the expansion teams will pick in this draft, but for now we put the Tempo here and the Fire at No. 7. Latson averaged a Division I-leading 25.2 PPG last season with Florida State. She sought a bigger profile with a program that regularly competes for the national championship, and South Carolina provides that. How will Latson adjust from an offense where she was the primary threat to being one of several? She is a career 32.6% shooter from behind the arc, which she will look to improve upon. Ole Miss | small forward | 6-foot-0 | senior She will spend her final season in the SEC after three years at Ohio State, where she was one of the Big Ten's top players. Her 16.5 PPG average and 37.4% shooting from behind the arc in 2024-25 were career highs. McMahon is a bit undersized as a forward but should improve defensively at Ole Miss and can improve her stock for playing at the next level. Maryland | shooting guard | 6-foot-3 | senior She spent her first three seasons at Indiana, where she averaged career highs last season of 14.4 PPG, 5.4 RPG and 3.2 APG. Garzon, who will play her final season at a different Big Ten school, stands out as an adept 3-point shooter with great size: She shot 42.6% from behind the arc during her Hoosiers career and made 220 3-pointers, including 88 last season. UConn | power forward | 6-foot-4 | senior One of the most intriguing transfers in college, Williams averaged 19.2 PPG and 9.8 RPG for Wisconsin last season. But her college career went under the radar while with the Badgers, who last made the NCAA tournament in 2010. Now she's joining the 12-time national champion Huskies, and no program better prepares players for WNBA success. Tennessee | power forward | 6-foot-4 | senior After two seasons at Texas A&M and one at UCLA, Barker will finish her college career at Tennessee. She has averaged 10.3 PPG and 6.4 RPG over three collegiate seasons and has a skill set with good size that interests WNBA evaluators. She will need to adjust to coach Kim Caldwell's fast pace, but already spent two seasons in the SEC and is prepared for the league's style of play. UCLA | shooting guard | 5-foot-11 | senior She will play her last college season for the Bruins after a good career at Utah, where she averaged 19.3 PPG in 2024-25. Her biggest strength is 3-point shooting: She made 94 treys last season on 44.8% accuracy. Her 62.7 effective field goal percentage was the best in the Big Ten. Spain | point guard | 5-foot-8 She was named MVP of the FIBA U19 World Cup in 2023, then was part of Spain's runner-up senior squad in the EuroBasket tournament this summer. She will turn 20 in January and could be ready for the jump to the WNBA. Duke | shooting guard | 6-foot-0 | senior The Dream had a good season under first-year WNBA coach Karl Smesko, who emphasizes 3-point shooting. Jackson made 87 treys last season while shooting 37.2%. And she was part of a Duke defense that led the ACC in allowing just 56.5 PPG per game. 14. Seattle Storm: Kiki Rice UCLA | point guard | 5-foot-11 | senior She was second to Betts in scoring (12.8 PPG) for the Bruins' Final Four team last season while also averaging 5.0 assists and 3.5 rebounds. There don't appear to be a lot of top point guards available in this draft, and we will see whether Rice impresses WNBA evaluators with her game management skills. South Carolina | center | 6-foot-6 | senior Okot, who is from Kenya, played there for two years at Zetech University before spending this past season at Mississippi State, where she averaged 11.3 PPG, 9.6 RPG and 1.1 BPG and shot 64.9% from the field. Now at South Carolina, her role might be even bigger with forward Chloe Kitts out for the season with a knee injury. (Kitts, incidentally, was on our first-round draft board before being hurt and might still enter the draft after this season.)",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46532440/wnba-mock-draft-2026-betts-miles-latson-johnson-fudd,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1008%2Fr1557556_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,03ef0081188805bd30e632605baacf778148adff
ddad4434548b,How Harry Kane is tearing up the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich,,"Oct 16, 2025, 07:33 AM ET The 2020 documentary ""All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur "" provided a revealing glimpse into Harry Kane 's psyche. In a one-on-one chat with then-manager Jose Mourinho, Kane said: ""When you're at a club like Tottenham, we've done well and I've done well, but I want to be [ Cristiano Ronaldo ] or [ Lionel Messi ]."" Some might have scoffed at the English striker's ambition as shown on screen, but despite the constant change after Mauricio Pochettino's departure as Spurs manager in 2019, Kane's brilliant numbers never waned. His blistering start to the 2025-26 campaign with Bayern Munich (18 goals in 10 matches), is on par with Messi and Ronaldo. Take a deeper look at his overall game, however, and his gaudy scoring stats are just scratching the surface. He has never been more influential in the buildup phase of play. The goals remain a constant, but he now plays a role at the start, middle and end of Bayern's attacks. Kane is evolving, and that evolution is contributing to perhaps his best season yet. With Saturday's Der Klassiker vs. Borussia Dortmund on the horizon (12:30 p.m. ET, ESPN+), let's examine how his role has changed from his days at Spurs, what it could mean for England at the 2026 FIFA World Cup , and his future at the club level. Filling a Musiala-shaped hole Harry Kane has been a prolific goalscorer for years and is taking Germany by storm in 2025-26 with his new role at Bayern Munich. S. Mellar/Getty Images When star midfielder Jamal Musiala picked up an injury during the Club World Cup, it left a creative void. Kane has taken up the mantle. ""When Jamal's playing, it's a bit different. Getting the ball off defenders, driving, when we were playing together, it was better for him to go and do that,"" Kane explained after Bayern's win over Eintracht Frankfurt . ""This season, it's allowed me to play a little bit deeper, use my qualities in that sense of turning and playing it forward, then arriving later in the box."" The goal he scored in that game saw Kane occupy Frankfurt's defensive line before peeling back close to Joshua Kimmich just ahead of the center circle. When the ball was played up to Serge Gnabry near the edge of the penalty area, the striker moved forward from the middle of the pitch, slotting into a gap created by him initially dropping for a trademark finish from outside the box. Wyscout Wyscout But Kane's game is about more than just arriving late to score goals. He's now a crucial cog in Bayern's buildup, often seen deep in his own half to receive the ball from his own defense. In the ninth minute of the same game, Kane received the ball near the sideline in the left-back position, wriggled past two challenges and found Gnabry in space. Wyscout Wyscout Wyscout The surprising thing is how much of a regularity such Luka Modric -esque moves are becoming. Players get sucked into following Kane so far into Bayern's half that he can find another attacker in space as he holds the ball up. He initiates the moves, and he completes them. Both his inevitable goal scoring and his playmaking ability are thriving as a result. How Kane's game has evolved Kane was always more than a goal poacher: it just took some time to discover his alternative capabilities. At the beginning of his career and in his first two seasons in Germany, Kane's game centered around creating chances or scoring them, but mainly scoring. He amassed many shots and touches in the box under Pochettino, and shades of his ball-carrying and ability to bring others into the game appeared near the end of his Tottenham Hotspur spell. Kane's heat map from his last two seasons at Tottenham, depicting where he was most active, helps show how his game has changed. More color appears in his own half, near the center circle, or in half-spaces (the channels between center backs and fullbacks) away from goal. In his first two seasons at Bayern Munich, his actions took place almost entirely in the opponent's half, as he leaned more into his talents as a finisher. Looking at Kane's heat map for the 2025-26 season, spots emerge all over the pitch, with highlighted areas deep in his own half. Statistics show that this season, Kane is back to combining the best of his abilities as an attacker and a creator. His progressive passes are as high as they were in 2021-22 and 2023-24, while he's never had more touches in his own box than this season. It's clearly working. ""Arriving late,"" as Kane puts it, has seen his expected assists and shot-creating actions rise. He has provided a solution to Bayern's shortage of creativity in midfield, as Kimmich and Leon Goretzka aren't the most inventive midfielders. (All stats below are per 90 minutes.) The evolution of Harry Kane Team Prog. passes Own-half touches Expected assists Shot-creating actions Bayern, 2025-26 4.93 14.60 0.55 5.89 Bayern, 2023-25 3.49 8.82 0.28 2.99 Spurs, 2021-23 4.53 12.12 0.16 3.51 His link-up play, hold-up ability and chance-creating talents were underrated during his time in north London, but in Bavaria, that part of his game has been elevated. It is now being used in spaces where you'd typically see Kimmich, and it's the absolute best of both worlds. Looking ahead to the World Cup Kane, England and coach Thomas Tuchel will be determined to get their hands on an elusive trophy this summer, and they shouldn't be afraid to use the ""new"" Harry Kane to do so. Ominously for the rest of the competition, England might have started doing this already. Against Serbia , while he spent most of the game occupying their back five, Kane would often peel off and look for the ball deeper. In the early stages of the World Cup, Tuchel could opt for Kane in this role to break teams down. With Kane dragging a center back of out of position, faster players such as Anthony Gordon or Bukayo Saka can be played in behind. In the latter stages (should England reach them), England might have less of the ball and use him more like a target man, as they did in the first minute of the Serbia game when a long ball was sent into the box for Kane to nod down. Kane's versatility could unlock defenses that sit deep and elevate other attackers. However, he still needs to be the striker who gets into the box, as there isn't another striker in the national side with his finishing ability. Lucky for England, he can do both. The conundrum for Tuchel will be balancing both roles. What's next at club level? With Kane's Bayern Munich contract set to expire in 2027, both club and player are thinking about what happens next. Bayern's sporting director has hinted at an extension , and the longer a new contract isn't signed, the more rumors and conjecture will swirl. We've taken the liberty of looking ahead for Kane, and his next step could be to settle unfinished business in England. Kane has played down a return home, but the motive would be clear: to break Alan Shearer's goal-scoring record (260; Kane has 213) and attempt to win a Premier League title. - Darke: Tuchel's tough love on Bellingham could help England and the player at World Cup - Ogden: Premier League big issues: Will Amorim, Ange last? Is Salah fading? - Connelly: The best teams in Europe right now: Bayern, Kane setting the tone Manchester City have Erling Haaland , and unless a team comes along to sign him out of his massive contract, he won't be displaced. But what if manager Pep Guardiola combined Haaland and Kane? Guardiola likes to play with four attackers and one holding midfielder behind Haaland, but those four attackers float around the pitch. One of those players could be Kane, as defenses wouldn't know who to mark. The downside could be that it exacerbates some of the out-of-possession issues City have had in their press this season. The forward line has left huge gaps as City have pressed aggressively. Kane isn't a bad presser, but if he's asked to drop deeper, we have no evidence to suggest whether his work without the ball would be sufficient in this new position, particularly in terms of tackling and closing players down. Teams are smart about exploiting space. Guardiola couldn't have both players pressing as forwards. Still, most of City's game will be played with them dictating the tempo, so the focus will be on what Kane brings in possession. It's inventive, but with Guardiola, it's wild enough to work.

Sign Up Now In terms of other Premier League clubs, Liverpool have signed three attackers and are trying to figure out how they fit. Arsenal are ruled out because of Kane's Spurs allegiance, which leaves a possible romantic return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. After getting a taste of his first piece of silverware, though, Kane returning to his old club or moving to Chelsea or Manchester United would be a step down. Elsewhere in Europe, with the lack of funds in Serie A , Kane's next challenge could be tackling LaLiga with Real Madrid or Barcelona . Neither the Catalan giants nor Real Madrid have a pure No. 9 with a physical and aerial presence, besides Robert Lewandowski at Barcelona, whose contract expires in summer 2026. Since Joselu left Real Madrid, Los Blancos have missed the player, as Thibaut Courtois highlighted last season. ""We put in a lot of crosses, but this year we don't have Joselu, a natural striker up front,"" he said after being knocked out of the Champions League by Arsenal. Coach Xabi Alonso has a vast array of talent in attack that he likes to rotate. Adding Kane would give the Spaniard an even bigger selection headache. The Bayern forward isn't accustomed to that, and Lewandowski's expiring contract and Kylian Mbappé 's tremendous form make Barcelona a more attractive option. It's hard to envision Kane combining with Lamine Yamal , Raphinha and Pedri and not being successful, as Barça create plenty but are often wasteful in front of goal. As the starting striker, Kane would be a perfect fit in Barcelona's swaggering attack. A longer stay in Munich? With his current form, ability and profile as one of the world's best players, Kane is a suitable fit for a club that challenges for a league title and the Champions League every season. It's why he says he's open to a new contract with Bayern Munich. ""In terms of staying longer [at Bayern], I could definitely see that,"" he said Oct. 6 . ""I spoke openly a couple of weeks ago that I have not had those conversations with Bayern yet, but if they were to arise I would be willing to talk and have an honest conversation."" Despite being a tantalizing prospect for many clubs, Kane has repeatedly spoken of how happy he is in Germany -- maybe to the point where he himself didn't expect to enjoy it this much. The feeling has always been that he would eventually return to England, but after winning his maiden Bundesliga title, it's clear his focus is on winning as much as possible in Bavaria. With the astonishing way he has adapted to his new role, who's to say he couldn't extend his contract and become a Bayern Munich legend?",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46595771/how-harry-kane-tearing-bundesliga-bayern-munich-england-striker,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1560125_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,bf4c358dee2bb16eab6c9e625564d6a336c320e7
ac1f4beb34ea,Soccer,,"Erik ten Hag is the man who pushed Man United to sign Mason Mount from Chelsea in July 2023. So convinced was the Dutchman of Mount's importance to the way he wanted to play that he still hasn't shaken the belief that the midfielder's unavailability during their time together at Old Trafford was one of the reasons Ten Hag eventually got the sack. Mount was only able to start seven Premier League games in almost 15 months for Ten Hag. The now former United boss still thinks -- nearly a year on -- that things might have been different had he been fit more often. - Premier League big issues: Will Amorim, Ange last? Is Salah fading? - How to fix Man United in 4 steps by copying Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City - Shattering soccer myths: Man Utd, Barca need tactical flexibility Though he's been back in the United XI in recent weeks, Mount's injury problems haven't disappeared entirely since Ruben Amorim's arrival. It's left the former Sporting CP boss in a similar situation to Ten Hag in trying to use the England international as much as possible, while simultaneously trying to reduce the risk of further spells on the sidelines. Even after scoring against Sunderland -- his first goal of the season and his first ever Premier League goal at Old Trafford -- Mount was substituted in the 66th minute. It didn't matter that he was playing well. Rather, it had already been decided that he couldn't play for much longer than an hour. ""He did really well,"" said Amorim afterwards. ""He had a number of minutes because we have to manage when a guy like Mason is returning from injury."" For Amorim, keeping Mount on the pitch for an extra half an hour wasn't worth it with a game against Liverpool at Anfield to come after the international break. It's a potentially tricky start to a four-game run that also includes fixtures against Brighton & Hove Albion , Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur , a stretch that could go a long way to deciding whether Amorim is still in charge at Christmas. Mount was one of the first United players Amorim met at the club's Carrington training ground when he arrived in Manchester to take over from Ten Hag in Nov. 2024. In the middle of another period of injury recovery, Mount was in the gym at the training ground while most of his teammates were either on holiday or international duty. It was the first glimpse of an attitude that Amorim has grown to love. The Portuguese coach has tried to cleanse the dressing room of what he has viewed as negative influences. It resulted in the departures of both Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho . Mount, meanwhile, has been held up as an example of what he wants in his squad. The England star has attended team meetings even when injured in order to give himself the best chance of quickly slotting back into the team. Mason Mount has scored one goal in seven games so far for Manchester United this season. (Photo by Martin Rickett/PA Images via Getty Images) The 26-year-old is often the last player to leave Carrington because of the long ice baths and saunas he takes after training in an effort to stay fit. Rather than jetting off during the international break, he chose to spend the downtime with his family and on the golf course. Mount has also taken it upon himself to help other players understand Amorim's system, having played in a similar tactical set-up under Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea. ""I think I have the experience of playing a similar formation to what he [Amorim] likes,"" he said after his goal against Sunderland. ""I have played it before in the past. So, knowing the roles and what he wants out of the team resonates with me because I've done it before. ""I think at the beginning, especially, it was something that maybe [Amorim] could lean on me [for] because I know the positions."" As well as knowing the system, Mount offers Amorim something different. He was picked to start against Sunderland in place of £62.5 million summer signing Matheus Cunha . It wasn't a straightforward decision. Despite United's problems so far this season, Cunha has been good, but he's a forward rather than a midfielder. For Mount, it's the other way around. With both Cunha and fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo in the team, United have more of an attacking threat. Mount, though, knows how to press effectively, shut down space out of possession and help the two deeper midfielders -- usually Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro -- when United are being overrun. It's a vital ingredient for a system that is up against a three-man midfield most weeks in the Premier League. ""I think Mason Mount can give us more of a midfielder than a winger or a striker,"" said Amorim after beating Sunderland. ""He can defend really well. He is really smart, he can attack really well. It is the characteristics we are going to change when we look at every opponent."" The ""characteristics"" Amorim felt he needed in a pressurized moment against Sunderland will also be needed at Anfield this weekend. ""I see myself as bringing a lot of energy into the team and setting off the press at times, being a bit of a catalyst going forward,"" said Mount, when asked about Amorim's assessment. ""That's always something that I focus on, helping the people around me and really bringing the energy."" Energy is one of the things Amorim has asked of his players, particularly at the beginning of games. Over the course of his 11-month reign, Amorim's team have conceded the first goal in 22 of his 34 Premier League matches, often leaving them in a hole before they've really started playing.

Sign Up Now Amorim has made the point before -- privately to his squad and in news conferences -- that United doesn't deal well with setbacks. It means that the need to be on the front foot right away is even more important. Mount will be asked to be a key part of that against Liverpool on Sunday just like he was against Sunderland, when he capitalized on United's first clear opportunity to score after just eight minutes. A big performance at Anfield would be another nod to Tuchel that Mount deserves an England recall in the months before the World Cup . The pair had a long conversation after Mount impressed against Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season and the prospect of a place on the plane to North America next summer is still there. Tuchel knows all about his qualities after making him a central part of the Chelsea team, which won the UEFA Champions League in 2021. It will be little consolation for Ten Hag, who never saw the best of Mount, but he's finally showing how important he can be for his United successor.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46606213/manchester-united-mason-mount-ruben-amorim-erik-ten-hag-liverpool-premier-league,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560613_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,c845d96d6d49e226c4b6f2b05cac201283bc4923
cd99a3911e16,2026 college football recruiting class rankings: Top 55 schools,,"The college football season rolls on and brings with it many twists and turns. Among the biggest are several prominent coach firings, including at Penn State. The Nittany Lions' 2026 recruiting class remains in the top 25, but after the dismissal of James Franklin, it is one to watch. Programs including Arkansas, UCLA and Oklahoma State have seen their classes fall apart in the wake of coaching changes. With overall success on the field, Missouri is starting to build success on the recruiting trail as well, with multiple commitments in October, including from ESPN 300 OT Johnnie Jones, a onetime UCLA commit. With the latest wave of additions, the Tigers were a big riser in our rankings. Here are our updated 2026 recruiting class rankings, expanded from 50 to 55 this week. (Previous update: Oct. 2) Previous ranking: 1 ESPN 300 commits: 19 Top offensive prospect: OT Keenyi Pepe Top defensive prospect: CB Elbert Hill No program has more 2026 momentum than USC under Lincoln Riley, especially after hiring general manager Chad Bowden away from Notre Dame. The Trojans have double-digit ESPN 300 commits, with several joining the list since January. That includes two five-stars to start May in Pepe and Hill, and a pair of four-star commits who flipped from Big Ten rival Oregon: in-state defensive lineman Tomuhini Topui and quarterback Jonas Williams . Topui is a physical, aggressive defensive tackle who could develop into an interior pass-rushing headache for opposing offenses, and Williams is a true dual-threat signal-caller. USC also made it a point to beef up in the trenches. It pulled four-star defensive tackle Jaimeon Winfield out of Texas, landed in-state defensive end Simote Katoanga and traveled to Utah to snag Corner Canyon offensive lineman Esun Tafa . To further bolster the O-line, the Trojans landed Pepe out of IMG Academy. He is huge at roughly 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds, but is light on his feet as well as physical and can become a standout tackle. On the perimeter, they will not have to wait for in-state defender R.J. Sermons as the ESPN 300 CB reclassified to 2025 and will join the Trojans this fall. For 2026, they pulled Elbert Hill, the top-ranked corner, out of the Midwest. Hill possesses elite speed, having been measured at over 22 mph in game play. Previous ranking: 2 ESPN 300 commits: 18 Top offensive prospect: QB Jared Curtis Top defensive prospect: CB Justice Fitzpatrick The Bulldogs have been a staple among the top three recruiting classes during Kirby Smart's tenure and look to be a contender to do so again in 2026. A big step toward finishing near the top is bringing five-star quarterback Curtis back into the mix. After a decommitment, the Bulldogs were able to fend off other suitors, most notably Oregon, and give themselves a potential impact QB for the future. Curtis might need to adjust to a relatively steep jump in competition level, but he has elite physical tools, including a smooth, quick release and the ability to change arm angles. With three of their top four pass catchers from 2024 having moved on and the fourth likely to leave after this season, Georgia is bringing in new receiving targets with speed. Brady Marchese has been recorded hitting over 22 mph in game play. Kaiden Prothro can give the Bulldogs a matchup nightmare as he possesses an excellent blend of size, speed and body control. After signing two ESPN 300 TEs in their 2025 class, the Dawgs continue to restock there, adding Lincoln Keyes , who with his big frame and good body control can offer a wide catch radius. On defense, the Bulldogs have had 11 first-round NFL draft picks over the past five years and they continue to infuse that unit with top talent, including two of the top DBs in the country in Fitzpatrick and Zechariah Fort . Fort is a safety with good range who can be active in run support. Fitzpatrick is the younger brother of former Alabama great Minkah Fitzpatrick; his blend of size and speed gives him equally promising impact potential. Previous ranking: 3 ESPN 300 commits: 15 Top offensive prospect : RB K.J. Edwards Top defensive prospect : ATH Brandon Arrington Mike Elko has quickly proved he can identify and recruit at a high level. He has worked fertile recruiting grounds outside his home territory, including Georgia, Florida, California. He went out west to land the nation's No. 1-ranked athlete Brandon Arrington, whose speed could allow him to have an impact on either side of the ball, though he projects to corner in College Station. He pulled out Georgia ESPN 300 DLs Jordan Carter and Bryce Perry-Wright as well as landing fellow four-star defensive tackle Jermaine Kinsler out of New Jersey. The Aggies bolstered their rushing attack with a pair of in-state running backs in K.J. Edwards and Jonathan Hatton, who has an excellent blend of size (200 pounds) and speed (he was measured hitting 21 mph on film). Edwards has been very productive in high school, rushing for 1,700 yards in each of his last two seasons. Elko has also been able to unearth talent from more unlikely places, such as quarterback Helaman Casuga out of Utah. Casuga is not a big, physical prospect at roughly 6 feet, but he has a live arm and can get the ball out quickly. Victor Singleton , one of the top prospects in Ohio, was a nice flip from Illinois. He has clocked a 21-mph max speed and has the type of quickness and excellent feet to thrive in man coverage at corner. Previous ranking: 4 ESPN 300 commits: 14 Top offensive prospect: QB Dia Bell Top defensive prospect : DE Richard Wesley As Texas tackles the 2025 season led by one of the most high-profile signings in recent years in quarterback Arch Manning , the Longhorns continue to build for the future, including another five-star QB. Dia Bell brings valuable experience, having faced quality competition during his time in high school. He has shown good accuracy and deep-ball touch, and as a junior threw for more than 2,500 yards and completed 70% of his passes. The Horns also added potential targets in ESPN 300 WRs Chris Stewart and Jermaine Bishop Jr . Stewart brings big-play speed, and Bishop is a quick, fluid target who can create after the catch. Their backfield gained more five-star talent with Derrek Cooper , a versatile running back who blends excellent size and speed and can also be a receiving threat. To protect their new offensive weapons, they have also landed some top in-state OLs, including top-10 OG Nicolas Robertson , a powerful big man with good feet. Texas hit the transfer portal hard to address needs along the defensive line for this season, especially interior DL, but there are young players for that unit in the 2026 class. One-time Oregon commit Richard Wesley was a big add as he is explosive and powerful and could be a versatile and impactful presence in the trenches. Dylan Berymon has been a standout on the camp circuit the past two offseasons and seems to keep rising to whatever challenge is thrown at him. Corey Wells is another 300-pounder who can bend well and be disruptive. Previous ranking: 5 ESPN 300 commits: 18 Top offensive prospect: TE Ian Premer Top defensive prospect : CB Khary Adams Notre Dame started the year off slowly on the recruiting trail but added several key ESPN 300 additions in the spring and summer months, including important defensive additions. Rodney Dunham was one of the first on board and is an edge player with a quick first step. The secondary will benefit from adding some length to that unit. Ayden Pouncey is a rangy safety with a 6-foot-3 frame that could allow him to grow into an outside linebacker role. Khary Adams is one of the top cornerback prospects in the nation as he possesses an excellent blend of size (6-foot-2) and speed (21.3 mph max speed). On offense, ESPN 300 OT Gregory Patrick joined a class that already featured several top offensive line prospects including top-10 tackle Tyler Merrill , who at 6-foot-7 and 335 pounds is a massive presence with physicality and power in the run game. This group collectively can continue the school's strong reputation as an offensive line factory. The Irish also landed Thomas Davis Jr ., whose father is former Panthers star Thomas Davis , and four-star quarterback Noah Grubbs , who already has shown impressive footwork and a sound release from the pocket. Their QB of the future will benefit from multiple targets added in this class, including TE Ian Premer . Among the wide receivers in the group is high-three star Devin Fitzgerald , the son of former NFL great Larry Fitzgerald. Like his father, he is a good-sized target at nearly 6-foot-2 and has shown to be productive, with more than 50 receptions and nine TDs as a junior. Previous ranking: 6 ESPN 300 commits: 12 Top offensive prospect: TE Kendre' Harrison Top defensive prospect: S Jett Washington Dan Lanning's run of sustained excellence in Eugene rolls on with Oregon's 2026 class. Reeling in five-star tight end Kendre' Harrison in November set the tone. The 6-6, 250-pound tight end is a dynamic two-sport athlete with an exceptional catch radius and is a nightmare for opposing defenses in the red zone. The Ducks also added a five-star prospect to their defense with the big-framed and rangy Jett Washington. A fluid safety with good ball skills and the ability to win jump-ball battles, he can also be a physical presence in the secondary. The Ducks added four-star defensive back Xavier Lherisse , who clocked an impressive 1.62 10-yard dash and 4.49 40-yard dash at the Under Armour Miami camp. Four-star running back Tradarian Ball adds explosiveness and excellent ball skills. While the commitment of five-star DE Richard Wesley was short-lived, the Ducks still have a strong defensive line foundation within this class. They secured the top in-state big man in ESPN 300 DT Tony Cumberland , who has good burst and power, and can be a disruptive presence. DE Dutch Horisk will arrive from one of the top programs in California (St. John Bosco), where he has been a multiyear starter who uses his hands well; as a junior, he had nine TFLs and four sacks. Oregon also has bolstered its O-line unit. Leading that group is five-star Immanuel Iheanacho , who is a massive presence at around 6-foot-7, 350 pounds and can push defenders around. The Ducks also pulled a pair of OLs from former conference foe Cal, in ESPN 300 OG Tommy Tofi and Koloi Keli . Previous ranking: 7 ESPN 300 commits: 11 Top offensive prospect: QB Faizon Brandon Top defensive prospect: DE Hezekiak Harris Faizon Brandon, a five-star quarterback, is the headliner here, and rightfully so. He's a strong, accurate passer who fits Tennessee's offense perfectly. His commitment was big initially but seems even more impactful after the Vols' well-publicized split with Nico Iamaleava . In-state four-star receivers Tyreek King (Knoxville Catholic) and Joel Wyatt (Webb School) pair well alongside Brandon. King is a quick, fluid target who has clocked in-game speeds faster than 21 mph. Five-star Tristen Keys , out of Mississippi, was a big flip from SEC foe LSU. He brings excellent ball skills and body control and offers a wide catch radius. Keep an eye on in-state offensive tackle Gabriel Osenda , who is a massive presence (6-7, 330 pounds) for the Vols to develop. Tennessee's in-state success extends to defense with DE Zach Groves . A defender with good quickness and power, he has amassed more than 50 TFLs heading into his senior season. The Vols also bolstered their D-line by landing Dereon Albert out of Mississippi. The 300-pound defender has been a UA Next camp standout two straight years and displays the tools to be a tough, competitive and consistent presence in the trenches. Brayden Rouse, out of Georgia, could contribute at TE but projects to linebacker, where he brings good range and can play well in space and be effective in coverage. Previous rank : 8 ESPN 300 commits : 10 Top offensive prospect: RB Ezavier Crowell Top defensive prospect: S Jireh Edwards It took some time for Alabama's class to find its footing, but an active June brought the Tide into the mix among the top classes in the country. They kept one of the top running backs in the class at home by landing Ezavier Crowell, an aggressive runner who possesses good power and vision. The defense is benefitting from some big pickups, including pulling several ESPN 300 defenders out of Georgia. Xavier Griffin has a lengthy and broad frame to develop and can get up field and bend the edge. From the same high school (Gainesville), the Tide snagged DE Jamarion Matthews , who has a stockier build but can also bend well and get after the quarterback. They also added a pair of top-10 CBs in Jorden Edmonds , also out of the Peach State, and in-state Zyan Gibson , who has posted consistent mid-4.4 40s on the camp circuit. The summer success continues into July as the Tide added five-star Jireh Edwards to their secondary. At roughly 6-foot-2 and more than 200 pounds with excellent testing numbers, Edwards can be a physical and versatile defensive back. Previous ranking: 9 ESPN 300 commits: 13 Top offensive prospect: WR Chris Henry Jr . Top defensive prospect: S Blaine Bradford Ryan Day has the luxury of building his 2026 class around one of the most coveted players in the country: five-star receiver Henry, whose father, the late Chris Henry, was a star receiver for West Virginia and the Cincinnati Bengals. Henry Jr. stands 6-6 and has a combination of length and quickness rarely seen from high school receivers. The rest of the Buckeyes' class has started to take shape around Henry. The team has added a handful of ESPN 300 prospects since March, including Bradford out of Louisiana and linebacker Simeon Caldwell out of Florida. C.J. Sanna is a prospect we like on tape; he is a big, physical linebacker with excellent range and is a bit of an underrated pickup for this talented class. In-state offensive tackle Maxwell Riley is impressive changing direction and finishes plays with the type of nastiness that will endear him to fans in Columbus. Previous ranking : 10 ESPN 300 commits : 14 Top offensive prospect : ATH Davian Groce Top defensive prospect : DE JaReylan McCoy Landing one of the top defenders in the country is the fastest way to climb the recruiting rankings, and that's exactly what Billy Napier did by securing five-star defensive end JaReylan McCoy. Ranked No. 9 overall and the second-best defender in the ESPN 300, McCoy would be Florida's highest-rated defensive signee in more than a decade. The 6-foot-7, 260-pound Mississippi native brings elite length, explosive traits and a relentless motor that was on full display at the Under Armour All-America week in January. Beating out LSU and Texas for McCoy marks a major recruiting win for Napier, and McCoy has the potential to develop into one of the SEC's most feared defensive linemen. A late close helped the Gators rise in the past cycle, but they've ascended much earlier this time around with an active summer. In June they added a pair of dynamic pass catchers in Marquez Daniel and Justin Williams , as well as Georgia running back Carsyn Baker . An early but key pickup was QB Will Griffin , who came on board in June 2024. A big-bodied passer with a strong arm and good accuracy, he could eventually be a nice transition from current QB DJ Lagway. Napier's staff has also bolstered both lines of scrimmage with several high-upside prospects ranked just outside the ESPN 300, adding critical depth as Florida looks to reassert itself in the SEC. Previous ranking: 11 ESPN 300 commits: 12 Top offensive prospect: RB Savion Hiter Top defensive prospect: DE Carter Meadows The Wolverines signed the No. 1 QB for the 2025 cycle in Bryce Underwood and he carries high expectations, but they continue to add talent to the position and landed ESPN 300 signal-caller Brady Smigiel . The onetime Florida State commit is not only an accurate passer, but he also plays with the confidence and swagger that will be needed battling with five-star Underwood. Michigan further bolstered its backfield by landing No. 2 RB Savion Hiter, a runner with a nice blend of size (6 feet, 200 pounds), power and speed who can also catch the ball well. After losing two DLs in the first round of the NFL draft, Michigan added several DLs to this class, including ESPN 300 DEs Titan Davis and McHale Blade . Four-star DE Tariq Boney is a player to keep an eye on. He lacks ideal length but can be a well-rounded technician and a quick contributor. In addition to pulling Boney out of the nation's capital, Michigan also landed Carter Meadows, a rangy edge defender who can bend well. After scoring from off the beaten path with former standout TE Colston Loveland (Idaho), the Wolverines hope to strike big again from that same region with Matt Ludwig out of Montana. He is a versatile player with good ball skills who can be tough after the catch and fights for yards. Previous ranking: 12 ESPN 300 commits: 10 Top offensive prospect: WR Jabari Mack Top defensive prospect: DT Lamar Brown The Tigers are tough to beat for in-state talent, and they built the foundation for one of the top classes in the country with homegrown recruits. A great example of that came when they fended off several top suitors, including Texas A&M, and kept top-ranked prospect Lamar Brown at home. Projected to the defensive line, he is an agile and flexible big man who also could excel, if needed, as an offensive lineman. LSU also added wide receiver Jabari Mack (a strong route runner) and offensive tackle Brysten Martinez , a pair of in-state four-star recruits who bolster a class that now features more than half of the top 10 players from Louisiana. That includes a pair of teammates from Edna Karr High: DT Richard Anderson , a stout presence at more than 300 pounds with good initial quickness, and Aiden Hall , a safety with good length, speed and downhill physicality. Though much of their recruiting success is from within their primary recruiting footprint, the Tigers did go out west to land ESPN 300 CB Havon Finney Jr . A 2027 prospect who reclassified into the 2026 class, he has shown he can be physical in press coverage but also brings excellent speed to be able to run with receivers. Previous ranking : 14 ESPN 300 commits : 12 Top offensive prospect : TE Xavier Tiller Top defensive prospect : LB Izayia Williams Mike Norvell cranked up the heat on Florida State's 2026 recruiting class this summer. Coming off a 2-10 season that led to a staff overhaul, Norvell's fresh start pitch is resonating with prospects. A key in-state win was landing rangy top-five CB Chauncey Kennon out of Booker High School in Sarasota. LB Izayia Williams has bounced around with multiple commitments, including a previous commitment to the Seminoles, but if they can keep him in the mix, their defense will add a player with excellent speed and range. The Seminoles landed multiple four-star commitments in June, headlined by tight end Xavier Tiller, who checks in at No. 84 on the ESPN 300. A former Texas A&M commit, the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Tiller boasts an 80-inch wingspan, fluid movement skills and the toughness to win contested catches. Tiller isn't the only notable pass catcher entering the mix for Florida State. Wide receiver Devin Carter , the son of former Seminoles running back Dexter Carter, is back in the fold after initially flipping to Auburn. He brings explosive short-area quickness and a strong football background. Four-star Florida native Brandon Bennett adds another dynamic option. Norvell also landed a quarterback who could one day get them the ball and tie the class together by flipping Jaden O'Neal , who plays at Mustang High in Oklahoma, from the in-state Sooners. The 6-foot-3 pocket passer ranks No. 166 overall with a good frame, smooth delivery and calm demeanor. If Florida State holds on to O'Neal, he would be the program's highest-rated quarterback signee since 2022. Previous ranking: 13 ESPN 300 commits: 10 Top offensive prospect: OT Jackson Cantwell Top defensive prospect: LB Jordan Campbell Despite a rocky finish to the 2024 season, the Hurricanes are trending in the right direction. They're coming off a 10-win season, former QB Cam Ward was the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft and they've reeled in two consecutive top-15 recruiting classes. Mario Cristobal's 2026 class is working to match or even exceed those groups. The Hurricanes are adding pieces to field a dominant offensive line. They could lose several projected 2025 starters after this season but are adding big men who can step in and project a bright future in the trenches. In addition to landing the top-rated interior OL in the 2025 class, they have added several OLs to their 2026 class, led by No. 1 tackle Jackson Cantwell. Much like current standout OT Francis Mauigoa , who was a five-star himself and a Year 1 starter, Cantwell could step in at one of the tackle spots upon arriving in South Florida. He is a massive presence at roughly 6-7 and 320 pounds and carries his size well. In addition to being powerful, he possesses good quickness and flexibility, and much like Mauigoa is being projected to be a high NFL draft pick. QB Dereon Coleman has room for growth but has a quick release and accuracy. The Hurricanes flipped from Georgia a speedy receiving target out of California in Vance Spafford , who won the fastest-man competition last summer at the UA Future 50 event. Four-star Miami native Jordan Campbell is 6-2, 220 pounds with the versatility to make plays in pursuit and the bend and power that portend a potential impact pass rusher. He's a candidate to take a leap with college coaching. Previous ranking: 16 ESPN 300 commits: 11 Top offensive prospect: OT Leo Delaney Top defensive prospect: S Kentavion Anderson Clemson is coming off a College Football Playoff appearance, but the Tigers are still chasing the heights of their mid-2010s success under Dabo Swinney, and their 2025 class ranked just 37th in the country. Despite some on-field struggles, their 2026 group is looking more promising, especially after a red-hot March in which Swinney landed eight verbals, including five ESPN 300 commits. Much of the talent is currently concentrated on offense. Naeem Burroughs is a burner in the 100-meter dash who can take the top off a defense and has a high football IQ. Fellow receiver Connor Salmin is another big-play threat. With some new offensive weapons, the Tigers are making sure they have the time to get the ball downfield by loading up along the offensive line. Delaney, Carter Scruggs , Grant Wise , Adam Guthrie and Chancellor Barclay give the Tigers multiple ESPN 300 OLs to help reload a senior-heavy unit that is projected to lose multiple starters after 2025. They could one day protect fellow four-star Tait Reynolds , a dual-threat QB out of Arizona who could push to be part of the long-term solution to replace Cade Klubnik . While the foundation of the class is on offense, Anderson is a key in-state pickup on the other side of the ball. With his frame (roughly 6-foot-2, 190 pounds) and range, he can be a versatile back-end defender for the Tigers. Previous ranking: 15 ESPN 300 commits: 8 Top offensive prospect : WR Keeyun Chapman Top defensive prospect : CB Jakob Weatherspoon Unsurprisingly given his ethos, Bill Belichick is building North Carolina's 2026 class from the inside out. Zavion Griffin-Haynes was a key in-state keep. The aggressive, lengthy edge defender can bolster the Heels' defensive front with the tools to be a three-down player. Four-star North Carolina defensive tackle Trashawn Ruffin flipped from Texas A&M, and the 300-pounder has plenty of raw physicality to mold. Ruffin is one of several interior linemen in the class that also includes one-time Oregon commit Viliami Moala , a massive 300-pounder who brings not only jolting power but is light on his feet for his size and can be a handful in the heart of the trenches. The secondary has undergone some changes during this recruiting cycle, but Marcellous Ryan out of California remains and gives UNC a lean but fluid CB to develop. Jakob Weatherspoon out of Ohio was a big flip from Ohio State and is CB with excellent speed. Crew Davis can be a versatile back with the power to run between the tackles, but he also possesses good ball skills. As a junior, he rushed for more than 1,300 yards and also hauled in more than 50 receptions. In an effort to boost their passing attack, the Heels have added several potential big-play pieces. Quarterback commit Travis Burgess had a strong showing at the Elite 11 finals and jumped into the ESPN 300 after spring evaluations. He displayed steady development including improved accuracy and also has excellent mobility to create with his legs as well. In July they added a pair of ESPN 300 WRs in Keeyun Chapman and Carnell Warren , both of whom are big targets (roughly 6-foot-4) who can run well. Having worked with some excellent TEs in his past, Belichick was able to snare a flip from Tennessee in Carson Sneed , an ESPN 300 TE who can also be a productive target as well as aid the ground game as a tenacious blocker. Previous ranking: 18 ESPN 300 commits: 6 Top offensive prospect: OT Kodi Greene Top defensive prospect: DE Derek Colman-Brusa Jedd Fisch did an excellent job bringing in talent at Arizona and is now working to retool Washington's roster and get the Huskies back into the playoff hunt. The Huskies won a key recruiting battle by pulling away Greene, an ESPN 300 OL, from rival Oregon. He is a 300-pounder who moves very well for his size with good quickness and the one-time Washington resident can be a key option in the trenches. The Huskies went east to land their QB in Derek Zammit , a tough, smart player with a smooth, quick release. He should continue to improve with the tools to develop into a productive starter. Washington landed several commitments in the secondary to address that unit. In-state Elijah Durr has good size at roughly 6 feet and is smooth in his movements. He could develop at cornerback or safety. The Huskies also added a pair of four-star DBs in CB Jeron Jones , who has good speed, and Gavin Day out of Las Vegas, an aggressive safety who tallied more than 100 tackles as a junior. Previous ranking: 17 ESPN 300 commits: 5 Top offensive prospect: OT Kevin Brown Top defensive prospect: S Matt Sieg All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The Nittany Lions jumped out to a fast start fueled by strong in-state recruiting but are now in a transitional period after the dismissal of coach James Franklin. They will need to work to try and keep the core of this class together during the coaching change, with several of their top commits being Pennsylvania natives. Included in that group are four-star Harrisburg High School teammates Kevin Brown and Messiah Mickens . Brown is a big, flexible offensive tackle, while Mickens has been a productive prep running back, which bodes well for a  program that must finally replace Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton after 2025. In-state athlete David Davis Jr ., who has clocked a 20.5 mph max speed, has the cover skills to fit into the back end of a defense one day. While most of the early commits are within Penn State's primary recruiting radius, the Nittany Lions also landed strong-armed quarterback Troy Huhn out of California. He's a big body with good feet and brings nice upside. Previous ranking : 19 ESPN 300 commits : 3 Top offensive prospect : TE Brock Harris Top defensive prospect : DE Braxton Lindsey Kalani Sitake's 2026 class has the potential to be program-defining as BYU builds on the momentum of last year's 11-win season, which saw the Cougars climb as high as No. 6 in the College Football Playoff rankings. The Cougars currently hold commitments from two top-100 ESPN 300 standouts -- tight end Brock Harris and quarterback Ryder Lyons -- marking what could be their most highly rated duo of high school signees in the ESPN 300 era dating to 2006). Harris, a 6-foot-7, 240-pound in-state product, has transformed from a jumbo wideout into one of the nation's premier tight ends, adding size while retaining his fluid route-running and wide catch radius. He also brings toughness, having competed at the 2025 Under Armour All-America Game with a cast on his hand. If all goes according to plan, Harris will catch plenty of passes from Lyons, a four-star quarterback who won California's Gatorade Player of the Year award this fall. Lyons' commitment represents a full-circle win for BYU. The Cougars offered him as an eighth grader and held off the likes of USC and Oregon to secure his commitment. Another ESPN 300 prospect, two-way lineman Bott Mulitalo , committed in March and could be tasked with protecting Lyons down the road, adding to what has the makings of a historic haul in Provo. Previous ranking: 23 ESPN 300 commits: 3 Top offensive prospect: QB Bowe Bentley Top defensive prospect: DE Jake Kreul Oklahoma's 2026 recruiting class might be middle of the pack so far in the SEC, but it's anchored by one of the top quarterback prospects in the country. Bowe Bentley , a four-star signal-caller from Celina (Texas) High, gives the Sooners a dynamic player around whom to build. Bentley is a dual-threat passer who pairs impressive production with the kind of arm talent, mobility and leadership -- not to mention a bit of improvisation -- that can shape a class. Bentley is one of several four-stars currently in the group. He's joined by wide receiver Daniel Odom out of St. John Bosco (California). The 6-foot-2, 190-pound target has length, runs polished routes and has deceptive speed off the line. Oklahoma has layered in a slew of signings along the offensive and defensive fronts, including Brian Harris , a 6-3, 280-pounder out of Florida. He's a disruptive interior run defender with an impressive motor. Another key addition out of Florida -- and a big boost to the class overall -- was five-star DE Jake Kreul , who brings an explosive first step, good bend and a relentless motor and should be able to work his way into the mix in Year 1. Previous ranking: 20 ESPN 300 commits: 5 Top offensive prospect: OT Evan Goodwin Top defensive prospect: LB Kenneth Goodwin The Mustangs charged into the CFP last season and are showing signs they plan to be consistent contenders. Capitalizing on the rich talent base in Texas, they have added several in-state prospects, including ESPN 300 back Christian Rhodes . An explosive runner who has been recorded hitting better than 21 mph in game play, he rushed for more than 1,200 yards as a junior. To help clear running lanes, the Mustangs have added several offensive linemen, including Evan Goodwin, a massive presence at 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds, and in-state guard Drew Evers , a thickly built and strong blocker who can latch on and control defenders. High three-star Aljour Miles II is another nice in-state add, as he is a lengthy receiver with good quickness and body control. Another receiving target with big-play potential, Jakai Anderson , was pulled out of Louisiana. Not quite as big a target, he brings a good blend of speed and elusiveness and could also be productive in the return game. On defense, the addition of DE Hudson Woods is a big plus. Woods shows some savvy as a pass rusher, with active hands and good bend. LB Kenneth Goodwin out of California can be a physical player with the ability to rush the passer as well as make plays in coverage. Previous ranking : 21 ESPN 300 commits : 6 Top offensive prospect : OT Darius Gray Top defensive prospect : S J'Zavien Currence South Carolina nearly made the College Football Playoff, and Shane Beamer keeps brightening the Gamecocks' future outlook as well. South Carolina added J'Zavien Currence out of the same high school, South Pointe High School, as former Gamecocks star Jadeveon Clowney . Currence is a versatile defender with his blend of size, versatility and speed. He could stay in the secondary, or if he continues to grow, he could move to linebacker. Also on defense, South Carolina has added several four-star defensive ends, including Keenan Britt . Britt lacks ideal height but has good arm length and initial quickness. He plays with leverage and can be a disruptive presence with his blend of speed and power. On the heels of a deep and talented 2025 cycle receiver haul, the Gamecocks continue to add young talent to that unit, landing in-state ESPN 300 prospect Sequel Patterson . A multi-sport athlete who can play on either side of the ball, he projects to receiver where he can be a productive target as a quick and sharp route runner. ESPN 300 QB Landon Duckworth , a passer with a strong arm, brings high upside with excellent physical tools to develop. Four-star in-state offensive tackle Zyon Guiles is a 6-foot-5, 295-pound mauler with powerful hands and contact explosiveness, which should bode well even if he's asked to move inside. Previous ranking : 22 ESPN 300 commits: 6 Top offensive prospect: RB Damarius Yates Top defensive prospect: CB Dorian Barney The Rebels have relied heavily on the transfer portal, but by no means have turned their back on bringing in young talent. They signed a top-20 class for 2025 as well one of the top 10 newcomer classes for the last cycle. Damarius Yates was a key in-state keep, as he rushed for more than 1,300 yards as a junior for Kemper County and caught 31 passes. He possesses explosive lateral movement with the acceleration to separate from defenders. Corey Barber is a receiver with good speed and can be a vertical threat as well as create plays on jet sweeps. On defense, DEs Landon Barnes and Carmelow Reed both need further development but bring good tools. Barnes is out of one of the top programs in Texas (Duncanville) and uses his hands well and can set the edge. Reed has a big frame and possesses good first-step quickness. The Rebels added to their four-star defensive haul with Dorian Barney, a flip from Michigan who is a fluid and instinctive cover corner. Previous ranking : 24 ESPN 300 commits : 2 Top offensive prospect : OT Felix Ojo Top defensive prospect : S Donovan Webb The Red Raiders have been active in the transfer portal, but Joey McGuire & Co. also remain committed to building their roster through high schools. He pulled off a huge in-state win landing five-star offensive tackle Felix Ojo. It's the second time McGuire has landed an in-state five-star prospect ( Micah Hudson , 2024). Ojo is lean and needs some further development but has elite length, bends well and brings a high ceiling for development. In-state guard Jerald Mays is another nice addition to that unit, as he is a thickly built lineman with good feet. While the hope is Hudson will still break out and meet expectations, Tech is adding to the receiver room in four-star Chase Campbell , a target with good speed and body control who has amassed over 160 receptions with 35 TDs between his sophomore and junior years. In-state safety Donovan Webb can close well and has strong ball skills to finish and generate turnovers. He was position MVP at this spring's UA Dallas camp. Previous ranking: 25 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: ATH Nasir Rankin Top defensive prospect: DE Kayden Bennett Good recruiting starts at home, and an early priority for the Fighting Illini was in-state athlete Rankin. A two-sport star who also excels on the hardwood, the ESPN 300 prospect projects to wide receiver, where he can be a playmaker with good hands and the ability to make defenders miss after the catch. Also from in-state, big man Casey Thomann is one of the top OL prospects in Illinois, and three-star Tony Balanganayi is an interesting big man. He projects to the defensive line, where he has shown he can be disruptive, but with more mass could offer higher upside as an OL. From within the Big Ten footprint, four-star Cam Thomas (Ohio) is a defender with an outstanding first step and could develop into an edge rusher with big upside. Parker Crim brings good arm length, can move well and has shown he can be explosive off the ball. Tony Williams , out of Florida, is a middle linebacker with good instincts and can be a physical presence between the tackles. Previous ranking: 26 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: WR Calvin Russell Top defensive prospect: DE Kamron Wilson The Fran Brown era in Syracuse certainly isn't boring. He led the Orange to just their second 10-win season since 2001 behind Ohio State transfer Kyle McCord , then landed a solid 2025 recruiting class. Now he's pushing for more talent in 2026. They surprised many by beating several top programs, including Michigan, for ESPN 300 WR Calvin Russell, a lengthy but smooth target who plans to also play basketball with the Orange. Four-star defensive end Jarius Rodgers , also out of Florida, is among Brown's biggest gets so far. The 6-5 220-pounder has tremendous length and an impressive track background. He has considerable physical tools and upside if Syracuse's coaching staff can harness it. Wilson is another big pull out of Florida; the edge defender has good initial quickness and tallied 17 sacks in 2024. OT Javeion Cooper has real upside too. He has good size (6-5, 300 pounds) yet plays with impressive balance for someone with his power and contact explosiveness. The Orange also have been active in the mid-Atlantic, landing three receivers from Delaware. Among that group is B.J. Garrett , a big target (6-3, 191 pounds) with good hands who could develop into a player in the mold of Oronde Gadsden, who had similar measurables coming out in the 2021 class. Previous ranking: 27 ESPN 300 commits: 4 Top offensive prospect: WR Jordan Clay Top defensive prospect: DE Jamarion Carlton Baylor picked up a WR with strong ties to the program in London Smith , whose father was a football and basketball star at Baylor and whose mother was a national champion triple jumper for the Bears. Unsurprisingly, London is a quick, smooth target with good body control. Another key add at WR is Jordan Clay, a nice-sized target at close to 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds who also possesses very good body control. Further capitalizing on in-state talent, Baylor landed ESPN 300 DE Jamarion Carlton and ESPN 300 CB Jamarion Vincent , who possesses coveted size at roughly 6-2 and blends that with good speed and smooth movements. Previous ranking: 28 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: QB Briggs Cherry Top offensive prospect: S Jaydin Broadnax Jeff Brohm has raised Louisville's floor with a 19-8 record and an appearance in the ACC championship game two years ago. His 2026 class has the players to keep the program moving in the right direction. ESPN 300 defensive back Jaydin Broadnax, out of Florida, is the biggest get so far. At nearly 6-foot-3, he has great length, balance and body control for a corner. LB Karsten Busch is a nice addition from within the state who will help on defense. He possesses good size and the ability to be a physical, downhill presence against the run. Sam Dawson is another in-state defensive add. He is a DT with active, heavy hands and good power who can help stuff the run. QB Briggs Cherry has performed well during in-person evaluations, including winning positional MVP during the UA New Orleans camp in March. The strong-armed passer has risen in the rankings, proving to be a key January pickup. Previous ranking: 29 ESPN 300 commits: 3 Top offensive prospect: ATH Ryelan Morris Top defensive prospect: S Lasiah Jackson The Cardinal are working to bounce back from a 3-9 campaign and their 2026 class is showing the tools to make future improvements. A key pickup was ESPN 300 athlete Ryelan Morris, a flip from Baylor. At 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds, he is versatile in how he could be utilized within their offense. He is quick with good hands and best projects as a slot receiver, where he can be dangerous after the catch. They beat out programs like Alabama and Florida State for ESPN 300 DB Lasiah Jackson out of Georgia, a defender with good length and range. Having had a reputation for fielding excellent OLs not long ago, they are looking to rebuild that unit into a strength with several big men committed. Jalayne Miller , out of Arizona, possesses good feet and flexibility, and Blaise Thomassie could be a sleeper add. He performed very well at a loaded UA New Orleans camp between his junior and senior years. He possesses good body quickness, is very good with his hands and could develop at OG or center. Previous ranking: 30 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: WR Dyzier Carter Top defensive prospect: ATH Chris Hewitt Jr . The Scarlet Knights have added some top talent to their wide receiver room with Dyzier Carter and Elias Coke , who are longtime commits, having joined the class before the 2024 season started. Carter is a good route runner with strong hands and could be a quick contributor. Coke is a nice target at roughly 6-foot-2. On defense, Joey Kopec is a two-way player in high school, contributing at RB and LB. He has good range and is effective dropping into coverage. Part of a big June haul, Rinaldo Callaway , out of Georgia, is an interesting addition to keep an eye on. A rangy edge defender, he is raw and needs development but shows a nice ceiling for development and could grow into a disruptive pass rusher. Athlete Chris Hewitt projects to the secondary. Always active in Florida, the Scarlet Knights landed Reece Beck , a DE with good physical tools, frame, reach and active hands. He can be tough against the run and productive as a pass rusher. They will not need to wait for edge defender Wydeek Collier , a big riser in the 2026 rankings after the spring evaluation period, who reclassified and joined Rutgers' 2025 class. Previous ranking: 31 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: WR Kortez Rupert Top defensive prospect: DT Cameron McHaney Curt Cignetti proved in his first year at Indiana that his program-building skills translate to the Power 4. Now he's establishing a foundation for sustained success by assembling one of the program's most promising defensive recruiting classes in recent memory. The Hoosiers have put particular emphasis on the defensive line. Four-star tackle Cameron McHaney, a thickly built interior lineman from IMG Academy, shows initial quickness off the snap and plays with violence and disruption. He projects as a pocket-pusher who can anchor or attack in multiple fronts. Joining him are a pair of four-star defensive ends: Gabe Hill and Kevontay Hugan . Hill, at 6-foot-2 and 240 pounds, pairs an explosive first step with strong hands and a relentless motor. Hugan, another high-upside edge rusher, rounds out a talented group of trench commits. On offense, a top commit is wide receiver Kortez Rupert, a 5-foot-11, 155-pound speedster from East Saint Louis High, the same program that produced Luther Burden . Rupert isn't the same caliber of prospect, but he shows impressive burst off the line and could grow into a dangerous slot threat. Previous ranking: 33 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: OG Marek Jin Top defensive prospect: DE Mason Leak Bill O'Brien has injected new life into Boston College, in part by returning the program to its local roots. That has continued so far in 2026, with nearly half of its commits hailing from Massachusetts, Connecticut or New York. One of those prospects is Mason Leak, who is an interesting addition that will likely need developmental time but flashes very good raw tools and could be a breakout player. The Eagles added two promising QBs this cycle as well in Femi Babalola and D.J. Bordeaux . The former has a rangy frame, tested well in offseason camp and possesses a strong, accurate arm. The latter has a smooth release and moves well. At the program's height, BC built a reputation for developing NFL-caliber talent, particularly along the offensive line and on defense, and the Eagles are working hard to get back to that level. An early commit from in-state is OT Brady Bekkenhuis , who is a tenacious blocker with upside. Four-star Marek Jin is a flexible OL prospect who plays with good leverage, and with continued development and focus, Jin could be a key contributor in the trenches. Previous ranking: 34 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: OT Andrew Trout Top defensive prospect: CB Justin Hopkins The Gophers are not a class that will be heavy with ESPN 300 commits, but they're assembling a strong class anchored by a plethora of high three-star prospects. CBs Justin Hopkins and Chance Payne are good examples, as is edge defender Aaden Aytch . A prospect with a lean build, Aytch needs to continue to develop, but he brings a high ceiling as he has good length, displays wiry strength, can redirect well and be a factor in pursuit. Beefing up the offensive line, they have several commits, led by Andrew Trout, the No. 1 player in the state and an ESPN 300 OT. Another key in-state keep was Roman Voss , who was also pursued by Alabama. Listed as an athlete, he has experience as a QB, but projects to TE and can be a versatile weapon for the Minnesota offense. Previous ranking: 35 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: ATH Damon Ferguson Top defensive prospect: OLB Reston Lehman Pat Narduzzi and Pittsburgh haven't secured multiple ESPN 300 commits in one class since 2021. If things hold, that's set to change in 2026. The Panthers landed commitments from a pair of four-stars: outside linebacker Reston Lehman, out of Pennsylvania, and athlete Damon Ferguson. Lehman has solid size at 6-foot-3, 230 pounds and has the versatility to get after quarterbacks off the edge but also drop into coverage. He's comfortable tracking the quarterback as a pass rusher and has already begun to show the makings of multiple pass-rush moves. He's one of several intriguing linebacker additions, alongside three-star outside linebacker Isaiah Simmons and three-star inside linebacker Desmond Johnson out of Miami. Pitt hasn't produced a 1,000-yard rusher since Israel Abanikanda in 2022. Ferguson certainly has the raw tools to change that. The Maryland native is a quick runner who can change direction without skipping a beat and runs low to the ground. His suddenness and speed make him an attractive option in the pass game too and could even translate to work in the defensive secondary if needed. Previous ranking: 36 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: OT Kaden Snyder Top defensive prospect: S J.J. Dunnigan Lance Leipold is no stranger to building a program and is working to fortify Kansas' 2026 class. At 6-foot-3, 190 pounds, in-state defensive back J.J. Dunnigan has the length to reroute receivers off the line and the straight-line speed to hang with them on vertical routes. The Jayhawks have a few offensive linemen committed, led by 6-foot-5 Kansas native Kaden Snyder, who has an enticing combination of athleticism, pass-protection skills and upside if he can continue to fill out his frame. The Jalon Daniels era enters its sixth and final season in 2025. In-state three-star commit Jaylen Mason is an intriguing developmental option at QB. Kansas also added RB Kaydin ""KD"" Jones for its backfield. The one-time Oklahoma State commit has good vision and has proven to be productive with three straight 1,000-plus-yard seasons heading into 2025. Previous ranking: 38 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: QB Oscar Rios Top defensive prospect: DE Prince Williams Arizona's program has oscillated between incredible highs, winning 10 games two seasons ago and sending Tetairoa McMillan to the NFL, and painful lows, with a four-win campaign in Brent Brennan's first season. One of the few constants amid plenty of program upheaval has been quarterback Noah Fifita , who is sixth in program history in passing yards (5,955) and seventh in touchdowns (44). Arizona's 2026 class could have Fifita's successor. The Wildcats landed a commitment from four-star California native Oscar Rios in late June. An ESPN 300 QB, Rios has developed from a tall, lanky underclassman into a strong-armed, confident passer capable of driving the ball vertically while winning over teammates and coaches with his competitive demeanor. Landing Rios was a big win, and Arizona continued the momentum in early July, landing a commitment from fellow four-star Prince Williams. The Bishop Gorman defensive end stands 6-foot-2, 255 pounds and doesn't back down from larger offensive tackles, nor does he cede reps in camp settings. He has the type of competitive nature and versatility a defensive line room can rally around. That duo forms an impressive foundation for Arizona to continue building out its 2026 class. Previous ranking: 39 ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: QB Keisean Henderson Top defensive prospect: CB Paris Melvin Jr . It has been nearly a decade since Houston got a five-star high school recruit to campus when it reeled in future NFL defensive tackle Ed Oliver . That will change in 2026 if Houston and coach Willie Fritz hang onto Keisean Henderson , the nation's top dual-threat quarterback prospect. The 6-foot-3, 185-pounder is an exceptional athlete -- so much so that some evaluators wondered whether he'll ultimately be better served at a different position. But Fritz has remained steadfast that the Cougars envision Henderson as a signal-caller, and he has a strong recent track record of production at the position, having coached Darian Mensah at Tulane. They'll need to continue to develop Henderson's game, but there's no denying he has got a dizzying array of physical gifts, arm talent and game-changing mobility. That was on display when he kicked off his senior season with a seven-TD performance, including six through the air. Henderson is the headliner, but he's not the only ranked recruit in Houston's class. Jayden Warren is a 6-foot-2, 185-pound target who committed to the Cougars in mid-July. He has excellent speed and can take the top off a defense as a vertical threat. Previous ranking: NR ESPN 300 commits: 2 Top offensive prospect: OT Johnnie Jones Top defensive prospect: LB J.J. Bush Missouri has leveled up over the past three years under Eli Drinkwitz and has a shot to win at least 10 games for the third consecutive season. While the Tigers' 2026 class has come together a little later than many other power-conference programs, this class has surged during the fall and built a solid foundation, including a pair of ESPN 300 offensive linemen in Johnnie Jones and Brandon Anderson . At 6-foot-6, Jones has all the physical markers of a Power 4 offensive tackle. Anderson's 340-pound frame is better suited for the interior, where he's strong at the point of attack, loves to climb to the second level and has enough foot quickness to anchor down in pass protection. The Tigers have also added a pair of four-stars at skill positions. Florida native Jabari Brady is a 6-2 wide receiver with a massive catch radius thanks to his 81-inch wingspan. Drinkwitz also picked up a commitment in early October from running back Terry Hodges , who has been recorded hitting up to 21 mph on tape. Previous ranking: 37 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: RB Victor Santino Top defensive prospect: DE Camron Brooks In Justin Wilcox's eight seasons, Cal has been steady, albeit unspectacular, never losing more than eight games but never winning more than eight. If the Golden Bears' 2026 class is any indication, their coaching staff certainly isn't leaving any stone unturned in their pursuit to raise the ceiling of the program. Their lone ESPN 300 recruit, defensive end Camron Brooks, hails from Georgia and picked Cal after taking visits to Clemson, Florida State and Ohio State. At 6-foot-3, 230 pounds, Brooks has excellent length and initial burst. He's one of two players from Thomas County Central High School who have committed to Cal in the class, joining interior lineman Artem Korchagin . Cal also dipped into Hawai'i to land four prospects: tight end Taimane Purcell , offensive guard Kamo'i Huihui-White , quarterback Nainoa Lopes and offensive tackle Esaiah Wong . The Bears even tapped into the NFL Academy's European program, landing tight end Luca Wolf out of London, who stands an impressive 6-foot-6, 240 pounds. The class could gel around in-state quarterback Brady Palmer , a three-star pocket passer out of San Diego. He's a poised, accurate passer who has enough athleticism to extend plays and has been a frequent competitor on the camp circuit. Previous ranking: 32 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: QB Kayd Coffman Top defensive prospect: DE Fameitau Siale Under Jonathan Smith, Michigan State is looking to recapture its status among the Big Ten's upper-tier programs, which has become harder over the past few years. Having an in-state, homegrown signal-caller to shepherd in a new era would certainly inject more enthusiasm into the program. Enter Kayd Coffman, a 6-foot-2, 195-pounder out of East Kentwood High School in Michigan and an ESPN 300 prospect. Coffman has a quick, snappy release with the footwork and mobility to develop into a dynamic passer on the run. Among several pass-catchers already pledged in Michigan State's class who could be future targets for Coffman are three-stars Samson Gash and Zachary Washington . Going back to his Pacific Northwest ties, Smith pulled out of Washington DE Fameitau Siale , who has good explosiveness and power. Previous ranking: 40 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: OG Vincent Johnson Jr . Top defensive prospect: DE Jesse Ford After a step back in 2024, TCU is clearly prioritizing reinforcements along its front in 2026 as it tries to get back to College Football Playoff contention under Sonny Dykes. An early foundation was set with in-state defensive linemen, and they come in different shapes and sizes. ESPN 300 defensive end Jesse Ford leads that group. He has been a productive, disruptive presence at 6-5 and 230 pounds with an impressive first step and room to keep packing weight onto his frame. In-state DTs Maddox Flynt and Duncan McGhee are strong three-star additions as both show they can be active with their hands and have good strength. On offense, QB Jack Daulton completed 73% of his passes as a junior and on film shows he can be an effective runner. The Horned Frogs have also added several players to their O-line, led by top-30 OG Vincent Jackson Jr., to help protect their quarterback and power their run game. Previous ranking: 47 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: QB Jake Fette Top defensive prospect: DE Julian Hugo Kenny Dillingham deftly pulled all roster-building levers available to him as he restored the Sun Devils to national relevancy. They have an interesting 2026 class that includes an ESPN 300 QB. Four-star Texas native Jake Fette is a dual-threat playmaker with excellent short-area quickness and a smooth, consistent release. Arizona State has already landed a pair of tight ends alongside him, including Hayden Vercher , who could be a weapon at the position as he possesses excellent ball skills and is a good route runner with more than 1,000 yards receiving in 2024. On defense, Julian Hugo was a nice pull out of Texas as he is an explosive defender with active hands and posted double-digit sacks as a junior. Previous ranking: 44 ESPN 300 commits: 6 Top offensive prospect: QB Peyton Falzone Top defensive prospect: S Bralan Womack Though other teams have more total commits at this stage and this class has undergone some change, Hugh Freeze has done a good job attracting premium talent to the Plains as he continues to rebuild the Tigers. Although they have lost some defensive front-seven commits during the process, Jaquez Wilkes remains on board and gives them a versatile LB who has posted impressive stats. The in-state athlete heading into his senior season has rushed for more than 3,000 yards and posted back-to-back 100-tackle seasons. Freeze was able to bring LB Shadarius Toodle back into the mix after flipping him back from SEC rival Georgia, and he scored a key recruiting win by landing top-five safety Bralan Womack, beating out conference rivals Florida and Texas A&M. An intriguing add is Nikau Hepi , a huge OL prospect out of the Asia-Pacific NFL Academy in Australia. Although his skills are raw, he bends well and shows tremendous upside. The Tigers have been utilizing the portal at QB but bring in one to develop in Peyton Falzone, who looks like a nice fit for Freeze's offense as he can be a mobile threat as well as a productive passer. Previous ranking: 41 ESPN 300 commits: 0 Top offensive prospect: RB Jett Walker Top defensive prospect: CB Vincent Smith In the golden days of his first stint at West Virginia, Rich Rodriguez turned overlooked three-stars such as Pat White and Steve Slaton into fantastic scheme fits. He's once again assembling a class that might lack star power but has plenty of depth, particularly at running back. The Mountaineers have picked up commitments from Texas native Jett Walker, who has been up to 21.2 mph on tape at 6-1, 210 pounds, and similarly graded Tennessee native Christopher Talley , plus a mid-July commitment from SirPaul Cheeks , who has the explosive lateral agility and ball skills to develop into an all-purpose threat. The secondary is also a strength. West Virginia's top-ranked pledge is corner Vincent Smith, who brings a strong 6-foot-2, 200-pound frame and impressed on the camp circuit with physicality and surprising quickness. The Mountaineers might still seek another quarterback, but the class's X factor could be athlete Jyron Hughley . The Florida native has work to do as a passer, but his mobility could intrigue Rodriguez in a hybrid role. Previous ranking: 42 ESPN 300 commits: 0 Top offensive prospect: WR Zayion Cotton Top defensive prospect: DT Kaleb Morris Jeff Lebby faces a daunting SEC rebuild as he tries to reboot Mississippi State. The Bulldogs haven't landed many blue-chippers -- the top 10 in-state recruits are committed elsewhere -- but they are steadily adding talent and producing more encouraging results on the field, such as a home win over Arizona State earlier this season. The 2026 class is shaping up to strike a similar note: It isn't flush with high-end talent, but there's depth here. Among the top commits are several receivers, headlined by 6-foot-5, 215-pound Zayion Cotton, a versatile target who runs a full route tree and remains a vertical threat with strength, speed and high-point ability. Those receivers could one day battle for targets from three-star quarterback Brodie McWhorter , who boasts commanding arm talent. On the other side of the ball, Kaleb Morris can offer some versatility to the defensive front, possesses a good initial burst and flashes good power. Previous ranking: 43 ESPN 300 commits: 0 Top offensive prospect: WR Rhys Dorsey Top defensive prospect: S Amari Jones South Florida and Alex Golesh aren't sneaking up on anyone now that they've emerged as arguably the most dangerous Group of 5 team in the country. This class shouldn't either. Even without any ESPN 300 prospects, it has plenty of emerging talent. Amari Jones, an IMG Academy product, is the headliner as a 6-foot, 165-pound defensive back with a strong track record against elite competition. Rhys Dorsey is undersized at 5-11, 175 pounds, but the Alabama native wreaks havoc from the slot with his change-of-direction skills, instincts and top-end speed. The class also bolsters the second level with Dennis King III , a twitchy linebacker who can play inside or outside, plus edge projects Latrell Sellers and Ellis Alloway . Golesh also secured in-state quarterback Rhys Brush (6-2, 185 pounds), who has a quick, accurate release and underrated athleticism after posting one of the better vertical leaps of any pocket passer in the class, but he'll need to get stronger. Previous ranking: 45 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: WR Denairius Gray Top defensive prospect: S Jordan Crutchfield This isn't the deepest class on paper, but Kentucky has landed quality talent, including four four-stars. Denairius Gray is the headliner after just sneaking onto the last ESPN 300 update. Previously committed to Auburn for 18 months, the 6-foot-1 Chaminade-Madonna product brings length, athleticism and big-game experience. Perhaps the most interesting addition is quarterback Matt Ponatoski . The one-time Missouri commit is Ohio's reigning Gatorade Player of the Year in both football and baseball, and has been on a steady ascent over the past year. He's a crafty, savvy passer with a low-slot release and enough mobility to extend plays. Kentucky fans will need to keep an eye on Ponatoski's baseball exploits this spring, as he has legitimate first-round upside on the diamond, which could impact his chances of getting to campus. Previous ranking: 46 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: OG Sean Stover Top defensive prospect: DE Dane Bathurst Manny Diaz has Duke trending up. After signing two ESPN 300 prospects in 2025 -- the first time that's happened since 2017 -- the Blue Devils are off to another strong start. Their top 2026 pledge is Sean Stover, a 6-3, 280-pound mauler on the interior offensive line who loves to finish plays at the second level but also shows pass-protection technique and room for added strength. On the defensive side, Blue Devils fans could quickly fall for Dane Bathurst at defensive end. He's a high-energy player with impressive leadership skills who has the physical traits to develop into a versatile, impactful edge defender. It's also possible Duke landed an eventual replacement for QB Darian Mensah in Terry Walker III . An Elite 11 finalist, Walker shows developmental traits and throws a pretty deep ball, though his senior season was cut short by a torn ACL and he'll need time to develop more efficiency in college. Previous ranking: NR ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: WR Jayden Petit Top defensive prospect: DE Yahya Gaad The Badgers have shown they can use a boost to their offensive power and their 2026 class has some early sizzle on that side of the ball. Jayden Petit out of Florida, their lone ESPN 300 commit, pledged to Wisconsin after visiting Oklahoma, North Carolina and Miami. It's easy to dream of how he could use his 6-foot-4 frame to high-point the ball as a vertical threat to open up the Badgers' offense. Petit is one of several four-star prospects in Wisconsin's class. Georgia running back Amari Latimer is set to follow his brother, starting nickel Geimere Latimer , to campus. Washington athlete Jack Sievers has a 6-4 frame and the basketball background and athletic tools teams covet out of tight ends, though he has also shown some chops as an edge rusher if the Badgers shift him to defense. The success of Wisconsin's class could hinge on four-star quarterback Ryan Hopkins . He has plenty of big-game experience at Mater Dei (California) with impressive athleticism, a nice throwing stroke and plenty of velocity. Previous ranking: 48 ESPN 300 commits: 0 Top offensive prospect: QB Michael Mitchell Jr Top defensive prospect: S Bradley Brown Vanderbilt is off to its best start in nearly two decades. Veteran quarterback Diego Pavia is at the center of the Commodores' turnaround, and he relies on a cast of experienced playmakers, including senior tight end Eli Stowers . Their 2026 class is filled with depth to help replenish those key positions as the roster turns over, including at quarterback, where Vanderbilt went across the country for dual-threat QB Michael Mitchell Jr. out of San Francisco. The 5-foot-10 Mitchell is a two-time MVP of the Under Armour Utah camp with impressive arm strength and improvisational ability despite his size. He'll have talent around him, including in-state receiver Keeyshawn Tabuteau (he has been up to 21.6 mph on film) and running back Evan Hampton , who flipped from Louisville in July. He can get up to speed quickly and enjoys running through contact. Vanderbilt also added South Carolina product Tilden Riley , a 6-5 wideout who projects to tight end and could eventually replace Stowers with his size and red zone ability. He has real pass-catching upside. Previous ranking: 49 ESPN 300 commits: 0 Top offensive prospect: OT Courtney Heard Top defensive prospect: CB Jaedyn Terry Those who know Brent Key likely aren't surprised to see that his 2026 class, so far at least, isn't particularly flashy but has plenty of depth, especially along the offensive and defensive lines. But he also landed a commitment from Jaedyn Terry, a corner who has excellent length at 6-foot-3 and the athleticism to flip his hips and run with receivers on the boundary. A high three-star, Terry has plenty of upside in the right development environment. The Yellow Jackets' class also includes a pair of twins along the offensive line: 6-6 Georgia natives Courtney and Courtlin Heard . Courtney profiles best at tackle, where he's a physical, aggressive bookend with elite size and impressive change-of-direction skills. Expect him to become more powerful as he matures. There's a chance Courtlin could line up alongside his twin brother at guard. He's a bit bigger, checking in near 330 pounds, and he's a mauling type of interior lineman who is a headache for defensive linemen to shake once he latches on. If he can develop his body in the right way, he could one day anchor the interior of an offensive line. Previous ranking: 50 ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: OT Kelvin Obot Top defensive prospect: LB LaGary Mitchell The best programs know how to identify talent that accentuates their player development strengths. So when Utah targets offensive linemen, pay attention. In 2023, the Utes landed a pair of four-star ESPN 300 offensive linemen in Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu , who now bookend their starting offensive line. Their top target so far in 2026 is Kelvin Obot, another ESPN 300 tackle. The 6-foot-5, 270-pounder from Idaho is an aggressive, athletic tackle who should have enough quickness, change-of-direction skills and technique to hold up at the position, especially if he adds more mass to a frame that has room for it. Obot is one of two Idaho natives at the top of the Utes' class. The other is LaGary Mitchell, a 6-3, 210-pounder who's like a ball of clay for Utah's defensive coaching staff to mold at linebacker. He might not have the most refined technique in the class, but his dynamism and competitiveness often covered up any deficiencies in high school, and he could take quite a leap with more seasoning. Utah also added a pair of in-state pass catchers in Jaron and Kennan Pula , identical twins who flipped their commitment from UCLA over the summer. Previous ranking: NR ESPN 300 commits: 1 Top offensive prospect: QB Miles Teodecki Top defensive prospect: DE Tucker Ashford The Wildcats will need to continue to hit on several under-the-radar types in this class to help build upon and perhaps reshape their identity in 2026 and beyond. Tucker Ashford is a good start. The 6-foot-3, 245-pounder is one of two four-stars in the class. The Fort Worth, Texas, native has impressive tools -- he's athletic enough to play tight end and even Wildcat quarterback -- with the size, play strength and range that should translate well to Saturdays. Miles Teodecki, another Texas native, is the other four-star. The quarterback had interest from Ivy League schools before an impressive evolution over the last season as a productive prep star who is willing to push the ball down the field from a lower arm slot. He's not nearly the runner that Avery Johnson is, but Kansas State's class may have the foundation of an offensive line built to protect him. The Wildcats currently have several three-star pledges along the offensive line, led by a pair of Texas tackles in Keegan Collins and Justin Morales . Previous ranking: NR ESPN 300 commits: 0 Top offensive prospect: WR Kymistrii Young Top defensive prospect: DT Jamarcus Whyce The good news for Boilermakers fans is that with Barry Odom beginning to reshape the roster, Purdue appears to be on sturdier footing than it was a year ago. But the Boilermakers will still need to find, develop and retain some under-the-radar talent. Their top prize is defensive tackle Jamarcus Whyce, a 300-pound disruptor with quickness and a relentless motor who uses his excellent hand strength to win one-on-ones frequently. Purdue flipped him from Louisville and he could team up well with three-star defensive end commit Katrell Webb , who has impressive athleticism and has developed from a young OL into a productive and promising power-conference-level DL. QB Corin Berry is one of those less-heralded prospects with the tools to develop. He has a good frame and solid arm strength and accuracy while also possessing good speed and mobility. Previous ranking: NR ESPN 300 commits: 0 Top offensive prospect: RB Dylan McCoy Top defensive prospect: CB Jordyn Best Many of NC State's top commits play defense, including five DBs who can help address a need to bolster the pass defense. Jordyn Best, a 5-foot-11 South Carolina native and the lone four-star player of the group, has exceptional speed. His 10.52 time in the 100-meter dash is one of the best by a corner in the class and he can change direction on a dime. Best is also a willing run defender and has all the physical tools required of a high-level Power 4 corner. NC State also added a pair of Mid-Atlantic linebackers in Koby Sarkodie (Maryland) and Jordan Moreta (New Jersey). In-state three-star quarterback Jacob Smith has been committed to the Wolfpack for more than a year. He's back healthy after tearing his ACL as a junior and has both daring arm talent and a multisport background, as he's also expected to play baseball at NC State.",https://www.espn.com/college-football/recruiting/story/_/id/44574905/2026-college-football-recruiting-class-rankings-top-teams-schools,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0903%2Fr1540625_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,1358e3e51d8be044eab015d98bb53f1608088491

Using our play-by-play data, we're able to identify defensive schemes and where each wide receiver and cornerback lines up on each play. By tracking these WR/CB matchups, including potential shadow situations, we can offer the best projections, rankings, start/sit advice and waiver wire suggestions each week. All of this advice is centered on 12-team PPR leagues with relatively standard scoring and lineup settings (1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 flex, 1 K, 1 D/ST), although I'll often mention ""shallow"" or ""deep"" leagues for some starters. The charts show all players who have been projected for at least 6.0 fantasy points this week, as well as all D/STs. ""Matchup"" is automatically determined using a proprietary metric that factors in raw and volume-adjusted fantasy points allowed to each position by the opposing defense this season . (Editor's note: Projections and rankings will align almost perfectly, but sometimes when a projection is close, a player might be ranked slightly higher or lower because of other factors, including upside or risk. This column is subject to updates during the weekend, although at the very minimum, rankings will be updated on the site and projections will always be updated inside the game leading up to kickoff. ) PIT-CIN | LAR-JAC | NO-CHI | MIA-CLE | NE-TEN | LV-KC PHI-MIN | CAR-NYJ | NYG-DEN | IND-LAC | WAS-DAL | GB-ARI | ATL-SF | TB-DET | HOU-SEA Projected score: Steelers 29, Bengals 17 RANK PLAYER PROJ MATCHUP QB17 17.4 Good QB30 11.9 Average RB12 16.5 Great RB23 13.0 Great RB27 11.4 Average WR9 16.1 Average WR13 15.8 Average WR38 11.0 Average TE24 7.7 Great TE28 7.4 Great DST1 7.8 Great DST25 3.7 Average Lineup locks: Jaylen Warren , Ja'Marr Chase , DK Metcalf Fantasy scoop: Following a slow start to the season, Chase Brown has had a role reduction in recent weeks. During his first four games, Brown played 68% of the offensive snaps and handled 78% of the designed runs. Over the past two games, Brown played 53% of the snaps and handled 59% of the runs, out-snapping only Samaje Perine 64-56 in the span. Brown sits seventh among backs in targets and receptions, but he hasn't cleared 10 carries in a game since Week 2, nor has he scored more than 13.1 fantasy points in a single outing this season. Perhaps Joe Flacco will get Brown rolling in time (Browns RBs were terrific as a whole during Flacco's time in Cleveland), but Brown is no more than an uninspiring flex option this week against a solid Steelers run defense. Shadow Report: DJ Turner II is a good bet to shadow Metcalf this week. Turner has emerged as the Bengals' top corner, having traveled with Travis Hunter (Hunter scored 5.2 fantasy points in the game), Justin Jefferson (12.5), Courtland Sutton (19.1), Jameson Williams (1.9) and Romeo Doubs (10.5). Turner has done a decent job, with six of the top seven WR performances against the Bengals having come from players he didn't shadow. Expectations for Metcalf can be lowered very slightly, whereas Pittsburgh's secondary targets can be upgraded against a defense that has given up the third-most yards, sixth-most TDs (12) and the sixth-highest EPA against the pass. Over/under: 45.9 (eighth highest) Win probability: Steelers 89% (second highest) Projected score: Rams 23, Jaguars 19 RANK PLAYER PROJ MATCHUP QB14 17.1 Good QB24 15.1 Shaky RB9 16.5 Average RB20 13.4 Average WR4 19.3 Good WR19 13.9 Shaky WR46 9.8 Shaky WR57 8.3 Good WR61 7.4 Good WR63 7.1 Shaky TE23 8.3 Average DST4 6.7 Average DST19 4.1 Average Lineup locks: Kyren Williams , Travis Etienne Jr ., Davante Adams , Brian Thomas Jr . Fantasy scoop: One of fantasy's biggest busts through five weeks of the season, Thomas got back on track with an 8-90-1 receiving line on 10 targets against the Seahawks last Sunday. Thomas' 23.0 fantasy points were his most since Week 17 of last season and more than double his previous season high (12.0 in Week 5). Thomas' playing time and target share haven't changed, but his connection with QB Trevor Lawrence has improved dramatically (28% catch rate in Weeks 1-3 to a 74% catch rate during Weeks 4-6). Thomas might not return to his WR1 production level of 2024, but he's back in the WR2 mix, and that includes this week despite a tough matchup against a good Rams defense that has given up the fourth-lowest EPA against the pass.

Johnson totaled 28 targets during the first three games (24% share) but has only nine in three games since (11%), the latter total allowing him 60 yards and zero TDs on seven catches. Johnson has never cleared a 14% target share in a season, so especially with Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau back, he's unlikely to get enough consistent volume to return TE1 fantasy value. Shadow Report: Upgrade Chicago's receivers against a New Orleans pass defense that has given up the 10th-most fantasy points to receivers (third most to the perimeter) as well as the fourth-highest EPA against the pass. Rome Odunze , DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus (who inexplicably has more targets than Moore this season) get the boost over Kool-Aid McKinstry , Alontae Taylor and Quincy Riley .

It was his worst fantasy showing since he produced 10.1 points in his NFL debut. Judkins was limited by game script (41% snap share and 12 carries) but also a nonexistent passing-game role that's becoming more concerning by the week. Judkins' route participation is a lowly 22% on the season and, after getting zero targets Sunday, he has had either zero or one target in three of the past four games. Judkins is running the ball well (4.6 YPC), but his Derrick Henry -like usage in an offense struggling to score touchdowns is going to continue to limit his fantasy output. The good news is that he has an elite Week 7 matchup against a Miami defense that has given up 5.6 yards per carry (second highest) and the most scrimmage yards to RBs this season. Both Rico Dowdle (32.4) and Kimani Vidal (22.8) have produced big fantasy days against Miami over the past two weeks. Judkins is a solid RB2 option this week. Shadow Report: Rasul Douglas figures to shadow Jerry Jeudy . Having quickly emerged as Miami's top corner, Douglas shadowed Garrett Wilson in Week 4 (Wilson scored 20.2 fantasy points) and Tetairoa McMillan in Week 5 (10.2). Miami hasn't faced much pass volume (fourth-fewest WR targets) but has struggled with efficiency (second-highest EPA against the pass), so this is an upgrade for Cleveland's passing game, including Jeudy.

After what we saw in Week 6, it's certainly possible. Tyjae Spears out-snapped Tony Pollard 35 to 25, and though Pollard doubled him up in carries (10 to 5), Spears ran more routes (22 to 12) and was targeted more often (5 to 2). Granted, Pollard is not fully to blame for Tennessee's struggling offense, but even with heavy volume, he hasn't moved the needle much this season, nor has he been a fantasy factor (under 14 fantasy points in all six games). Spears, meanwhile, produced 50 yards on nine touches in Week 6, which was only his second outing of the season. There's some uncertainty here following the team's coaching change from Brian Callahan (fired on Monday) to Mike McCoy, so this is a situation best avoided for now, especially against a Patriots defense that has given up 3.1 yards per carry (second lowest) to RBs. Only one RB ( De'Von Achane in Week 2) has cleared 13.1 fantasy points against New England this season. Over/under: 43 (13th highest) Win probability: Patriots 86% (third highest) Projected score: Chiefs 29, Raiders 17 RANK PLAYER PROJ MATCHUP QB2 22.0 Shaky QB28 13.7 Average RB11 16.4 Average RB29 11.5 Average RB40 7.1 Average WR20 13.7 Average WR24 13.4 Average WR28 12.7 Shaky WR40 10.9 Shaky TE8 10.8 Shaky TE11 10.3 Shaky DST2 7.7 Great DST24 3.5 Poor Lineup locks: Patrick Mahomes , Ashton Jeanty , Rashee Rice , Xavier Worthy , Jakobi Meyers , Travis Kelce Fantasy scoop: Rice is back from suspension, and this week's game marks his first outing since he was injured in Week 4 of last season. Rice has been a fantasy superstar since taking on a substantial role midway through his rookie season in 2023. During that span (nine regular-season games), Rice is averaging 19.5 fantasy PPG. In three full games last season, he handled a massive 36% target share (10.7 per game) and averaged 21.6 PPG (17-plus in all three). It's possible Rice is limited slightly in his return, but especially in the league's pass-heaviest offense, that's not enough to keep him on your bench. Rice and Worthy should both be in lineups against a Raiders defense that has given up the fifth-most fantasy points to receivers. Fantasy scoop: With Brock Bowers still sidelined, Michael Mayer stepped in and paced the Raiders with seven targets last week. Mayer, who played a career-high 91.2% of the snaps, turned the heavy usage into 50 yards and one TD on five receptions. That worked out to a career-high 16.0 fantasy points. Bowers will remain out this week and Mayer's Week 6 usage and production are enough to allow streaming consideration against the Chiefs. Over/under: 46 (sixth highest) Win probability: Chiefs 90% (highest) Projected score: Vikings 23, Eagles 22 RANK PLAYER PROJ MATCHUP QB4 19.8 Poor QB21 16.4 Good RB10 16.1 Average RB19 13.9 Good WR5 18.3 Average WR16 14.9 Poor WR29 12.4 Poor WR34 12.0 Average TE6 11.7 Good TE10 9.5 Poor DST5 6.7 Good DST9 6.2 Average Lineup locks: Jalen Hurts , Saquon Barkley , Justin Jefferson , A.J. Brown , Dallas Goedert Fantasy scoop: Goedert is off to an elite start to the season, and though there's enough here for weekly TE1 consideration, sustainability is a concern. On the plus side, the veteran tight end has already matched a career high with five TDs (all of which have come in his past four games) and has soaked up a team-high 20 targets across his past two outings. On the other hand, Goedert is certainly headed for regression, as his five scores are well above his 2.1 expected TD total (he has one end zone target) and he has cleared 45 yards in one game. Goedert might be headed for a return to earth, but his 23% target share is nothing to sneeze at considering the inconsistency at tight end in fantasy. He's a solid TE1 option against a Vikings defense that has given up the eighth-most catches and three TDs to tight ends. Shadow Report: If Quinyon Mitchell (hamstring) is able to play this week, expect him to travel with Jefferson. Mitchell has traveled in all six games, including matchups with George Pickens (3.5 fantasy points in the game), Hollywood Brown (8.0), Davante Adams (14.6), Emeka Egbuka (20.1) and Courtland Sutton (17.9). He also shadowed Wan'Dale Robinson on Thursday before leaving the game. The Eagles have faced a lot of volume (second-most WR targets faced) but have been effective (58% catch rate is fourth lowest and 7.0 YPT is third lowest against WRs). If Mitchell plays, Jefferson will have a tougher matchup than usual, whereas Jordan Addison can be upgraded against Adoree' Jackson . If Mitchell is out, upgrade Minnesota's perimeter receivers against Jackson and Kelee Ringo . Shadow Report: Downgrade the Eagles receivers against a rested Vikings pass defense that has given up the fewest receptions, yards and fantasy points to the position this season. Minnesota, which has given up the lowest EPA against the pass, will match up ex-Eagle Isaiah Rodgers , Byron Murphy Jr . and Jeff Okudah against A.J. Brown and Jahan Dotson on the boundary, with Murphy and Joshua Metellus handling DeVonta Smith in the slot. Over/under: 44.6 (10th highest) Win probability: Vikings 52% (14th highest) Projected score: Panthers 24, Jets 21 Lineup locks: Breece Hall , Tetairoa McMillan Fantasy scoop: Rico Dowdle is on quite a heater, having become the sixth player since at least 1970 to produce 230 or more scrimmage yards in consecutive games. After exploding for 234 yards and one TD on 26 touches in Week 5, Dowdle produced 239 yards and a score on a career-high 34 touches in a revenge game against his former team (Dallas) on Sunday. Dowdle's elite production cannot be ignored and is likely to lead to a larger role moving forward, but it's worth noting that his big performances came against the defenses that rank last (Dallas) and second to last (Miami) in EPA this season. Chuba Hubbard (out the past two weeks) was signed to a contract extension just under a year ago and was the team's clear lead back during Weeks 1-4. Even if Dowdle is the lead moving forward, a healthy Hubbard will play a sizable role and the opposition will be tougher. Dowdle is best viewed as a RB2/flex option this week if Hubbard returns, but a fringe RB1 if he remains sidelined. Shadow Report: Sauce Gardner is a strong bet to shadow McMillan this week. The Jets' standout corner has already traveled with DK Metcalf (12.3 fantasy points in the game), Mike Evans (13.3), George Pickens (13.7) and Courtland Sutton (2.7) this season, which works out to 10.5 fantasy PPG. Gardner is one of the best in the business and has clearly slowed top receivers, but New York has struggled against the pass overall (third-highest EPA allowed), which has allowed secondary receivers such as Ryan Flournoy , Calvin Austin III and Emeka Egbuka to deliver 14-plus fantasy points each against them. McMillan should be downgraded, whereas Xavier Legette and Jalen Coker (if he returns from injury) are deep league sleepers. Over/under: 44.4 (11th highest) Win probability: Panthers 62% (eighth highest) Projected score: Broncos 23, Giants 18 RANK PLAYER PROJ MATCHUP QB16 16.7 Average QB27 13.8 Poor RB18 14.0 Poor RB22 12.8 Shaky RB37 8.0 Shaky WR25 12.8 Good WR36 11.3 Poor WR55 8.4 Poor WR56 8.3 Good WR62 7.2 Good TE16 9.3 Average TE21 8.5 Poor DST3 7.2 Good DST16 5.0 Shaky Lineup locks: J.K. Dobbins , Cam Skattebo , Courtland Sutton Shadow Report: Downgrade the Giants' passing game against the Broncos' elite pass defense. Denver has surrendered the fourth-fewest yards, a league-low one TD and the second-fewest fantasy points (fourth fewest to the perimeter) to receivers. Pat Surtain II has shadowed the opposing team's top receiver in all six games, but he might play a side this week with Wan'Dale Robinson primarily working inside (74% slot). Shadow Report: There's a decent chance Paulson Adebo will shadow Sutton this week. New York's top corner traveled with Terry McLaurin in Week 1 (McLaurin scored 4.7 fantasy points) and A.J. Brown in Week 6 (14.0). The Giants have given up the third-most fantasy points to receivers this season, but a lot of that is volume based (second-most WR targets faced) and they've been better lately after a slow start. Sutton can be downgraded slightly.

Kimani Vidal was the clear lead back, soaking up 18 carries and four targets on 43 snaps (67%), compared with six carries and one target on 20 snaps (31%) for Hassan Haskins . Vidal ran 21 of a possible 39 routes, compared to only seven routes for Haskins. Vidal, a 2024 sixth-round pick, played very well, converting 21 touches into 139 yards and one TD. He's on the RB2/flex radar for the time being, though his Week 7 ceiling is limited by a Colts defense yet to allow a back to clear 16.5 fantasy points in a game.

After starting slowly with a pair of duds in his first three outings, the Dallas quarterback has reeled off three consecutive top-five fantasy outings. Prescott has thrown for at least three TDs in each of those games and ranks first in pass attempts and completions, and second in passing yards and TDs this season. Prescott's lack of rushing (49 yards on 14 carries this season) remains a roadblock to consistent QB1 production, but he's in a terrific spot this week against a Commanders defense that has given up the sixth-most fantasy points to QBs. In fact, the opposing quarterback has produced 18-plus fantasy points in four straight games against Washington. Shadow Report: We're upgrading Washington's receivers against a Dallas defense that has given up the most fantasy points and touchdowns (12) as well as the highest catch rate (74%) and yards per target (10.1) to receivers this season. Six receivers have scored 17-plus fantasy points against Dallas, and that includes Tetairoa McMillan (17.9) last week. McLaurin and Samuel can be upgraded against the defense giving up the highest EPA to passing games this season. Over/under: 62.1 (highest) Win probability: Commanders 57% (10th highest) Projected score: Packers 26, Cardinals 25 RANK PLAYER PROJ MATCHUP QB9 18.2 Good QB13 17.4 Average RB5 19.2 Average RB35 9.4 Shaky RB38 8.0 Shaky WR30 12.3 Good WR35 11.7 Average WR39 10.9 Average WR59 7.8 Average TE1 15.6 Great TE14 9.3 Good DST8 6.3 Good DST27 3.4 Shaky Lineup locks: Josh Jacobs , Marvin Harrison Jr ., Trey McBride Fantasy scoop: Arizona switched up its running back deployment Sunday, turning to a two-player approach that included Bam Knight (11 carries and two targets on 34 snaps) and Michael Carter (nine carries and four targets on 32 snaps). Had he not been injured, Emari Demercado would've played more of a role, though perhaps not an impactful one, as he got on the field on only three of the first 17 plays before his departure. Neither Knight (54 yards on 12 touches) nor Carter (64 yards on 11 touches) moved the needle much, though Knight did score a touchdown for the second week in a row. Set to face a Green Bay defense that has given up two TDs, the second-fewest yards and the fifth-fewest fantasy points to RBs, this is a backfield best avoided, with Carter and Knight no more than deep league flex options.

Penix has registered a total of four passing TDs in five games this season and remains a nonfactor with his legs (15-37-1 rushing line, with most of that coming in Week 1). Penix's best weekly fantasy finish was 10th (Week 1) and he has finished 20th or lower three times, including on Monday night against the Bills. Penix is best left on waivers.

Regardless of who suits up for Tampa Bay, they'll be in a terrific spot against an injury-plagued Lions defense that is without top corners Terrion Arnold and D.J. Reed . Detroit has given up 10 TDs (second most) and the sixth-most fantasy points to receivers. The likes of Evans (if he plays), Tez Johnson and Sterling Shepard can be upgraded, as can tight end Cade Otton , who has five-plus targets and 10-plus fantasy points in consecutive games and figures to be busier than usual with Tampa Bay so shorthanded on the outside.

When we last saw Houston (Week 5), Woody Marks (seven carries and one target on 25 snaps) and Nick Chubb (11 carries and one target on 23 snaps) worked in a committee, and neither can be trusted against a Seattle defense that has given up a ton to RBs through the air but almost nothing on the ground (371 rushing yards and 3.1 YPC, both league lows). Much to the chagrin of objective onlookers, Kenneth Walker III (10 carries and one target on 18 snaps) was out-snapped by Zach Charbonnet (12 carries and one target on 33 snaps) for the fourth time in five games together last week. Walker (exactly 11 touches in consecutive outings) hasn't cleared 12.0 fantasy points in a game since Week 3, and Charbonnet hasn't cleared 12.4 points in a game this season. Both should be avoided against a Houston defense that hasn't allowed a back to reach 12.0 points since Week 2. Shadow Report: ""Monday Night Football"" will feature a terrific WR/CB matchup between one of the league's best receivers (Smith-Njigba) and one of its top corners ( Derek Stingley Jr .). Smith-Njigba has spent most of his time on the boundary this season (only 22% slot), which means there's a chance, if Houston chooses to shadow, that he'll align against Stingley on roughly three quarters of his routes this week. Stingley is fresh off his bye after he shadowed Davante Adams (Adams scored 7.2 fantasy points), Mike Evans (10.6) and Brian Thomas Jr . (7.5) earlier in the season. Expectations for Smith-Njigba should be lowered against a defense that has given up the lowest catch rate (57%) to WRs as well as a league-low three passing TDs and the second-lowest EPA against the pass.

83ca7285cde5,Fantasy Football,,"We see a lot of flashes during the fantasy football season, right? It could be a seldom-used wide receiver making an impact play or a No. 2 tight end finding the end zone. Low-volume guys, lacking defined roles, but getting into the box score. Without the consistent usage and opportunity, however, it's hard for fantasy managers to buy-in or to give up a valuable roster spot. I get it. But what if we looked a little bit closer, examined the game tape and put together a list of players to put on your fantasy radar? Sure, many of these targets aren't ready to jump into your Week 7 lineup, and most are a better fit for deeper leagues. The point here is to be on alert, especially when injuries start to pile up, because that's when you need an edge on the waiver wire. Below are 10 names to keep an eye on as the season progresses. Theo Johnson (left) and Jaxson Dart have already developed a nice chemistry in the red zone. Logan Bowles/Getty Images Johnson has the big frame (6-foot-6, 266 pounds) to power through contact, plus he has much more alignment versatility than I expected in Brian Daboll's offense. Over his past three games, with Jaxson Dart starting at quarterback, Johnson is averaging 12.2 PPG, catching 11 of 17 targets, including three touchdowns. I think we all can agree Dart's presence gives the Giants more juice on offense. It's there. And with Johnson playing in line, bumping to the slot or even aligning as a backside ""X"" receiver, he can play a role as a matchup piece in the pass game. Johnson's recent numbers and usage (5.3 targets per game) should put him in the mix as a potential waiver pickup in deeper formats. But for managers in shallow leagues, Johnson is simply a name to put on the radar. I don't love the current Browns pass game with Dillon Gabriel at quarterback. A lot of quicks and unders. Get the ball out. And that's reflected in Gabriel's numbers (4.8 YPA, 5.8 AYPA). However, Bond does give the Browns a vertical element, plus he is a sudden mover -- with 4.39 speed -- who can get loose after the catch. And he is getting more run with Cedric Tillman on IR. Bond has seen 14 targets in Gabriel's two starts, catching only four. That needs to improve. But I'll take the usage and volume here, plus Bond has three end zone targets over those two games. If we see more development and growth from Gabriel, with a more aggressive play script, Bond has the traits to produce fantasy numbers as a WR3 in a Browns offense that is devoid of explosive playmakers. Despite limited opportunities, Luther Burden III is second on the team with three receptions of 25-plus yards this season. Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images Burden saw an uptick in volume during the Monday night win over the Commanders, catching four of five targets (both season highs) for 51 yards, which led all Bears wide receivers. Yes, Burden ran only 12 routes, but he was a part of the game script despite seeing limited reps. Burden does have competition for targets in Chicago's wide receiver room with Rome Odunze , DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus . But we also have to look at his catch-and-run skills in an offensive system under coach Ben Johnson that leans on in-breaking routes, plus he can see the ball on screens, too. Get him in space. Moore's groin injury from the Monday night game could open the door for Burden this Sunday against the Saints. So, let's keep an eye on that, because he has upside here in an ascending Bears' offense. With Daniel Jones playing the role of a point guard and ball distributor in coach Shane Steichen's offense, Pierce's value rises as a true vertical target in the route tree. In four games played this season (he missed two due to a concussion), Pierce has two with double-digit fantasy points, and he's averaging 19.9 YPC. Straight-line speed here. Pierce is a better fit for deeper formats that carry a third wide receiver spot in the lineup, and the limited volume (4.3 targets per game) does lower his floor. But with 36.4% of Pierce's receptions going for 20 or more yards, and a reception rate of 64.7%, he gives you some upside as a big-play option. He's a name to keep on the radar when injuries across the league at wide receiver force managers to make a move. Higgins was one of my top late-round targets during the summer months because of the size/traits and the projected fit in the Houston offense. Play as the boundary ""X"" and win in the red zone. Operate as the No. 2/3 opposite of Nico Collins . All of it. However, I'm still waiting on Higgins to break out, which isn't uncommon for rookie wide receivers. It's a different game on Sundays than playing in the Big 12. Can Higgins make that jump soon? In Week 5 against a banged-up Ravens defense, he caught all four of his targets for 32 yards. And in the Week 4 game versus the Titans, Higgins found the end zone for the first time as a pro on a 24-yard grab. Higgins averaged 13.5 routes run over those two games, so we still need to see a bump in usage. And we also need more consistency from the Houston pass game. But with Higgins currently available in more than 75% of ESPN leagues, he has the talent to stay on the radar. Injuries have flipped the Buccaneers' wide receiver room on its head, which has given Tez Johnson a chance to show off his abilities. Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images The Bucs have experienced a barrage of injuries at wide receiver with Mike Evans (hamstring), Chris Godwin Jr . (fibula), Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) an Jalen McMillan (neck) are all working through various ailments. So, we'll need to check the injury reports this week, as Johnson could see a bump in reps for Monday's matchup versus the Lions. Johnson caught only one of three targets in the Week 6 win over the 49ers, but that went for a 45-yard touchdown. Big-time play there. Johnson also brought in all four of his targets for 59 yards in the previous week's victory at Seattle. Remember, with his slight frame (5-foot-10, 154 pounds), Johnson needs to win in space, using his lower-body quicks to set up safeties, or by eluding defenders in the open field. And we've seen him do both in limited action this season. Plus, with the level of play we are seeing from Baker Mayfield right now, you want to roster Tampa pass catchers. The Titans fired head coach Brian Callahan earlier this week, so there is a transition period to work through here with the team. But as this shakes out, don't forget about Helm and his potential in the passing game as a multilevel target for quarterback Cam Ward . Helm has run an average of 18.5 routes over his past two games, catching six of eight targets. Not a ton of volume here, but Helm did see an end zone target in the Week 6 loss to the Raiders, and I like what the tape is telling us. Helm has the coverage awareness to find space as an underneath outlet, plus he can use his foot quickness to slip defenders after the catch. And he has enough play speed to be schemed on wheels or seam routes. Even with the presence of Chig Okonkwo in Tennessee, Helm's role in this offense can continue to climb, which keeps him on the radar as a potential deeper-league pickup this season. Gadsden had his best game as a pro in the Chargers' Week 6 win over the Dolphins, catching seven of eight targets for 68 yards (11.8 points). Now, did the rookie's usage increase due to the absence of injured wide receiver Quentin Johnston ? Maybe. But if we are talking about players to write down in your notes, then Gadsden fits. Gadsden has run at least 20 routes in each of his past three games, and he ran 23 this past Sunday -- with Will Dissly suited up. So, I see Gadsden as an emerging player in this offense, with a big-time catch radius and the ability to create some numbers after the catch. Plus, given how inconsistent the tight end position is in fantasy football, Gadsden could be a smart target for deeper-league managers. There's upside here to monitor. Emanuel Wilson (pictured) would be the next man up if Packers starting running back Josh Jacobs were to miss time. Michael Allio/Icon Sportswire The Packers' current No. 2 running back behind Josh Jacobs , Wilson is an injury away from taking on a much larger role in Matt LaFleur's offense. Wilson had 11.1 points in the Week 4 game versus Dallas, and he showed some good things on the tape: The production on screens, elusiveness, pad level and burst as a runner, too. On Sunday against the Bengals, in a game where Jacobs produced big numbers on 23 touches, Wilson had only three carries and one reception. It's part of the deal as a backup. But I see enough quality traits with Wilson, in an offense where the run game is a foundational piece, to keep an eye out. A motion/movement player in Andy Reid's system, Smith hasn't been utilized as a runner at a high rate (eight carries on the season), but he has caught three passes in each of his past three games. And in Reid's screen package, which is the best in the NFL, Smith will see schemed targets. Yes, the return of No. 1 wide receiver Rashee Rice (suspension) this week does cloud the outlook a bit for Smith and all the Chiefs' pass catchers. But, again, we are talking about players who can be on our radar, and Smith qualifies for that. He is one play away from seeing more carries if Isiah Pacheco or Kareem Hunt were to miss time with an injury (and neither has been very effective this season). Plus, Smith is a rapid accelerator with pass-catching skills. And Reid loves to feature players with versatile skill sets in the red zone. Let's keep an eye on Smith.",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/46603300/fantasy-football-pickups-stash-bench,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560623_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,943a0418fd018866752b7130da514f55907e3596

Ian Parker Oct 16, 2025, 07:58 AM ET On one of the hottest streaks in the UFC, Reinier de Ridder (21-2) is back in action for the fourth time this year at UFC Fight Night in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Saturday (7 p.m. ET on ESPN+, prelims at 4 p.m.). His opponent, Brendan Allen (25-7), is stepping in on short notice after Anthony ""Fluffy"" Hernandez withdrew because of injury last month. De Ridder, ESPN's sixth-ranked middleweight, is undefeated in his four-fight UFC tenure and Allen, No. 10 by ESPN, is also coming off a win. He won a unanimous decision over veteran Marvin Vettori in July. ESPN MMA analysts Din Thomas and Anthony Smith provide their main event predictions, and ESPN betting expert Ian Parker adds insight on the value bets available on the fight card. Middleweight main event Expert Pick Method Din Thomas MMA coach De Ridder Decision Anthony Smith ESPN MMA analyst Allen Decision In order for Allen to win fights, he has to be able to take his opponent down. He's typically the better grappler in every fight he wins. Here, I think De Ridder is probably the better grappler. De Ridder should be able to reverse any position Allen puts him in and end up on top. I'm saying De Ridder by decision, but it wouldn't surprise me if De Ridder got the submission. -- Din Thomas Allen is a better striker than De Ridder, and I think he's the better wrestler. I don't think De Ridder will be able to take him down, so the grappling should be controlled more by Allen. If I end up being wrong on this, I think it will be because Allen sometimes fades under a high pace. When he's pushed really hard, we've seen him fall behind in the later rounds, but I think he has the tools to win this matchup. -- Anthony Smith Betting analysis Odds accurate as of Oct. 16. For the most up-to-date odds, visit ESPN BET. Parker: De Ridder to win (-210). If Allen is able to pull off the upset, he can put himself in the middleweight title picture in 2026. However, I believe a five-round fight favors De Ridder over Allen. De Ridder went five rounds with Robert Whittaker in July and was able to dictate the pace in the final round to get the win. Unless Allen catches De Ridder in Round 1, his gas tank will likely run out as the fight goes on, giving De Ridder the opportunity to take the win. Parker's best bets on the rest of the card play 0:50 Mike Malott gets huge finish in front of hometown crowd Mike Malott wins a crucial bout vs. Adam Fugitt in front of his fellow Canadian fans. Over 1.5 rounds: This should be an incredibly close fight between two well-rounded fighters. Coming off a knockout loss to Daniel Rodriguez in July, I expect fan-favorite Holland to be more defense-minded and less reckless offensively to avoid getting tagged by Malott, who is on a two-fight winning streak. Malott has also been using his wrestling and ground game more recently, which will come in handy here. I think Malott will have success with takedowns and keep Holland on his back for the majority of the fight. If finish happens, I see it coming late in the fight, so take over 1.5 rounds. All of ESPN.

Sign Up Now Zahabi to win (-135): Coming off his win over José Aldo in Montreal in May, Zahabi will be looking to add another seasoned veteran and former title challenger to his résumé. Both Zahabi and Vera are extremely durable, but the difference in their fight will be Zahabi's output and Vera's tendency to start slow. Zahabi also has the ability to take down Vera and keep him there, if he isn't having success on the feet. On top of all of that, Vera has taken a lot of damage in his 15-year professional career. More than likely this fight goes the distance and Zahabi wins by decision. Manon to win by decision: In her first fight since losing her title fight to Valentina Shevchenko in May, Fiorot will be taking on the surging Jasdavicius in Fiorot's home country of Canada. This should be an interesting fight between two talented fighters. Fiorot is a 2-to-1 favorite, and I think it makes sense.

6a4f6f1cce05,Boxing opponents Tyson Fury should consider with his return,,"We have been here a few times before with Tyson Fury , but it looks like the entertaining former heavyweight champion is set to end his retirement -- again -- and could be back in the ring in 2026. ""He's indicated that he wants to fight next year,"" promoter Frank Warren said on his Queensberry Promotions YouTube channel on Oct. 9. Fury (34-2-1, 24 KOs) has not boxed since a second decision loss to undisputed world heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk in December, after which he announced (not for the first time) he was hanging up his gloves. If Fury, 37, does embark on another comeback, who will be his next opponent? Will he go straight into a challenging fight? Will he finally face Anthony Joshua or will he want to ease himself back with an easier assignment? ESPN looks at five contenders for the return of the ""Gypsy King."" The one that should happen: Anthony Joshua Anthony Joshua, left, is coming off a fifth-round KO loss to Daniel Dubois in September 2024 at London's Wembley Stadium. Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing It might not be as big as it once would have been when they shared all the heavyweight world titles between them, but there is still a big demand to see Fury vs. Joshua, especially in the U.K. The English rivals first had serious talks to face each other five years ago, but successive attempts to make the fight have failed to deliver one of the biggest fights available in boxing. Since both are now closer to 40 and nearing the end of their careers, there is a realization that time is running out to make a fortune from sharing a ring together whether a title is on the line or not. ""[Fury's] was one of the most astonishing retirements I've ever seen. We never knew that was going to happen, did we?"" Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn, who has guided Joshua's career since his professional debut in 2013, recently told ESPN. ""I know that if the deal is right he will fight Anthony Joshua. He last fought in December so he's been out of the ring for a year soon. I know that Fury's team are all talking to Turki Alalshikh [chairman of the Saudi Arabia General Entertainment Authority], and I saw an interview with Frank Warren saying he had talked to Tyson Fury and he's coming back."" Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs), a two-time heavyweight world champion, has not fought since getting knocked out in Round 5 by Daniel Dubois in September 2024. An elbow surgery has delayed Joshua, 36, from resuming his career, but he is expected to box again late this year or early 2026. Hearn told ESPN Joshua will have an interim fight before a potential fight with Fury . ""The obvious one is Joshua because everybody wanted to see that fight and [still] wants to see that fight. That's an obvious one,"" Warren said. ""To be blunt, it's all about the money."" Recently, Warren and Hearn have separately held talks about making Joshua vs. Fury with Alalshikh, currently the most powerful figure in global boxing. ""I think Turki Alalshikh is probably the only one who can make the Tyson Fury fight because both guys are going to want a huge amount of money and Turki has a reputation for making the biggest fights in the sport,"" Hearn said. ""And the biggest fight in the sport is Anthony Joshua versus Tyson Fury, no question about it."" The question is whether Fury feels he is ready to go straight into a fight with Joshua next or have an interim fight, which could potentially delay Fury vs. Joshua until the second half of 2026. The one that can happen: Martin Bakole or Fabio Wardley Heavyweight contender Martin Bakole defeated Jared Anderson by fifth-round KO in August 2024. Photo by Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing/Getty Images After over a year out of the ring, Fury may decide he wants a warmup fight. An opponent that brings less threat, but is still a big enough name to be a credible opponent, is Bakole. Bakole, 33, is looking for a big fight and has previously sparred Fury. Bakole (21-2-1, 16 KOs) was clinically dealt with inside two rounds by Joseph Parker in February, although he did step in as a late-notice substitute opponent . Bakole then fought to a draw with Efe Ajagba in May, and has recently been linked to fighting Joshua in Nigeria. If Bakole ends up fighting Joshua, Fury could easily be matched against Fabio Wardley. Both are promoted by Queensberry Promotions, and Wardley (19-0-1, 18 KOs) is outside the elite group whose inexperience could be capitalized on by Fury's smart boxing. But Wardley is dangerous, as he showed when he knocked out the previously unbeaten Justis Huni in June when he was losing the fight. Wardley is scheduled to face Parker on Oct. 25. The one we don't want to see: Oleksandr Usyk Oleksandr Usyk, right, defeated Tyson Fury twice in 2024, the first time by split decision before earning a unanimous decision in the rematch. Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing Fury feels a deep sense of injustice over the outcome of his rematch with Usyk -- a feeling not widely shared by the media. Usyk, 38, is 2-0 over Fury and continued his imperious form in a masterful Round 5 KO win over Dubois in July. It is hard to argue a case for Fury upsetting the odds in a third encounter against the undisputed heavyweight champion, but along with Joshua, this could be the fight Fury wants. Usyk has said his retirement day is close , and he could be tempted by a big money trilogy encounter before he walks away from boxing. But Fury can earn more against Joshua and has a better chance of beating him, which is why that Usyk trilogy fight is unlikely to be next. The most dangerous: Moses Itauma Moses Itauma, right, stopped Dillian Whyte in Round 1 of their heavyweight fight in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in August. Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images Fury is fully aware of how dangerous Itauma is, after the 20-year-old notched his eighth first-round victim in his most recent fight . ""Moses Itauma will wreck all them old men out of the division,"" Fury said on social media in August following Itauma's first-round demolition of Dillian Whyte, who had gone six rounds with Fury for the WBC world title in April 2022 . ""Usyk, [Joshua], [Jarrell] Miller. Whoever there is that's old. [Zhilei] Zhang, whoever else the f--- there is, Luis Ortiz. All these big names of the past. Even the man who took my belts, Usyk, Moses will wreck him because it's a young man versus an old man. And an old man can't mess with a young man."" Itauma (13-0, 11 KOs) is rumored to be fighting on Dec. 13, but it won't be against Fury. The one he won't take: Joseph Parker Joseph Parker, left, is the WBO heavyweight interim titlist, and a friend and trainer partner of Tyson Fury, whom he share  the same trainer in Andy Lee. Photo by Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing via Getty Images Parker, the former WBO champion, is in an excellent position to land a world title shot in 2026, as long as he avoids defeat against Wardley on Oct. 25. Parker (36-3, 24 KOs) holds the WBO interim title, and should he beat Wardley, he will go into 2026 first in the queue to fight Usyk, in what could be Usyk's final fight before retirement. You would think, given Parker's status, he would be the ideal opponent for Fury to make up ground. But Fury and Parker are good friends, and Parker even trains out of Fury's gym in Morecambe, England, and they share the same trainer in Andy Lee. This is one fight that could not happen.",https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/46594383/why-tyson-fury-consider-opponents-boxing-return,Sport,Washington Post,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1560079_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,f296055646ac9d492cc041829dafe8cc12a3e534
e9977da4bb44,Long Covid Is Real — And It’s Changing an Entire Generation,,"I n January 2020, just weeks before the NBA shut down and Costco shelves emptied and Tom Hanks got sick, Joy Corbitt’s only brother died in his mid-forties with symptoms of Covid . Which meant, from the pandemic’s earliest days, Joy was taking no chances. She’d heard that Black and brown people like her seemed to be getting sick and dying at higher rates than other Americans. And that kids were either not getting sick, or getting less sick, or getting sick in ways we didn’t really understand. So, when it came to protecting her then-14-year-old daughter Lia, the North Carolina mother was vigilant. “I was consumed with the news — consumed with the numbers,” Joy says. As one week of lockdown slogged into the next, Lia, a straight-A student, struggled through that chaotic, ever unmuted, camera-off Zoom version of school. Which is to say, she didn’t learn much. With Joy’s husband James, a long-haul trucker, frequently on the road, the mother and daughter did their best to fill the time. They got a crazy Shih Tzu puppy named Zane. They spent long hours playing foosball and air hockey. They watched Netflix and cooking shows and Bridgerton together (yes, even the sex scenes). By the time fall 2020 poked its head onto the horizon, Lia’s high school was set to resume in-person classes. Joy kept her daughter home. She was anxious; it was too soon for students to return. But Lia, a budding theater kid, was eager to get back to her friends, to her life, to try her luck onstage. A couple months into the school year, after Lia scored a role in a production of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe , Joy relented. Lia “just lit up” about theater, her mom recalls. Joy figured, we had to let kids be kids. She took some consolation in the rules mandating universal masking. The masking, of course, didn’t last long. Kids. On an otherwise unremarkable day in January 2021, Lia came home with what she described as a “very minor sore throat.” She isolated, per school policy, counting down the 10 days until she could return. On Lia’s first day back, though, her throat was sore all morning. She threw up at lunch. Joy took her home early. “I was very confused,” Lia says. “I thought, ‘Am I still sick?’” “I thought it would go away,” she adds, “quickly.” It didn’t. Over the next three years, Lia would develop a perplexing, debilitating, and persistent set of symptoms. Extreme fatigue that turned mornings into catatonic nightmares. Brain fog that made memories slippery. Incessant vomiting. It all kept her out of class, stuck in the nurse’s office — or out of school entirely. The straight-A’s evaporated. Lia’s story is one I’ve heard from dozens of families over two years investigating the impact of long Covid on kids. It’s a slow-moving spiral: first their health, then their grades, then their future. And as the country throttles past the pandemic’s fifth anniversary, those for whom Covid looms very present are feeling increasingly forgotten, subject to pervasive skepticism and a kind of cultural fatigue when it comes to their illness. Lia and Joy Corbitt at their dining room table in Davidson, North Carolina. “When you have a disability people can’t see,” Joy says, “you don’t get as much empathy.” Eli Cahan The Make America Healthy Again movement has recently gestured at embracing the long Covid community. In September, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convened two roundtables with the stated purpose of bringing long Covid “out of the shadows,” including by launching a “public awareness and education campaign.” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall — a physician with a loved one suffering from long Covid and who co-led the convenings — says those conversations were the first step to “take this invisible illness seriously.” But since the earliest days of the second Trump administration, the dollars that could help those suffering from the illness have quietly faded away. In March, cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) disappeared the nearly $2 billion invested in the RECOVER (Researching Covid to Enhance Recovery) initiative , hamstringing research that might have yielded diagnostic tests or better treatments. The same week, the administration shuttered the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Long Covid Research and Practice. In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the NIH’s Vaccine Research Center — the entity whose work laid the foundation for the Moderna Covid shot. In May, health officials installed by Trump overrode career scientists at the Food and Drug Administration to limit approvals of new Covid vaccines. Around the same time, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disavowed the vaccine for healthy kids and pregnant women. (“We’re now one step closer to realizing President Trump’s promise to make America healthy again,” Kennedy said in a video announcing the policy.) In the weeks that followed, the secretary also removed every member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with a merry band of loyalists and skeptics. That committee has since walked back recommendations for the Covid shot. And since the committee’s suggestions only move forward with the approval of the CDC director, RFK Jr. fired Susan Monarez, whom he’d appointed to that role 29 days earlier, for her refusal to “commit in advance to approving every [committee] recommendation regardless of the scientific evidence,” as Monarez later testified at a Senate hearing. Then there was Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill, expected to boot tens of millions of Americans, including potentially one in five kids, off Medicaid. Where health insurance goes, vaccine access follows: Uninsured or partially insured children are less likely to get the shot, studies show. And unvaccinated children are up to 20 times more likely to develop long Covid. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment on how the measures taken since March could impact young people with long Covid. But in the leadup to this school year, these developments led experts to warn that Covid cases may start ramping up again. That could have devastating effects in an education system beset by plummeting achievement levels and an epidemic of absenteeism (more than 10 million kids, or nearly one-third of all school-aged children, regularly missed school last year). And for families already affected by long Covid, absence after absence is prompting threats of investigations for truancy that have led to children being removed from school altogether, either by choice or upon the advice of the district. “Millions of Americans are impacted by long Covid, and they deserve a federal government that will have their back,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said in response to inquiries from Rolling Stone . “The Trump administration is not only failing to achieve those goals, but actively taking us in the wrong direction.” It all suggests a brewing public health crisis for a generation of Americans — including people like Lia Corbitt, who, since 2022, has been largely in virtual education. That’s left doting parents like Joy disheartened. A decorative pep talk on the Corbitts’ bookshelf Eli Cahan “When you have a disability people can’t see, you don’t get the same level of empathy,” Joy says. “It feels like the world has moved on.” THE CDC DEFINES LONG COVID as a wide array of chronic symptoms — including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, memory changes, and sleep disturbances — that began after an infection with the virus and last more than three months. The most recent data from HHS estimated that, as of December 2024, around 22 million American adults had the illness at some point. More than nine million were still sick with it by the end of 2023. Data is harder to come by for children, who since the earliest days of the pandemic were noted to experience a wider-ranging and less predictable set of symptoms than adults. In February 2024, a paper published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimated that up to six million children in the United States had suffered from long Covid at some point. A year later, CDC researchers put the figure at closer to one million, with 300,000 actively suffering from the disease; it also noted the numbers, based on national survey data, may significantly undercount the illness’ true toll. Whichever figure you use, the numbers are enormous, rivaling conditions like ADHD and autism as one of the most common chronic diseases in American youth today. And for the children and teens I’ve spoken with, long Covid has done serious physical and emotional damage. It’s also hindered their ability to participate in school — something that becomes an all-encompassing source of frustration for children and parents alike. All of the students interviewed for this story were diagnosed with long Covid. And they all met the Department of Education ’s (DOE) eligibility criteria for specialized school accommodations because of their illness. It’s a group that’s ballooned in size: The number of children receiving specialized accommodations increased by 500,000 after the pandemic relative to before. There’s Alexander, in eighth grade when the pandemic hit, the adventurer extraordinaire from Massachusetts whose Covid-related exhaustion meant tardy after tardy — but who was denied accommodations because his grades were too good. There’s Eliza, a kindergartner in Washington state whose severe stomach pain constantly kept her out of school, but who was denied accommodations because the principal said that “we have great teachers here.” There’s ninth-grader William, a Mets fanatic from suburban New York, who was denied accommodations because school officials told him that “Covid is over.” Those struggles are despite a July 2021 joint statement from HHS and the Department of Justice clarifying that long Covid is a protected condition under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But early actions under the second Trump administration stand to further jeopardize their ability to access special education. An Inauguration Day executive order targeting DEI withdrew federal support through the DOE for learning loss caused by the pandemic, including from long Covid. (The rollbacks specifically targeted special education for Hispanic, Black, and Tribal communities, whose children who faced higher rates of severe illness due to Covid, and who use special education at higher rates.) The Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts likewise stand to dry up billions more in special education dollars. And should the Trump White House fulfill its campaign promises to axe the DOE entirely, billions of federal dollars upon which schools rely to support millions of children who need special education may vanish overnight. WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, the legitimacy of long Covid has been a wellspring of controversy. What the wide-ranging long Covid symptoms have in common is that they’re a challenging combination of persistent yet intermittent, incapacitating yet invisible. Too often, especially for young people, that means adults — even doctors — “don’t believe there’s anything wrong with the child,” says Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who is also the director of the post-Covid program at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. “They think they’re being a teenager.” At various points, skeptical doctors have attributed the symptoms to a kind of neurosis: patient as hypochondriac, equipped with a fancy new diagnosis. “It is hard to know if this kind of long-tail phenomenon is more pronounced or more common [with Covid],” Adam Lauring, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Michigan, told The Washington Post in June of 2020, “or we are just seeing things that come to our attention because there is a heightened awareness.” Other doctors have chalked up the symptoms to a kind of societal malaise: patient as emotional sponge in a chaotic world, sickness quite literally all in their heads. “Whether long Covid can be considered just a consequence of a viral infection or should be attributed to the implications of ‘the pandemic era’ we are now living in is still a matter of debate,” Achille Marino and Rolando Cimaz, pediatric rheumatologists at the University of Milan, wrote in 2022 in the journal of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases. Some in the medical community have even called for dumping the diagnosis altogether. “It is time to stop using terms like ‘Long Covid,’” John Gerrard, former chief health officer of Queensland, Australia, wrote in a press release for a March 2024 study comparing symptoms of Covid patients to those with the flu. “This terminology can cause unnecessary fear, and in some cases, hypervigilance to longer symptoms that can impede recovery.” Another piece of the long Covid puzzle is a practical issue: getting diagnosed. According to Elizabeth Pray, former president of Washington state’s chapter of the National Association of School Nurses, who herself has cared for numerous kids with symptoms of long Covid, there are two major steps in the diagnostic odyssey. First, the child needs a documented Covid infection. Second, they need to find a doctor able — and willing — to make the diagnosis. But many kids may not have tested at the time of their infection, Pray says. Months into the pandemic, the U.S. faced severe shortages in Covid tests for everyone. Well into the winter of 2022, major retailers like CVS and Walgreens were still rationing tests to favor adults, who were at greater risk of severe illness and death. At various points, tests were restricted for kids under 16 years of age, and then under 12. Even in kids who did test, studies show that up to 90 percent of cases can go missed due to differences in how kids’ immune systems handle the virus. “If you have families that didn’t test,” Pray says, “how would you tie it back to know how big the problem is?” In the situation where a child does have a confirmed case, finding a doctor to ink the long Covid diagnosis can still be a challenge. According to the patient advocacy group Long Covid Alliance, there are fewer than a dozen long-Covid pediatric clinics across the country, compared with 400 adult clinics. That means many kids who live far from major medical centers — like Pray’s students in Moses Lake, a town of 25,000 that’s 200 miles from Seattle — won’t ever be seen at such a clinic. Dakota Presnell was one of those kids. Before the blackouts, the vertigo, the sniffle and the cough, Dakota’s childhood in the seaside North Carolina vacation town of Manteo was idyllic. Dakota Presnell on a dock in Manteo, North Carolina. He used to spend the summers roller skating and playing in the ocean, his mom says, before his long Covid symptoms hit. Eli Cahan He’d spend summers leaping off story-high footbridges and docks and jetties, and slipping down slides into the rollicking Atlantic surrounding Roanoke Island. In the off-season, he’d roller skate down deserted streets and frequent the laser tag arena or the bowling alley, playing one or the other until they closed up shop. Dakota was “a happy-go-lucky kid,” his mother, Michelle Hooker, says. “It was hard to keep him home… He was always on the go, always doing something.” Then, sixth grade. Winter, 2021. Omicron. Dakota had gone back to school in-person and — like many who contracted Covid’s most infectious variant — he was quickly bedridden, Michelle says. Of all his symptoms, the dizziness and fatigue were the worst. At one point, a friend told Michelle that she should “look into” long Covid; she’d bring it up time and time again with Dakota’s pediatrician, to little avail. In the summer of 2022, the blackouts started. Out of nowhere, like a limp marionette, Dakota would drop to the ground. Michelle “became his legs,” she says, as she’d carry her son from room to room. By the fall his fatigue and fainting spells were a “complete and utter nightmare.” By January 2024, Dakota’s symptoms also included memory loss and severe pain in his arms and legs that he couldn’t shake. Michelle says that, during this time, they went to loads of doctors — pediatricians, neurologists, the works — and racked up several hospitalizations where they were seen by still more clinical teams. They accrued loads of diagnoses: non-epileptic seizures, amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome, functional neurologic disorder. That last diagnosis, in particular, irked Michelle. “That’s a fancy way of saying it’s all in your head,” she says. Long Covid, she adds, never made the list. To Yonts, at Children’s National, experiences like Dakota’s are no longer surprising. She’s heard story after story of undiagnosed patients who, by the time they make it to her clinic, have been seen by doctors who “think there’s something else going on, [something] not physical.” At the same time, Yonts knows specialized long Covid clinics, including hers, can’t see the vast majority of patients who request a visit: Their capacity is “woefully inadequate,” she says. “We’ve had really lengthy waitlists for most of our existence.” FOR KIDS LIKE DAKOTA suffering from long Covid, navigating school is a mess, too. Under federal law , any student with a “physical or mental impairment” impacting their ability to participate in school is entitled to accommodations under a so-called 504 or an Individualized Education (IEP) plan. The DOE’s language is deliberately inclusive: Such entitlements stand whether students are diagnosed with — or are “regarded to have” — any such impairment, William Koski, director of the Youth and Education Law Project at Stanford University, says. A table of contents for one of many notebooks maintained by Dakota’s mom Michelle charting his medical care and correspondence with the school district. Eli Cahan The accommodations provided under the plans can run a broad spectrum. They include everything from rest breaks to extra time to provision of quiet spaces for testing. They can also be more tailored: For example, for children with conditions that put them at risk of passing out — in which staying hydrated is critical — accommodations can include things like keeping pretzels or a water bottle at their desk. More intensive plans can include tutors or “changes to the curricular expectations” altogether. Since the onset of the pandemic, the number of school-aged students with IEPs has jumped. In the 2018-2019 school year, 6.3 million children received special education services. In 2022-2023, 6.8 million did. Still, some long-Covid families say they’ve been in the dark when it comes to accommodations. In some cases, they’ve faced pushback for seeking special education. That’s true for people like Lia, who had a pre-existing special education plan for ADHD, and who had, by then, a long Covid diagnosis. But Lia struggled to convince her school to provide additional accommodations for her fatigue, nausea, and frequent absences. After much back and forth, the school offered a compromise: She could have two extra days to hand in her homework. Oh, and she could go to the bathroom when she needed to. “That was really the only change that they gave us,” Lia says. “If there had been other options,” Joy adds, “they weren’t discussed or offered.” The obstacles to accommodations have been especially stark for people like Michelle and Dakota, who hadn’t previously navigated special education, and who lacked a formal diagnosis of long Covid. It took more than three years before Michelle realized they could even seek help. “[The school] didn’t give us any information,” Dakota says. When they finally did hear through Facebook about the possibility of a 504 — and started pinging the school to advocate — things quickly became contentious. “I’m battling the school,” Michelle says, “[because] they don’t believe anything is wrong with Dakota.” (Dare County Schools, Dakota’s district, did not respond to requests for comment.) To Laura Malone, pediatrician and director of the Post-Covid-19 Rehabilitation Clinic at Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, part of the trouble around accommodations traces back to lack of knowledge around the illness. “Long Covid is a newer diagnosis…[that] schools, education systems aren’t as aware of,” Malone says. Michelle puts it more bluntly. “They don’t believe he has long Covid,” she says of the school. “They don’t believe long Covid exists.” AFTER MONTHS OF BATTLING, by the beginning of eighth grade in fall 2023, Dakota successfully got a 504 plan. Theoretically, that entitled him to extra time on tests and deadlines, as well as breaks throughout the school day. On paper, it was a version of school that retained a sense of normalcy while being feasible given his fatigue and brain fog. Unfortunately, the text on paper didn’t translate to real life, Michelle says. The plan “didn’t do much — he was still expected to [take] all these classes, carry all of this homework, do the daily assignments,” she says. “It was kind of a B.S., fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type answer.” In this way, Dakota and Michelle’s experience reflects a different issue with learning accommodations: the difficulty implementing and enforcing them. One of the biggest pieces of the implementation issue is that of dogma, Kathy Riley, nurse at the Plymouth school district in Massachusetts and co-lead for the National Association of School Nurses’ long Covid efforts, says. There are cases where teachers, much like some school officials, simply disagree with the notion that long Covid is real, or that kids with it need help. “The teachers have to buy into the accommodations…or it’s not going to work,” Riley says. “If a teacher doesn’t really agree with it, then the kid doesn’t get it.” That gets into the problem of enforcement, which typically falls upon the districts themselves. The DOE’s Office of Civil Rights “generally will not evaluate the content” of 504s or IEPs, the agency states on its website. Nor does it “review the result of individual placement or other educational decisions.” Instead, “any disagreement can be resolved through a due process hearing.” But a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the ability and willingness of families to pursue such hearings varies widely due to language barriers, ability to find an attorney, legal costs, and fears of retaliation, among other factors. Such barriers were particularly marked in low-income school districts, which on average have more children of color, and which tend to have higher numbers of children with disabilities. “Many parents feel they are at a disadvantage in a conflict with the school district due to an imbalance of power and so may be reluctant to engage in dispute resolution,” the report concluded. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from Rolling Stone about the inability of students with long Covid to receive 504s or IEPs, or lack of enforcement of 504s or IEPs in cases where they are granted. ) Recent reporting suggests that kids’ access to special education may worsen further following widespread cuts to the DOE. In March, the administration hollowed out the department’s Office of Civil Rights — including entire investigative teams in the majority of regions — leaving thousands of pending cases in limbo, according to the New York Times . And in May, ProPu blica found that, in the period following the cuts, hundreds fewer ongoing cases were investigated , and new cases were dismissed outright at rates 30 percent higher than previously. In late September, Maryland Sen. Angela Alsobrooks introduced a bill to exempt funding for special education from any future DOE cuts. “Any attempt to slash programs and protections for our students with disabilities is beyond callous,” Alsobrooks said in a press release. Still, by October — amid the government shutdown — mass layoffs were imperiling the DOE’s ability to administer special education, department sources told ABC News . To Dakota, politics shouldn’t play a role in whether kids with long Covid get the support they need. That’s true for teachers not following certain special education plans rather than others. It’s also true for government-wide initiatives that pull out the rug from under children like him. “People are inclined to their opinion,” Dakota says, “but at the same time, in some situations, like [with] long Covid…opinions get in the way.” THE TUG-OF-WAR AROUND accommodations comes at a time when fewer American students are attending school than ever before. In January 2024, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that chronic absenteeism — defined as the number of students missing at least one out of every 10 school days — nearly doubled following the Covid pandemic. Every state saw increases in chronic absenteeism, the study found: In total, nearly 30 percent — some 13 million children — regularly missed school. The alarm bells around the absenteeism crisis partly relate to learning loss. In January 2025, an annual Congressional analysis known as the “nation’s report card” found that American students’ achievement levels were declining to some of the worst in recent history . The alarm is also related to money. Attendance is one of the key factors that determines school funding in most states. That incentivizes schools to do what they can to make sure students show up, since absences can only hurt their bottom line. As a result, some districts are taking a punitive approach to chronic absenteeism. On one extreme is Missouri, where, following an August 2023 decision from the state’s Supreme Court, parents of children with poor attendance records are now liable for jail time. A more common mechanism involves truancy. States like Indiana are already moving to toughen truancy laws by introducing bills to tighten attendance requirements and immediately refer families for investigation in ways that can lead to prosecution of children, parents, or both. Truancy hinges on defining an absence as unexcused. But that’s a definition “really dependent on the school itself,” Christy McGill, deputy superintendent for educator effectiveness and family engagement for the Nevada Department of Education, says. For example, some schools may require doctors’ notes for every missed day, McGill says, while others do not. Studies have found that children of color were up to four times more likely to have their absences marked unexcused than those who were white. Rolling Stone contacted every state’s education department for this article, the majority of which did not respond to requests for comment. Most of those that did — Colorado, Kentucky, Oregon, and Utah among them — lack visibility into the reasons for excused versus unexcused absences. Such variability worries Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a national nonprofit organization focused on chronic absenteeism. “Unfortunately, across the United States, absences are too often deemed ‘unexcused’ for arbitrary reasons,” she says. The lack of clarity around excused versus unexcused absences includes those potentially related to medical conditions such as long Covid. Even as large-scale reviews of children with long Covid find absenteeism to be a consistent issue , schools have little insight into whether poor attendance in their district may derive, in part, from kids struggling with the condition. “There’s no question there could be long Covid symptoms out there we don’t know about,” Eric Mackey, Alabama’s state superintendent of education, says, “[but] I don’t have any information on that.” (The DOE did not respond to inquiries from Rolling Stone about policies for determining unexcused absences or the initiation of truancy investigations. The agency also did not respond to inquiries about how schools should incorporate protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act into their policies around absences or truancy.) Many of the families I spoke to, at one point or another, found themselves staring down threats of truancy. For some, those threats came via robocall after robocall. For Dakota and Michelle, they came in meetings with school officials. And for Lia and Joy, they came more insidiously. “I always wondered what my teachers thought,” Lia says. “They knew I was sick — but did they believe me, [or] did they think I was making it up?” So, when Lia’s medical waiver fell off seemingly overnight in the fall of 2022, Joy was concerned. If Lia missed 10 days of a given course, she’d automatically fail — if not worse, when it came to the specter of truancy. (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Lia’s district, did not respond to requests for comment.) “I tried to communicate from the beginning that…there is no way, at this point, she is not going to miss more,” Joy says. “[But] it didn’t matter. It felt like she was being punished for being ill.” AFTER MONTHS OF FRUITLESS morning wake-ups and early afternoon pickups, tardies and absences and missed assignments, months of blackouts and vomiting and forgetfulness and dozing off, Dakota and Lia were left with only one option: hybrid education. Education outside the schoolyard has long been considered the option of last resort, Koski, at Stanford, says: Keeping kids with their peers “is one of the bedrock principles of …the disability rights movement.” Based on how their accommodations were implemented, though, the families I interviewed say they felt trapped. In Lia’s case, even as her 504 entitled her to two extra days to submit homework, she kept racking up absences for not bringing it to class on the original due date. And even as she and Joy heard through the grapevine that other students across the country struggling with long Covid were offered additional services, such IEPs that included hybrid school with teachers coming to their homes for in-person tutoring, she was never offered such a plan. “Given how the school was handling [accommodations], and their procedures, and their rules, I really had no choice but to switch to virtual school,” Lia says. That switch came with its own costs. She was always missing out: parties, prom, homecomings. She kept finding herself on the outside of inside jokes. She lost close friends, who accused her of being flaky, or avoiding them entirely. “It’s still affecting me to this day,” Lia says. Dakota found himself in a similar spot when, this past summer — after Michelle finally had an opportunity to advocate for his special education plan — officials rendered a decision: Dakota would be enrolled at Dare Learning Academy, the district’s “alternative” educational option. It was the worst of both worlds: simultaneously denying Dakota additional accommodations and punting him further to the margins. It also felt like confirmation of what his family had dreaded: that school officials saw him as undisciplined or unmotivated rather than sick. To Michelle and Dakota, the decision felt premeditated: People “sometimes have their minds made up before we even see them,” Dakota says. It’s hard to know whether the experiences of kids like Lia and Dakota are becoming more common. The most recent data available from the DOE shows that the number of students in homebound or hospital-bound, residential facility, or separate school-based programs has stayed roughly stable since the pandemic. But that data doesn’t account for the kind of hybrid education that became mainstream during the pandemic. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from Rolling Stone about how students in hybrid school settings are counted.) The longer-term consequences on a generation of struggling children taught without adequate support — or via hybrid education — are also not yet clear, says Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. But, based on what she’s seen, she’s afraid that “every community is going to pay the price in the long run.” “We absolutely know the best place for a kid is in school,” Kressly says. In virtual education, she adds, “are we just putting them out of sight?” Some parents — like Michelle — are already observing changes in their children. “We’ve been beat up and chewed up, no one’s taken account for what they’ve done, and it’s not fair, because he’s falling through the cracks,” she says of Dakota. “As long as this goes on,” she adds, “his light is getting dimmer and dimmer — because he’s losing hope.” Dakota, for his part, still has big dreams. He wants to live in a big city (Norfolk, Virginia), and work a demanding job (general surgeon). Dakota thinks he’ll be good, too: “I know how to listen and take other people’s opinions and worries into account,” he says. But Dakota also knows he faces long odds. And he knows how much his illness plays a role in that. “Long Covid has taken my life and turned it around,” Dakota says. Lia is also trying to concentrate on the future. After she got into a pediatric long Covid clinic and began implementing a variety of different treatments — salt tabs day and night, electrolyte powder infused in every drink, this and that medication prescribed off-label — slowly but surely, she has been feeling better. So, she’s got her eyes on the prize. A high school diploma. A college welcome weekend. Most recently, a beauty pageant title. Even still, life looks different now. In particular, there’s a void where her friends and classmates used to be. “I’m back,” Lia says, “and at the same time, so much has changed, because I’ve missed out on so much.” This fall, she was excited to make a fresh start at college. New place, new people, new her. A her that feels like the real her. Not the long Covid version. College “is a place where no one really knows me,” Lia says. “I can start over — and kind of, maybe, separate myself from the illness a little bit.” This reporting was supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/long-covid-kids-school-absenteeism-1235447552,Entertainment,Washington Post,Eli Cahan,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/h_1599268427.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-16T12:00:00+00:00,118a1d610ef9785598bf5e9ca0d8482fe4af2c74

d8f06fc55da5,Pinterest will let you 'dial down' AI slop in your feeds,pinterest,"Pinterest is taking new steps to reduce the amount of AI slop its users are seeing. The service is adding settings that allow people to ""dial down"" AI-generated content in a number of categories that are ""highly-prone"" to such imagery, the company said in an update. While most social platforms have grappled with how to deal with the rise of AI-created content, Pinterest has been particularly inundated. Its image-board UI has proven particularly susceptible to AI slop, and users have complained about the difficulty of finding content created by humans. Now, Pinterest is offering users more control over how much AI content appears in their recommendations. The service is adding a ""refine your recommendations"" setting that allows you to toggle generative AI content from specific categories, including art, architecture, beauty, fashion, entertainment, health, home decor and sport. According to the company, these topics have seen an influx of AI-generated content, but users should ""expect even more additions in the future."" Notably, Pinterest isn't promising to root out generative AI content entirely. Rather, it says the new settings should ""dial down"" the amount of AI-based content they're seeing in a particular category. A spokesperson for the company says this is because not all AI-generated content on the platform is low quality and some users are in fact open to seeing AI-generated material. The setting also applies only to image pins, not video, so it likely won't do much to prevent Sora or other AI-created video clips from appearing in your feeds. For AI-created or AI-edited content that does continue to surface, Pinterest says it will label these posts more prominently. The company started experimenting with labels back in May , but has now ""ramped up"" its tools for identifying such content. Pinterest's new settings are available now on desktop and Android and will be available on iOS in the next few weeks.",https://www.engadget.com/social-media/pinterest-will-let-you-dial-down-ai-slop-in-your-feeds-130000337.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/b.FK92IQ7UEip.lP8i0aDg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/FilteringPins-NewsroomHeader.jpg,2025-10-16T13:00:00+00:00,4691e724d431b1c8f364e469b5e1e579688951cf
650403dc3539,"Microsoft's next Windows 11 AI gamble: Just say ""Hey Copilot""","microsoft, windows 11, copilot ai","Over a decade since Microsoft tried to make talking to Cortana on PCs a thing -- and spectacularly failed in the process -- the Windows giant is taking another swing at voice commands with its Copilot AI assistant in Windows 11. Starting today, the company is rolling out an upgrade to its existing Copilot Voice and Vision features which will let you say ""Hey, Copilot"" and then ask your PC a question based on what's on the screen. If you're looking at pictures of Hawaii, for example, you could ask your Windows 11 PC where exactly they were taken, have it plot you a flight plan and potentially even give you some budgeting tips to afford that island vacation. Microsoft's jaunty promotional videos for the Copilot features, set to Vampire Weekend's almost two-decade-old ""A Punk,"" make the process look practically seamless. One user asks Copilot to show them how to stream their music in the ""best possible quality,"" and the AI proceeds to highlight the exact location of the streaming settings in Spotify, while suggesting they choose the lossless option. Another person asks Copilot to write up a short biography based on their photo portfolio. Now Copilot isn't just about searching the web or generating novelty AI art, it's making it easy for users to perform practical tasks without much effort. Microsoft is clearly striving for the convenience of the Star Trek ship computer, a dream that also pushed Amazon to invest billions in its Echo devices and Alexa. The difference with Copilot is that you're not just talking to a faceless speaker -- Microsoft is also trying to make Windows 11 aware of what you're doing on your screen. The ""Hey Copilot"" feature and all of the Copilot Vision are cloud-based, so you'll have to live with image data of your desktop making its way to Microsoft's servers. That involves a level of trust the company has lost with many users, especially after the messy debut of Recall , its first flagship AI-powered feature. It doesn't help that many people are still peeved about the death of Windows 10 support this week . Unsurprisingly, the company stresses that ""Hey, Copilot"" is a purely opt-in feature that's buried in the Copilot app settings. (Of course, that can always change, especially if the company wants to juice AI engagement stats in a few years.) Copilot Actions (Microsoft) I suspect it'll be even harder for users to swallow where Microsoft wants to take Copilot: Giving it the ability to perform Windows tasks on its own. That's the goal of the experimental Copilot Actions feature, which initially debuted as a tool that could perform tasks on websites . Once enabled, Copilot Actions can be prompted to handle manual tasks, like resizing and straightening an a folder of photos. If any questions pop up, it can prompt you to answer them within the Copilot app. And as Copilot Actions is handling its job in the background, you're free to do anything else you'd like on your computer. Conceptually, Copilot Actions sounds similar to handing off a task to a real life assistant -- but just like a human assistant, there's always a chance something could go wrong along the way. It's also not hard to imagine the feature being coopted by nefarious malware down the line, since it's basically a Windows script in a better interface. Microsoft says it's tested Copilot Actions ""extensively"" internally, and it's rolling out the feature slowly to gather feedback. Just like ""Hey, Copilot,"" it's entirely opt-in, and you can see everything Copilot Actions is doing step-by-step in the Copilot app. Microsoft says you'l be able to jump in and take control of a Copilot Action job at any point, as well as control the permissions of AI agents in Windows 11’s user settings. Copilot tasks are also performed in a contained environment, according to Microsoft, which allows for even more specific permissions controls as well as runtime isolation (so Copilot can’t affect the rest of your system beyond its specific task). And as if we're not already inundated with Copilot all over Windows 11 already, Microsoft also plans to add an ""Ask Copilot"" search function right on Windows 11's taskbar. The company claims it's part of a mission to make the taskbar ""a dynamic hub"" for accomplishing tasks, but personally I like to keep my taskbar clear so I can cram in more app windows. Like everything Microsoft is announcing today, the Ask Copilot bar will also be entirely opt-in. As someone who’s been skeptical of Microsoft’s Copilot initiatives so far, I could actually see myself using “Hey Copilot” if it works as advertised. It sounds far more practical than the old Siri voice commands, which were limited by simplistic language models from a decade ago. Microsoft is also expanding AI actions built into Windows 11, including a new integration with Manus , an AI agent that can do things like turn several documents into a website, as well as Filmora , which lets you create AI videos right from the File Explorer. The new ""Hey Copilot"" and Copilot Vision features are available today on all Windows 11 PCs that have access to Copilot. Microsoft is also making Copilot Vision broadly available around the world today where Copilot is available. Copilot Actions and the Ask Copilot taskbar feature will ""gradually"" become available to Windows 11 Insiders, according to Microsoft.",https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsofts-next-windows-11-ai-gamble-just-say-hey-copilot-130000875.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XEst08s8k3qahDqtgr_Jbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Windows_Blog_Hero_Image_High_Res.jpg,2025-10-16T13:00:00+00:00,3d818acbd7c09622a2dc88fbb4a143909c56f9f7
08f396637068,How to cancel ExpressVPN and get a full refund,"expressvpn, subscription details, cancel subscription","ExpressVPN is one of the best VPNs on the market, with user-friendly apps, excellent speed test scores and a strong security record. In my ExpressVPN review , I found it to live up to its positive word of mouth, especially when unblocking foreign streaming sites. But no service is perfect, and my cup of VPN tea is not everybody's. If you're looking to switch away, follow this guide to cancel ExpressVPN. How to cancel ExpressVPN on desktop No matter where you originally signed up for ExpressVPN, you can cancel through your browser on a desktop platform. With any browser (i.e. Chrome, Safari, etc), the steps are as follows. Note that doing this will instantly cancel your ExpressVPN subscription and revoke your access to the service. Go to expressvpn.com. In the top bar, click on My Account. Enter your username and password to sign in. You'll be taken to your account dashboard. In the menu on the left-hand side of the screen, click Subscription. Scroll down until you find the words ""Subscription details."" You should see a box containing the monthly cost of your subscription. At the right of that box, click Cancel Subscription . From here, follow the on-screen prompts to complete cancellation. If you're not ready to lose ExpressVPN service just yet, you can end auto-renewal instead of cancelling altogether. You'll still be able to use ExpressVPN until your subscription runs out. To cancel auto-renew, go to the subscription tab of your account dashboard and find the box with your subscription ID (it should be right at the top). In that box, click the link that says Edit subscription settings , then scroll down and click Turn Off Automatic Renewal. If you change your mind before your subscription lapses, you'll be able to turn it back on later. How to cancel ExpressVPN on mobile You can also cancel ExpressVPN on your phone or tablet, but the process is largely the same — some buttons are just in different places. As above, this instantly ends your ExpressVPN subscription. Here's how to do it. Go to expressvpn.com in your mobile browser. Tap the three horizontal lines at the top-right, then in the menu that appears, tap My Account. In the account dashboard, tap the three horizontal lines at the top-right once again. This time, scroll down to the expanded ""My Account"" menu and tap Subscription. Scroll down to the ""Subscription details"" box and tap Cancel Subscription. Follow the prompts on the screen to complete cancellation. Like on desktop, you can also turn off auto-renewal so your subscription ends when your current pay period expires. Go to the subscription tab of your account dashboard as described in the steps, find the box with your subscription ID, then follow the steps from the last paragraph of the previous section. Cancelling ExpressVPN through an app store The website is almost always the right way to cancel ExpressVPN, but there is one exception: if you originally signed up through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. This includes both paid subscriptions and the 7-day free trials ExpressVPN offers to app store users. In this case, you'll need to cancel through the app store where you originally made the purchase. On Apple, open the app store, then tap Subscriptions and scroll down to find ExpressVPN. On Android, open Google Play and tap Payment & subscriptions, then Subscriptions. In both cases, once you've found ExpressVPN, tap it and scroll down to find the button for cancellation. How to get a refund from ExpressVPN ExpressVPN offers a full refund to anyone who cancels a subscription within 30 days of purchase. You can also get a refund if your subscription renews without your consent — if that happens, you have 14 days to request your money back. There's no dedicated button for asking for a refund. Instead, you'll need to contact ExpressVPN. To do that, go to expressvpn.com/support, then click on the button in the bottom-right corner that says Need help? Chat with us! This will open a chat with a bot which you can use to ask for your money back. Unfortunately, there's no public link to email the support team, so live chat is the only option here. ExpressVPN alternatives Depending on what made you want to cancel ExpressVPN, there are a few other VPNs you might like better. Proton VPN is my favorite provider at the moment, combining great apps with a unique focus on privacy rights (it's also cheaper). NordVPN has a lot of useful features ExpressVPN leaves off its no-frills clients. And if you're all about speed, Surfshark is the current fastest VPN in my tests.

eb681097c26e,"Plug-in hybrids emit almost as much pollution as gas cars, report finds","carbon dioxide emissions, electric motors, fuel consumption, gas cars","The difference in emissions between plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and gas cars is merely 19 percent and not 75 percent as lab tests show, according to a report by a group of European transport and environment NGOs. They analyzed data transmitted by the onboard fuel consumption meters of 800,000 plug-in hybrids registered in the continent between 2021 and 2023. What they found was that the real-world carbon dioxide emissions of PHEVs were 4.9 times higher than what they're supposed to emit on paper, mostly because of manufacturers' and testers' flawed assumption on the share of the vehicles' electric driving mode. Specifically, the official estimates for the share of electric driving mode are 84 percent, but the share is only as little as 27 percent in the real world. That means most of the driving done on PHEVs uses gas. In addition, even when PHEVs are in electric driving mode, they're still emitting considerable pollution. Apparently, their electric motors don't have sufficient power to operate on their own, and their combustion engines have to supply power for almost a third of the distance driven. The lack of fast charging in PHEVs also makes it less convenient to charge, leading people to just fill their tanks with gas. All these factors don't only translate to pollution, but also to additional gas expenses. The report says drivers end up paying $582 more than official estimates for fuel costs. As The Guardian notes, carmakers have been pushing for the adoption of PHEVs in Europe as a low-emissions alternative that won't give owners range anxiety, with Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW accounting for most of the sales over the past years. The researchers have noted that four major carmaker groups have avoided over $5.8 billion in fines between 2021 and 2023 due to the underestimation of PHEV emissions in the lab. These official emission numbers allowed companies to comply with the required carbon dioxide emission targets for their fleets. Based on real-world data, however, the vehicles they sold emitted 52 million tons more carbon dioxide than they were supposed to.",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/plug-in-hybrids-emit-almost-as-much-pollution-as-gas-cars-report-finds-120032534.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.iVLvhuKafP2T_qCdaKH1Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODM-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/93ec14e0-aa7a-11f0-8bfb-78696a9648ea,2025-10-16T12:00:32+00:00,35dc51a2cdc4cb481ae9e29a228792108ba1cfe1

65e0d4b3a45d,The best Bluetooth trackers for 2025,"bluetooth tracker, google, bluetooth tracking device, pebblebee, tile sticker, tile mate, trackers, apple, bluetooth, chipolo","Most people think of AirTags when they picture a Bluetooth tracker. And indeed, Apple’s little white discs used to be the most capable option, relying on a vast finding network of nearby iPhones to pinpoint lost tags. But now, both Google and Samsung have implemented finding networks of their own. And other Bluetooth tracker companies, like Chipolo and Pebblebee, now have trackers that pair with either Google or Apple’s network too. In short, you’ve got a lot of options for tagging and tracking your keys, backpacks, luggage and more. So we tested all the major brands out there to see how they work and put together a guide to help you get the most out of your chosen tracker. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers you can buy. Table of contents Best Bluetooth trackers for 2025 Amy Skorheim for Engadget Format : Disc with hole | Compatibility : Android and iPhone | Water resistance : IP55 (splash and dust resistant) | Battery life : 1 year | Replaceable battery : Yes | Distance for left-behind alerts : 450 ft. | Phone finder function : Yes, via Chipolo app Chipolo’s previous fob, the Chipolo ONE, was our top pick for a couple years. The release of Samsung’s latest tag, new Tile trackers and other tags compatible with Google’s finding network didn’t manage to nudge it from its throne. The Chipolo Pop came out in early 2025 and it not only retains all the features we loved about the original tracker, but it also solved our one complaint about the previous model: Chipolo’s limited finding network. The Pop tracker taps into either Google’s Find Hub or Apple’s Find My network, calling on every nearby Android or iPhone, respectively, to anonymously ping a lost tracker for accurate finding. Not only does it have some considerable lost-in-the wild chops, it’s also louder than an AirTag, can make your phone ring, has 12 different ring tones, comes in cute colors and, notably, has a dang hole unlike Apple’s slippery, accessory-requiring pebble. It only works with one network at a time, but it’s easy to remove a device that’s connected to, say, an iPhone and then pair it up with a Galaxy handset. Setup was dead simple and fast. For both the iOS and Android tests, just bringing the Pop close to the phone triggered a prompt to pair it. Chipolo’s tag is no longer the loudest tracker we tested (Pebblebee’s Clip Universal holds that honor), but you won’t struggle to hear it — and it has 12 optional ringtones, including three that are holiday-themed. Neither Apple AirTags nor third-party trackers working with Google’s Find Hub will let you ring your phone by squeezing the fob, but Chipolo Pop will. You’ll have to install the Chipolo app and give it permission to run in the background (doing so didn’t drastically drain either my iPhone or Android phone battery). The feature worked reliably in my tests and was highly appreciated, as my keys tend to stay put when I’m home, but my iPhone likes to roam around the house like a bored housecat. iPhone users who walk away from an item tagged with the Find My network will get an alert before they get too far away (usually a couple blocks), but Google’s finding network has no similar ability. The Chipolo app enables left-behind (separation) alerts when using an Android phone. In my tests I got about 400 feet away from my stuff before getting a notification I’d forgotten something. That’s actually faster than AirTags’ notification and far quicker than Tile’s. Alerts were consistent whether I was forgetting an item at home, at a coffee shop or inside my car. As far as losing stuff out in the wild, the Pop paired with Apple’s Find My network possesses the same spooky accuracy as an AirTag. In my iPhone test, I had a friend hide the tag about four blocks away from me next to a relatively busy coffee shop. Once they told me the tag had been stashed, I went to the Find My app to turn on the lost item feature — but no need, the finding network had already located it. I tapped to follow directions in Apple Maps and was taken within about two feet from the bush where it was hidden. Like my AirTags tests, I was both impressed with and slightly unnerved by the accuracy. The finding skills that rely on the Android network were also impressive. Once the Pop was hidden, I marked it as lost and got a ping that it had been spotted about six minutes later. Again, the directions led me close enough to ring the tracker that I could find it. Most people won’t need to rely on the finding network on a regular basis, which is why it’s important that Chipolo’s everyday locating abilities work well, too. Tapping the Play Sound function on either an Android or iPhone made the tag chirp almost instantly, and it was able to connect to nearby tags from further away than models from other brands. Pros Louder than an AirTag Uses either or Apple or Google's finding networks Chipolo app adds useful features Colorful disc with a hole Enables left-behind alerts for Android phones $29 at Amazon Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget Format : Smooth disc | Compatibility : iPhone | Water resistance : IP67 (water and dust-resistant) | Battery life : 1 year | Replaceable battery : Yes | Distance for left-behind alerts : 1,200 ft | Phone finder function : No AirTags work with iOS' Find My app and are registered to your Apple ID, so they don’t require any additional downloads. If you’ve used the Find My app before, you’ll likely understand how this works. These are the quietest of the trackers we tested and each time you press the Play Sound button, the tags only ring for seven seconds. You’ll need to keep pressing if you don’t find your item right away and AirTags can’t be used to ring your phone. As for separation alerts, AirTags were consistent, always delivering a “left behind” alert when I traveled about 1,200 feet away, or about three square blocks, without an item. You can turn off separation alerts for any given tracker, as well as designate certain locations, such as your home or workplace, as exceptions for the notifications. AirTags can tap into the ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless protocol. This allows you to play a fun game of hot and cold with an item when it’s within about 25 feet of your iPhone. Directional arrows and a diminishing distance meter on your iPhone’s screen point you to an item without having to ring it. This worked reliably about 75 percent of the time in my tests; usually it was just easier to ring the item when the directional finding couldn’t keep a lock on the tracker. UWB is supported by iPhone models 11 and later and while newer Galaxy and Pixel phones also support UWB, but the only Android-compatible tracker so far has been Samsung's now-discontinued SmartTag+. In 2021, Tile announced a UWB tracker, but has long since missed its promised release window of “early 2022.” AirTag’s ability to locate a lost item out in the city is almost eerie. I had someone (who was not carrying an iPhone) take my bike with a tracker hidden under the seat to a location a little over a half mile away. I set out a few minutes later and toggled on Notify When Found in the Find My app. Within three minutes, I received a notification that the bike had been “seen” near an address. Tapping on Directions navigates to Apple Maps, which took me to a spot about 30 feet from the bike. Had it been obscured from view, I could have then used the Find Nearby button to activate the UWB locating features. Ringing the tag was too quiet to hear on the sidewalk. Both the Chipolo Pop and the Pebblebee Clip Universal will work with Apple’s Find My network, giving you the same eerily accurate finding capabilities. The Pop goes for the same $29 as the AirTag and the Clip Universal goes for $35, but the former is rechargeable and adds lights to the mix. Both have built-in holes for easier attachment and both ring louder than the AirTags. That said, AirTags are still the gold standard for iPhone users and remain our top pick for iOS devotees. Pros Vast finding network Accurate UWB for nearby locating Cons iPhone only Only rings for 7 seconds at a time No attachment point $37 at Amazon Amy Skorheim for Engadget Format : Disc with silicone loop tab | Compatibility : Android and iPhone | Water resistance : IP67 (water and dust resistant) | Battery life : 6 mo. per charge | Replaceable battery : No (rechargeable) | Distance for left-behind alerts : 350 ft. Android, 900 ft. iPhone | Phone finder function : Yes, via Chipolo app The Chipolo Loop is a souped up version of our top pick, the Chipolo Pop. Instead of a matte plastic disc with a hole in it, the Loop has a smooth face and a silicone attachment tab. Plus, it’s USB-C rechargeable and comes in more (and more fun) colors. You’ll pay $10 more for those upgrades — and it’s debatable whether it's easier to recharge a device every six months or swap in a new battery once a year — so our top pick is still the Pop. But if rechargeability is what you’re after, the Loop delivers, plus it has reliable finding chops, a simple setup and unique extra features. The Chipolo Loop will work with either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub (but only one at a time). Pairing was braindead easy, just press the button on your new loop and do what it says on your phone. When I tested how quickly the finding community located a lost Loop, the results were the same as for other trackers using the two major finding networks: I was alerted to its discovery in about seven minutes when connected to Apple’s system and a little over 20 minutes on Google’s. The fob itself also worked as intended when locating misplaced items in my house. I tossed it willy-nilly into my bedroom and used my phone to make it ring from across the house. When I left it in the (unattached) garage, I could get it to play a sound from my porch, and it was audible enough for me to hear. It also has a flashing LED light, but it’s so small as to be irrelevant. What puts the Loop above other rechargeable trackers such as the Pebblebee Universal, is the extra features it imparts — solving shortcomings for both Apple and Google’s finding apps. For example, neither Google nor Apple’s finding apps let you use your fob to find your phone — but with the Chipolo app installed, double squeezing the Loop makes your phone ring (even on silent mode). While Android phones natively let you set the volume of the tracker, iPhones don’t — unless you have the Chipolo app. Apple’s Find My gives users left-behind alerts but Google’s Find Hub doesn’t. Chipolo’s app restores that feature to Android users so they get a ping when their phone ventures away from the tracker. The only drawback there is that you can’t set “safe” locations, such as your home. That means your phone will ping you every time you leave your Loop behind, even if you leave it at home. That’s fine for something you always want to have, like your keys, but could get annoying for things you don't always need to bring, like a jacket or luggage. Luckily you can enable left-behind alerts on a per-item basis. Because these extra features are handled through the company’s app, you’ll need to enable notifications and allow it to run in the background. When I did so, I didn’t notice a significant battery draw from the Chipolo app on either my iPhone or Galaxy handset. Pros Attractive design and colors Rechargeable battery Allows you to find your phone with the Chipolo app Good Bluetooth range Multiple ring tone options and adjustable volume Cons The LED light isn't very noticeable No option to set ""safe"" locations for left behind alerts (Android only) $39 at Amazon Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget Format : Oblong fob with hole | Compatibility : Samsung phones | Water resistance : IP67 (water and dust-resistant) | Battery life : 16 months | Replaceable battery : Yes | Distance for left-behind alerts : 1,300 ft. | Phone finder function : Yes Nothing can beat the vastness of Apple’s Find My network, since it relies on every nearby iPhone to help locate AirTags. The number of Samsung phones in the US may be smaller than the number of Apple handsets out there, but it’s still significant. The new SmartTag 2 relies on those phones to offer a finding network that may not best Apple’s, but it was the first tag to offer anything close to Apple's network. Of course, now that Google has it's own expanded Find Hub network, Samsung's network falls to third place in terms of size. The SmartTag 2 only works with Samsung devices and after testing one out with a Galaxy S23, I was impressed how quickly it was able to find tagged items out in the wild, though the precision didn’t quite match that of Apple. Of all the trackers I’ve tried, I like the design of the SmartTag the best. It’s an oblong fob with a big hole for attaching directly to your keys, or you can buy the optional silicone case and ring Samsung offers. Its volume is louder than the AirTag and the Tile Pro, but not as loud as either the Chipolo One or the Pebblebee Clip. You can also change the tag’s ringtone or double squeeze it to ring your handset, both things that you can’t do with AirTags. Setup is simple as well: once you remove the plastic pull tab, your phone senses the tracker and walks you through the standard permissions (location services, notifications) and warnings (don’t use the tracker on people). The companion app, SmartThings Find, tracks your Samsung devices and the SmartTag with an intuitive and clean Google Maps-based interface. As for how the tag works in practice, I found the left behind alerts triggered reliably when I got about three blocks (1,200 feet or so) away when walking and about eight blocks away when driving. That’s far longer than Chipolo’s alerts, a little longer than Apple’s notifications and about on par with Tile’s left-behind feature. When the tag is out of range and you enable Lost Mode, you’ll get an alert when it’s spotted by another Samsung phone. The tag also uses NFC to display your contact info and a custom note to anyone who finds the tracker, regardless of the brand of smartphone they carry. Of course, whoever finds it would need to know to hold it to the back of their phone to get the message, and it was harder to trigger with my iPhone when the tag was in the silicone holder. To test the finding network, I asked a friend (without a phone in their pocket) to wander a half mile away with the tag. About 12 minutes after turning on Lost Mode, I got a message that the SmartTag was “spotted by a nearby device” with a dropped pin. I tapped Navigate in the app, which opened Google Maps and led me to a point directly across a moderately busy street from where my friend was standing. If I’d left the tag behind somewhere I’d recently been, just seeing the location on the map would have been enough to jog my memory as to where I might have dropped my stuff. But if someone had stolen the tagged item and I was wandering the streets trying to get it back, vigilante style, it may not have been precise enough to help. It may not be as accurate as the iPhone-and-AirTag combo, but the SmartTag 2 is a solid entry in the Bluetooth tracker market and a good option if you have a Samsung phone. Pros Finding network is large Attractive and useful design Cons Only works with Samsung phones $22 at Amazon Amy Skorheim for Engadget Format : Disc with hole | Compatibility : Android and iPhone | Water resistance : IPX6 (water spray resistant) | Battery life : 1 year | Replaceable battery : No (rechargeable) | Distance for left-behind alerts : 800 ft. (iPhone only) | Phone finder function : No The Clip Universal feels sturdy, with a strong metal ring encircling the fob. Built-in lights help you locate lost items in the dark and it can recharge using a standard USB-C port. Like the Chipolo Pop and Loop, the Clip Universal works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. In tests where I hid the fob out in the city, the respective apps accurately led me close enough to the tracker to ring it, but took longer than other fobs on the same networks. In tests around the house and in my garage, my tester phones didn’t connect to the Clip quite as quickly as they did to the Chipolo Pop. The Chipolo options also provide a few extra features, such as the ability to ring your phone, so they slightly edged out Pebblebee’s tracker. The Clip Universale does have two major perks, however. For one, it’s ear splittingly loud. My phone’s decibel meter app clocked it at 91dB — a level that can cause hearing damage if you’re exposed to it for too long. Paired with the flashing lights, it’s one of the easiest trackers to find. Another perk is the new personal safety feature called Alert . When you squeeze the tag five times, it triggers a loud siren, bright flashes from the LED light and sends a notification to people you designate within the Pebblebee app. There’s a free version that lets you designate one person and sends a static location or a $3 monthly version that notifies five people and sends a live location. Pros Loudest tracker we tested Rechargeable Acts as a safety siren Cons Not as easy to set up as other trackers Occasional connection blips $35 at Amazon What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get. Device compatibility Like most things from the folks in Cupertino, AirTags only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both Apple and Google have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags. Finding network Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe . Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range. Apple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a billion iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US Now that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running , it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices. Tile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users. In our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Loop and Pop and the Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus. Samsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking less than 20 minutes on average for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs. Separation alerts A tracker’s day-to-day utility becomes really apparent when it prevents you from losing something in the first place. Separation alerts tell you when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items. Useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house. Apple’s Find My app delivers these notifications, but Google’s Find Hub does not. However, if you have a Chipolo device and allow its companion app to run in the background on your Android phone, left-behind alerts are enabled. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $7 to $25 monthly). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere. In our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item. Connectivity and volume The feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say ""Hey Siri, where are my keys?"" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device. If you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop and Loop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and third-party tags using Google’s network don’t offer this feature. The volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels. Design and alternative formats Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories , which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring. You can even get trackers embedded into useful items like luggage locks. The SmartLock from KeySmart is a TSA-approved luggage lock, but in addition to the three digit code, it’s also a Bluetooth tracker that’s compatible with Apple Find My. It wasn’t quite as loud as other trackers in my tests, and the range wasn’t as long, but it paired easily and worked with Apple’s finding network just like an AirTag. Battery life AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs use replaceable batteries and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee Clip Universal Clip Universal and Chipolo Loop trackers are rechargeable via a standard USB-C port. They’re also equipped with onboard LEDs (though the light on the Loop is barely noticeable). Stalking, theft and data privacy AirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple , Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android. Last year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode , which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. As a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary . Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose. How we tested Bluetooth trackers Before deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options. Here’s the full list of every tracker we tested: After acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 followed by an iPhone 16 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 then an S23 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use. As new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Motorola Moto Tag The Moto Tag haunts me. At this very moment, my Galaxy phone says the fob is “Near you right now.” But I don’t know where. I tap to play a sound and the Find Hub tries, but ultimately says it can’t. I tap the Find Nearby function that’s supposed to visually guide you to the tag. I parade my phone around the house like a divining rod, take it down into the basement, walk it all over the garage. Nothing. But the Hub app unendingly says the Moto Tag is “Near you right now” and I get flashes of every old-school horror movie where the telephone operator tells the soon-to-be victim that the call is coming from inside the house. It’s partly my fault. I tend to keep good tabs on the gadgets I test for work. But during my most recent move, the tiny green disc didn’t make it into the safety of my review unit cabinet after relocation. Perhaps in retribution for my neglect, the Moto Tag keeps itself just out of reach. Taunting me. I’ll let you know if I ever find it, but in the meantime, it’s clear this finding device doesn’t want to be found. The recommended tags in this guide will serve you better. Tile Pro and Tile Mate (2024) Tile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models . In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices. There are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob. I tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal. For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the busiest place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker. In my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches. Tile devices work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers. Bluetooth tracker FAQs Which Bluetooth tracker has the longest range? Both the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker. Remember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members. What is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car? Bluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose. How accurate are Bluetooth trackers? Accuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Apple’s AirTags also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker. Accurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks). Recent Updates October 2025 : Added Chipolo Loop as a new pick for best rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. Detailed our experience with the Moto Tag and KeySmart SmartLock.

9c4972081638,The best live TV streaming services to cut cable in 2025,"youtube tv, streaming service, streaming service, youtube tv, tv streaming services, tv streaming, nfl, netflix, sling, hulu, directv, nfl, los angeles chargers, kansas city chiefs","We still think getting a live TV streaming service is a better deal than paying for cable — but the gulf between the two options is narrowing. Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it’s not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. There are a handful of major players and, after testing them all, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But there are a lot of changes happening in the world of live TV streaming, with new services from ESPN and Fox , as well as the upcoming consolidation of Hulu into Disney . We’re testing out the new services and we’ll let you know how the new options affect your options. For now, these are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our breakdowns of how to stream and what you get for your money. Editor's note : There’s been a lot of hubbub in the streaming world lately. YouTube TV subscribers nearly missed out on access to NBC Universal channels — but the companies ultimately came to a multi-year agreement . Disney (and by extension Hulu+ Live TV) lost a whole bunch of subscribers over free speech dissent — and then announced a price hike for Hulu+ Live TV, bringing it to $90 monthly. Philo implemented a $5 monthly price increase , but users will now get to watch HBO Max and Discovery+, so it’s not all bad. Speaking of HBO Max, customers will no longer get CNN’s livestream as of November 17 because the latter entity is going to try yet again to offer its own service. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 YouTube TV Price : $83/mo. and up | Simultaneous at-home streams : 3 | Total channels : 100+ (base plan) | DVR limits : Unlimited, 9 mo. expiration | Multiview : Yes (select programming) | Contract : No | Free trial : Yes (length varies) In mid-December of 2024, subscribers got a bummer of an email letting them know the price of YouTube TV would be going up yet again , this time to $83, which is a $10 hike from the last increase of $8 in March of 2023 . Even still, Google’s option makes a strong case for delivering the best streaming service for live TV. Compared to our top pick for sports, YouTube TV covers major and minor teams, regional games and national matchups almost as well. It gives you clear navigation, a great search function, unlimited DVR and broad network coverage. But, even beyond the price increase, YTTV is financially precarious if you're not great at resisting temptation. Upon signup, you’re presented with nearly 50 different add-ons, including 4K resolution, premium channels and themed packages. Even if you fight the urge to roll Max, Shudder and AcornTV into the mix at signup, the enticement remains as it’s dangerously easy to add more to your subscription — when I searched for a program on a network I didn’t have, I was prompted to add it. And of course, you can also rent or buy movies that aren’t currently showing on any channels, just like you can via YouTube. While it’s convenient to be able to order up anything I might want on a whim, I could easily see this pushing one’s bill far above Google’s listed price per month. Still, it’s nice to have all your entertainment in one place. And if you only want the add-ons, you can actually subscribe to most of the standalone networks without paying for the base plan. Either way, you get a familiar user experience, with navigation you’ll recognize if you’ve spent any time on regular ol’ YouTube. Unsurprisingly, Google’s search function was the best of the bunch, finding the shows and games I searched for quickly and giving me clear choices for how to watch and record. At signup, you’ll also pick the shows, networks and teams you like, which are added to your library. YouTube TV then automatically records them. You get unlimited cloud DVR space (though recordings expire after nine months) and it’s dead simple to add programming to your library. Like a real cable experience, YouTube TV autoplays your last-watched program upon startup by default, but it was the only service that allowed me to turn that feature off by heading to the settings. Searching for and recording an upcoming game was easy. Once the game was recorded, I had to hunt a little to find it in my library (turns out single games are listed under the Events heading, not Sports). But after that, playback was simple and included a fascinating extra feature: You can either play a recorded game from the beginning or hit Watch Key Plays. The latter gives you between 12 and 20 highlight snippets, each about 10 seconds long. It focuses on the most impressive shots in an NBA bout and includes every goal in an MLS matchup. The feature was available for NCAA basketball and in-season major American leagues (hockey, soccer and basketball at the time of testing). Foreign and more minor games didn’t have the feature. Sports fans will also appreciate the new multiview feature that YouTube TV added mid-2024 that lets you pick up to four sports, news and weather channels from a select list and view them all at the same time on your screen. If you find yourself constantly flipping back and forth between games, this could save you some hassle. YouTube TV also gives you the most in-app settings. You can add parental controls to a profile or pull up a stats menu that shows your buffer health and connection speeds. You can lower playback resolution for slow connections and even send feedback to YouTube. It was also the best at integrating VOD and live programming. For example, when I searched for a show that happened to be playing live, a red badge in the corner of the show’s image let me know it was on right then. I know it makes no difference whether I watch an on-demand recording or a live show, but I like the imagined sense of community knowing someone else might be watching this episode of Portlandia too. Pros Intuitive and smooth interface Accurate search functions Cool multiview feature Good coverage of sports, news and linear programming networks Cons Very easy to overspend on extras The price keeps going up $83 at YouTube TV Fubo Price : $56/mo. and up | Simultaneous at-home streams : 10 | Total channels : 215 (base plan) | DVR limits : Unlimited, 9 mo. expiration | Multiview : Yes (select programming) | Contract : No | Free trial : Yes (length varies) You may have heard about the announcement of the merger between Fubo and Hulu + Live TV and find yourself wondering how that’ll affect the two services. For now, the companies plan to operate the two as separate entities, but will use their combined power to leverage carrier and content deals. Such deals are no doubt behind Fubo's latest package, a sports-focused plan that goes for $56 per month. Fubo Sports includes 20 sports and broadcast networks including ABC, CBS and FOX as well as ACC Network, Big 10 Network, CBS Sports Network and the ESPN stations available with the ESPN Unlimited plan. Fox News and FS1 and 2 are also included. For college and pro football fans, this package comes the closest to having most of what you need to watch most live games. For that reason and others, our top pick for live sports coverage is Fubo . When you first sign up, it asks which teams you follow across all kinds of associations. Pick teams from in-season leagues and you’ll quickly have DVR content to watch. That’s because Fubo records every game your chosen teams play as long as it’s aired on a supported channel – and its sports coverage is vast. I tested out the top-tier package and the guide said there were 118 sports networks to choose from. In addition to the usual suspects from ESPN, Fox, NBC and CBS, you can watch motorsports, international leagues, adventure sports and even poker. Add-ons give you NBA TV, NHL Network, NFL Red Zone and MLB Network. And if you need access to all one thousand games the NBA plays in a season, you can add the NBA League Pass to your lineup for $17 per month. Fubo even has its own sports channels. And in August 2025, Fubo added access to ESPN+ for subscribers to its Pro, Essential, Elite and Deluxe plans. It does require setting up a MyDisney account, which you can learn about here . The only notable lack for sports fans is the absence of TBS and TNT which have licensing deals to show some NBA, MLB, NHL and NCAA games. Still, the coverage is comprehensive. The UI designers obviously put effort into making everything easy to find with endless categorization, including breaking down sports offerings by type, giving lots of filtering options for live guide and on-demand content, as well as including interesting groupings on the home page. Fubo also makes finding and recording your favorite games easy. Searching for an upcoming game was simple, as was sifting through the ample amount of recorded games I ended up with. I particularly liked FanView for live games, which inserts the video into a smaller window and surrounds that window with continually updating stats plus a clickable list of other games currently airing. But, unfortunately, the feature isn't currently available. Hopefully Fubo will bring it back, as it was a differentiating perk for the service. Fubo did recently expand its multiview feature, letting you watch up to four live channels at once. This feature used to only be available on Apple TV boxes and only with sports fare, but I used it in January 2025 with a Roku device and was able to have two NCAA men’s games, my local evening news and CSI Miami from ion Mystery all up on the screen at the same time. Fubo has made an obvious effort to win at sports, but recently it’s tried to deliver on the live TV experience as well. Based on what I've seen so far, it's certainly made strides. The guide was impressive in the number of ways it let you organize live TV, yet everything felt clean and uncluttered. The Home, Sports, Shows and Movies pages were filled with recommendations and many iterations of categories, with almost all suggestions being live TV. The focus on live TV can make the VOD and DVR playback functions feel second-rate. The search function wasn’t the best at finding the shows I looked for, and navigating available VOD content wasn’t as breezy as browsing through live programming. The lack of a pop-up preview window as you fast forward or rewind through recordings makes it tough to gauge where you are in a show. At $85, this is technically the most expensive base package (now that DirectTV offers a 26-channel, sports-only package). And it's now $2 more than YouTube TV and Hulu+ TV, which are both $83. But if you need all the sports – and want some nicely organized live TV during the few moments when there’s not a game on – this is the way to go. It’s worth noting that a lapsed Fubo subscription will let you access a truncated version of the service for free . When my subscription expired after testing, I received an email detailing the content I could still watch without re-upping my payments. It’s similar to other free ad supported TV streamers, with a limited channel selection through the same Fubo interface. Pros Best coverage of sports networks Automatically records your favorite teams Informative FanView feature Uncluttered live TV interface Cons DVR and VOD experience is inferior to the live component $85 at Fubo Hulu Price : $90/mo. and up | Simultaneous at-home streams : 2 | Total channels : 95+ (base plan) | DVR limits : Unlimited, 9 mo. expiration | Multiview : No | Contract : No | Free trial : Yes (3 days) In what seems to be a yearly tradition, the price of Hulu+ Live TV has gone up again. In October 2023, the lowest tier jumped to $77 per month. In October the following year, it went to $83. And now, in the blessed year 2025, Hulu+ Live TV subscriptions start at $90 per month (for reference, the service was $40 monthly when it debuted in 2017 ). Those price jumps are a little easier to take when you consider that you get a lot of content you can’t find elsewhere; the service comes bundled with Disney+, ESPN+ and includes Hulu’s original programming. So if you’re already a Hulu and Disney+ subscriber, it probably makes the most sense for you to go with Hulu’s live component. Note that $90 gets you that content with ads — for ad-free Disney+ and Hulu, it’s $100 monthly. There’s no telling if pricing will change further when Hulu undergoes expected changes. First, there was the announcement of the merger between the service and Fubo. Then in August 2025, Disney shared its plans to combine the on-demand Hulu with Disney+ in 2026 . For now, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV and Disney+ will all operate as separate entities, but Variety reported on plans for Hulu+ Live TV to also be rolled into Disney+ at some point next year. As it stands now, Hulu + Live TV carries your local affiliates and most of the top cable channels. For sports, you get all available ESPN iterations plus FS1, FS2, TBS, USA, NBC Golf, the NFL Network and TNT (Turner Network Television). You can also add on premium VOD channels like Max and Showtime, and it’s the only provider that includes Disney+ at no extra cost. Navigation isn’t as smooth as most of the other options — as I used Hulu + Live TV, it felt like the live component had been shoehorned into the standard Hulu app. But for viewers who are already comfortable with (and paying for) Hulu and Disney+, this might be the best pick for your live TV subscription. Pros Includes Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ progrmming $83 at Hulu DirecTV Price : Free, $20/mo. and up | Simultaneous at-home streams : Unlimited | Total channels : 105 (free), 9 - 185 (paid) | DVR limits : Unlimited (9-month expiration, maximum of 30 episodes per series) | Multiview : Yes (select mixes) | Contract : No | Free trial : Yes (5 days) In mid-April, DirecTV Stream rebranded . Streaming is now the company’s primary offering and is simply called DirecTV . Customers looking for the original satellite TV service can still find it, but it’s nested within the streaming option on the website, with a disclaimer that states the dish-enabled plan is only for those who don’t have high-speed internet at home. It’s interesting to see a more traditional satellite provider shift its focus to streaming — a move that’s clearly intended to better compete with YouTube TV and other similar services. The good news is that streaming with DirecTV requires no contract (the satellite plan still assesses a $20-per-month early termination fee). There’s no special equipment involved unless you want to get the Gemini Air streaming device. The HDMI streaming dongle supports 4K resolution, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and HDR10+, similar to the 4K streaming sticks from Roku or Amazon that cost around $50. But you can’t buy the Gemini Air. Instead, you lease it for $10 per month, which, after five months or so, might start to feel like a bad deal. It’s still the service that most closely resembles cable, complete with numbered channels and somewhat confusing plan structures. You can go for Signature packages , which range from $85 per month to $170 per month — those are most comparable to YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV and Fubo. Or you can sign up for one of the four Genre Packs which cost $35, $40 or $70 monthly. These slimmed-down channel lineups focus on sports, entertainment, news or Spanish language stations. The entertainment pack reminds me of Philo and the sports offerings have a whiff of Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. In good news for sports fans, the company recently announced that subscribers to any DirecTV Signature Package or the MySports Genre Pack will gain access to the Unlimited version of ESPN's service at no extra charge once it’s live. DirecTV customers with a Gemini device will also get access to the Disney+ and Hulu basic bundle. Regardless of which plan you end up going with, it’s all based on the DirecTV streaming app, which you can download and watch for free, (like Tubi or Pluto TV), but once you add a plan or pack, the channels you paid for are unlocked. Comparing the $85-per-month Entertainment Signature Package (not to be confused with the $35 MyEntertainment Genre Pack) to YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV’s $83 base plans, the offerings are pretty similar. You get your area’s five major local channels (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, PBS), nearly all of the 20 most popular channels (with the exception of Ion and the History Channel), sports channels that include ESPN, TNT, and FS1, plus unlimited DVR space with a nine-month expiration. The navigation and performance of the service remains largely unchanged from when we first started recommending it. I like the experience of flipping from one numbered channel to the next — it reminds me of watching TV as a kid, plus it’s great for serendipitously finding something to watch when you’re bored. The top navigation is pretty simple, with options for search, home, the live TV guide, your DVR library and on-demand content. The guide doesn’t split the channels into a ton of categories, just recent, sports, kids, movies and TV shows. There’s also a favorites channels list, which you can add to from the guide. There’s still no way to stop whatever is playing as you browse the guide — something I find irritating, but it might not bother everyone. As you watch a show in the live guide, you can press your remote’s right D-pad button to advance to the next numbered channel and hitting the left button takes you to the preceding channel. If you want to rewind or fast forward, you have to first hit the center/enter/OK button and then you can control playback. That took me a minute to get used to, but wasn’t a huge learning curve. Pressing up shows you a few recent channels and the down button creates an inset of the show you’re watching alongside some suggested similar programming, popular channels, your continue-watching content and more browsing categories. A new multiview feature lets you pick from seven “mixes,” each of which contains four channels that you can watch all at once in a grid on the same screen. There’s a mix for sports, news, business, kids, local and more and it’s available to subscribers to the Signature packages and the MySports genre pack. I found it pretty simple to navigate DirecTV once I got the hang of it. That simplicity extends to the way it looks as well, with plain grids in grey and blue tones. Some might find that minimalism refreshing and clean. I found it a little uninspired — I wasn't as excited to browse as I’ve been with other apps. Navigation is also a little slow. Compared to watching other live content (on the same TV with the same internet connection), DirecTV channels always took a second or two longer to load. The search function requires you to input your entire query then hit Done to see your results. Other services start showing findings as you type. Again, the results are organized into three categories: shows, movies or all. If there’s something on a channel you’re not subscribed to, it’ll prompt you to go online and sign up for the channel. You can’t do it through the app, like you can with some services. You might find that annoying or be thankful for the slight bit of friction it adds to spending more money. $0 - $170 at Direct TV Sling TV Price : Free, $20/mo. and up | Simultaneous at-home streams : 1 (Orange), 3 (Blue), 3 (Select) | Total channels : 600+ (free), 10 - 50 | DVR limits : 50 hours | Multiview : No | Contract : No | Free trial : No To me, the idea of spending time fine-tuning channel choices sounds exhausting. But if you’re the type who wants to get exactly what you want without paying for too much of what you don’t, Sling TV may be your best bet. It breaks its base plan into two packages, Blue and Orange, with different channels on each. Sling snuck in a price increase at the tail end of 2024 and now Blue costs $51 a month. It carries a larger number of networks, while Orange seems to have spent its lineup dollars on ESPN and ESPN 2. But even at the new $46 monthly, Sling Orange is still the cheapest way to get those two sports outlets ( ESPN+ is only $12 monthly, but doesn’t show all of ESPN’s content.) In August 2025, Sling introduced Day Passes that let you watch channels on the Orange plan for just $5. There are also weekend and week-long passes to choose from , so if there’s just a game or two you want to watch, this is probably the cheapest way to do it — just make sure Sling Orange includes the channels that air the events you want to watch. It's worth noting that Disney , and subsequently Warner Bros Discovery , have filed suits against Sling for offering these short-term packages, so there's a chance the mini plans may not be around long. Sling also added another plan to its lineup. The Select plan includes National Geographic, FX, the NFL Network, FS1, Fox News and more. In some markets, subscribers will also get their local ABC, NBC and Fox stations. The plan goes for $20, $25 or $30 depending on the number of local stations available. After picking a plan, you can choose from a stable of add-on packages, with monthly prices ranging from $6 to $11. These include blocks of sports or lifestyle channels, kid-friendly fare, the Discovery+ bundle and a news package. There are 29 individual premium offerings, including AMC+, Starz, MGM+, Shudder and Acorn, which go for between $2 and $10 per month. Sling has pay-per-view movies, too. As far as local coverage, Sling Blue grants access to ABC, Fox and NBC local affiliates in about 20 of the larger US markets including Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, NYC, Miami and DC. ABC coverage began in March 2023. That raised the price of Sling Blue in supported markets from $40 to $45. For people not in those areas (or who opt for Orange) Sling suggests getting an HD antenna to catch local stations for free. Sling now offers select sports in 4K . You'll need a Roku, Amazon Fire or Apple TV device that supports 4K (and a compatible TV) but for no extra charge, you'll get to certain sports events with a bump in resolution. Sling's navigation is speedy and the interface is nicely organized, putting an emphasis on what you like to watch, with recommendations that are pretty accurate. The UI also makes the add-ons you’ve chosen easy to find. In my tests, though, the app froze a number of times as I navigated. While most services froze once or twice, it happened enough times with Sling to frustrate me. I had to force quit or back out of the app and start over five or six times during the three weeks of testing. Compared to others, Sling’s DVR allowance is on the stingy side, only giving you 50 hours of recordings, though they won't expire. You can pay for more DVR storage, but that will increase your overall costs. I tried not to wander too far off-path during testing, but I feel it’s my duty to inform you that Sling has an Elvis channel, a Bob Ross channel and ALF TV (yes, an entire station devoted to the ‘80s sitcom starring a puppet). There’s also a Dog TV network intended to be played for your dogs when you leave the house, which you can add to Sling or get as a standalone app for $10 per month. Pros More affordable than most live services Orange plan is the cheapest way to get ESPN Highly customizable packages Cons Only 50 hours of DVR allowance Local channels only in major metro areas $46 and up at Sling TV Philo Price : $28/mo. and up | Simultaneous at-home streams : 3 | Total channels : 70+ (base plan) | DVR limits : Unlimited, 1 yr. expiration | Multiview : No | Contract : No | Free trial : Yes (7 days) Philo held out at $25 monthly for a few years but increased to $28 in 2024 and added add AMC+ to lessen the blow (and it has some good shows !). Then in late 2025, the price went up again — this time to $33 monthly — but added access to the ad-supported tiers of HBO Max and Discovery+. Users will be able to watch those channels through the HBO or Discovery app, using their Philo account for access. Despite the bump, it’s still one of the cheapest ways to get a cordless live TV experience. Philo’s free offerings recently increased as well, bumping up to more than 100 channels . The biggest caveat is that you won’t find any local stations or sports programming on Philo. If that’s not an issue, the service is great, with a clean, streamlined interface and generous DVR limits. I’m a fan of minimalist design, so I appreciated presentation of the menus and guide. There are just four top navigation headings: Home, Guide, Saved and Search. And instead of the usual guide layout that stretches out or shortens a show’s listing to represent its air time, Philo’s guide features monospaced squares in chronological order with the duration of the program inside the square. Another nice touch is when you navigate to a square, it fills with a live video of the show or movie. Philo doesn’t limit the amount of programming you can DVR and lets you keep recordings for a full year, which is more than the nine months other providers allow. Like all live TV streamers, Philo won’t let you fast forward VOD programming. If skipping commercials is important to you, I recommend taking advantage of that unlimited DVR policy and hitting “Save” on any show or movie you think you may want to watch, then fast forwarding it on playback (you can do this with all the services we tried). As far as channels, Philo covers many of the top cable networks, with notable exceptions including Fox News, CNN, ESPN and MSNBC. Anyone looking for great news coverage should look elsewhere anyway, but the lack of a few must-have entertainment outlets like Bravo and Freeform was a little disappointing. The 100 or so channels in Philo’s free service are baked into the paid plan, bringing the total to 170, which is a pretty good deal for under $30 monthly. Pros Affordable Minimalist and easy interface Unlimited DVR allowance that lasts for a year Cons No sports or local access Limited news coverage $28 at Philo Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One . NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix . YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package ), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here . Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix . Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming . The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream , Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree . But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Tubi Local channels : A few | Sports coverage : Replays and shows about sports | On-demand : Yes | Total channels : 260 | Profiles per account : 1 You can watch Tubi without signing up, but doing so lets you make lists, add your favorite shows and channels, and remember where you left off in a program. There are a couple hundred live channels including dozens of regional Fox stations (which ones you see will depend on your location). You also get news-stream channels like NBC News Now, Fox Live Now and ABC News Live. Fox is Tubi’s parent company so there are picks like Fox Sports on Tubi, Fox Soul and Fox Weather as well. Around a dozen sports channels, channels devoted to true crime, dramas, comedy and lifestyle shows round out the complete lineup . The live TV category lives in the side rail navigation, along with tabs for on-demand movies, TV shows, kids stuff and a categories section. Those sub-categories are lengthy with topics like Actors Turned Directors, Martial Arts Mayhem and Werewolf Mysteries. Within the live TV tab, the channels are also divided into categories so you can find news, sports and local fare along with genres like comedy, drama and sci-fi channels. Navigation is speedy and settings include useful features like parental controls, autoplay options and closed captioning modifiers. It’s an overall smooth experience — the only mild irritants I found is that the TV guide only stays open for 10 seconds if you’re not actively clicking around and your current show keeps playing as you browse the guide. Pros Free with no sign-in required Shows some local Fox and ABC stations Appealing on-demand content Highly detailed categories sections for VOD Cons Channel guide disappears after 10 seconds Current show continues playing as you browse Free at Tubi Plex Local channels : No | Sports coverage : Replays and shows about sports | On-demand : Yes | Total channels : 800+ | Profiles per account : 15 (with a free Plex Home acct) Plex is not just an expansive FAST service with more than 500 live TV channels in most areas — it’s also a great tool for your other streaming pursuits. The search function will tell you which other services currently carry a particular title. I searched for Dept. Q , High Potential , Sinners and Willow and found I could watch those shows and movies with a subscription to Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and Disney+, respectively. You can also search for content by actor or director and rent movies directly from Plex. In 2024, Plex added movie and show reviews culled from other Plex users and professional critics — users can even share their reviews with friends on the service, creating a Letterboxd -like social media element. The search function can be slow (though it has improved over time) and, from what I’ve seen, it accurately directs you to the correct provider. It’s a thoroughly great live TV service too, with plenty of channels, good organization and an easy to navigate interface. Pros Good selection of free live channels Helpful and accurate search for any title Detailed organization that's not overly complicated Free at Plex Sling Local channels : A few | Sports coverage : Replays and shows about sports | On-demand : Yes | Total channels : 400+ | Profiles per account : 4 (with sign-up) | Like DirecTV, Prime Video and Fubo, Sling offers a no-cost version of its paid service within the same app. If you pay for Sling, you won’t see the Freestream framing, but the channels are still available. Without a subscription, you can access more than 400 channels of free stuff, including news networks like BBC News, CBS News 24/7, ABC News live, Bloomberg and Cheddar news, along with a slew of regional Fox and CBS news stations. The sports offerings are pretty slim, but there are plenty of entertainment channels, AMC content, true crime stations and lots of channels devoted to a single show ( Doctor Who , Farscape , Portlandia and Kim’s Convenience to name a few). The navigation is a little clunkier to navigate than other services, with a mix of nested vertical and horizontal menus and different functions for your remote’s buttons depending on what screen you’re on. Whatever you’re watching pops up in a small picture-in-picture window when you go to the guide — and I particularly appreciate that the window is easy to close so you can browse in peace. Pros Good national news network selection Nicely organized interface Your current show becomes a pop-out as you browse and is easily closed Cons Often asks you to sign up for paid Sling plans Free at Sling Pluto TV Local channels : A few | Sports coverage : Replays and shows about sports | On-demand : Yes | 4K live streams : No | Total channels : 250+ | Profiles per account : 1 | Picture-in-picture : No | Multiview : No | Contract : No Pluto TV is granularly organized, separating out nearly two dozen categories for its live content — including local CBS news and a sports section that includes CBS Sports HQ, NBC Sports Now, channels for NFL, NBA and MLB, NBC Golf Pass and about two dozen more. There’s also plenty of Star Trek to go around and a bunch of Pluto’s own stations like Pluto History, Nick Jr Pluto, CSI Pluto, Pluto True Crime and a few Pluto Classic TV stations. A lot of that content, of course, comes courtesy of Pluto’s parent company, Paramount . The live news-stream selection is fairly stacked and includes NBC News Now, ABC News Live, CNN Headlines, BBC News, Sky News and others. One thing I have to point out is that whatever you’re watching keeps playing and you can just see a sliver of the show above the guide as you browse, which I found distracting. But I did enjoy being able to flip from channel to channel using the up and down buttons on my remote’s D-pad, just like old-school cable surfing. Pros Highly organized guide Lots of Paramount-owned content Cons Your current show plays under the guide Free at Pluto TV Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app . Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna , you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations , and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max ( formerly , er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on . You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV ) includes some MLB games . Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi . While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited . Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month , sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on , after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV ( FAST ) including Freevee , Tubi , PlutoTV and Sling Freestream . These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel , the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV . Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town . I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen . Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million . How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

PayPal's stablecoin, which it debuted in 2023 , is supposed to be redeemable at a 1:1 rate for US dollars. $300 trillion is more than double the entire world's current GDP of $117 trillion. In short, that's a really bad mistake from Paxos. At least the action did appear to be a mistake. Paxos acknowledged the issue in a post on X, assuring clients that their funds are secure and stating that it burned the excess reserves of stablecoins.

Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor . Veo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025 . The new model offers better ""prompt adherence,"" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image ""ingredients"" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3. VIDEO In Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls ""Frame to Video,"" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature , but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too. Based on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2 , though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-31-is-better-at-generating-videos-from-images-220829129.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r.IdkXq0YDNDw2YDlk5ZLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Veo_3.1_-_Designed_to_empower_creatives_0-1_screenshot.png,2025-10-15T22:08:29+00:00,0cfe8cfddd858d1ea63b73ae75cc0effbd267546

c63770e14bb1,Razer's new Kiyo V2 webcams offer 4K streaming with HDR,razer,"Razer is updating its lineup of creator-focused webcams with two new models, the Razer Kiyo V2 and Razer Kiyo V2 X . The webcams offer new AI-powered features and 4K streaming at a more affordable price than the company's Kiyo Pro webcams . The $100 Kiyo V2 X is capable of capturing 720p video at either 60 or 30 frames per second, 1080p video at 24, 30 or 60 frames per second and 1440p video at 60 frames per second. Like some of Razer's other webcams, the Kiyo V2 X has a wide, 83-degree field of view that can be customized with the company's Synapse software. The webcam doesn't have the AI-powered features of the V2, but you do get all the basics, like auto-focus, a privacy shutter and a built-in microphone. VIDEO For about $50 more, the Kiyo V2 offers higher-quality capture and a few more automated features. The $150 webcam uses an 8.3MP Sony STARVIS image sensor and can capture true 4K HDR footage at 30 frames per second. The V2 also has a slightly wider field of view than the V2 X, at 93 degrees to the V2 X's 83 degrees. Razer is using that extra wiggle room to offer auto-framing — similar to Apple's Center Stage feature — through an integration with Reincubate's Camo Studio software. The Kiyo V2 can keep you in frame, remove your background and offer ""adaptive lighting correction,"" all with the new software improvements Razer and Reincubate are adding. While both webcams are pitched as creator tools, the basic features Razer is offering and the prices its offering them at easily make the Kiyo V2 and V2 X worth considering. At $150, the Kiyo V2 is only slightly more expensive than Engadget's favorite webcam and should, if Razer’s claims are true, offer even better video performance. Razer says you can purchase the Kiyo V2 X and Kiyo V2 today, for $100 and $150, respectively.",https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/razers-new-kiyo-v2-webcams-offer-4k-streaming-with-hdr-211411212.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oKOUK_hVRZCLxsjI6OhANw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Razer-Kiyo-V2.jpg,2025-10-15T21:14:11+00:00,2d9626c450dd4f213b1172144a144f7554256795

923d0bead476,Honor is making a smartphone with a fold-out camera,"artificial intelligence, robot phone","Device maker Honor has revealed that one of its upcoming smartphones will offer an unusual design choice. While many manufacturers push to have more numerous and powerful cameras in their products, the Chinese company will put the camera for its new phone on a pop-out mechanical arm. According to CNBC , the design of this so-called ""robot phone"" is meant to showcase Honor's AI capabilities as the company makes a $10 billion investment in artificial intelligence over the next five years. Honor hasn't shared too much about this product, but will likely have more details during next year's Mobile World Congress. Honor has experimented with unusual form factors before, including a surreally thin foldable smartphone and a laptop with a detachable webcam , and we've even seen a similar concept of a pop-up camera several years back in products like the OnePlus 7 Pro phone. The idea to swing out a camera could offer some interesting options for image and video capture, but it's also a prime place for mechanical failures and high manufacturing costs.",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/honor-is-making-a-smartphone-with-a-fold-out-camera-201555268.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SypkmSZn0nkWoE5MMSM45A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Njk-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Honor_fold-out_camera.jpg,2025-10-15T20:15:55+00:00,c32bfd0642e19842609de17060be7eb93f97bd23
0202933f47a3,Apple's M5 chip pushes AI performance with new 'Neural Accelerators',"apple, apple, performance","Like clockwork, Apple has introduced a new M-series chip on updated versions of the iPad Pro , MacBook Pro and for the first time, Apple Vision Pro. The new M5 chip shares plenty of similarities with the M4 chip Apple introduced in 2024, but the biggest seems to be a focus on improving graphics and AI performance. The M5 chip is made using a new third-generation 3nm process, according to Apple, with an updated 10-core GPU architecture on all versions that offers four times the peak GPU compute performance of the M4, while carrying over support for things like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The M5 also features a 10-core CPU, just like the M4, with six efficiency and up to four performance cores. The M5 chip configurations for the iPad Pro. (Apple) That is unless you're buying an M5 iPad Pro. The 1TB and 2TB models of the Pro feature a 10-core CPU and GPU, but if you opt for a smaller storage size of 256GB or 512GB, you'll get a nine-core CPU with six efficiency cores and three performance cores. Apple says the 10-core CPU offers ""up to 15 percent faster multithreaded performance"" over the M4 chip, though it's not clear if that's due to the CPU or memory improvements. That’s because the new chip offers an improved memory bandwidth of 153GB/s, up from the starting 120GB/s bandwidth on the M4, though less than what you can get with the M4 Pro or M4 Max . Apple will likely release M5 versions of both chips next year, but it's worth knowing what you're missing if you opt for the M5 right now. The performance gains Apple was able to squeeze out of its new GPU and improved memory bandwidth seem like the biggest changes users will actually notice from the M5. That includes ""up to 30 percent faster"" graphics performance than the M4 and ""up to a 45 percent graphics uplift in apps using ray tracing."" Apple introduced the M4 with a focus on dynamic caching and ray tracing, and it seems like the M5 makes both graphical processes more efficient. The gains are apparently even more noticeable on the M5 Vision Pro, where the headset can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate, up from the 100Hz max Apple guaranteed before, and is now able to render ""10 percent more pixels."" AI performance is also improved, though not necessarily thanks to the M5's 16-core Neural Engine alone, which seems to be the same Neural Engine used in the M4. Instead, Apple's taking a new approach to AI processing by including dedicated ""Neural Accelerators"" in each core of its GPU. This extra help has led to faster performance when devices are using Apple Intelligence skills or AI-powered features like the Vision Pro's ability to generate a Persona, according to Apple. In-depth testing and benchmarking of Apple's new M5 devices will be required to accurately capture how the M5 chip changes things, especially when it comes to general CPU performance. For now, though, Apple's chips continue to get more graphically powerful, which bodes well for anyone who uses MacBooks and iPads for creative tasks, AI or playing games.",https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QvZRnieu3xAsS7VyM0DH4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Apple-M5-chip.jpg,2025-10-15T19:37:45+00:00,a4773dd3654d28b358bec3154d671c9ebfb608d3

These are free upgrades, with search getting a major AI boost. First of all, the pre-existing voice search feature is getting ""AI smarts."" This means that users will be able to ask contextual questions about movies, actors and shows. It's worth noting that the bot will deliver the answers on-screen and not via a digital voice. This can be used to help find something to watch, as Roku gives examples of people asking how scary a movie is or if something is safe for children to watch. A search bar is being added to the live TV page and it will scour all of the platform's free live channels to find a match. The search tool will also now give more accurate information as to which streaming platform to choose based on active subscriptions and what people are looking for. The dedicated Roku Sports page will be able to track live scores and will let viewers keep tabs on multiple games at once, thanks to matchup tiles. This can be shut off to keep things spoiler-free. The company's pre-existing Bluetooth Headphone Mode is rolling out to more devices, including the Roku Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus. This lets people connect headphones directly without having to use the dedicated app. Both of those made our list of the best streaming devices , so more functionality is always appreciated. The app is getting an overhaul, with new shortcuts and the ability to rate shows and movies directly within the app. The company has also revealed that Philips Ambilight technology is now available on Roku TVs in the US. This tech automatically changes the ambient lighting based on what's being shown on-screen. All of these software updates will be available to Roku devices in the coming months.

abba083be87c,The best VPN service for 2025,"vpns, proton vpn","As frustrating as it is that governments and businesses are running roughshod over our online freedoms, at least we have plenty of good VPNs to choose from to keep us protected online. There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place. On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood. I built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can't go too far wrong. For each VPN on this list, I've shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs. Editor's note: This list has been completely overhauled and rewritten as of September 2025. We intend to revisit this list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in pricing, features, testing results and other factors. Table of contents Best VPNs for 2025 Proton Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chromebook, Chrome, Firefox, Android TV, Apple TV, Firestick, routers | Average download speed drop: 12.5 percent | Server locations: 154 in 122 countries | Notable features: NetShield ad blocker, Secure Core servers, Tor over VPN | Best price: $107.76 for 24 months Read our full Proton VPN review Proton VPN clinches the top spot for one simple reason: it does everything right. All its closest competitors have one area in which they fall short — ExpressVPN doesn't have as many features, NordVPN can be irksome to use, Surfshark's pricing forces you into a long-term deal, and so on. Proton VPN isn't perfect, nor is it the best in every individual area, but it's the one VPN where I can't find a serious weakness no matter how I poke and prod. Proton's winning run starts with its excellently designed apps, which never feel cluttered or aggravating on any platform. Every feature is where you expect it to be, never demanding any digging or leaving you perplexed about what a certain setting is for. There's no drop-off in quality between platforms, either: Proton has clearly paid equally close attention to its clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. That ease of use extends to Proton VPN's impact on your browsing speeds. In my tests, it reduced my download speeds by an average of 12 percent worldwide and my upload speeds by only 4 percent, factors that are only noticeable on a connection that's very slow to begin with. Even more impressively, it held the global average ping below 300 ms — latency always increases with distance, but Proton's infrastructure keeps that number low. It's also a VPN uniquely devoted to security and privacy. As the only competitive VPN majority-owned by a nonprofit, Proton can focus on guaranteeing the rights of its users without being bought out or misusing its access to customers. Not only did it pass my leak tests without a scratch, but it's also a leader in physical VPN security — its Secure Core servers connect you through locations fortified in the real-world. All its servers use full-disk encryption, ensuring privacy from both hackers and Proton itself. Proton VPN also commits to its privacy mission in one more important way: offering a free plan with unlimited data you can use to stay anonymous online for as long as you want. You can't choose your server location, so it's no good for (as an example) unblocking a specific streaming service, but it's ideal if you just want to take security precautions without paying. Pros Keeps internet speeds fast Physically secured data centers Free plan with unlimited data Cons High proportion of virtual server locations Live chat support only for paid users $3.39 per month for 24 months at Proton ExpressVPN Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chromebook, Chrome, Android TV, Apple TV, Firestick, routers | Average download speed drop: 6.9 percent | Server locations: 164 in 105 countries | Notable features: Threat Manager tracker and malware blocker, Ad blocker, Parental controls, Aircove router | Best price: $97.72 for 28 months Read our full ExpressVPN review ExpressVPN is a high-performing VPN service with very few flaws. The only real issue keeping it from the top spot is that it remains a bit overpriced for the functionality it offers. That's why I've named it the best premium VPN — not the best overall, but worth paying extra for if you have the cash. That designation stands even after the new tiered pricing plans introduced in September 2025, which offer better value in the past, but are still generally pricier than equivalent plans from Proton and Surfshark. The best reasons to pick ExpressVPN are its apps, its speeds and its global server network. Let's take those in order. Each ExpressVPN client is stripped down to be as simple as software ever comes. The most complicated thing you'll do on any of them is pick server locations — everything else is a matter of clicking a button on or off. For a VPN beginner, or anyone who wants their service to run unobtrusively in the background, it's paradise. Speeds are even better than Proton VPN's, another way ExpressVPN earns its slightly higher price. In multiple daily tests across six different locations, my speed dropped an average of just 6.9 percent and my mean latency remained below 300. Upload speeds went down a miniscule 1.6 percent. It's hard to get much better than this (although Surfshark manages it). With 164 server locations in 105 different countries and territories, ExpressVPN has the largest server network of any VPN on this list. Closer servers grant better speeds, but a bigger network also increases your range of options for spoofed IP addresses — you'll be able to unblock streaming sites in more than half the world (and have plenty of fallback options in case one server fails). ExpressVPN doesn't have many additional features, but that's hard to complain about when it's so good at its most important job. Besides, it's not like there's nothing. You'll find a kill switch, malware detector, ad blocker and parental controls on all platforms, plus split tunneling on Windows, Android and macOS 10 and under. The Aircove router is also worth mentioning — as the only VPN router with its own interface, it's easy to operate and provide whole-house VPN coverage without technical knowledge. Pros Fast download and upload speeds Unblocks Netflix everywhere Easy-to-use apps Cons Few extra features Expensive plans $3.49 per month for 28 months at ExpressVPN Surfshark Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chromebook, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Apple TV, Fire TV, routers | Average download speed drop: 5.4 percent | Server locations: 141 in 100 countries | Notable features: Dynamic MultiHop, Everlink, IP rotator, unlimited simultaneous connections, CleanWeb, NoBorders mode | Best price: $53.73 for 28 months Read our full Surfshark review Since ""the fastest VPN"" is such a popular superlative for VPNs to tout about themselves, I want to make it clear what I mean. The fastest VPN is the one that reduces your speeds the least — it's exceedingly rare for a VPN to make your internet faster than it is normally. As a result, if you don't have a fast internet connection to start, you can't have a fast VPN. Also, there's no guarantee that Surfshark will always be the fastest, as the race at the top is continually close. With the disclaimer out of the way, here are the facts: Surfshark beat out every other VPN on the list in my speed tests. For each VPN, I pick six servers spaced evenly across the world and test them on several consecutive days. Surfshark dropped my speed an average of 5.4 percent across all six test sites. Without an outlier in South Africa (which still only dropped my speeds by 11 percent), the average would be 4.3 percent. Upload speeds only dropped by an average of 3.6 percent. That's all outstanding, and makes using the internet with Surfshark feel completely seamless, no matter where you are in the world. From Oregon, I got a negligible slowdown on a server in Indonesia — and yes, I did make sure it was actually encrypting my connection. Beyond being fast, Surfshark is an envelope-pushing VPN with several features you won't find anywhere else. Nexus lets you rotate your IP address constantly as you browse and pick your own starting and ending points for a multi-hop connection. It's also highly secure, with no slip-ups anywhere in my leak testing and no loopholes in its privacy policy (plus a clean bill of health from a June 2025 audit). The few issues that keep Surfshark from the top spot can be annoying, but none of them are dealbreaking. Its app design relies a bit too much on popups, and its monthly plans are the most expensive in the game, making it a better choice for long-term use. Pros Very fast speeds Split tunneling on all apps Unlimited simultaneous connections Cons Single-month pricing is excessive Lots of popups on desktop NoBorders Mode useful but can turn on needlessly $1.99 per month for 27 months at Surfshark NordVPN Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chromebook, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, AndroidTV, tvOS routers | Average download speed drop: 6.4 percent | Server locations: 153 in 117 countries | Notable features: Double VPN, Onion over VPN, obfuscated servers, P2P servers, Threat Protection, Dark Web Monitor | Best price: $83.43 for 27 months Read our full NordVPN review NordVPN distinguishes itself with the features it offers to boost the usual VPN experience. Even though the ahead-of-its-time Meshnet is sadly shutting down this year , there's a great menu of options. A basic plan comes with double VPN connections, Onion Over VPN servers, P2P servers, Threat Protection antivirus and a kill switch, plus split tunneling on Windows and Android. Innovating on features doesn't mean NordVPN sleeps on the fundamentals. Its speed speaks for itself. Watching videos takes a lot of download capacity, especially in 4K UHD. In my tests, NordVPN only dropped my download speed by 6.4 percent, which puts it ahead of everybody except Surfshark. Performance on individual servers ranged from a high drop of 10.4 percent (still great) to a low drop of 3.4 percent. That's fast enough for high-quality streaming on almost any home network. NordVPN's server list includes 153 cities in 117 countries, which translates to a huge range of options for checking out alternate streaming libraries. It also changed my virtual location with near-perfect precision. In tests of five server locations, Netflix never once managed to block NordVPN, and only once (in Nigeria) failed to change the content that turned up. In the area of security, the NordLynx protocol is a tuned-up version of WireGuard that's both fast and safe, and NordWhisper hides your VPN usage from censors without too much speed loss. It also passed all my leak tests without issues. Its privacy policy is a little less watertight, since there's not a full list of all the third-party processors it works with — so it might not be ideal for sensitive tasks. However, any information provided to a third party would almost certainly be aggregated and anonymized. Pros Excellent download speeds Useful exclusive features Extensive server network Cons Clunky interface choices Collects device info by default $3.09 per month for 27 months at NordVPN Private Internet Access Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Apple TV, Android TV, routers | Server locations: 155 in 91 countries | Notable features: PIA MACE ad blocker, automation, built-in DNS resolver, MTU limiter | Best price: $79 for 36 months We're in the process of re-testing Private Internet Access for a full review. Private Internet Access has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. Although you'll find it no problem to set and forget, PIA also comes with several unexpectedly deep features. There's an ""advanced kill switch"" that goes beyond a normal kill switch by not letting you get online in the first place without going through a VPN server. You can also automate PIA's behavior on known networks and public Wi-Fi, and split tunnel by both app and URL. PIA also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection. To summarize, Private Internet Access may be priced like a budget VPN, but it rarely acts like one. There are naturally a couple instances where you get what you pay for. PIA's apps, while well-designed, have a tendency to lag. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries. Furthermore, while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. Speeds are fast, but variable, with some servers running at nearly my full unprotected speed and others dropping sharply. Do note that while PIA is frequently quick, the live latency tests displayed on the app don't always match reality. Pros Deep automation features Large server network Integrates SOCKS5 and Shadowsocks Cons May share data with parent company Fluctuating speeds $2.03 per month for 39 months at PIA VPN Mullvad Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, routers | Server locations: 89 in 49 countries | Notable features: IPv6 support, Bridge Mode multihop, ad and tracker blocker | Best price: 5 Euro per month We're in the process of re-testing Mullvad for a full review. Mullvad VPN's name is Swedish for ""mole,"" which makes a lot more sense as a mascot for a tunneling app than a bear does (sorry, TunnelBear). Mullvad's first mission is privacy, which influences everything from its marketing to its apps to its registration process. It's the only VPN you can sign up for without an email address — each account is designated by a series of numbers so it can't be connected with any online presence. For true untraceability, you can even pay in cash by writing your account number in an envelope and mailing it to Mullvad headquarters with one of their nine supported currencies. The pricing system is unusual but extremely simple: every month, 5 Euro (currently just under $6) will subtract from your account until it runs out. At any time, you can top it up as much as you'd like. Be aware that the price is always figured in Euro, so if you're paying with anything else, account for exchange rates. On top of all that, Mullvad refuses to use marketing cookies to track your activities on its own website — to my knowledge, it’s the only VPN that goes that far. Fortunately, all this privacy innovation is matched with a product that's actually good. Mullvad is surprisingly fast and even keeps latencies low at a distance. Its apps are easy to use, barring a few features that might be slightly opaque to inexperienced users (and which you can get away without touching). It's even one of the few VPNs that's actually set up to conduct IPv6 traffic, even if your ISP still blocks it. The main downside is that Mullvad doesn't use virtual server locations, so its server list is pretty small, but at least you can be sure every location is where it claims to be. Also, if live chat support is important to you, note that Mullvad doesn't have this on its website. Pros Completely anonymous signup No trackers on website Supports IPv6 Cons Small server list No live tech support 5 Euro per month (currently under $6) at Mullvad hide.me Platforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Apple TV, Android TV, Fire TV, routers | Server locations: 81 in 58 countries | Notable features: Customizable split tunneling, Stealth Guard strong kill switch, dynamic port forwarding, IPv6 support | Best price: $69.95 for 27 months We're in the process of re-testing hide.me for a full review. I didn't initially think much of hide.me , but something strange happened over the last few years: while other free VPNs, even Proton VPN, cut back their services, hide.me kept improving. As of now, it's the only VPN that lets you use it without paying, doesn't cap your data and lets you choose your own server location. This makes it one of the very few free VPNs actually suitable for streaming. True, there are limits — hide.me only has eight free servers and can only be connected on one device at a time. But since it barely throttles free speeds at all, I'm not complaining. There aren't even any ads. Actually using the apps is extremely simple, from download to operation; most everything happens with one click. A paid subscription to hide.me raises the total location options to 91 countries and increases the simultaneous connections limit to 10. According to hide.me's website, paying also removes a speed cap, but I've never noticed a significant difference. Speeds on both free and paid plans are generally great, with very little average impact on both downloads and uploads. Latencies can get high, though. Aside from its free plan, hide.me has a number of interesting features, including dynamic port forwarding that makes traffic through your NAT firewall faster and more stable. It's got a strong kill switch option reminiscent of PIA's, preventing designated apps from connecting unless the VPN is active. There's also a versatile feature called SmartGuard which can block ads, catch malware-associated websites and serve as a parental control. Pros Dynamic port forwarding Free plan with unlimited data Fast speeds Cons Free plan limited to eight locations Free OR $2.69 per month for 26 months at hide.me Other VPNs we tested The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation. Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. There's a lot to recommend with CyberGhost. Its streaming-optimized servers meet a high standard for playback quality, it's pretty fast overall and its Smart Rules offer some of the deepest VPN automation on the market. The ad blocker works well, and the NoSpy servers are a neat idea — CyberGhost keeps them under lock and key near its Romania headquarters and carefully fine-tunes all their settings. On the other hand, its apps just aren't up to the standard set by our favorites on this list. I like the designs on paper, but there are too many snags in the experience, from laggy connections to an overactive kill switch that often blocks internet access even when the VPN is working perfectly. I also have some concerns about its commitment to data privacy, since its privacy policy retains the right to share your personal data with its entire corporate family. CyberGhost's parent company, Kape Technologies, also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, but neither of those VPNs have privacy policies quite so permissive. TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net ). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. There are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, so always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy . While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.

d83a8d3c5d33,Ball x Pit's deeply satisfying grind keeps me coming back for more,"ball x pit, sun","For as long as I can remember, I've had trouble going to sleep. When I lay down, my mind inevitably starts racing a thousand miles an hour, thinking about anything and everything. On several recent nights, though, my pre-slumber thoughts had a singular focus. I mulled over possibilities like, ""What if I fuse a ball that heals my character with one that splits into smaller balls with the same effect, and add a passive that fires a baby ball every time I'm healed?"" Then I grab my PlayStation Portal and do just that until I doze off. This is the hold Ball x Pit has had over me. Kenny Sun and a small group of collaborators have cooked up a mesmerizing brick-breaking roguelite. Ball x Pit is a blend of dual-stick shoot-'em-up action, base building and about a dozen other things that keeps calling me back for one more run... and another, and another. After a cataclysmic event wipes out the city of Ballbylon and leaves an enormous pit, hunters descend into the depths in search of treasure. For our purposes, this means playing levels to collect resources in order to build structures in New Ballbylon. These buildings unlock perks, such as new characters, that help with future runs. The sickly chaos of the levels and the calmer city building aspect feed into each other smartly and combine for a satisfying loop. Base building in Ball x Pit (Kenny Sun/Devolver Digital) That’s not the only important interplay here. Like any good roguelite, Ball x Pit is all about finding synergies for maximum impact. It's right there in the title, with the ""x"" denoting a relationship between two things (it's derived from shipping in fandom parlance). In the pit, you battle monsters by — surprise! — firing balls at them. Along with regular “baby balls,” each character has a unique ability and a special starter ball. In the vein of Vampire Survivors , you'll unlock more special balls and passive abilities when you collect enough gems to level up. One ball has a chance to freeze enemies and another is slower but deals much more damage. There are dozens of others. The real fun comes in when you start fusing these balls and their effects together, freeing up space for another weapon. It gets even better when you're able to evolve a pair of balls into something new. It's possible to fuse evolved balls, or even evolve them again. There’s a strategic aspect to this, as you won’t want to fuse balls that can nearly cancel each other out, such as merging an area-of-effect ball with one that disappears on impact, or leave yourself with too few balls in the face of danger. Once I unlocked the option to take two characters on a run and combine their passive abilities, that's where things went into overdrive. The possibilities became very exciting at this point, and I ended up playing Ball x Pit way past my ideal bedtime as a result. It does take a while to get to that point, though. Progression is slow at first. The repetition can get to be a little much as you need to beat each stage multiple times before moving onto the next. Also, I wish there was a bit more to the game narratively than a basic setup and some character descriptions. VIDEO But there's so much to consider on each run, and that’s what keeps me coming back. Each of the nine levels is set in a different biome, with its own hazards, enemies and bosses. Some late-game characters turn the game on its head by shifting playstyles in surprising ways, but I don't want to spoil those. Along with the absolute chaos and dopamine hits of slicing through enemies, discovering killer combinations between characters, special balls — especially the evolutions — and passives drives so much of the joy of this game. Whenever you do fuse or evolve a pair of balls, rather than having to click an ""OK"" button to get back in the action, the prompt reads ""Whoa."" That's on the nose, but funny. And I'll be damned if I didn't say that very thing out loud many times when I saw what a new evolved ball could do. Ball x Pit is out now on Steam , PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch for $15. It's available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is coming later this fall with a free upgrade from the Switch version.",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1v4FvrwN7oVPb1cfrVDc9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/ball_x_pit.jpg,2025-10-15T17:10:00+00:00,9df72dd9e674215402fe28f6ba016765231c4b0f
b82f8e5abea2,How to cancel Proton VPN and get a refund,"proton vpn, vpn service, cancel subscription, proton free, proton, proton mail","Proton VPN currently tops my list of the best VPNs , and I gave it a glowing recommendation in my detailed Proton VPN review . It's easy to use, fast, cheap and secure, with a large server network and one of the industry's best scores at unblocking streaming sites. All that said, there's no such thing as a perfect VPN, and you may find that Proton isn't working for you. If that happens, here's how to cancel your subscription. How to cancel Proton VPN through a browser If you initially signed up less than 30 days ago, you can cancel your subscription and request a refund by contacting tech support. See ""How to get a refund from Proton VPN"" below for details. If more than 30 days have passed, use the following steps to cancel your subscription. Open your browser and go to protonvpn.com. At the top-right, click Sign in , then enter your username and password. You'll be taken to your account dashboard. At the left side of the dashboard, click the Subscription tab. Scroll all the way down to the section labeled Cancel subscription. Click the ""Continue"" button. A pop-up window will appear, asking if you're sure. Click Cancel subscription . Cancelling this way doesn't immediately terminate service — it just means your subscription won't auto-renew. You can still use Proton VPN's paid features, including the entire server network, until the current period expires. After that, you'll be automatically downgraded to the free plan. During this time, your account dashboard will still be active, so you can use it to turn renewal back on if you change your mind. This method also works in mobile browser apps. Just follow the same steps on your mobile device and you'll cancel in the same way, with service continuing until your subscription expires. How to downgrade from Proton Unlimited to Proton VPN only A Proton Unlimited subscription applies to all Proton products. Since it's mainly founded on Proton Mail, though, downgrading to VPN service only is tricky and requires some extra steps. First, downgrade Proton Unlimited to Proton Free from your main account dashboard. Log in at account.proton.me, then click Settings, All settings, Dashboard and Your plan. Under ""Proton Unlimited,"" click Explore other Proton plans . On the next page, select Proton Free. This will effectively cancel Proton Unlimited, though you can still use it until the end of the pay period. Finally, go to the Proton VPN website (not the overall Proton site) and sign up for a Proton VPN Plus plan. Since you downgraded instead of deleting your account, you should be able to use the same account address. How to delete your Proton account on mobile You can also use the mobile app to delete your entire Proton account, instantly and irreversibly ending your subscriptions to Proton VPN, Proton Mail and any other products in the line. Taking this action permanently burns your Proton username, so you won't be able to use it again if you decide to re-subscribe (in that case, you’ll just have to make a new one). The process is the same on both Android and iOS — the apps have slight cosmetic differences, but everything is in the same place. Follow the steps below to nuke your Proton account from orbit. Open the Proton VPN app on your Android phone. Click Settings at the bottom of the window. At the top of the settings page, click your account email address. This will take you to Account settings . Click Delete account. A window will open in your web browser, showing your general Proton account page. Scroll down to the bottom of this page and click the red Delete your account button. Select a reason for deleting your account and leave feedback in the box provided. You have to pick an option from the menu and type at least 10 characters in the box, though feel free to keyboard mash if you don't want to say anything. Check the box on the next page beside ""Yes, I want to permanently delete this account and all its data."" Finally, click the red Delete account button. How to get a refund from Proton VPN Proton VPN has a 30-day refund policy. As long as you paid for your VPN less than 30 days ago, you can get your money back. To request a refund, send a message through the contact form on the website. You can also email protonvpn@support.zendesk.com. There's a minimum of 100 characters in the ""What happened?"" box. Unlike when you're simply deleting your account, I do recommend putting a brief real answer here, clearly stating that you would like to cancel your account and receive a refund. According to its terms of service , Proton will only refund you for the portion of the service you didn't use. If you spend $10 for a one-month subscription and cancel after 15 days, you'll get $5 back. The terms do state that the company ""may also provide you with a full refund upon request"" — directly asking for such a refund in your contact form makes this more likely. If you cancel after 30 days are up, you may still be able to get a prorated payment for your remaining time, either in cash or account credit. You'll have to ask for this specifically, as the default option is that your account just stays active until it runs out. What to do if you subscribed through an app store If you bought your Proton VPN subscription through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, then Apple or Google processed your money and you're subject to their refund policies. If you subscribed through Apple, go to your Apple ID profile in iOS settings, click on Subscriptions , scroll to Proton VPN and click on Cancel subscription. You'll then get the opportunity to request a refund. On Android, log into the Google Play Store, click on your profile picture, then click Manage subscriptions . Find Proton VPN, click Cancel subscription and provide a reason. As with iOS, the steps will walk you through the refund process. Proton VPN alternatives Once you've fully cancelled Proton VPN, you may be in the market for an alternative. I recommend a few of my other favorites, depending on why Proton didn't work for you. Surfshark is faster, ExpressVPN has some of the best app design and NordVPN has a wider range of interesting features.

d7439e9bebec,VSCO adds its first AI-powered photo editing tool,"image editing, vsco, photographers, editing tools, remove tool, vsco app, photo editing, image resolution","The VSCO photo editing and sharing app has been around for nearly as long as Instagram, positioning itself as the serious photographer’s choice for mobile editing. The original focus was on tasteful filters and editing tools, all of which got significantly more powerful and flexible over time; VSCO has long been doing the same sort of film emulations that have made Fujifilm’s cameras so desirable in recent years. The company also built up a loyal community of photographers who share their edits far and wide, both in the VSCO app as well as on more mainstream platforms like Instagram itself. Now, the company is making an unsurprising but potentially controversial move: it is releasing its first AI-powered image editing tool . “Remove,” as the name suggests, lets you erase “unwanted elements” from your photos without compromising the image’s full resolution. At first glance, it feels quite similar to tools like Google’s own Magic Eraser. You just pop open an image in the editor and highlight the portion you want to remove, and VSCO will do its best to obliterate the offending bits and fill in whatever is in the background that it deems appropriate. I haven’t had a chance to test how effective this tool is yet, but VSCO is using Black Forest Lab’s FLUX.1 Kontext model to do its magic, combined with its own proprietary technology specifically focused on making results that the company says look authentic. A quick look at Black Forest Lab and the FLUX.1 model show a tool that does appear to be well-suited to removing unwanted parts of an image and properly filling in the space that remains — but we’ll have to see it in action to judge whether it does the job well. This new Remove tool isn’t the only AI-powered editor VSCO is working on. There’s also an Upscale tool in the works that the company says will “enhance image resolution” while keeping color and composition unchanged. These sorts of tools will live under a new umbrella the company is calling AI Lab, making it clear this will be an ongoing initiative and not just a one-off release. On one hand, I’m not at all surprised to see VSCO jumping into AI-powered editing; it has to keep up with the rest of the industry. But on the other hand, the company has made its mark by building a community of photographers who value authenticity in their work, something that cannot help but be in conflict with AI tools, at least on the surface. VSCO’s CEO Eric Wittman acknowledged that tension in a conversation with Engadget. “We have a very photographer-centric, creator-first point of view,” Wittman said. “But where we see AI fitting in is in support of those folks, and that work, and that vision. The intention isn’t to replace [that work], though — AI has a place, but it’s not to replace what creators, and photographers in particular, are doing.” That mindset makes sense with something like Remove, which duplicates something people have done with Photoshop for years. Rather than generating new images or radically changing the truth of a photo like you can do with some of Google’s tools on the Pixel phones, Remove is a bit more subtle. “You would use masks, you would manually painstakingly edit things at a pixel by pixel level,” Wittman said. “What a lot of Remove tools would do is basically like automate that.” Wittman also cited preserving image quality as a key part of the work behind its own Remove tool. “We know that many people who were attempting to use AI in the early days, especially photographers, a lot of their disappointment was just in the preservation of the integrity and the quality of the work,” he said. “So what we've really tried to do is continue to help automate where we can and make things easier, but also preserve the quality.” To that end, VSCO is stressing that all these edits are non-destructive and the output will be in full, original resolution. As VSCO starts dabbling in more AI editing tools, Wittman emphasized that the company wants to stay on the side of helping photographers realize a creative vision rather than helping them make entirely unreal images, while also avoiding the mess of copyright issues and inauthentic content that is flooding the internet thanks to AI. “When you think about things like copyright, and the incredible importance of copyright, integrity, and authenticity — we're big believers as a company in both the laws and the norms that have been around for many many years.

To use it, you’ll need an active VSCO Pro subscription , which runs $13 per month or $60 a year.

bcd44560741c,Apple's long-rumored smart display will reportedly cost $350,"apple, smart display, bloomberg, smart appliances","Apple has been expected to widen its smart home offering for a long time now, and if a new report is accurate, we could be getting a trio of new devices fairly soon. According to Bloomberg , Apple is working on an indoor camera and a smart display to arrive in 2026, as well as a tabletop robot, with the latter expected to launch in 2027. An Apple-made smart display in particular has featured heavily in the rumor mill for a number of years , but it appears to be closer than ever. Bloomberg ’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple’s new home hub will have a 7-inch square LCD display, a built-in FaceTime camera and an OS that dynamically adjusts depending on who’s using it. It will also ship with an improved version of Siri that will behave more like ChatGPT or other chatbots in how it uses the web to answer your questions. The product, along with the more advanced Siri chatbot, had been slated for release earlier this year, but Apple reportedly scrapped those plans in favor of a spring 2026 launch. Bloomberg claims there will be two versions of the home hub, one code-named J940 which takes the form of a display mounted on a HomePod mini-like speaker, and the other (J491) designed to be hung on a wall. With both you’ll be able to control smart appliances, play music and presumably interact with Apple’s various apps on other devices. Apple is said to be targeting a price of around $350, although the Bloomberg report does not specify which version of the device that price refers to. The tabletop robot scheduled to launch in 2027 will effectively be the smart display Apple could be releasing next year mounted into a motorized arm that can move the device to different positions, which sounds like the company’s take on Amazon’s (slightly creepy) swivelling Echo Show 10 , first launched in 2021. This product will have a larger 9-inch display, but is said to be delayed after Apple encountered engineering challenges with the motor. Bloomberg reports that all three of these devices will be built in Vietnam, which sources said represented a ""major change"" in how Apple launches a new product category, as it has traditionally relied on China at the outset. In 2020 it emerged that Apple was looking to diversify its production by moving some of its iPad and MacBook manufacturing to Vietnam, and the US’ trade war with China has only intensified during Trump’s second administration. Vietnam has not escaped tariffs of its own, but they’re less severe than imports from China.",https://www.engadget.com/home/apples-long-rumored-smart-display-will-reportedly-cost-350-165801748.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XHmekGbP.jOjRI.V8dy4Aw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/8fa98870-a9e6-11f0-bfec-6a90477f54d5,2025-10-15T16:58:01+00:00,0a4885f990ce5e1d4223baac3c8eb7280dba0b24
f37680653baf,Apple's first M5 laptop is the 14-inch MacBook Pro,"macbook pro, apple, apple","The new M5 MacBook Pro has arrived — and brought something of a strategy change for Apple's chip release strategy this year. This time around, Apple has led with the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, which retains the same $1,599 starting price as its M4 predecessor. It debuts alongside new 11- and 13-inch iPad Pros and a refreshed Apple Vision Pro that have the same M5 chipset , but — unlike last year — there's no M5 Pro and M5 Max devices to be found. In the past, Apple has favored launching its entire MacBook Pro lineup at once, as it did in 2024 with the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max models. However, it may have decided to release the M5 model now so it could get a jump start on sales, since the M5 Pro and M5 Max versions are reportedly still several months away. Apple may have also opted for a low-key release since the M5 MacBook Pro is largely unchanged from the previous model. With that, the emphasis is squarely on the M5 chip and its extra performance. Reportedly due to cost reasons , Apple decided to use the same 3-nanometer fabrication process for the M5 as it did for the M4. The new chip has 10 GPU cores and 10 CPU cores, along with a 16-core Neural Engine. Apple claims the M5 has the ""world’s fastest CPU core"" with up to 20 percent faster multithreaded performance compared with the M4 chip. As for the GPU, the company says that offers ""up to 1.6x faster graphics performance in pro apps and enables up to 1.6x higher frame rates in games compared to the M4 model."" That should make the M5 MacBook Pro a better option than the M4 model for things like gaming and video editing. To that end, compared with the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple says the latest model delivers up to 1.8x faster ""AI video-enhancing performance"" in Topaz Video, up to 1.7x faster 3D rendering in Blender and up to 1.2x faster build performance during code compiling in Xcode. The company is promising 3.5x faster AI performance than with the M4 model, and up to 6x faster performance than M1. It also claims SSD performance is up to twice as fast as the previous generation. The M5 MacBook Pro comes with the same 14.2-inch, 3,024 x 1,964 Liquid Retina XDR display that can hit 1,000 nits in SDR mode and up to 1,600 nits peak brightness for HDR content. It has adaptive refresh rates at up to 120Hz and offers a wide P3 color gamut with up to 1 billion colors, ideal for video editors and Lightroom users. Other key features include an SDXC card slot, HDMI port and 3.5mm headphone jack. There are three USB-C ports as before, but they're still the Thunderbolt 4 type with speeds up to 40 Gbps, and not the 80 Gbps Thunderbolt 5 ports found on M4 Pro and Max models. It also comes with a six-speaker system with support for Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio as before, along with Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 and a 12MP Center Stage 1080p webcam. As you might imagine, it comes with macOS Tahoe ready to go. Per the comparison page on Apple's site , except for the different CPU, the M5 MacBook Pro otherwise has identical specs to its M4 predecessor, right down to the same dimensions, weight and 70-watt power adapter. The 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro is now available for pre-order starting at $1,599 with 16GB memory and 512GB storage. It maxes out at 32GB of RAM and 4TB of storage. Shipping will start October 22. Update, 12:52PM ET: Confirmed via Apple's spec page that there are no real differences between the M4 and M5 MacBook Pro aside from the new CPU.",https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-first-m5-laptop-is-the-14-inch-macbook-pro-131314446.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/616afc00-a9c8-11f0-8fd7-0ba19a123fa6,2025-10-15T13:13:14+00:00,f8c09842f6cc153c23606eea2e1b0c8be9202799
c0336c7ba13f,Fujifilm's refreshed Instax mini LiPlay has an extra camera for selfies,"instant camera, fujifilm, instax mini, nifty features, fujifilm instax","Fujifilm just announced the Instax mini LiPlay+ instant camera , which is a refresh of the original mini LiPlay from 2019 . It's been six long years, so the company has added some nifty features here. First of all, there's a second camera on the rear that's intended for selfies. It features a wide-angle lens and joins the pre-existing front-facing camera. There's a new functionality that lets users combine the content from both cameras to create unique layered images. That's pretty nifty. The design is mostly the same as before, but the rear LCD is larger. This should make it easier to accurately compose images before printing them out. To that end, there's a new film type accompanying the launch of this camera. The Soft Glitter instant film is available in ten-exposure packs and offers gold accents and soft hues to ""bring a calming shimmer"" around the frames. Film packs cost around $18. There's also a redesigned app with plenty of new features, including the ability to add short audio clips to images. These multimedia creations can be viewed by scanning a QR code in the print, which will trigger the audio on a smartphone or similar device. The LiPlay+ app lets users further edit images before printing them via the camera. The camera will be available for purchase by the end of the month and costs $235. There will be blue and beige versions. The original mini LiPlay didn't quite make our list of the best instant cameras , but several Fujifilm Instax models did.

b308d5e5a9ba,"The best VPN deals: Get up to 87 percent off ProtonVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark and more","vpn service, vpn providers, virtual private network, surfshark antivirus, surfshark alert, expressvpn","A virtual private network (VPN) is useful in lots of ways every day, whether you're streaming foreign TV shows or keeping yourself anonymous online so advertisers can't track you. But while we strongly recommend using a VPN, it pays to do some research before investing in one — pricing can be opaque for these services, and you can't always trust how the providers portray their best deals. Even so, there are genuinely great deals to be had. VPN providers love to give out deep discounts to anybody willing to sign up for a year or more at once. This means you've got to pay out more upfront, but if you divide the cost by the months of service, you're actually paying less per month over time. With deals like this, VPN providers boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services. Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now. Best VPN deals Proton This Swiss VPN is Engadget's top VPN of choice right now, for reasons I've laid out in a full Proton VPN review . It looks and feels good to use on every platform, which makes it fantastic for multiple-device households. It keeps your browsing speeds fast and latencies low, even over long distances. For those who need a VPN to stay anonymous, Proton VPN is the only service implementing full-disk encryption, which means it can manage all your traffic without any of it being visible to Proton itself. $119.76 for 24 months (50 percent off) at Proton VPN NordVPN — $83.43 for a two-year subscription with three months free (77 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. Although I'm sad to see it shutting down Meshnet , NordVPN still includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping. ExpressVPN Basic — $97.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (73 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review , it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock. ExpressVPN Advanced — $125.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (67 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers , but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the ""basic"" level of Surfshark , but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (86 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the previous tier. This evergreen deal gives you 86 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with two months free (73 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. However, if you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. What makes a good VPN deal Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers . One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

ca4427513994,Waymo plans to launch fully autonomous taxi service in London next year,"waymo, london","Waymo is bringing its autonomous taxis to the UK in 2026, marking the company’s first major expansion outside of the US. Waymo has selected the mobility company, Moove, as its fleet operations partner, and is currently working with local and national authorities in the UK to gain the necessary permissions to launch a robotaxi service in London first next year. Right now, you won’t find any fully driverless cars in London or anywhere in the UK, but that’s set to change next year when the Automated Vehicles Act 2024 begins to take effect. This legislation is intended to regulate the eventual arrival of self-driving vehicles in the UK, but before that can happen, the government will help to facilitate robotaxi pilots from Spring 2026. Given its complex road network and narrow winding streets built long before cars were a concern, London will be a challenging city for Waymo’s robotaxis to navigate, but the company said in a statement that its technology significantly reduces the risk of injury-causing collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians compared to human-driven cars. The imminent arrival of Waymo in the UK was also welcomed by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), with self-driving taxis seen as an important first step in ushering in autonomous travel on a larger scale. Waymo already has close links to the UK, with its first international engineering hubs located in London and Oxford. It also has a partnership with UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, which sees it equip all-electric Jaguar I-Pace taxis with its Waymo Driver self–driving tech in the US. However, Waymo won't be without competition when its service arrives in London next year. Uber and Wayve are planning for their own pilot to launch around the same time, after the latter’s CEO and co-founder, Alex Kendall, called the arrival of the Automated Vehicles Act ""a defining moment for UK autonomy.""",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-plans-to-launch-fully-autonomous-taxi-service-in-london-next-year-142453250.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hd21WcNgau43yCoDx1Amyw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/7d1a4ce0-a9d1-11f0-9fde-fefe4fdc2ee4,2025-10-15T14:24:53+00:00,1c7e0278c709e3ae7047d42c204f412b170cfb2a
2f2182494838,"Apple's new Vision Pro gets an M5 chip and Dual Knit Band, but it's still $3,499","vision pro, apple, macbook pro, apple watch","Apple has introduced an upgraded version of its Vision Pro headset that's powered by the company's M5 chip, its latest silicon that will also come with the new iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. The first generation of the headset was equipped with Apple's M2, so you can expect this device to be faster and come with more capabilities. Apple hasn't budged the price from $3,499 with 256GB of storage, but at least it comes with a Dual Knit Band, which adds a top strap for extra security and comfort. (Existing Vision Pro users can also buy the Dual Knit Band separately for $99.) As you'd expect, Apple claims the refreshed Vision Pro should be faster while loading apps, browsing the web and doing just about everything. The M5 chip also includes a new 10-core GPU, with better support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, ""enabling developers to add remarkable detail to lighting, shadows, and reflections in games like Control,"" according to Apple. The company also says the M5 Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on its micro-OLED displays, which should make everything look a bit sharper. The M5 Vision Pro should last a bit longer than the original model, as well. Apple claims it supports up to two and a half hours of typical usage, and up to three hours of video playback. The previous model was rated for two hours of general usage and two and a half hours of video viewing. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported a few days ago that Apple was due for another wave of product announcements. He wrote back then that the new iPad Pro and Vision Pro are already being mass produced and that Apple is ""gearing up for an imminent release."" Apple had originally wanted to launch a a lighter and cheaper version of the Vision Pro headset, as well, but it reportedly decided to shift its focus on the development of smart glasses. The company pulled people working on the lighter Vision Pro, Gurman said in another report , and moved them to its smart glasses project. Apple is reportedly working on a smart glasses model with no display and is meant to pair with iPhones, along with another model that's equipped with a built-in screen and can directly compete with Meta's Ray-Ban Display . The company is aiming to release the model with no screen in 2027 and the one with a screen in 2028, Gurman said. ""The Vision Pro is a flawed product, but it's certainly not empty,"" we noted in our review of the original headset. ""It's as if Apple has compiled everything it's learned from building the Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods into a single device, all in a bid to avoid the Innovator's Dilemma."" At first glance, the M5 Vision Pro doesn't seem to change that conclusion much, not without more content and apps built around spatial computing. A price drop and more storage on the base model would certainly make the Vision Pro more compelling, until that happens it'll remain more of a developer kit than a full-fledged consumer product. The M5 Vision Pro is now ready to pre-order and will once again set you back $3,499. Apple will start shipping the device on October 22.",https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iyD8KK_eZdxc0x9aa9w9BQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/6d64d250-a9c9-11f0-bff1-ed688f0409ab,2025-10-15T13:21:23+00:00,6d2d85f6020d30fb15f994b695fe00dcabe74978
6714dd6799ce,Apple's latest iPad Pro gets a power boost with the new M5 chip,"apple, ipad pro, ipad","Apple's latest 11- and 13-inch iPad Pros have arrived , and though they're the first with the company's all-new M5 chip, they're otherwise largely identical to last year's models . The main reason to buy one, then, would be for the extra performance over the M4 — something that may be worthwhile to content creators and other power users looking for a tablet instead of a laptop. Last year Apple decided to debut its M4 chip with the iPad Pro lineup and not its laptops. The reason? Only the entry-level M4 was ready (and not the M4 Pro and M4 Max), so Apple decided to wait before putting in its MacBooks so it could launch the entire lineup at once. With updated Magic Keyboards, It also showed that Apple was marketing the iPad Pro as a feasible MacBook replacement for power users. The same applies with the M5, except this time the company also launched its entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro at the same time. As before, the new M5 processor uses TSMC's 3-nanometer process, as Apple reportedly decided against 2-nanometer chips due to cost considerations. The entry-level M5 comes in a couple of versions. The iPad Pro with either 256GB or 512GB of storage gets an M5 with a 9-core CPU (3 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores), 10-core GPU and 12GB of RAM. The 1TB and 2TB models get a fourth performance core and 16GB of RAM. The big upgrade here appears to be to the GPU; Apple says each of the 10 GPU cores have a Neural Accelerator on board, which will allow GPU-based AI processing to run significantly faster than on the M4. Apple claims it has more than four times the peak GPU compute performance of the M4 (which is only about 18 months old, mind you). Graphics performance should be about 45 percent higher than on the M4, as well. Overall multithreaded performance is 15 percent faster than the M4, and Apple says that video transcoding is six times faster than what the old M1 iPad Pro from 2021 delivered. As for battery life, Apple claims the same 10 hours that basically every iPad has ever been rated at. But for the first time, the iPad Pro supports fast charging — you can get up to 50 percent in 30 minutes using a 60W USB-C power adaptor. Apple is also using the C1X modem that it originally introduced last month in the iPhone Air; that'll provide the optional 5G service that Apple has offered on iPads for a few years now. There's also an N1 chip (also found in the iPhone Air), which is an Apple-designed networking chip for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6 and Thread connectivity. Apple claims this new chip will make features like Personal Hotspot and Airdrop more reliable while also offering improved performance on 5GHz Wi-Fi networks. As before, the 2025 iPad Airs are extremely thin and light. The 11-inch model is 5.3mm thick and tips the scales at just under one pound, while the 13-incher is just 5.1mm thick weighs 1.29 pounds. Both feature ""tandem"" OLED Ultra Display XDR screens that hit up to 1,000 nits brightness and peak at 1,600 nits — so they're perfect for viewing and editing HDR content. The new iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model with 256GB of storage ($1,199 with 5G) and $1,299 for the 13-inch ($1,499 with 5G). Those are the same prices as last year — still extremely expensive, but at least not more than before. You can pre-order the new iPad Pro now, and it'll be available on October 22.",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-latest-ipad-pro-get-a-power-boost-with-the-new-m5-chip-131036435.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kqsmxeMkz3pdl.sWrIeCzQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NTc-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/1b66f150-a9c8-11f0-bbe5-94ae760a1f8f,2025-10-15T13:10:36+00:00,dc32cc6ad0c4c2883f225260ebfc502fa2e275a5
9c9bdb041f34,ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X review: An extra life for Xbox,"rog xbox ally, xbox, microsoft, asus, microsoft, sam rutherford, the ally","Xbox is at a crossroads. While the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 continue to gain popularity, multiple price hikes for the Xbox Series S and X have killed their momentum. And with several big box retailers like Costco deciding to drop Microsoft’s console from their shelves, the current-gen Xbox may be dead in the water. So what should the company do? Microsoft’s most straightforward option would be to simply punt the end of the Xbox's lifecycle, regroup and come back strong with a brand new console in a year or two. On the flipside, the company could follow in Sega's footsteps after the untimely demise of the Dreamcast and become a cross-platform game publisher with a large stable of first-party studios. However, there's a third route that could fill the gap between now and whenever the next Xbox arrives that could potentially expand its reach to a whole new segment: Give handheld gaming a go. ASUS/Engadget While its $1,000 price may be an obstacle, ASUS and Microsoft's collaboration on the ROG Xbox Ally X has created a top-tier handheld with strong performance and better software than all of its Windows-based rivals. Pros New full-screen Xbox experience Strong performance Bright screen Solid battery life Cons Expensive Larger grips make it a bit bulky Mediocre haptics $1,000 at Best Buy Engineering and building a new portable gaming device isn't cheap or quick. So instead of doing everything itself, Microsoft teamed up with ASUS to create the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X — a pair of Windows 11-based portable gaming PCs enhanced with Microsoft's DNA. And while it's too early to say if these handhelds will help save Xbox itself, they're more than solid portables that could have a big impact on portable gaming going forward. Editor's note: This review is focused on the ROG Xbox Ally X, primarily because that's all we have at the moment. However, the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X share many features including the same basic design , display, button layout and software (the only difference is their color). That said, the base Xbox Ally has less impressive specs as it comes with a slower AMD Ryzen Z2 chip, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a smaller 60WHr battery. It’s also a touch lighter (1.48 pounds vs 1.58) and has a lower price of $600 instead of $1,000. Design and display: The Xbox goes portable Sam Rutherford for Engadget When you look at the ROG Xbox Ally X, it might appear as if ASUS bolted larger grips to its previous handheld — the Ally X — and called it a day. However, the company says the Xbox Ally was redesigned from the ground up, in large part to include a number of signature features that will make Xbox faithful feel right at home. This includes things like the classic ABXY button layout, Impulse triggers with tons of travel and, of course, the requisite Xbox home button. Then smack dab in the middle of everything is a 7-inch IPS LCD screen. Speaking of the display, ASUS picked a FHD IPS panel with a 120Hz refresh rate that appears to be the exact same screen used on the Ally X. While it doesn't deliver pure blacks like you'd get from OLED, contrast was still surprisingly good. With a brightness of 500 nits (the one on our review unit was actually a touch higher at 510 nits), this display delivers almost everything you want without feeling like you need to upgrade to something like the huge 8.8-inch OLED panel on the Lenovo Legion Go 2. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Around back, there are two customizable paddles while the top edge houses a fingerprint reader and all of the Xbox Ally X's connectivity: two USB-C ports, a microSD card reader and 3.5mm audio. Notably, while both ports support charging and display capabilities, the one furthest to the left is also Thunderbolt 4 compliant. This means it has enough bandwidth to support external GPUs like ASUS' recently updated XG Mobile graphics dock. Ultimately, the ROG Xbox Ally might not look all that different from ASUS' previous handhelds, but between its buttons, triggers and those big new grips, it really does feel like you're holding a portable version of Microsoft's console. Even without Hall Effect sensors, the Xbox Ally X's joysticks are tight and responsive, while the triggers offer a ton of travel. The only thing I wish ASUS and Microsoft had paid a little more attention to is the handheld's haptics, which are fine, but they’re a far cry from the expressive rumble motors you get from a DualSense controller or the Switch 2's Joy-Con. Performance: Flagship handheld power Sam Rutherford for Engadget As the higher-end model in ASUS and Microsoft's new joint handheld lineup, the ROG Xbox Ally X features a AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip with 24GB of memory (which is shared with its GPU) and 1TB of storage that can be expanded via microSD. However, thanks in part to the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft tweaked a number of the handheld's background processes and services for the first time on a Windows 11-based handheld. The result is a slightly more optimized device even when compared to its closest rivals. In Cyberpunk 2077 at 1,920 x 1,080, medium graphics and FSR set to performance, the ROG Xbox Ally X hit 62.1 fps while plugged in and set to its max 35-watt Turbo mode. That's almost five fps higher than what we got from the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (57.5 fps) when its settings are similarly maxed out. Admittedly, this might not sound like a huge improvement, but it ends up being an extra seven percent performance from the same chip, which ain't bad. Meanwhile in Returnal, I got similar numbers after switching to the Ally's more energy-efficient 17-watt Performance Mode (unplugged), where it produced 42 fps at full HD on medium versus 39 fps for the Lenovo. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, it's important to note that the Ally's performance changes depending on whether it's plugged into the wall or not. If you want its full 35-watt Turbo Mode, you're going to need to use a power adapter, while its 17-watt Performance and 13-watt Silent modes stay the same no matter what you do. There’s also a manual performance customization tool, but to access it, you'll need to switch over to ASUS' Armoury Crate app, as there isn't a place to change things directly inside the Xbox app. Software: The tailored gaming experience we needed Getting excited about the software on a gaming handheld is usually pretty difficult. However, between the aforementioned tweaks to background services and the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft has managed to remove a ton of the clunkiness that typically plagues other Windows-based gaming handhelds. Instead of having to wade your way through the traditional Windows desktop before booting into a game, now you're greeted by the Xbox app upon startup (and even during initial setup), so there are fewer steps to get between you and your favorite title. Furthermore, Microsoft has come up with a revamped layout that makes core features super easy to find. The Home tab is where all your installed software is, while there are other dedicated sections for Game Pass downloads (assuming you have a subscription) cloud gaming/remote play (also via Game Pass) and the Microsoft Store. If you prefer other digital marketplaces like Steam or Epic, there are shortcuts to download installers for those stores (and a few more like GOG and Ubisoft) in the My Apps tab. You don't need to open a web browser and do things manually. To switch between apps in Microsoft's new full-screen Xbox experience, all you need to do is swipe up from the bottom of the ROG Xbox Ally X's screen. (Sam Rutherford for Engadget) Furthermore, hitting the Xbox button summons a handful of quick settings for all sorts of things, including the Command Center for performance, toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, your Xbox friends list and a whole lot more. It's kind of like a do-everything button and it makes accessing almost all of your most important tools and features quick and easy. On top of that, there are new gestures that you can access by swiping in on the screen in different directions. Dragging your finger in from the left calls up the Xbox Game Bar overlay, even when you're in the middle of playing a game, while swiping in from the right opens your Windows notifications. But my favorite command is swiping up from the bottom, which is a new way to switch between apps (or a cooler version of Alt + Tab, depending on how you look at it). From there, you can even scroll through any programs that are currently open just by tapping the Xbox Ally's shoulder buttons. If you want to use the handheld like a real PC, you can also activate the Windows desktop from there too. Microsoft has also thoughtfully included compatibility tags on a number of games in its store to give buyers a sense of how well a game will run on the ROG Xbox Ally X. (Sam Rutherford for Engadget) The redesigned Xbox experience is very breezy and handles 90 to 95 percent of your traditional gaming functions, but there are still times when some of Window's underlying awkwardness shows through. Most often, I found this happens when exiting a game from a third-party store, where the Xbox Ally will spit you out into your Steam library (for example), where you'll often have to rely on touchscreen controls instead of the joysticks or the desktop mode's mouse cursor to navigate around. It's not a big deal compared to other Windows-based handhelds, and even though Microsoft has taken a big step forward on the Xbox Ally, there is still a little polishing to be done. Battery life: A solid jump in longevity One of the biggest benefits of going with the ROG Xbox Ally X is that it comes with a larger 80WHr battery than the base model (60Whr). When that is combined with improved energy efficiency from its new chip, you get very solid battery life — just as long as you don’t max out the power settings. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I tested this by playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at full HD on medium settings and max brightness (Protip: don’t do this at night if you want to get to sleep on time) and the Xbox Ally X lasted just shy of three and a half hours. That’s 30 minutes longer than what I got from the Legion Go 2, although considering the latter has a much larger screen (with the same 500 nits of brightness), that difference wasn’t a big shock. The bigger revelation is that when compared to the original Ally X, ASUS and Microsoft’s new jointly-made device provided an extra hour of runtime, which could make a meaningful difference on a long trip. Wrap-up While Microsoft’s first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isn’t upending the status quo and it’s way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements. The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that it’s kind of wild it took so long to get here. Sure, there are still a few edge cases where you’ll have to tap the screen or flip between the Xbox app and ASUS’ Armoury Create to tweak certain settings, but compared to most of its rivals, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a massive upgrade in general usability. Here is a size comparison between the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (bottom) and the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (top). (Sam Rutherford for Engadget) The bigger grips and a familiar button layout will instantly make longtime Xbox fans feel right at home. And thanks to the new chip and more processes and services that run in the background while you’re gaming, you get class-leading performance and battery life. Aside from lackluster haptics, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s biggest issue is its price. I totally get that there’s a growing number of gamers who constantly crave better performance from their portable PCs. However, the trade-off for all this is a much bigger hit to your wallet. It wasn’t that long ago when the going rate for a premium handheld was more like $500, which made it easier to afford. After all, those devices weren’t really designed to be your main gaming rig like a laptop or desktop. Ultimately the biggest deciding factor for purchasing the ROG Xbox Ally X may be how much someone is already invested into the Xbox ecosystem. If you’re a fan of other game stores or you don’t have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass or a ton of friends on the platform, you won’t get the full benefit of everything Microsoft has integrated into the handheld’s new software. This goes double for devotees of Valve’s digital store and Linux-based OS that don’t need bleeding edge performance, who can safely stick to much more affordable Steam Decks or the Legion Go S . Alternatively, if you want a versatile portable with a giant OLED screen and detachable controllers, the Legion Go 2 is worth consideration as well. Though at $1,300 for the model with a Z2 Extreme chip, it’s even more expensive than this new handheld Xbox. Still, despite some minor caveats, Microsoft has finally put its spin on portable PC gaming (with an assist from ASUS) and brought some welcome upgrades to the space that have made the ROG Xbox Ally X a top shelf device.",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H_J2ZwPx_6pCVGPFKO9s_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/8acf0250-a9c1-11f0-be3f-1657d225426a,2025-10-15T13:00:50+00:00,40f73dc24bfc266e7936bd79e4ce1b05aff66d13
29b6dd68b721,Halliday Glasses review: Ambitious smart glasses with frustrating flaws,"smart glasses, daniel cooper, halliday, pair of glasses","Every now and then, you review a product you can’t get along with in any way, shape or form. Sometimes, it’s about the quality of the hardware, but more often it’s about the philosophy of its makers. Imagine trying to review a toilet built by, and for, aliens from the planet Zog: You can appreciate the intention behind it, but you’ll never be able to praise it. That’s the issue I’ve had with Halliday’s smart glasses , because almost every design decision made by its creators feels, to me, like the wrong one. Cofounder Carter Hou conceded that some people love Halliday’s approach and others haven’t taken to it anywhere near as much. Sadly, I’ve found myself in the latter category. Halliday announced itself to the world at CES in January, dragging behind it a truckload of promises about its Wayfarer-style smart glasses. It said the glasses would be “invisible to onlookers,” styled to be as close to a regular pair of specs as it could manage. There’d be no outward facing camera or sensors, just a tiny interior display projecting data into the wearer’s view. It talked up its “proactive” AI assistant that was always listening and would pipe up with an answer when asked a question. It would be discreetly controlled with a touchpad ring, so you’d not need to visibly fiddle with your phone or the glasses’ touch-sensitive arm to use it. Plus, it would weigh just 35 grams. What’s not to like? The company launched a Kickstarter at the end of January, earning $3,305,917 from more than 8,000 backers. The company has already shared its first product with backers, and it’s now ready to share it with retail customers. I’ve been testing the hardware for around a month with regular software updates. Halliday assured me that the last few issues, like inconsistent Bluetooth connectivity, should be ironed out by the time it’s available to the masses. Daniel Cooper for Engadget Smart glasses that take lots of big swings, few of which come off. Pros Lightweight Innovative Takes risks Cons Flimsy Inelegant Display is difficult to use AI features are underbaked $499 at Halliday Hardware Halliday’s chunky Wayfarer-style glasses are made out of plastic, with thin plastic lenses set to your prescription. Plastic is obviously easy to work with and affordable, but it also can give the appearance and feel of looking a bit cheap and flimsy. Even the temple tips are made of solid plastic, which means they can’t be adjusted to suit your head shape and comfort levels.The only way to modify how they sit on your face is by contorting the nose pads, which you’ll be told to do during setup. On the underside of the right temple tip, you’ll find a rubber gasket covering its built-in USB-C charging port. Follow it towards the front and you’ll find one of two speakers (its twin sits on the opposite arm), the touch surface for control and the power button. Sitting over the right lens is a little plastic cantilever arm, on the end of which is a 3.6mm round microLED display module. The arm can be pulled in or out and tilted up and down to put the display into your peripheral vision. The aim, as stated, was to make a small and light pair of glasses that wouldn’t draw attention to themselves. Sadly, Halliday couldn’t avoid the issue that plagues all smart glasses, which is that they have to be bigger to accommodate all the electronics. But, to my eye, they only just about register as a bold style choice rather than as a comically-oversized pair of specs. I keep flip-flopping on this: Half the time, they’re bold, half the time, I feel like I’m wearing faux Marx-brothers glasses from a Halloween store. (Daniel Cooper for Engadget) The control ring is available in US sizes 8-15, and is made of silver plastic with a small clickpad section embedded. Continuing Halliday’s focus on subtlety, the ring’s only distinguishing mark is a small black line on one side of the clickpad to indicate the right hand side. Slide the ring on without remembering to check its orientation and you’ll be trying to use the menus upside down and back to front. Like a lot of smart rings, it’ll certainly stand out on your hand if you’re used to thinner, daintier adornments.

Like a lot of smart rings, it’ll certainly stand out on your hand if you’re used to thinner, daintier adornments. Display Closeup image of the Halliday Smart Glasses display (Daniel Cooper for Engadget) It’s easy enough to put a teeny-tiny display close to your eye, ostensibly tricking it into thinking it's much larger. The 3.6mm microLED module is meant to project the equivalent of a 3.5-inch display into your field of view. It’s the same sort of barebones green monochrome display found in a lot of wearables since green is easy to read and not too power-hungry. Again, the focus on invisibility means you’re meant to flick your eyes toward it, read what you need and flick back before anyone’s really noticed. There are many reasons why this is a smart choice compared to companies using waveguide prisms embedded in the lenses itself. It saves a lot of weight, makes what you’re looking at far more private and cuts down the cost. Since, after all, you can just use cheap regular or prescription lenses in the frame, rather than specialist ones with the built-in prisms. But the use of a tiny-display-close-to-your-eye is a problem if you are already a glasses wearer. After all, the screen is behind the prescription, so it’s not as simple as just glancing or catching it in my peripheral vision. In my experience, I’d get a notification, look up, and then have to wait for my eyes to refocus before I could see what was going on. That’s not a big deal if it’s just the time or an icon telling you there’s a new WhatsApp, but it’s hard to read full sentences of text. Personally, I found the display to be too close and too unnaturally placed for me to comfortably use it. I tried every adjustment possible to make it easier to use, even wearing them in silly ways to no avail. And this gets worse when you’re being asked to engage with the lengthy responses produced by its “Proactive” AI. Reading paragraphs of text on a 3.6mm screen is a one-way ticket to the sort of eye pain you’d normally only experience after downing a pint of ice cream. If you struggle to use those sorts of displays, then you’ll also struggle with the other text-heavy features the glasses offer. Most notably, its “reactive” AI, translation and Cheatsheet — its teleprompter-esque service for presentations. In use Image of the rear temple tips of the Halliday Smart Glasses (Daniel Cooper for Engadget) Once you’ve followed the YouTube clip guiding you through setup, you’ll control your glasses via Halliday’s app. Set that up, make sure it’s connected, and it’ll be easy enough to run things just with the ring. You’ll need to memorize a cumbersome control scheme, which has to work to overcome its limited inputs. For instance, it’s easy enough to think that a click would be the dominant action, with the tap acting as the secondary one — but it’s the other way around. Initially, I was clicking (which activates the notification center) rather than tapping to access a menu item. That the clickpad is so small means you’ll do a fair bit of scrolling, too. Halliday’s focus on lightness extended beyond what you’d wear on your face, but how much you’d need to carry in your bag on the go. Rather than build a charging case, the USB-C charger is on the temple tip, hidden behind a little rubber gasket. Except, the gasket is very difficult to actually flick out of its recess and often gets pushed further in. It got to the point where I keep a paperclip on hand to flick it out when it’s time to recharge. Close up of the Control Ring and charger for the Halliday Smart Glasses (Daniel Cooper for Engadget) The control ring is charged magnetically, so you will be carrying around a little dongle and USB-C cable. It’s not much extra weight to carry, but it is yet another thing to deal with. Plus, if you’re in a hurry for power, you’ll need to charge two devices simultaneously rather than just putting both in a charging case. Look, maybe this is a gripe too far, but it feels like Halliday attempted to reduce complexity and, in doing so, made things a hell of a lot fiddlier when it comes to charging. Proactive AI Image of how Halliday pitched its proactive AI. (Halliday) Halliday pitched its glasses as being the “first” with a “proactive” AI running in the background of your day to offer context-based assistance. In one of the company’s examples, the system is listening to a conversation, enabling its wearer to act like a know-it-all. Certainly, it was this feature that most intrigued me as I’m sure we’ve all hoped for an electronic version of Gary from Veep every now and again. Image of a conversation between me and Halliday's Proactive AI (Daniel Cooper for Engadget) The Star Trek-esque promise of such a system clashes with its reality, since the proactive AI is just a constantly-running chatbot which treats everything as a prompt. Here’s the app’s own record of a conversation I had in which every line it heard gets its own response. It will even try to respond to the ums, ahs and other non-speech glue that holds speech together, saying that the line “doesn’t contain any factual claims.” And, don’t forget, all of this is being pushed into your peripheral vision for as long as the AI is active. Bear in mind you only have a limited amount of time credits with which to use the AI. So you can’t have it running in the background 24/7, but on this evidence, I’m not sure that you would ever want to. Hou says the company is working on improving this but, at this point, it doesn’t feel like a feature you’d want to use on a regular basis. Reactive AI The glasses’ reactive AI, meanwhile, is in dire need of some sort of help, since it often refused to answer my questions and, when it did, it often got its facts wrong. On September 18, I asked it who the current manager of (Portuguese football team) Benfica was, since it had just hired a new manager. But it told me the name of the old one, who’d been fired on August 31 — which isn’t ideal. Similarly, questions around basic facts concerning geography and science were either met with blank responses or lackluster answers. I know that plenty of AIs aren’t perfect for up-to-the-minute information, but what else would you want to use it for? Audio memo and transcription You can record audio memos through the glasses if you need to express an idea in a hurry. It’s worth noting, however, that the microphone quality is poor. It sounds like the sort of crunchy radio microphone audio you last heard in a live news broadcast from the 1980s. Given how much of the interaction with these glasses is through speech, the poor microphone quality is baffling. Sure, save on weight as much as possible, but not for the thing the glasses need to do one of their most critical jobs. Once recorded, you can then listen back to the memo in the app, and can even ask the system for a transcription. Bafflingly, you can’t just press the button and then go do something else in the app. If you want your words turned into (an approximate) text record, you’ll need to leave that specific pane open while it runs. I found this out after pressing the button a third time and, rather than moving to the next memo to get that transcribed, I was distracted by something on my laptop and then saw the transcript finally appear before my eyes. Music Halliday’s app claims it’s possible to use the glasses’ built-in speakers in place of your wireless headphones. And, yes, it is technically possible to do this, in the same way that it’s technically possible to steer a motorcycle with your feet or carve a block of marble with an iPhone. I’m no audiophile, but if you’re looking for a better listening experience, listening to a broken record player from a mile away with two paper cups and some string is probably better. It’s very much the sort of option you’d go for if you had to listen to something in the direst of emergencies — and then never again. Price and the competition If you opted to back Halliday’s glasses on Kickstarter, you could pick them up for $399. For the rest of us, it will be available to order through the Halliday website for $499, with shipping due to begin at the end of October. It is available in one of three colors: Black, Gradient or Tortoisehell, with prescription lenses included in the price, at least at the time of publication. If you order now, you will also get the control ring for free, but it will eventually cost $69. In terms of rival smart glasses, the closest competitor is likely Brilliant Labs’ Halo , which uses a similar standalone microLED display with the same focus on AI. Given the display option, if you think you’d struggle with Halliday, it’s easy to assume you won’t be happy with these either. Halo will set you back $299, although it’s worth mentioning that it’ll only be sold in limited quantities. One alternative is Rokid’s forthcoming Glasses , which are equipped with the sort of waveguide display lenses I prefer. The company promises it’ll offer real-time translation, a built-in AI assistant and an outward-facing camera. Would-be backers can pick them up for $549 on Kickstarter at present, with a retail price likely closer to $750 when they launch toward the end of this year. But if I was looking for a product that did a lot of what Halliday offered, albeit in a much more polished package, it’d be Even Realities G1 . There’s a lot to like about the G1, as it offers a more limited feature set, but one in which things actually work a lot better. The one downside is the price, since you’ll need to fork out $600 for the glasses and another $150 for the lenses. The big tech elephant in the room, of course, is Meta’s Ray-Ban Display glasses that seem to pay off on the promise of smart glasses’ premise. They’re obviously pricey, retailing for $799, but have all of the gadgets and gizmos you are likely to want and need. It ships with a 600 x 600 full color display in the lens, letting you engage with notifications a lot more like you would if you were using your phone. Wrap-up Close up of the Halliday Smart Glasses ring (Daniel Cooper for Engadget) My issues with the display certainly didn’t endear Halliday to me. But I think that the product is less than the sum of its parts, both from a hardware and software standpoint. The “proactive” AI is perhaps the biggest disappointment, given it’s just a chatbot responding to every interaction like a prompt.

2cdeec2ceb6c,Japan asks OpenAI not to infringe on 'irreplaceable' manga and anime content,"irreplaceable treasures, japan, openai, anime and manga, copyright infringement, sora","Japan's government has asked OpenAI not to infringe on anime and manga content that it called ""irreplaceable treasures,"" according to a report from ITMedia seen by IGN . The request was made by a key minister in charge of AI and IP in response to numerous videos from OpenAI's Sora 2 generator that use copyrighted material from Japanese studios. ""We have requested OpenAI not to engage in any actions that could constitute copyright infringement,"" said cabinet minister Minoru Kiuchi at a press conference last week. ""Anime and manga are irreplaceable treasures that we can be proud of around the world."" Launched on October 1, OpenAI's Sora 2 can generate 1080p videos up to 20 seconds long with sound. The company also released the Sora app that uses Sora 2 to generate TikTok-style videos of nearly anything. Anime has been a key theme, with many short videos replicating copyrighted materials from franchises like DragonBall and Pokémon. Despite the demand, Japan has been one of the more progressive nations when it comes to artificial intelligence. The nation's AI Promotion Act aims to boost the use of AI as an economic growth driver, while also outlining guidelines around copyright infringement. However, the topic of enforcement is still fuzzy so the government is trying to get a better grip on it. ""Japan bears a responsibility to take the lead on making rules [around AI and copyright], precisely because we are a country... [that creates] anime, games, and music,"" said parliament member Akihisa Shiozaki on his blog . Last month, OpenAI said it had contacted studios to give them the option of opting out of Sora 2 training on their materials, Reuters reported. The new process requires movie studios and other content owners to explicitly ask OpenAI to exclude their copyright material from videos generated by Sora. It's not known which, if any, Japanese studios the company has contacted.",https://www.engadget.com/ai/japan-asks-openai-not-to-infringe-on-irreplaceable-manga-and-anime-content-120008580.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/8954ccf0-a996-11f0-a8df-cb673ab07705,2025-10-15T12:00:08+00:00,189c9a9bdfdb75ee515fc3c251a66bb7fbff9950
d11c7de6d911,"Windows 10 support has ended, but here's how to get an extra year for free","microsoft, extended security, windows 11, windows 10, administrator account, esu","Still running Windows 10 on your PC? Did you know that as of October 14, Microsoft moved the software to its ""end of life"" phase? So while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. The good news is you still have three options to make sure your computer remains secure: You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible. You can buy a new PC that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook). Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year. Option three is pretty easy — and can now be done for free in many cases — so we'll focus on that one here. We'll walk you through the steps of keeping Windows 10 on your PC… for now, at least. How to sign up for Windows 10 Extended Security Updates on your computer We can question Microsoft's motives for killing off Windows 10, even though it works perfectly well on most older PCs. But without those periodic security updates, your PC will become increasingly susceptible to malware with each passing week. To that end, enrolling in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will give you another year of using Windows 10 securely. At one point, Microsoft suggested the 12-month extension would require a $30 fee. While that's still an option, there's now a free path for Windows 10 users in the US. Here's how to make it happen. Step 1: Make sure your PC is up to date You can find out if your computer is up-to-date by going into your Settings > System > About, then scroll down to see what version you're running. If not, you'll want to make sure you also install all the Windows 10 updates available. Step 2: Make sure you're using an administrator account If you share a computer with multiple people in your household, make sure you're signed in to the administrator account. Typically, it's the first account created on the computer. You'll know it's the right one when you see ""Administrator"" under the name. (You can double-check under Settings > Your Info.) Step 3: Verify if your PC is eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 (or not) If you see an option to upgrade to Windows 11 , just do that. It's free and it keeps you in the Windows loop. Otherwise, continue following the steps below so you can keep your computer safe with security updates. Step 4: Enroll in Extended Security Updates Sign up for ESU by selecting Update & Security from the Settings menu. Click the ""Enroll Now"" sign-up link, as pictured below. Again, you may see an option to download Windows 11 if your computer meets the requirements (again, definitely do that if you see it). Find out if you need to update your computer. (Screenshot/Engadget) If you're not seeing the ""Enroll now"" link, you probably need to update and install the latest Windows 10 updates (as noted above). By enrolling in Extended Security Updates, you'll have another year before you need to upgrade to Windows 11. (Screenshots/Engadget) Step 5: Choose your upgrade method Next up is choosing how you want to enroll, and you have a few options. The easiest way is to back up your PC settings. It's free, but it takes a little bit of time since you'll need to back up your data. Again, you'll need to use your administrator account to get started. Back up your PC before you enroll in ESU. (ExplainingComputers via YouTube) That said, the free option here comes with two catches, at least for users in the US. (European users will get the free option with no strings attached .) The first is that you'll be linking your Windows login to Microsoft's cloud-based online service. Most users have likely already done this (if they're using CoPilot, Office 365, GamePass, OneDrive or one of Microsoft's other various online services). But if you've specifically opted for a local login to Windows, the price you're paying for this ""free"" extension is joining the cloud-connected Microsoft universe. The other potential issue is that the free backup only applies to the first 5 GB of storage . Anything more, and you’ll need to pay up for Microsoft's OneDrive services. But thankfully, you can turn off anything you don't want to back up by going to Settings > OneDrive and toggling off options like Documents, Pictures and Videos to get in under the free threshold to start. Once you're signed in, a window will pop up that says ""Add this device to receive Extended Security Updates."" Click Add Device to enroll it. Click Done. A note: Thanks to YouTube's Explaining Computers channel , where we grabbed the screenshot above (since our test PC was already signed up for cloud backups, and didn't provide the splash screen to choose options). You can watch their full video if you'd like a deeper dive into the process. That's it, you're done! (Until next year) You've got 12 more months to figure out an alternative upgrade path to Windows 11. If anything changes next year, we'll update this story with what your next steps are. You did it right if you see this window.

74ab6ffc6a32,The best budget wireless earbuds for 2025,"wireless earbuds, noise cancellation, anc, skullcandy method, wireless charging","Big-name brands like Apple , Sony , and Bose tend to dominate the headlines when it comes to wireless earbuds , but that doesn’t mean you need to spend a ton to get something good. It’s more than possible to find a pair with clean sound, strong noise cancellation and a rich set of features for less than $100. That said, there’s still plenty of junk in the bargain bin, so you need to be careful. If you’re looking to make an audio upgrade on the cheap, we’ve read countless reviews, compared specs and tested a few dozen models ourselves to find the best budget wireless earbuds you can buy. This is a busy market with new options releasing all the time, but you can find our current favorites below. Table of contents Best budget wireless earbuds for 2025 Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Bluetooth : v5.2 | ANC : Yes | Transparency mode : Yes | Custom EQ : Yes | Charging port : USB-C | Wireless charging : Yes | Water resistance : IPX4 | Multipoint connectivity : Yes (2 devices) | Wear detection : No | Battery life (rated) : 10 hrs, 50 hrs w/ case | Fast charging (rated) : 10 mins = 4 hrs | Codecs : SBC, AAC, LDAC | Warranty : 18 months Three years into its life, we still haven't found a better value among wireless earbuds than the Anker Soundcore Space A40 . Typically available between $45 and $60, it offers the kind of performance and features we'd expect from earbuds priced twice as high. Its little round earpieces are light and evenly balanced, so they shouldn’t be a pain for most to wear for hours at a time. The default sound profile is good enough: It’s warm, with a bump in the upper-bass and a dip in the treble that can dull some finer details, but pleasant on the whole. It doesn’t completely blow out the low-end the way many cheaper headphones do. You can also customize the sound with EQ tools in the Soundcore app. Using those won’t make the Space A40 sound as nice as the best wireless earbuds on the market, but they can add a touch more deep bass or high-frequency emphasis. The app in general is easy to use, and it saves any changes you make directly to the earphones. The Space A40's best feature is its active noise cancellation (ANC), which is outstanding for the money. It won’t totally block out higher-pitched sounds, but it’s plenty effective at muting the rumbles of a train or jet engine. By default, Anker uses an adaptive ANC system that automatically tweaks the intensity based on your surroundings, though you can manually set it to strong, moderate or weak levels, too. That’s great for those with sensitive ears. There’s also a transparency mode, which isn’t nearly as good as what you’d find on a high-end pair like the AirPods Pro but works in a pinch. Most of the little touches you’d want from a modern set of headphones are here as well. The Space A40 can connect to two devices simultaneously, and you can use one earbud on its own. Battery life is solid at roughly eight hours, while the included charging case can supply another 40 or so hours. It also supports wireless charging. The IPX4 water resistance rating isn’t anything special but lets the earphones survive light rain and everyday sweat. The touch control scheme can feel somewhat busy, as it lets you assign up to six different shortcuts to different taps and long presses and effectively forces you to omit a function or two, but it works reliably. We’ve had no real connection issues, either. The only major shortcomings are the mic quality and the lack of auto-pausing when you remove an earbud. The former doesn’t handle sibilant sounds very well and can lose your voice in particularly noisy areas, so this isn’t the best option for phone calls, but it’s usable. Pros Excellent ANC for the money Pleasant, warm sound Multi-device connectivity and wireless charging support Comfortable fit Good battery life Cons No automatic wear detection Call quality is mediocre Audio performance isn't as detailed as higher-end options (as expected) $45 at Amazon Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Bluetooth : v5.3 | ANC : Yes | Transparency mode : Yes | Custom EQ : Yes | Charging port : USB-C | Wireless charging : Yes | Water resistance : IPX4 | Multipoint connectivity : Yes (2 devices) | Wear detection : Yes | Battery life (rated) : 10 hrs, 50 hrs w/ case | Fast charging (rated) : 10 mins = 4 hrs | Codecs : SBC, AAC, LDAC | Warranty : 18 months The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is a commendable option if you prefer a larger “stem” design akin to Apple’s AirPods. In many ways, these earphones are just the Space A40 in a different shape. Like our top pick, they deliver an impressive adaptive ANC system, a relatively secure fit, wireless charging, an intuitive app, IPX4-rated water resistance and the ability to connect with two devices at once. Battery life is about the same as well, but we were usually able to get a half-hour or so more out of the Liberty 4 NC. By default, this pair has an exciting sound with big, thumpy bass and a noticeable spike in the treble. It’s a good example of the “fun” EQ curve we often see from mainstream headphones nowadays, one that lends a nice sense of clarity to vocals and higher-range instrumentation. It fits especially well with EDM and pop music. That said, it’s intense, so some might find it fatiguing. The Space A40 doesn’t exactly sound neutral, but it comes off as easygoing by comparison, so it should be more agreeable for most. You can still personalize the Liberty 4 NC’s sound profile through a variety of EQ settings in the Soundcore app, but it’s hard to fully rein in the bass even with those. Beyond that, you can manually adjust the strength of this pair’s ANC on a five-step scale, which is a little more granular than the Space A40’s three-step system. The touch controls are slightly more extensive, as you can triple-tap each earbud to change volume or access other commands. It also supports wear detection, plus its integrated mics are a bit better at resisting wind noise. However, it’s sluggish to auto-pause whenever you remove an earbud, and call quality is still mediocre in general. The included transparency mode is still merely serviceable too. And at $100, it’s right on the edge of our “budget” limit. Along those lines: Anker has a couple newer models in the Liberty 4 Pro and Liberty 5 , but those cost more than the $100 threshold we've set for this guide. Pros Strong ANC for the money Multi-device connectivity and wireless charging support Comfortable Good battery life Cons Bass-heavy sound is fun but can be fatiguing Bulkier ""stem"" design is not for everyone Call quality isn't great $70 at Amazon Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Bluetooth : v5.2 | ANC : No | Transparency mode : No | Custom EQ : Yes | Charging port : USB-C | Wireless charging : Yes | Water resistance : IPX7 | Multipoint connectivity : No | Wear detection : No | Battery life (rated) : 7 hrs, 30 hrs w/ case | Fast charging (rated) : 10 mins = 2 hrs | Codecs : SBC, AAC | Warranty : 18 months If you don’t want to spend more than $50 on a set of true wireless earbuds, consider the Earfun Free 2S . Similar to the Liberty 4 NC, this pair has a big bass response and a smaller bump in the treble. It misses details in the mids and can feel exhausting to listen to over extended periods, but it’s a richer take on this kind of sound signature than most pairs in the price range. You can adjust the sound through EarFun’s app as well, though there are fewer EQ presets to choose from than with the Space A40. The earpieces themselves are well-shaped and not oversized. Combined with their soft silicone ear tips, they should be comfortable for most to wear over long periods of time. An IPX7 rating means they’re fully waterproof, too. There’s a suite of reliable touch controls and battery life sits at around seven hours of playtime. The included case adds another 30-ish hours and supports wireless charging, too. It’s not the smallest case we’ve used, but it’s not so large that it can’t fit in a pocket, either. That said, you start to run into more “you get what you pay for” situations once you drop into this price range. In addition to not sounding quite as sharp as our pricier picks, the Free 2S lacks active noise cancellation, multi-device connectivity, auto-pausing and a transparency mode. And though their mic quality is decent in most cases, it’s pretty susceptible to wind noise. Pros Very affordable Comfortable and compact fit IPX7 waterproof rating Lively, customizable sound Cons No ANC or ambient sound modes No wear detection or multi-device connectivity, either Sound quality is still less balanced than our top picks $40 at Amazon Jeff Dunn for Engadget Bluetooth : v5.3 | ANC : No | Transparency mode : Yes | Custom EQ : Yes | Charging port : USB-C (integrated) | Wireless charging : No | Water resistance : IP55 | Multipoint connectivity : No | Wear detection : No | Battery life (rated) : 9 hrs, 35+ hrs w/ case | Fast charging (rated) : 10 mins = 1 hr | Codecs : SBC | Warranty : 2 years Any of our picks above will be perfectly fine for working out. But if you want a set of cheap earphones specifically for the gym, the JLab Go Sport+ are a worthy buy at $30. Their around-the-ear hook design stays secure in place whether you're jogging, lifting or doing burpees. The hooks themselves are soft and flexible, so they shouldn’t be a pain to wear regardless of your ear size. The design is IP55 water-resistant, which isn’t the absolute best but is still enough to endure sweaty, non-swimming workouts. (Just note that the rating doesn’t apply to the charging case.) Battery life is solid at eight to nine hours per charge — or roughly 35 hours with the case — and the touch controls are consistently responsive, which isn’t a given at this price. There’s also a surprisingly usable transparency mode if you need to better hear your surroundings in a pinch. The Go Sport+ works with JLab’s simplistic but intuitive smartphone app, which lets you assign touch controls, check battery status and customize the EQ curve. If you don’t want to tinker, there are three preset EQ modes built in. Unfortunately, none of those make the Go Sport+ sound especially dynamic. The default “JLab Signature” profile is a little too light on bass and edgy in the treble compared to the Space A40. A “balanced” preset sounds even more compressed, while the “bass boost” profile doesn’t amplify the low-end to a meaningful degree. The default profile is still clean enough to get you through a ride on the exercise bike without being distracting, and it generally puts each part of a track in the right place. Nobody buys $30 earbuds for the audio quality — but the price is this low for a reason, so set your expectations accordingly. Along those lines, don’t expect a ton of bonus features: There’s no ANC, wireless charging, auto-pausing or multi-device connectivity. The case has a very short USB-C cable hardwired in, which is sort of convenient but demands extra care — if that cord breaks, you’ll need a whole new case. The case could stand to be a bit smaller, too, and the mic struggles in windy environments. Still, for $30, there’s plenty to like about the Go Sport+ as a cheap beater set used strictly for workouts. Pros Secure, gym-friendly design Highly affordable IP55-rated water resistance Solid battery life and ambient sound mode Cons Sound quality isn't great Affixed charging cable is very short No wear detection, multi-device connectivity or wireless charging Case could be smaller $30 at Amazon Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Bluetooth : v5.2 | ANC : No | Transparency mode : No | Custom EQ : Yes | Charging port : USB-C | Wireless charging : No | Water resistance : IPX2 | Multipoint connectivity : Yes (2 devices) | Wear detection : Yes | Battery life (rated) : 5 hrs, 6 hrs w/ wake word off, 20 hrs w/ case | Fast charging : 15 mins = 2 hrs | Codecs : SBC, AAC, aptX | Warranty : 1 year All of our picks so far are technically earphones , meaning they extend into your ear canal. For some people, that is inherently uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the market for decent yet affordable “earbuds,” which rest on the concha instead of going all the way in your ear, is spotty. If you can’t bring yourself to pay for a pair of AirPods , though, the Amazon Echo Buds are a decent compromise at $50. The plastic earpieces here aren’t exactly premium, but they rest lightly in the ear and feel sturdily put together. They let in and leak noise more easily than in-ear headphones, but if you prefer open earbuds, that’s more of a feature than a bug. If the fit doesn’t feel right, you can shed a little bulk by removing the pre-installed silicone covers. (Like most open earbuds, though, comfort here is dependent on your ear shape.) Mic quality is more than adequate, and the circular touch panels give ample room for using the controls, which are customizable and consistently responsive. Battery life sits around five hours, which is middling but not out of character for cheap wireless earbuds. The pocket-friendly case adds about three full charges, but it’s worth noting that Amazon doesn’t include a USB-C charging cable. A poor IPX2 water resistance rating means you should avoid the gym with these, too. While the Echo Buds sound fine out of the box, I'd use the EQ sliders in the Alexa app to bring down the treble a click or two. By default, the highs are a bit too edgy. That said, this emphasis lends a nice crispness to things like vocals, cymbals and strings, and there’s enough separation to keep complex tracks from sounding totally muddled. The profile here isn’t as full-bodied as the latest AirPods , and no open earbuds deliver true sub-bass, but there’s at least some rumble for hip-hop and EDM. Unlike many cheap wireless earbuds, the Echo Buds support auto-pausing and multi-device connectivity. I often had to manually pause playback on one device before I could switch to the other, but having the feature at all at this price is great. Unsurprisingly, they also come with Alexa baked in, which you can access hands-free. You manage the Echo Buds through the Alexa app, which is much more cluttered than a dedicated audio app but includes extras like a lost device tracker and sidetone control for phone calls. And if you want nothing to do with Alexa, it also lets you turn off the mics and wake-word support. Pros Actually decent unsealed earbuds that cost less than $50 Lightweight Pocket-friendly case Automatic wear detection Multi-device connectivity Hands-free (and optional) Alexa Cons Open design means you'll hear external noise all the time Poor water resistance Middling battery life Needs a little tweaking to sound its best Alexa app is a bit obnoxious $50 at Amazon Other budget wireless earbuds we tested The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC. (Jeff Dunn for Engadget) Note: This is a selection of noteworthy earbuds we’ve put through their paces, not a comprehensive list of everything we’ve ever tried. Skullcandy Method 360 ANC The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC is often available for $100, and at that price it’s worth considering over our picks above. These earphones have an extremely V-shaped sound signature with thunderous bass and noticeably clearer highs than the Soundcore Space A40, along with decent ANC and a bulky yet comfortable design that takes after Bose’s old QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds . They technically have a list price of $130, however, which puts them over the $100 limit we have for picks in this guide. Their enormous case and lack of wireless charging don’t help either. You can read our review for a full breakdown. Beats Solo Buds The $80 Beats Solo Buds are comfortable and long-lasting, with an impressive 18 hours of battery life. But they sound a bit flat and are severely lacking in features. There’s no ANC, wear detection or official water-resistance rating, and the included case can’t wirelessly charge the earbuds on its own. You can read our full review for more details. JLab Go Pop ANC The $30 JLab Go Pop ANC is worth a look if you just want a competent pair of wireless earphones for as little money as possible. It’s the cheapest set we’ve tested with active noise cancellation and transparency mode, though neither feature is all that effective. Like the Go Sport+, it also relies on a short USB-C cable tethered to its case to charge. But it actually sounds OK for the price: not particularly wide or detailed, but not harsh either, with decent energy and bass punch. The tiny earpieces fit snugly and isolate a good chunk of background noise passively. They’re also IP55-rated, while the case is similarly compact. There’s no auto-pausing, but you can connect to two devices at once, the touch controls work well and JLab’s app makes it easy to adjust settings. Battery life is alright at six to seven hours, too, though this is another one that’ll get wrecked by the wind if you take a call outside. The JLab Go Pop+ is another option here. It gives up the ANC, IP55 rating and multipoint connectivity, but it costs $5 less and has longer battery life. EarFun Air Pro 4 We liked what we heard from the EarFun Air Pro 4 for about a day or so — then one earbud broke, apparently deciding that it would only play at an extremely low volume from that point on. We’ve seen a few users report the same issue , while others have noted problems with crackling sounds coming out of single earpieces. This pair has received heaps of praise from other outlets, and we generally liked its predecessor, so it may well work for you. But we can’t recommend something that died before we could finish testing it. The Beats Solo Buds. (Photo by Billy Steele / Engadget) EarFun Free Pro 3 The EarFun Free Pro 3 are totally solid, but the Space A40 gets you superior ANC, longer battery life and a more comfortable design for a lower price these days. EarFun Air 2 Along those lines, the EarFun Air 2 are a good alternative to EarFun’s Free 2S if you’re partial an AirPods-style stem design, but they cost $10 more and aren’t significantly better. Baseus Bowie MA10 The Baseus Bowie MA10 are saddled with a ginormous charging case, a sloppy app and bulky earpieces that we found uncomfortable to wear over time. Baseus Eli Sport 1 The Baseus Eli Sport 1 have a fully open design that wraps around the ear and rests outside of your ear canal entirely. That’s nice for staying alert to the outside world, but it’s less so for getting the most detail out of your music. This is another pair with an oversized case, too. OnePlus Buds 3 The OnePlus Buds 3 have an excited sound and a stylish design in the same vein as the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, and their mic is a bit clearer for phone calls. They fall short of Anker’s pair when it comes to noise cancellation and battery life, however. Skullcandy Dime 3 The Skullcandy Dime 3 deliver a surprisingly neutral sound profile for their dirt-cheap price, so they’re worth considering over the JLab Go Pop ANC if you see them in the $25 range. Like that pair, they can also connect to two devices simultaneously. But their overall battery life is a bit shorter, their call quality is poor and their physical controls are both unintuitive and uncomfortable, since they lead you to push the buds deeper into your ear canals. Skullcandy Smokin' Buds The Skullcandy Smokin’ Buds are another ultra-budget option with a sick name, bro, but they sound harsher in the treble than the JLab Go Pop ANC and offer worse battery life through their charging case. This pair does use tap-based controls, but they can be finicky, and they still aren’t the most straightforward things to operate. Best cheap wireless earbuds: FAQs The JLab Go Pop ANC (left) and EarFun Air Pro 4. (Jeff Dunn for Engadget) What are the biggest differences between cheaper earbuds and more premium models? A higher price does not guarantee higher quality. We'd take a pair like the Anker Soundcore Space A40 over many alternatives priced well over $100. Broadly speaking, though, the pricier components used by the best wireless earbuds let them put out a more detailed and versatile sound, more powerful active noise cancellation and a more complete list of features like multipoint connectivity, faster pairing, wear detection or wireless charging. They generally feel less flimsy in the hand, and their companion software tends to be less buggy. Battery life may be longer as well. But you have to look at these things on a case-by-case basis: Some earbuds justify their cost, others very much do not. Can you improve the sound of cheap wireless earbuds? Evaluating audio quality is always subjective to some extent — what I find ""bloated,"" you may consider ""fun"" or ""lively."" In general, if a set of earbuds is tuned poorly or built with cheap materials, you can't magically fix that. However, most new pairs allow you to adjust their EQ curve through software, so you can sculpt the frequency ranges in a way that better suits your tastes, at least somewhat. Also, remember that fit is king: If your in-ear headphones aren't sealed tight enough, they'll inevitably sound less detailed, with weaker bass response and worse isolation from outside noise. Consider trying different ear tips in that case. Can cheap earbuds sound as good as AirPods? A few can, sure! I'd take the top-end AirPods Pro 3 over any of the top picks in this guide, but they are far from unassailable. Meanwhile, the AirPods 4 's unsealed design prevents them from pumping out truly deep bass, and I find them to sound a bit veiled in the treble. (They're still a level above the open-back Amazon Echo Buds, though.) The big appeal with AirPods is how tightly they integrate with other Apple devices: You open them with an iPhone and they just work. No other earbuds can replicate that, cheap or otherwise, because Apple uses proprietary tech that prevents competitors from offering the same features. Again, price and advertising budget has little to do with how good a set of earbuds is. (This is a silly question, but we know some casual buyers will inevitably ask it.) Recent updates October 2025 : We’ve made a few light edits to ensure our recommendations are still up-to-date. June 2025 : We’ve ensured our picks are still accurate and added testing notes on Skullcandy’s Method 360 ANC. April 2025 : The JLab Go Sport+ replaces the older JLab Go Air Sport as our “best for workouts” pick. We’ve also added testing notes on the EarFun Air Pro 4 and JLab Go Pop ANC, removing our blurbs for their predecessors along the way. December 2024 : We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and moved the aging JLab Go Air Pop and EarFun Air Pro 3 from honorable mentions to our “others we tested” section. September 2024 : We’ve added notes on a handful of other budget wireless earbuds that we’ve tested but fall short of our top picks, which remain unchanged.

Accordingly, we’ve removed the Nothing Ear Stick as an honorable mention, as it no longer appears to be available — though it remains a decent option if you do see it and want an unsealed alternative to the Amazon Echo Buds.

30033488166a,"The best streaming deals: Save on Hulu + Live TV, Audible, Starz and more","streaming service, live tv streaming, disney, streaming services","Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Hulu Paid for by Hulu Hulu + Live TV — $64.99/mo for 3 months ($25/mo off): New and eligible returning subscribers can get three months of Hulu + Live TV at a rate of $65 per month, which is much cheaper than the current $83-per-month rate and a whopping 27 percent off the new $90-per-month rate that kicks in on October 21. In addition to live TV content, unlimited DVR and access to more than 95 live TV channels, this service also includes Disney+ and ESPN Select, so you're essentially getting three separate streaming services under this umbrella. We consider that to be Hulu + Live TV's edge, and we named it one of the best live TV streaming services on the market right now. Just remember that your subscription will be billed at the new standard $90/month rate after the first three months. $64.99/mo for three months at Hulu Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off) : From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $30 ($40 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $5 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base ""Entertainment"" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Spotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart , you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing as of October 21, 2025, accounting for the latest price hike. Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off) : Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

The company said that it will use this opportunity to officially unveil its Android XR headset, internally known as Project Moohan. The livestreamed event will take place on Tuesday, October 21 at 10PM ET and you can watch either on Samsung's website or on its YouTube channel. It's possible that Samsung always anticipated having an event next week, but it's also possible that the company's hand was forced after a big leak last week disclosed several notable details about Project Moohan. According to the leaks, the headset's official name will be Samsung Galaxy XR and it is the first commercial product to leverage the Android XR platform for augmented reality. We knew Samsung was aiming to release this headset sometime this year, so it's very likely we'll learn both the release date and the price during Worlds Wide Open.",https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-introduce-its-android-xr-headset-at-a-galaxy-event-on-october-21-230000605.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/arxCdk5QmN9kUC5F3awmBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/e83bee10-a54a-11f0-bfff-5a48d30fbea3,2025-10-14T23:00:00+00:00,c220e762c8c540bc777d161dabc75757947e758a
39c5df94ab64,DirecTV will start replacing screensavers with AI-generated ads next year,"directv, ai company, glance, generative ai","DirecTV will begin replacing your TV's screensaver with AI-generated ads thanks to a new partnership. The entertainment brand is working with Glance, an AI company that has received backing from Google and developed an on-device AI tool alongside the tech giant. The new AI-powered screensavers will begin rolling out to DirecTV Gemini devices early next year. Glance's press release about the deal presents the tech's capability in lofty language: ""Shop smarter by discovering and engaging with products and brands in an AI-led virtual and visually immersive shopping experience that feels native to TV."" In practice, however, it sounds like a viewer can use the Glance mobile app to do things like insert themselves or other people into AI-generated videos appearing on their televisions. Then they can use the voice remote to alter the person's wardrobe and then buy items similar to the AI-generated images from your phone. ""We are making television a lean-in experience versus lean back,"" Rajat Wanchoo, Glance's group vice president of commercial partnerships, told The Verge , which initially picked up news of the partnership. ""We want to give users a chance to use the advancements that have happened in generative AI to create a ChatGPT moment for themselves, but on TV."" It's unclear how many DirecTV customers want to have a ChatGPT moment for themselves, but questions about whether people want or need a feature hasn't stopped most AI companies from pushing ahead with business plans. The press release doesn't note whether viewers will be able to turn off this screensaver feature once it's live.",https://www.engadget.com/directv-will-start-replacing-screensavers-with-ai-generated-ads-next-year-224436035.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Kz3swC0j6EYQCuxJ.avPgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/Glance_AI_DirecTV.png,2025-10-14T22:44:36+00:00,bd477abb6c685b21fcbde2c6845c0414ee0b0b7d
065562287f56,Banjo-Kazooie director Gregg Mayles confirms he's left Rare,"gregg mayles, sea of thieves, donkey kong country, game cancellations","Gregg Mayles, the director of Sea of Thieves and designer on Donkey Kong Country , has announced that he's left Rare. News of Mayles' exit was first reported in July 2025 during a rash of layoffs and game cancellations across Xbox Games Studios, but the short poem he shared on X today makes it official. With a 36-year tenure at the studio, Mayles saw its transition from an exclusive Nintendo partner to a Microsoft subsidiary. He helped design games like Battletoads, created Banjo-Kazooie and when studio founders Tim and Chris Stamper left in 2007, stepped up and became Rare's creative director. Mayles also led the team behind Sea of Thieves , one of Rare's modern successes. The studio has been supporting Sea of Thieves with new content since it was released in 2018, but was also working on a new project, Everwild , that was announced in 2019 . The game went through a troubled development process over the last few years, and Rare reportedly started from scratch in 2021 with Mayles taking over as director. Microsoft's decision to cancel the game and layoff staff at the studio this summer is likely one of the reasons he left. Losing Mayles is just one example of Microsoft's self-inflicted wounds from 2025. The company not only made cuts at Halo Studios and Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 , it also increased the prices of both Xbox consoles and Game Pass Ultimate . All of these changes are seemingly in service of shifting the Xbox business into something that's more focused on subscriptions and game publishing, but the transition definitely seems like a painful one.",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-confirms-hes-left-rare-220828667.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iIH9T5pSt5Dx.JyELvNDnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/a07ba260-a945-11f0-bd9b-311277d21ccd,2025-10-14T22:08:28+00:00,27cd2a2c229e976746252a2e8004cf7a07f28ddb

We reached out to Meta for confirmation and a representative said, ""This Group was removed for violating our policies against coordinated harm,"" however they did not confirm the name of the group or whether the DOJ was involved in the action. Officers for the immigration agency have reportedly been moving through Chicago with facial coverings, no name tags and sometimes in vehicles with no license plates, although a US District Judge ruled that all ICE agents who are not undercover are required to display visible identification while operating in the Chicagoland area. The Department of Justice has demanded that other tech companies remove content the current administration has deemed critical of its immigration policies and practices. At the start of the month, Apple removed ICEBlock, an app for tracking the movements of immigration agents, from the App Store following similar pressure from Bondi. ""Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,"" ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron said in an interview following the action.

79006785efb5,Google reportedly offers to tweak search results to avoid EU fine,"google search, google, google flights, search results","In order to avoid paying billions of dollars in fines for violating the European Union's Digital Markets Act, Google is considering changing how search results are displayed, Reuters reports . EU regulators first took issue with Google's Search and Play Store businesses in March 2025, claiming it favored its own services in search results over third-party options and prevented developers from informing customers of alternative ways of accessing apps. One of regulators main issues with Google Search was that Google appeared to favor results from services like Google Flights or Google Hotels over ones from ""vertical search services,"" providers that specialize in displaying search results from a specific industry, like Expedia or Hotels.com. To avoid fines, Google now wants Search to give VSS businesses equal treatment in results. ""We will create the opportunity for each VSS to show its own box on Search. A VSS box will be populated with results from that VSS inventory,"" Google said in a proposal viewed by Reuters . Results from Google's own services will exist with the same formatting alongside, and the winning VSS box will be displayed in search results based on ""objective and non-discriminatory criteria."" Importantly, search results from actual airlines and car rental companies won't be excluded, they'll also appear in a box ""above or below the VSS box depending on the relevance to the user's query."" Engadget has asked Google to comment on Reuters ' report and to confirm the details of its proposed changes to Google Search. We'll update this article if we hear back. Like Apple, Google faces significant scrutiny from the EU because of its monopolistic control over its various platforms and services. The threat of fines from the DMA has forced Apple to open up its products to third-party app stores , among a host of other changes. Clearly, Google is willing to tweak what once seemed like untouchable pillars of its business to avoid fines, too. Whether these proposed changes will be enough for the regulators remains to be seen, though.",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-reportedly-offers-to-tweak-search-results-to-avoid-eu-fine-193940005.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8jqg4ecRhDQdTOfmWNc3nQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/d91486c0-a934-11f0-b79f-75cdf358ab46,2025-10-14T19:39:40+00:00,0c5e8d9be6e75ed00a0da035772aef7813915fed

On October 3, Discord disclosed a data breach that the company says included a “small number” of government IDs like driver’s licenses and passports, which some users had submitted to verify their ages. Days later the company updated its statement to name 5CA as the target of the hack, which Discord contracts as part of its customer service efforts. It also disclosed that the ""small number"" of government IDs encompasses roughly 70,000 users. ""We are aware of media reports naming 5CA as the cause of a data breach involving one of our clients.

The company goes on to explicitly state ""the incident occurred outside of our systems and that 5CA was not hacked."" 5CA says that a preliminary investigation showed that the incident may have been the result of ""human error,"" though it offers no details as to what exactly that implies. In a recent interview with BleepingComputer , the hackers who claimed responsibility for the breach said they had access to Discord's Zendesk account for 58 hours on September 20.

Other video podcasts that are coming to Netflix include The Rewatchables, The Recipe Club, Dissect, Conspiracy Theories and Serial Killers. Netflix sees these podcasts as complementary to its current offerings ( The Ringer F1 Show , for instance, will sit neatly alongside Drive to Survive ). Of course, for Spotify, this is a way to get more eyeballs and eardrums on its original programming. With TV viewing becoming a bigger priority for YouTube over the last few years, this seems like a way for Netflix to bite back in the battle for consumer attention, given the prevalence of video podcasts on Google’s platform.

98132e02db14,X experiments with showing more information about profiles to fight inauthentic engagement,"nikita bier, compromised account, fake accounts","X has long been a hotbed for fake accounts, bots and other scammy behavior. Many of those dynamics have been exacerbated by the rise of paid verification, which boosts the visibility of anyone who pays for a subscription. Now, the company is running a small experiment that could help users better identify potentially suspicious accounts. The service is starting to test a new ""about this account"" feature that will provide details about when an account joined the platform, where the person running it is based, how many times the username has been changed and how the account is connected to X. The feature is a lot like the ""page transparency"" information on Facebook, which provides similar details about when a given page was created and where the people running it are based. ""When you read content on X, you should be able to verify its authenticity,"" X's head of product, Nikita Bier, shared in a post about the change. ""This is critical to getting a pulse on important issues happening in the world."" If fully rolled out, this type of feature could help people on X understand a lot of common scams and other deceptive behavior on the platform. For example, scammers often change the handle of a recently compromised account in order to trick an account's existing followers.

662d32230cb2,SteelSeries' updated Nova 7 gaming headset offers much better battery life,gaming headset,"SteelSeries just released a refresh of its popular Arctis Nova 7 midrange gaming headset. The Nova 7 Gen 2 offers significantly improved battery life, with an increase of around 40 percent when compared to the original version. This translates to 54 hours of use per charge, which is a mighty fine metric. There's quick-charging that can provide six more hours of use in 15 minutes at the outlet. It charges via USB-C and can simultaneously play audio from both a 2.4GHz wireless connection and Bluetooth audio. This means that users can mix and match audio sources, which comes in handy when gaming. The headset connects wirelessly to all major gaming consoles, in addition to PCs and phones. VIDEO The Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 integrates with the company's mobile app. This offers more than 200 presets for specific games, all of which adjust the EQ to match what's being played. On PC, the presets will automatically adjust depending on the game. These are headphones intended for gaming, so they also include a noise-cancelling microphone. This little boom mic can be hidden within the headset and disabled when using a standalone microphone. As for aesthetics, the Nova 7 looks a lot like the company's high-end headsets . It's available in three colors, including black, white and magenta. The headset is available to purchase right now and costs $200. It does lack a few features included with its higher-priced cousins, like the swappable battery system and active noise cancellation.",https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/steelseries-updated-nova-7-gaming-headset-offers-much-better-battery-life-171435527.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/5f387af0-a920-11f0-b9f7-2ccaf726aa23,2025-10-14T17:14:35+00:00,fac0333e89ca0a0cecf12228fe119683eb487b45
e86c1ba536da,Spotify's managed accounts will help keep your kids from wrecking your music taste profile,"spotify premium family plan, spotify, managed accounts, explicit content, spotify premium, standard spotify premium","Spotify has introduced a new ""managed accounts"" feature aimed at younger listeners. Initially piloted last year and launching in seven new markets, including the US, today, it allows parents and guardians with a Spotify Premium Family plan to allocate their children a dedicated profile with their own personalized recommendations and custom playlists. The idea is that the adults can filter out explicit content, limit the playback of certain artists and hide video playback features, including Canvas , should they want to. Users on this profile can’t use interactivity features like Messages either. Perhaps most importantly of all for some, a managed account also ensures that your personal Wrapped results at the end of the year aren’t dominated by whatever TikTok-viral songs the kids have been obsessively playing on repeat for months — and they won't mess with your Discover Weekly algorithm either. Spotify's 'Exclude from your Taste Profile' feature already offers a way of keeping the nonsense your kids might be listening to away from your own recommended content, but this feels like a cleaner option for families. Standard Spotify Premium features like daylist and the aforementioned Discover Weekly remain available to someone using a managed account, making it a better option for kids becoming interested in music (they may even have gotten hooked on a band you’ve been listening to in the car) than the Spotify Kids app, which is very much designed for the ' Baby Shark ' devotees. It’s probably helpful to think of a managed account as a bridge between that and an unrestricted Premium account where all the music in the world is at your fingertips. To set up a managed account, the plan owner has to go into their account settings within the Spotify app and select ""Add a Member,"" followed by selecting ""Add a listener aged under 13."" The app will provide further instructions from there. As a reminder, a Spotify Premium Family plan is required to set up a managed account. This currently costs $20 per month.",https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-managed-accounts-will-help-keep-your-kids-from-wrecking-your-music-taste-profile-154406843.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/91fuCXu6XQUOdNqHLbOklw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD00NTg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/0f31c1f0-a912-11f0-bdfc-d6e63fee477e,2025-10-14T15:44:06+00:00,55f8c8309fb46429f7a8a2b5097e6add9ff6dfee
4d625851a901,MLB,,"Oct 16, 2025, 09:12 AM ET Anthony Volpe recently had surgery to repair a partially torn labrum in his left shoulder, according to multiple reports, jeopardizing his availability for the start of the 2026 season and further complicating the New York Yankees ' plan at shortstop. Volpe underwent the surgery Tuesday -- less than a week after the end of his disappointing 2025 season -- and was operated on by Yankees team physician Dr. Chris Ahmad, according to reports. The New York Post first reported Volpe's surgery Wednesday. The Yankees are expected to officially confirm the reports when general manager Brian Cashman and manager Aaron Boone hold their end-of-season news conference Thursday. Volpe initially injured his shoulder in early May and was hampered by the injury throughout the season. The former top prospect had two cortisone shots -- one in July, and another in September -- but Cashman indicated last month that the Yankees thought Volpe might avoid surgery. Recovery timelines for labrum operations often vary, but the minimum time required to heal from the surgery is typically four months. Cashman and Boone are expected to discuss Volpe's situation Thursday, but a lengthy recovery likely will force the Yankees to search for alternatives at shortstop. Volpe's future with the Yankees already was uncertain after he struggled throughout the season. The former Gold Glove winner committed 19 errors -- tied for the third-most in the majors -- and batted just .212 with a .663 OPS. He went 5-for-26 in New York's seven postseason games, striking out 16 times. Jose Caballero filled in for Volpe at shortstop over the final two months of the season, and the Yankees also could use Oswaldo Cabrera at the position. Shortstop George Lombard Jr. is New York's top minor league prospect , but the 20-year-old batted just .215 in 108 games at Double-A Somerset this season and is considered a long shot to make the Yankees' Opening Day roster in 2026.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46614007/reports-yankees-anthony-volpe-undergoes-shoulder-surgery,Sport,Espn,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0826%2Fr1537207_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,1ad3181fee63fbd3b2761737dcbc38146e625899
d04d13c2a140,How Berhalter revived Chicago Fire after USMNT fired him,,"MIAMI -- It was a little more than a year ago that Gregg Berhalter led the U.S. men's national team to a historically disappointing Copa America run, becoming the first ever host-nation of the CONMBEBOL tournament to be eliminated in the group stage. The team's two losses and one win prompted the U.S. Soccer Federation to fire Berhalter, forcing the coach's second exit from the national team. As #BerhalterOUT inundated social media, questions about his future in the game naturally began. With a resume that included head coaching stints with the USMNT, Columbus Crew and Hammarby in Sweden, many wondered what, if anything in the coaching realm, was next for him. And, less than four months after his firing, Chicago Fire FC announced Berhalter would become the club's new head coach and director of football for the 2025 season. It marked Berhalter's return to MLS , the league where he won two titles as a player and, in doing so, he was undertaking the task of rebuilding a fallen franchise. The Fire had not qualified for the MLS Cup playoffs since the 2017 season and finished the 2024 campaign in last place of the Eastern Conference. Berhalter quickly responded to the challenge, transforming the perennial contenders for the Wooden Spoon -- the infamous, and unofficial, award for the worst overall record in the MLS regular season -- to a team that clinched a 2025 MLS playoff spot with a thrilling 5-3 win over Inter Miami CF and Lionel Messi . Along the way, he has also set a Chicago Fire record for away performances. Simultaneously, as the Chicago Fire makes history under Berhalter, the U.S. men's national team continues to struggle under new manager Mauricio Pochettino, having fallen short in both the Gold Cup and the Nations League earlier this year. But Berhalter insists he feels no vindication in seeing the USMNT continue to descend while he reaches new heights with Chicago. ""No, because I never thought it was me,"" Berhalter told ESPN. ""It's always a combination of forces. When you look at my record, you know, I think I'm the winningest coach of all time in U.S. soccer history. So, it's not like I did a poor job. ""It was a young team and we qualified [for the 2022 World Cup], we did well at the World Cup and we were building. But I also understand decisions and I never took it personally. I never needed vindication. For me, it's about wherever I go trying to be successful and doing my best."" And he is doing just that with the Fire. play 1:04 Keller: USMNT haven't improved under Pochettino Kasey Keller says he can't see any changes for the USMNT since Mauricio Pochettino has replaced Gregg Berhalter. A team united in Chicago Berhalter understood the challenges the Fire posed, but he saw potential in the team's ownership and the city around him. Having lived in Chicago for six years while coaching the national team, the Fire's new manager learned to listen to the city's cry for MLS success and took on the ""civic duty"" of making that happen. Despite low expectations, Berhalter faced immense pressure to perform. But instead of shying away from the emerging demands, he channeled his previous experiences in order to prevail. ""Pressure is something that I learned with the national team,"" Berhalter said. ""The stakes at the national team level are really, really high. When you're coaching in a World Cup and you're facing potential elimination, if you lose to England, you have to be able to deal with pressure."" Gregg Berhalter led the Chicago Fire to the team's first postseason since 2017, but he denies feeling vindication after U.S. Soccer fired him as coach of the USMNT last year. Matt Marton-Imagn Images Before the season, Berhalter created a roadmap to success for the club that included a complete shift in staff and player culture. He hired new staff -- including a director of performance and a head of strategy -- and recruited players in the winter transfer window who fit into the new identity he wanted for the club. Though the team previously chased after bigger names like Xherdan Shaqiri and Bastian Schweinsteiger to come in with international experience, Berhalter knew one star player could not reignite the flame of the Fire. Instead of a world-renowned Designated Player, he looked for players who embodied three characteristics Berhalter identified as key: growth, togetherness, and accountability. After working with the national team, Berhalter knew the importance of centering a team around the concept of camaraderie instead of one or headline players. ""Trying to help fit everyone into a team is something I learned from working with top talented players, working with bigger type egos,"" said Berhalter. In his director of football role, Berhalter is not willing to rule out to the arrival of an international sensation, but he would only consider the signing if the player fit the culture he is building. ""We are about the collective -- it's about how our 11 players plus the substitutes that come in can help the team play together. And that's really the strength of our group. That's what the whole playing system is now built around,"" said Berhalter. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now His concept of a collective fight was on full display with that impressive win in Miami to secure their postseason berth. Each of Chicago's five goals in the 5-3 win was scored by a different player, with D'Avilla Djé , Jonathan Dean , Rominigue Kouamé , Justin Reynolds and Brian Gutiérrez , illustrating Berhalter's main point: no single player can lead this team. That collective under Berhalter has the Fire standing second in the league for most goals scored with 66, behind only Messi's Inter Miami (76). Brian Gutiérrez has been with the Fire since 2020, and he says Berhalter's approach is more than just talk. ""The most important thing he's changed is culture, and having a bond with the entire team,"" Gutiérrez said. ""In recent times we didn't have that comradery, and now it shows on the field."" Getting 'so mad' and creating a 'huge shift' The Chicago Fire concluded 2024 in last place of the Eastern Conference table with just 30 points and seven wins in 34 games. But the season's disappointments felt familiar, as the team failed again to crack the top 10 of the East -- the last time they had done so was in 2019, when the East only had 12 teams. A team that once reached soaring heights -- winning the 1998 MLS Cup and multiple U.S. Open Cups in the early 2000s -- was nowhere to be found. Decades of mediocrity plagued Chicago and seemed to extend to any player who arrived at the club. Though players wanted to win and improve, draws and loses especially during away games became an accepted norm, Chicago Fire player Andrew Gutman told ESPN. ""MLS is such a hard league, especially to play away, you know, with the travel and the time change in different climates. There's a lot of variables that go into it, so the team sometimes just plays for draws away -- for whatever reason, that was the mindset,"" Gutman said. Berhalter immediately saw the need to set higher expectations on every level on and off the field. ""We don't want complacency,"" said Berhalter. ""No matter who you are, what age you are, you know, we believe you can still improve. So that's a really important value of ours."" STREAM FUTBOL AMERICAS ON ESPN+ Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only) The Fire kicked off 2025 with a 4-2 loss to the Columbus Crew before enjoying a five-game undefeated streak. The results began to mirror the team's evolution under Berhalter, slowly approaching a form of consistency. But before the Berhalter could feel like he turned the page into a new chapter for the club, the game against the New York Red Bulls on April 5 at Sports Illustrated Stadium proved a stark reminder of the mediocrity he was trying to overcome. Though Chicago took the lead early in New Jersey, the Red Bulls rallied to win 2-1. The normally cool-headed coach didn't hold back, unloading his disappointment onto his players so they understood that the standards of the past were no longer acceptable. ""The one game in particular that I remember was the Red Bull game away from home, and that was one of the moments,"" Berhalter told ESPN. ""There's been a few moments in the season where I go to the next level. I'm very even-keeled, but that was one of those moments. ""It was really about expectations because I was trying to communicate to the team about wherever we go, no matter where we go, we should have the expectation to win the game. And I didn't like that game, it felt it was missing a little. Like we're okay with two or one draws or a loss. And I was like, guys, 'It's not good enough. We can do so much more.' And so that was a big moment in the group of saying that like, expectations need to be different."" That game served as a turning point for the Fire, Gutman said. While players previously understood the coach's philosophy about high expectations and the need for excellence, the defeat provided tangible evidence on the dangers of complacency. ""He was so mad at us because he knew that we were the better team, and he felt like we only lost because of our mentality,"" Gutman said. ""And so from that game, I felt like there was a huge shift in the players realizing, 'OK, we're going to go win, away or wherever it is, we don't care.' Every single away game, he always reinforces the fact that we're here to win, we're here to get three points. And if we don't win, it's unacceptable."" After that game, the Fire rattled nine away victories this regular season -- an all-time Fire record. Chicago's 41 goals on the road leads the league for most goals scored in away games. With one regular season matchday left, the Fire sit behind only Cincinnati and San Diego (11 each) for the most away wins in MLS. In just one season, Berhalter has propelled Chicago to almost as many away victories as the team had in the previous three seasons combined. Even when entering the game against Inter Miami at Chase Stadium and facing the likes of Messi, Luis Suárez , Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba , Gutman told ESPN the team felt confident due to the confidence Berhalter instilled in them. ""We're going to need to play Miami away to clinch a playoff spot -- like, we didn't really feel the pressure,"" Gutman said afterward. ""We almost felt like we should win this game. We felt like we were set up perfectly to do exactly what we did... I was like, 'Why am I not feeling anxious or something that we're about to kind of break this playoff streak, you know?' But it was just like the day-to-day expectations that were put on us -- like, 'We got it.' "" In just over a year with Berhalter as head coach and director of football, the transformation in Chicago is evident. Now the next challenge awaits: The MLS Cup playoffs. The Fire have clinched at least a wildcard spot in the East, but depending how this weekend's Decision Day plays out, the Fire could earn a bye to the first round. Despite struggles in recent years, expectations continue to soar for Chicago and the players are aiming for the MLS Cup. ""I knew it was going to change under Gregg -- you could just see as soon as he walked in the room that we had finally got someone within the club that's going to bring it back to where it was,"" said Gutman. Thanks to a new culture, shift in expectations and a collective mentality, Berhalter is driving Chicago towards a possible first MLS Cup since 1998.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46607038/usmnt-gregg-berhalter-chicago-fire-major-league-soccer-world-cup,Sport,Espn,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560682_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,3e08309df24c1a7b276f7a16b91f675299b33b69

November and December matter. They matter plenty. Those are the games that shape the narrative for the rest of the season and are referenced when the selection committee is making many of its most difficult decisions. Take last season's top teams. For a second consecutive season, UConn had some nonconference stumbles that cost the eventual national champion a No. 1 seed. Tennessee may have cost itself a top-four seed last season by playing a nonconference schedule that wasn't quite tough enough to compensate for a 3-5 start to SEC play. That won't be the case this year, with games against NC State, Louisville and UCLA in the first two months. The Bruins play not only the Lady Vols, but four other top-15 teams before the end of November. If they get a top seed this season, the Bruins will have earned it. Another team with a heavy early schedule is Duke, which plays four top-20 programs in the first two months. With the 2025-26 season less than three weeks away, let's look at the games we may look back at, come March, to understand why teams did or did not get into the NCAA tournament field, or their seedings.. Note: This isn't a ranking, but rather a chronological list. Holiday events were generally left off -- except for the first women's Players Era Championship. The Thanksgiving event in Las Vegas could be one of the best two days regular-season women's college basketball has ever seen. Duke, South Carolina, Texas and UCLA will all be there.

The Blue Devils and Bears are the latest teams to kick things off in Paris. Duke returns four starters, plus leading scorer Toby Fournier , who came off the bench last season. Plus, this game will mark the debut of Emilee Skinner , the No. 4 recruit in the girls SC Next 100. This also marks the first game in a Baylor uniform for two-time transfer Taliah Scott , who could be the big-time wing scorer the Bears have lacked the past few seasons. Nov. 4 | 4 p.m. ET | Greensboro | ESPN2 The Wolfpack are not easing into the post-Aziaha James/Saniya Rivers era. Three of their first four games are against the Lady Vols, USC and TCU.

But just because there's a common thought or belief about a player doesn't mean it's right. That's why we asked our fantasy basketball experts André Snellings, Eric Moody, Eric Karabell, Jim McCormick and Steve Alexander to identify one player they feel differently about for this season compared with the rest of the crowd. Joel Embiid provides a big value after Round 3 Embiid will participate in 62 games and average 28 PPG, 10 RPG and 1.5 BPG, making him a fourth- or fifth-round bargain. It is so easy to be pessimistic about Embiid and not only the constant concerns about him staying healthy, but the numbers when he does play. Many forget he averaged 67 games for the 2021 and 2022 seasons and the numbers were fantastic. It really wasn't that long ago. OK, so perhaps Embiid sits all/most situations with back-to-back games, but I will be optimistic and predict big things for Embiid and the 76ers, even if I remain scared to invest top-30 draft capital in fantasy. -- Karabell Anthony Davis shouldn't be drafted in the first round Davis is being drafted in the first round of fantasy drafts, but I don't see it. It looks to me like he's somewhat out of shape and hasn't done much to get excited about in the preseason, and his injury history is staggering. Add in that Kyrie Irving is not likely to play this season, and it's hard to see the Mavericks having a lot to play for down the stretch. I'm letting someone else draft Davis in all of my leagues, as the risk is too great. -- Alexander Zion Williamson should be taken before the third round Everyone's treating Williamson like a risky fantasy pick, but the ceiling is massive. He put up 24.6 PPG, 7.2 RPG and 5.3 APG in 30 games last season and also posted career-best marks in steals and blocks. Yes, durability is a concern, as he has played 30 or fewer games in four of six seasons, but he enters 2025-26 in the best shape of his career. If he stays healthy, Williamson can smash his ADP (33.0) and finish inside the top 20. -- Moody Jamal Murray 's fantasy value is inflated Last season marked a career effort statistically, yet it still wasn't elite production compared with the high bar set at point guard in the NBA. I am a fan of Murray's game from a real basketball lens, but not as enthused in fantasy given the lack of any single special category. Denver capably replaced the usage and shooting volume of Michael Porter Jr . (with Cameron Johnson ) and arguably has more shot creation rostered than last season. -- McCormick Reed Sheppard has what it takes to be a top-60 guy I am higher on Sheppard than most. I think he is a clear top-60 player in category leagues and has similar upside in points leagues. Coming out of the 2024 NBA draft, I had Sheppard as the player in his class most ready to produce, with a consistent 3-point shot and strong combo guard skills. But Sheppard was drafted to a Rockets team with too many quality perimeter options to get an opportunity as a rookie. After the team traded two perimeter starters for Kevin Durant and lost Fred VanVleet to injury, Sheppard is now poised to earn starter's minutes and an honorary ""Sophomore of the Year"" award this season. -- Snellings",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/story/_/id/46608002/fantasy-basketball-experts-pinpoint-one-player-feel-differently-compared-crowd,Sport,Espn,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560745_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,b52857aaab2e2490f6e24a2f310c78f412c5205e
f1de76f0247f,OpenAI forms advisory council on wellbeing and AI,"advisory council, emotional wellness, mental health, expert council, advisory councils","OpenAI announced today that it is creating an advisory council centered on its users' mental and emotional wellness. The Expert Council on Well-being and AI comprises eight researchers and experts on the intersection of technology and mental health. Some of the members were experts that OpenAI consulted as it developed parental controls . Topics of safety and protecting younger users have become more of a talking point for all artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, after lawsuits questioned their complicity in multiple cases where teenagers committed suicide after sharing their plans with AI chatbots. This move sounds like a wise addition, but the effectiveness of any advisor hinges on listening to their insights. We've seen other tech companies establish and then utterly ignore their advisory councils; Meta is one of the notable recent examples. And the announcement from OpenAI even acknowledges that its new council has no real power to guide its operations: ""We remain responsible for the decisions we make, but we’ll continue learning from this council, the Global Physician Network, policymakers, and more, as we build advanced AI systems in ways that support people’s well-being."" It may become clearer how seriously OpenAI is taking this effort when it starts to disagree with the council, whether the company is genuinely committed to mitigating the serious risks of AI or whether this is a smoke and mirrors attempt to paper over its issues.",https://www.engadget.com/openai-forms-advisory-council-on-wellbeing-and-ai-183815365.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r5b7ITEzTP_27T0S5tDJXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDU-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2025-10/cccf0290-c345-44e1-8cea-d54e35a4e925,2025-10-14T18:38:15+00:00,a9b1a8dfdb6fa564c4e0cdc46ae2bdda76e79b9e
b4add79da381,OpenAI will let adults use ChatGPT for erotica starting in December,"sam altman, parental controls","OpenAI plans to open the floodgates to more adult uses of ChatGPT starting in December, according to a new post from CEO Sam Altman . The company announced that it would add parental controls and automatic age detection features in September, and it seems like a benefit of sorting out children from adults is an ability to offer more freedom in what ChatGPT can show users. ""In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,"" Altman says. Some avid ChatGPT users already regularly manipulate the chatbot to engage in NSFW conversations, but Altman's announcement sounds more like tacit approval from OpenAI that those use-cases are okay. The company signaled something similar during its DevDay 2025 announcements , when its new guidelines for developers creating apps for ChatGPT shared that ""support for mature (18+) experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in place."" After December, it sounds like adult interactions with ChatGPT or apps the chatbot can access are fair game. All of these changes are being made in the shadow of disturbing stories of the seemingly negative influence ChatGPT can have on users, including the death of 16-year old Adam Raine , who allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his own suicide. Reducing the chatbot's sycophantic qualities with the release of GPT-5 was one of the ways OpenAI tried to address the mental health impacts of ChatGPT, along with built-in notifications to remind users to take breaks . It's hard to definitively say whether these tweaks have made a difference, but combined with age-gating, it's clear OpenAI feels comfortable giving its chatbot a longer leash.",https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-adults-use-chatgpt-for-erotica-starting-in-december-182417583.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pj_mJctttKP5HnhSNVaGSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/f16b74f0-a929-11f0-9d7d-26f6b9e78917,2025-10-14T18:24:17+00:00,6bad9c1ab47c38a6500ac6a19b6643188338ec57

This makes foraging for a worthy cup of stimulation something of a challenge, but we are up to the task. Meanwhile, we have assembled the latest menu of tidbits to help you on your own quest for inspiration. We hope your day is productive and meaningful. And of course, do keep in touch. We always appreciate feedback, criticism, and suggestions. … GSK chief executive officer Emma Walmsley maintained the company has had a minimal role in an effort by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to update the prescribing information of a long-shelved drug so that it can be used to treat a condition often associated with autism , STAT writes. The FDA request that GSK update the prescribing information for its decades-old therapy leucovorin is “an administrative request,” she said. “We have no commercial interest, we have no scientific research, and we’re not pursuing it. So it’s just the administration at this stage.” Leucovorin, originally sold as Wellcovorin, was approved in 1983 to treat toxicities associated with certain therapies. GSK stopped marketing the drug in 1997, and generics are now available. Last month, though, GSK agreed to an FDA request to submit an application for leucovorin to treat cerebrate folate deficiency, a neurological condition that can have overlapping symptoms with autism. Although GSK no longer makes the drug, updating the label will allow generic manufacturers to do so as well. AstraZeneca got a rare sell rating on Thursday as Deutsche Bank AG analysts downgraded the drugmaker, taking a more skeptical view on the company’s drug pipeline, in particular for breast cancer treatments , Bloomberg News informs us. Analyst Emmanuel Papadakis cut the stock from hold and reduced his price target to $140, the lowest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg. That implies a 16% drop from current levels following the stock’s strong gains in the first half of this month. “With AstraZeneca at the top of its recent trading range, we take the opportunity to turn more explicitly negative,” Papadakis wrote in a note. Last time he had a buy recommendation on the stock was in July 2023. According to the analyst, AstraZeneca’s key breast cancer drug, camizestrant, is unlikely to show meaningful benefits over peers. Current valuations might be too stretched as patent expiration pressures are also starting to mount, he added. STAT+ Exclusive Story Already have an account?

5f714c730769,"For its next trick, Quantic Dream is trying to compete with League of Legends and Dota","quantic dream, multiplayer game, spellcasters chronicles","It's been quite a while since we've heard much about Quantic Dream's Star Wars: Eclipse . The studio revealed that project at The Game Awards back in 2021 and details have been scarce since then. As it turns out, the developer of Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human had been working on a second game this whole time. It's one that sees Quantic Dream venturing into entirely new territory, because the studio is making its first multiplayer game. Spellcasters Chronicles is a 3 vs. 3 MOBA with a third-person perspective that's akin to Marvel Rivals . Each round lasts 25 minutes, with teams summoning minions, battling to conquer territory and earning victory by destroying their opponents' lifestones. So far, so typical MOBA. But Quantic Dream has a few tricks up its sleeve that it hopes will help make Spellcasters Chronicles stand out in a highly competitive live-service market. VIDEO It's a magic-based MOBA with characters that have unique abilities, personalities and backstories. Every one of these mages has the ability to fly at any time and for as long as they want. So you can freely take to the skies to get a bird's eye view of the battlefield and help you make decisions about what to do next. You can duke it out with enemies in the air too. Along with attacks, support spells and summoning armies with hundreds of creatures, players can use their magic to plunk down buildings and shore up their defenses while altering the environment. There's interplay between characters too, as you can infuse allies (including summoned creatures) with spells. One mage, for instance, might add fire to a tankier teammate's hammer, so there are synergies to discover. ""Something we wanted to push is the sense of creativity,"" game director Greg Diaconu told reporters ahead of the reveal. Spellcasters Chronicles (Quantic Dream) Eventually, you'll be able to bring giant, game-changing titans into battles. Each player can summon one. Whenever a titan appears, it's an all-hands-on-deck situation for the opposing team, since these are powerful creatures that can completely change the course of a round. ""It was important for us to create a sense of spectacle,"" Diaconu said. ""Something that's as fun to watch as it is to play."" It all seems quite action-packed, but there's a heavy strategic element to Spellcasters Chronicles as well. Before you go into a battle, you'll select your spells and summons, including your titan — so this is a deckbuilder game too. In the thick of the action, your team will need to decide when to pressure the map and try to expand your territory while capturing altars of power, totems that will grant you resources. Speaking of which, each spell has a limited number of uses, so resource management is a factor too. Spellcasters Chronicles is free-to-play, but there are no pay-to-win concerns here. In-game purchases will be purely cosmetic. Expect battle passes full of new looks for the characters. Lots of updates are in the pipeline too, including new mages, spells and creatures. Seven years in the oven Quantic Dream started making Spellcasters Chronicles seven years ago (so before Netease bought a stake of the company and eventually the whole shebang ). Although the studio decided to keep making narrative-driven single-player games after Detroit: Become Human , it wanted to try something new as well. The idea was to take the team's experience of working on interactive storytelling to a different genre by creating a multiplayer game with a stylized look. ""Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us,"" Quantic Dream founder David Cage wrote in a blog post on Thursday. ""This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA."" In the world of Spellcasters Chronicles , gods are no more and mages who are able to harness an energy called the Source will shape the future. Quantic Dream hasn't shared too many details about the plot and characters of Spellcasters Chronicles just yet — the reveal focused on gameplay. That's perhaps in part because the studio is leaning into a community-driven narrative approach. Victories and defeats will contribute ""to the evolving Tapestry of Fate, where seasonal decisions will change gameplay, lore and map meta."" We shouldn't have to wait too long to see how all of that works in practice. Quantic Dream will run a closed beta for Spellcasters Chronicles on Steam later this year, and the game is set to hit consoles with cross-play support in 2026. Those who are attending TwitchCon San Diego this week can try out the MOBA there.",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/for-its-next-trick-quantic-dream-is-trying-to-compete-with-league-of-legends-and-dota-150000283.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZnPV1aTyj_q2wjcf49hXZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/qd_lede.jpeg,2025-10-16T15:00:00+00:00,dbc3b68df20ae7037a4e2571692c70349dcccc91

This means iPad users can browse Vision Pro content like apps and games from their tablet and queue downloads for the headset without needing to put it on each time. The Vision Pro app has been available on iPhone since the arrival of iOS 18.4 in April, and features a regularly updated selection of curated spatial content that Apple thinks Vision Pro users might want to try. Open it up today, for example, and it’ll point you towards the Lungy app’s audiovisual meditations, the travel show Elevated on (the recently and very confusingly rebranded) Apple TV, some recommended games and a list of education-focused apps available on Vision Pro. The Vision Pro app also includes news and tips for using the headset, as well product information and account settings. All of the same features will be offered in the iPad version of the app. In case you missed yesterday’s announcement, Apple has introduced an improved Vision Pro headset powered by the same M5 chip housed in its new iPad Pro and MacBook Pro . This should represent a fairly significant jump up from the first-gen product’s M2 chip. Web-browsing will be faster, as will loading apps and just generally navigating menus on your headset. The M5 chip also features a new 10-core GPU, which should significantly boost gaming performance, and without handing us any battery specs (which the company never likes to do), Apple says the upgraded Vision Pro should last a bit longer too.

Clark, whose second season in the WNBA ended early because of a series of injuries, will return to play in the pro-am next month at The Annika on the LPGA Tour. ""I had an amazing time at The Annika last November and participating in the pro-am alongside Nelly Korda and Annika Sorenstam, two of the best in the game,"" Clark said. The pro-am is Nov. 12 at Pelican Golf Club and open to the public. Clark, who had just finished her first season in the WNBA and was rookie of the year, brought out big crowds and a big buzz last year. The Annika is the penultimate tournament on the LPGA schedule. Clark has a corporate relationship with Gainbridge Insurance, the main sponsor. Clark's second WNBA season was slowed by injuries. She played only 13 games and was ruled out out for the rest of the season on Sept. 4 with a groin injury.

0570f45a1ee5,NCAAM,,"The tectonic shift that NIL deals and revenue sharing have sparked in college sports has not spared the men's basketball coaching carousel and the annual hot seat discussion. When NIL and revenue sharing were first introduced, there were questions on whether schools would be more patient when it came to firing coaches, opting instead to spend buyout money on putting together better rosters. It's now become clear that that's not the case. In reality, patience is at an all-time low. If new hires aren't cutting it after two years, they're on the hot seat. If a veteran coach underperforms for a few consecutive years, he's likely getting forced out the door, or at least under significant pressure. We saw evidence of that last spring, when Minnesota 's Ben Johnson (four years), Utah 's Craig Smith (four years), Texas ' Rodney Terry (three years) and Villanova 's Kyle Neptune (three years) were let go after short stints. NC State fired Kevin Keatts 12 months after making the Final Four. Indiana 's Mike Woodson stepped down midway through his fourth year at his alma mater. Then there are the retirements. Virginia 's Tony Bennett stepped down before last season; Auburn 's Bruce Pearl did the same last month. Miami 's Jim Larrañaga and Florida State 's Leonard Hamilton announced their departures midway through last season. There will undoubtedly be more in a few months. It's naive to think a coaching cycle will be quiet. The 2024 edition looked like it could be fairly quiet, but it ultimately featured changes at big-name programs Kentucky , Arkansas , Ohio State , Michigan , Louisville , USC and others. The 2025 offseason saw 14 (14!) coaching changes at the Power 5 level. What will 2026 bring? Will a blue blood like North Carolina open up and jump-start a half-dozen dominoes? Will another coaching legend such as Bill Self call it a career? Here's the state of the coaching ranks before the 2025-26 begins. Jump to: ACC | Big 12 | Big East | Big Ten | SEC | Other retirements | Who's up next? ACC Syracuse coach Adrian Autry needs a successful season to keep going after Year 3. Bob Donnan-Imagn Images Hot seat watch All eyes are on Hubert Davis and North Carolina entering this season. There was some speculation about his position toward the end of last season, but the Tar Heels won eight of their final 10 games to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament. News also emerged that Davis had signed a two-year contract extension in December through the 2029-30 season. In his four seasons at the helm, Davis has gone to three NCAA tournaments -- including a run to the national championship game in 2022 -- won the ACC regular-season title and earned a 1-seed in 2024. But UNC missed the tournament in 2023 and barely made it last season. The Tar Heels have a top-25-caliber roster this season, but will just going to another tournament be enough? Davis would be owed around $5 million if Carolina moved on from him in the spring. Davis isn't alone on the hot seat in the ACC. Adrian Autry had the unenviable task of replacing a legend at Syracuse when Jim Boeheim retired, and he is already under significant pressure entering Year 3. The Orange won 20 games in his debut campaign, but went just 14-19 last season, the program's lowest win total since 1970. Athletic director John Wildhack said after the season that ""we've got to fix it."" There's plenty of talent on this year's roster, with J.J. Starling and Donnie Freeman returning to join a pair of top-50 recruits and a handful of impact transfers. Will it translate to wins? Boston College 's Earl Grant provided plenty of optimism after finishing 9-11 in the ACC in 2022-23 and then winning 20 games in 2023-24. But the Eagles stumbled last season en route to a 4-16 league campaign. He is entering Year 5 in Chestnut Hill, and BC will need to show improvement. Grant is under contract through the 2028-29 season. Mike Young will have just one year left on his contract at Virginia Tech at the end of this season, and the Hokies have missed the past three NCAA tournaments after back-to-back appearances in 2021 and 2022. Tech went just 13-19 last season. There's been an influx of talent to the roster, but that has also raised expectations for an NCAA tournament team in Blacksburg. It's worth noting the school is currently in the midst of a football coaching search after firing Brent Pry in mid-September. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Also worth monitoring The seats of Wake Forest 's Steve Forbes and Pitt 's Jeff Capel are cooler than the ones above, but an NCAA tournament trip would benefit either greatly. Forbes has finished .500 or better in the league and won 19-plus games in each of the past four seasons, but the Demon Deacons have yet to go dancing in any of his five seasons in Winston-Salem. They're projecting as a bubble team again for this March. Meanwhile, Capel is signed through 2030 and would be owed well into eight figures if the Panthers were to move on from him. But Pitt has been to just one NCAA tournament in Capel's seven seasons. BIG EAST A succession plan is already in place for when Creighton coach Greg McDermott decides to retire. Jordan Prather-Imagn Images Worth monitoring It's probably a year early, but Kim English needs to bounce back to feel truly safe at Providence . He did a terrific job in Year 1 getting the Friars to 21 wins and within reach of the NCAA tournament, but they went 12-20 last season. His seat isn't hot -- and he would be owed a significant amount of money -- but we might have to gauge the temperature again in a few months. Retirement watch The Big East projects to be quieter than the ACC next spring. There aren't any obvious hot seat situations, although Butler 's Thad Matta and Creighton 's Greg McDermott are on retirement watch. Matta's second stint at Butler -- he had a one-season run in 2000-01 -- has lasted three seasons thus far, without an NCAA tournament trip for the Bulldogs. He's just 47-53 overall and 21-39 in the Big East, and things don't project to dramatically improve. McDermott's successor is already picked out, with former assistant Alan Huss leaving High Point in April to rejoin the staff and be named head-coach-in-waiting. There's no specific timeline for McDermott to retire, but anytime a replacement is already in place, it's worth monitoring. BIG TEN Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell's seat may be cool, particularly after last season's success with two lottery draft picks, but it is still one to monitor. AP Photo/Seth Wenig Hot seat watch Just 20 months after firing Chris Holtmann, Ohio State enters another season with a head coach on less-than-ideal footing -- although the Buckeyes have a roster that should render this discussion moot. Jake Diebler became the team's interim head coach when Holtmann was let go, and was given the permanent job after a strong finish to the 2023-24 campaign. But the Buckeyes went just 17-15 last season, with the program missing the NCAA tournament for a third straight time. Ohio State has March expectations entering 2025-26, with Diebler bringing back three starters and adding three transfers who should push for starting jobs from day one. This team can win games in March. If the Buckeyes underperform and don't hear their name on Selection Sunday again, though, things could get dicey for Diebler after just two seasons. The school would be on the hook for just under $5 million if it were to fire him in the spring. Also worth monitoring It may seem premature for both Nebraska 's Fred Hoiberg and Rutgers ' Steve Pikiell to be on the hot seat. The Cornhuskers won 23 games and went to the NCAA tournament in 2024, then won 21 games and the inaugural College Basketball Crown tournament last season. Hoiberg is signed through 2029 and his contract is fully guaranteed, meaning he would be owed around $13.5 million after this season. Pikiell is in a similar contractual situation, signed through 2031 and owed more than $20 million after this season. Retirement watch Oregon 's Dana Altman and Michigan State 's Tom Izzo have been followed by retirement rumors seemingly every spring. Altman is 67, but is still considered one of the most underrated coaches in the sport. He led the Ducks to 25 wins and a 5-seed last season. Meanwhile, Izzo is turning 71 in January, but just won the Big Ten regular-season title and took the Spartans to the Elite Eight. BIG 12 Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley has made the hot seat guide a few times -- but can he find a way to keep his seat cool in a contract year? Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire Hot seat watch The Big 12 could be as active as any high-major league in the spring, with at least three coaches on the hot seat and others constantly hounded by retirement speculation. Bobby Hurley has made this list a few times -- and he finds a way to survive every time at Arizona State . But he is now entering the final year of his contract, so something will need to happen in the next few months. Hurley made the NCAA tournament in two of his first four seasons in Tempe but has made it back just once in the past five years. The Sun Devils also finished 4-16 in Big 12 play last season. He returns just one player from last season, so an entirely new roster will need to produce quickly. Another coach who has found himself in hot seat discussions for multiple years is UCF 's Johnny Dawkins , who is now entering his 10th year with the Knights. They've made just one NCAA tournament appearance under his watch, in 2019 -- also the last time they finished above .500 in league play (when they were in the AAC). Dawkins signed a contract extension in 2024 that runs one more season after this one, but his salary is not guaranteed for the 2026-27 campaign. Cincinnati entered last season with top-25 expectations, but after starting 10-1, finished 7-13 in Big 12 play and missed the NCAA tournament. That has left Wes Miller vulnerable, as he's going into Year 5 with the Bearcats and has yet to go dancing. Once again, Cincinnati has a talented roster and will have NCAA tournament expectations, but falling short again could make it difficult for Miller to last another season. His guaranteed money reportedly drops from around $10 million to less than $5 million on April 1. Also worth monitoring It's a year early, at least, to consider Jerome Tang in any real trouble. Kansas State has missed back-to-back NCAA tournaments, though he led the Wildcats to 26 wins and an Elite Eight appearance in 2023 and is signed through 2030. The school would owe him nearly $13 million after this season. There have been the multiple health scares and on-court struggles that could convince Kansas coach Bill Self to retire. But there's also the promise of a projected lottery pick, followed by a stellar recruiting class, that could be reinvigorating. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel Retirement watch A trio of coaches has been linked to varying degrees of retirement discussions, including two of the sport's premier coaches. It starts with Bill Self , who has had multiple health scares over the past few years. Kansas has also struggled on the court in each of the previous two campaigns, but the Jayhawks are bringing in a potential No. 1 draft pick this season and have the nation's No. 2 recruiting class in the fold for next season. Houston 's Kelvin Sampson is now 70 years old, and fell seconds short of a national championship in April. Once again, though, the Cougars are expected to be near the top of the national rankings and should have another shot to cut down the nets. Would a title convince Sampson to hang it up? There was some talk surrounding Colorado 's Tad Boyle toward the end of last season, to the point he needed to announce his return to media outlets in March. The Buffaloes really struggled last season, finishing at the bottom of the Big 12, though they did win 26 games just two seasons ago. SEC The SEC is a gauntlet -- and unfortunately LSU is toward the bottom of the pack. Matt McMahon will bank on a solid group of transfers to win this season and save his seat. Matthew Maxey/Icon Sportswire Hot seat watch When 14 of the league's 16 teams hear their names on Selection Sunday, it's going to be hard to have a crowded hot seat in the SEC. LSU 's Matt McMahon is the primary one to watch. He's entering his fourth season in Baton Rouge but after showing tangible signs of improvement in 2023-24 -- going 17-16 and finishing .500 in the SEC -- the Tigers took a massive step back, going 3-15 in league play last season. The Tigers did go into the portal and come out with a quietly impressive group, so there is renewed optimism. When McMahon was hired in 2022, he was given a deal until 2029, and he would be owed about $6.5 million should LSU move on in the spring. Also worth monitoring It's premature to consider Lamont Paris on the hot seat, although another last-place finish would make things much warmer entering the 2026-27 season. Paris led South Carolina to 26 wins and the NCAA tournament in 2024 but is just 23-41 (6-30 in the SEC) in the two years sandwiching that campaign. He signed a lucrative contract extension in 2024 through 2030. After a late surge led to an NCAA tournament appearance last season, and with a roster built to go to another tournament this season, Oklahoma 's Porter Moser should find himself on safer footing down the stretch in 2026. He'll have two years left on his contract after this season, and Oklahoma would owe him over $5 million if it were to fire him. Retirement watch Rick Barnes is the only obvious name on retirement watch out of the SEC. He's 71, but appears to be at or near the top of his game. Tennessee won 25 or more games in each of the past four seasons, producing top-five defenses in each of the past five -- along with back-to-back Elite Eight appearances. One of the biggest potential coaching changes outside of the high majors could come from Gonzaga, with expectations that Mark Few could retire earlier than expected. Kirby Lee-Imagn Images Retirement watch elsewhere The biggest name to monitor outside the high-majors is Gonzaga 's Mark Few , who will turn 63 this season and has long been considered someone who could hang it up earlier than expected. There would be very little drama should a change take place in Spokane, though, as longtime assistant coach Brian Michaelson is expected to replace Few when he opts to retire. Dayton 's Anthony Grant has had retirement rumors follow him for the past couple of years, making him someone to monitor this season. The Flyers have been to just one NCAA tournament during Grant's eight years in charge, although they were poised for a 1-seed and a potentially historic NCAA tournament run when the pandemic canceled the tourney in 2020. Utah State's Jerrod Calhoun was a top mid-major coach who didn't make the jump up to the high majors in the offseason, but will likely lead this spring's list of highly sought-after candidates. Isaiah J. Downing-Imagn Images Who's up next? In March, we attempted to figure out the next group of mid-major coaches ready to make the jump to a higher level by polling more than a dozen industry sources involved in the coaching carousel. Ryan Odom (VCU to Virginia ), Alan Huss (High Point to Creighton), Bucky McMillan (Samford to Texas A&M ), Ben McCollum (Drake to Iowa ), Niko Medved (Colorado State to Minnesota ) were all in the top six and have since moved. Eric Olen ( New Mexico ), Daniyal Robinson ( North Texas ), Ross Hodge ( West Virginia ), Eric Henderson ( Drake ) and Bryan Hodgson ( South Florida ) -- all ranked in the top 20 -- also got new jobs. The group didn't include Will Wade (McNeese to NC State ) and Richard Pitino (New Mexico to Xavier ), who were ineligible for the poll due to previous high-major experience but made the real-life jump. In other words, a new crop of mid-major coaches will need to emerge in the spring. Utah State 's Jerrod Calhoun finished fifth in the aforementioned poll, and he's the only one in the top six not to get a high-major job last spring -- although he was heavily involved in the West Virginia search. The Aggies consistently produce high-level coaches, and Calhoun led the program to the NCAA tournament in his first season at the helm after winning 46 games his previous two seasons at Youngstown State. Also in that top tier or two of guys who could make the jump: Takayo Siddle, UNC Wilmington : Guided the Seahawks to the NCAA tournament last season and has finished in the top three of the CAA in four straight seasons, including a regular-season title in 2022. Drew Valentine, Loyola Chicago : Still only 34 years old, Valentine went to the NCAA tournament in 2022 and split the Atlantic-10 regular-season title in 2024. Bob Richey, Furman : Has an NCAA tournament win under his belt when the Paladins beat Virginia in 2023, and has won 22 or more games in six of eight seasons. Tony Skinn, George Mason : Won a share of the A-10 regular-season title in just his second year as a head coach, and is now 47-21 in his two seasons. Preston Spradlin, James Madison : Has now won at least 20 games in five straight seasons, going to two NCAA tournaments and winning two regular-season titles at Morehead State, before winning a share of the Sun Belt title last season at JMU. Josh Schertz, Saint Louis : He was one of the hottest names in the country 18 months ago after winning 32 games at Indiana State and could easily generate momentum again.

Sign Up Now Two names that could get mentioned even though they've rarely shown signs of leaving their current situations are Randy Bennett of Saint Mary's and Boise State 's Leon Rice . Bennett, an Arizona native who has been to four straight NCAA tournaments and won three straight WCC titles, will undoubtedly get linked to the Arizona State job if it opens. A few other coaches who finished in the top 20 of our spring poll will again be in the mix for vacancies next offseason. UC Irvine 's Russell Turner has won seven Big West regular-season titles. Colgate 's Matt Langel had guided the Raiders to five straight NCAA tournaments and five Patriot League titles in six years before finishing third last season. UNC Asheville 's Mike Morrell has won 70 games over the past three seasons. Princeton 's Mitch Henderson won three straight Ivy League regular-season titles before last season, while also going to the Sweet 16 in 2023. Yale 's James Jones just missed making the list this past spring, though his résumé is wildly impressive: He has either won the Ivy regular-season title or gone to the NCAA tournament in each of the past six seasons. Led by Charleston 's Chris Mack , there is a quartet of former high-major coaches looking to get back to that level. Mack has the best résumé of the group, with four Sweet 16s and an Elite Eight on his ledger from his time at Xavier, and he won 24 games last season with the Cougars. Grand Canyon 's Bryce Drew , who went to four of the past five NCAA tournaments in the WAC, is moving up to the Mountain West this season. John Groce has guided Akron to three of the past four NCAA tournaments, while UAB 's Andy Kennedy has won 125 games in five seasons with the Blazers. We would also be remiss if we didn't also mention that a handful of coaches who changed jobs last spring -- namely Olen, Robinson, Henderson and Hodgson -- will be candidates to hit the Power 5 level sooner rather than later, perhaps as early as next March or April. Other names to monitor: Belmont 's Casey Alexander , Vermont 's John Becker , Omaha 's Chris Crutchfield , Chattanooga 's Dan Earl , Merrimack 's Joe Gallo , San Francisco 's Chris Gerlufsen , Norfolk State 's Robert Jones , Toledo 's Tod Kowalczyk , UC Santa Barbara 's Joe Pasternack , Central Connecticut 's Patrick Sellers , Kent State 's Rob Senderoff , American 's Duane Simpkins , Towson 's Pat Skerry and Bradley 's Brian Wardle .

9d737b896306,NFL Week 7 uniforms: Chargers debut 'Charger Power' alternate look,,"Week 7 of the NFL season will feature the anticipated debut of alternate uniforms. The Los Angeles Chargers will be wearing their all-gold ""Charger Power"" alternates against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. It's the first time in franchise history the Chargers will wear a gold jersey. The look -- revealed in July -- is meant to channel the energy and ""progressive nature"" of the Air Coryell days, according to the team . With Hall of Fame coach Don Coryell, the Chargers ranked first in offensive yardage from 1980 to 1983. Los Angeles' end zones at SoFi Stadium will be powder blue and feature the retro Chargers logo with a bold ""H,"" which was used in the early days of the franchise. Many teams are opting for alternate monochromatic looks. On ""Thursday Night Football,"" the Cincinnati Bengals are hosting their annual ""White Bengal"" game, with an all-white look against the Pittsburgh Steelers . The white helmet was first worn in 2022, and the Bengals have gone 4-1 in games when wearing the lid. The Dallas Cowboys once again wear their all-white arctic uniforms against the Washington Commanders . The Cleveland Browns will don an alternate look -- their all-brown ""Alpha Dawg"" uniforms -- against the Miami Dolphins . The Detroit Lions will wear their all-black alternates against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on ""Monday Night Football.""

00e27871622a,Top takeaways from Season 2 of Netflix's 'Starting 5',,"The latest season of Netflix's ""Starting 5"" was released Thursday, offering new perspectives on memorable moments from the 2024-25 campaign. The series followed Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton , then- Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant , LA Clippers guard James Harden and Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown . Each star had his own challenges last season, all revealed by Netflix's behind-the-scenes access. ""The Netflix people are driving me nuts,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said at one point. ""They're everywhere, you know, and it's a pain in the ass."" Durant dealt with injuries and trade talk that nearly sent him to the Golden State Warriors . Haliburton fought through a midseason slump after limited action at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. Brown's knee injury was a setback for the Celtics in their pursuit of winning back-to-back titles. Harden embarked on another season seeking a championship, while Gilgeous-Alexander's consistency fueled the Thunder's NBA title aspirations. The outcome brought two of the season's stars to the biggest stage: Game 7 of the Finals. Here are the top takeaways from Season 2 of ""Starting 5."" Trade to Houston still hurts Harden, Durant The early days of the Oklahoma City Thunder paired two of the game's top scorers on one team: Durant and Harden. They were teammates for three seasons before the Thunder dealt Harden to the Houston Rockets in 2012, propelling the guard to All-Star and MVP heights. Even though the trade happened over a decade ago, emotions are still raw for Durant and Harden, who won Sixth Man of the Year that season. Alongside Russell Westbrook , the Thunder were coming off a Finals run in which they lost in five games to the Miami Heat . Unable to reach a contract extension , Oklahoma City traded Harden. He explained that it ""wasn't about no real money. It was a couple million dollars."" Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook played together in Oklahoma City for three seasons. (Photo by Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images) Durant admitted he didn't know what was going on with Harden's contract negotiations until the very end and ""never thought there was a possibility he was leaving."" He also expressed anger about the reaction leaguewide, with players posting congratulatory messages for Harden on social media. ""I was like, 'Shut the f--- up. Y'all just was f---ing scared. Y'all knew we was on the way."" Durant said. Harden echoed a similar sentiment. ""Overall, I was mad as hell, too,"" he said. ""Cause I got the call, and it's like, then there was loss. These are my dawgs, like you see what we just did these last three years? It was like, 'we're gonna win a championship next year.' ... I was hurt. It was sad, for real."" Durant said he liked playing with Harden and he misses it. However, he pointed out that he, Harden and Westbrook all maximized their potential, which is most important. Haliburton considered taking a break from Pacers Prior to leading the Pacers on a surprising NBA Finals run, Haliburton found himself in a dark place early in the 2024-25 season. His confidence took a hit after he played in just three games for Team USA in the Paris Olympics. The All-Star guard struggled in November and December, averaging 18.1 points and nine assists on 44% shooting from the field as Indiana entered 2025 with a 16-18 record. ""I honestly don't think I've ever felt as negative about myself as I did in November and December,"" Haliburton said. ""Yeah, I was definitely in a dark time."" His fiancée, Jade Jones, could tell Haliburton was feeling pressure from his play and was struggling to identify the root cause of his slump. The highest-paid player on the Pacers, Haliburton said players such as himself are only evaluated on whether they can impact their respective team to win games. If they don't, it's next man up. ""It got to the point where I was like, 'Should I kind of step away for a little bit just for our group? Would that be more beneficial?'"" Haliburton said. ""I know that if I'm not right, that our team isn't gonna be right."" A conversion with his trainer, renowned NBA skills coach Drew Hanlen, aided Haliburton's turnaround. He also returned to Paris in late January with the Pacers facing the San Antonio Spurs . This time, Haliburton performed. He dropped 28 points in Indiana's 136-98 win, and the rest was history. SGA, Chris Paul brotherhood on full display Gilgeous-Alexander and Paul developed a strong bond in the one season they spent as teammates with the Thunder in 2019-20. The 2025 MVP called Paul a mentor and friend, and he leaned on him for advice. After Denver Nuggets forward Aaron Gordon nailed a game winner against the Thunder in Game 1 of their second-round playoff series, Gilgeous-Alexander FaceTimed Paul when he got home. The two reviewed moments from the game. Paul also attended Game 2 of Oklahoma City's Western Conference finals series against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Gilgeous-Alexander received his MVP award that night as Paul sat courtside next to Gilgeous-Alexander's wife. The Thunder guard playfully put Paul in a chokehold after the game, saying, ""Now you stuck. Now you don't know what to do. Now what?"" ""Ima just chop your wrist off. It's gonna be with me,"" Paul replied, and the 12-time All-Star went to Gilgeous-Alexander's house for dinner afterward. The wild NBA Finals Game 1 ending told by the players Haliburton and the Pacers' shocking comebacks were a huge storyline of the postseason, and ""Starting 5."" There may not have been a single comeback with larger ramifications than Game 1 of the NBA Finals. The Thunder seemed to be in cruise control, holding a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter. However, Indiana was in a position it had seen before that postseason and slowly walked Oklahoma City down -- something Haliburton said the Pacers tried to do in each of their other comeback wins. Indiana, down one with less than 10 seconds remaining, had the ball after Gilgeous-Alexander missed a jumper. ""They get the rebound come down, don't call a timeout. [Haliburton] gets it to his right hand. He loves his right hand. That's where he goes,"" Gilgeous-Alexander explained. Haliburton then dribbled toward the right wing and rose up for a go-ahead jumper. ""It felt like slow motion. Like the ball's in the air forever. I'm just like, 'It's going in,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""I didn't even know how to react, so I just yell,"" Haliburton said, as the Pacers stole Game 1. Raw reactions after Haliburton tears Achilles in Game 7 The improbable Game 1 comeback set up the best two words in a playoff series: Game 7. Unfortunately, Haliburton's outing ended prematurely due to a torn Achilles just halfway through the first quarter. Netflix mic'd Haliburton up during the game and followed him to the locker room. The Pacers star -- who had nine points before exiting -- explained he wanted to heat check a 3-pointer, but didn't like the opportunity. Therefore, he swung the ball, knowing it would rotate back to him with the intention of attacking his defender, Gilgeous-Alexander. However, when he went to drive to the basket, the injury occurred. ""I knew what it was,"" Haliburton said. ""I turn around and look to see who's on the floor, I was like, 'Oh s---, no way.' And then I seen him screaming,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. Haliburton revealed that he wanted to walk off, recalling that Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant walked off when he tore his Achilles. ""I can walk off. Like, it's possible. So I was like, 'Get me up, I'm gonna walk off.' It felt like just dead weight at the end of my leg,"" he said. ""I think that's when I became overcome with emotion just because that's when the reality really set in."" Haliburton broke down in tears in the locker room with Jones, his father and his mother by his side. He got his ankle wrapped in ice and watched the rest of the game in the trainer's room, saying to the TV: ""Make it worth it, at least."" With Indiana leading at halftime, Haliburton revealed that his biggest regret was not giving a halftime speech to the team. Oklahoma City ended up winning 103-91 to claim the championship.",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46608847/nba-netflix-starting-five-season-two-takeaways-highlights-gilgeous-alexander-haliburton-brown-harden-durant,Sport,Espn,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560780_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,aff28aea09c25b63675072cc9d56e69cb7208904
1f1e8915c7bf,Bubba Wallace's son helps turn his dad's NASCAR career around,,"Oct 16, 2025, 10:30 AM ET The birth of son Becks has been the catalyst in helping Bubba Wallace find joy in life and racing. Jeffrey Brown/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Bubba Wallace used to be the one who was miserable in his motorhome after a NASCAR race. So much so that there were times when those bad days might result in a pair of sunglasses getting smashed and his wife, Amanda, who felt just as terribly, not knowing what to say. These days, however, those roles have reversed. ""I get back to the bus now and Amanda is more upset than I am,"" Wallace told ESPN. ""It's difficult to navigate that because over the years she's known this is what we have and I have to make this work. ... Now I walk back, like after Kansas, and I was fine, and she's beside herself. It's kind of funny."" Kansas Speedway, Sept. 28, saw Wallace leading on the final lap before his 23XI Racing car owner, Denny Hamlin , made a move that ran Wallace into the fence in Turns 3 and 4. Neither of them ended up winning as Chase Elliott drove by both. Wallace would have advanced in the Cup Series playoffs if he had won. Instead, a week later, he was eliminated. Wallace was disappointed afterward but handled his postrace obligations with professionalism and grace. Amanda's reaction, on the other hand, is where her husband was not that long ago, when he admittedly would have said something dumb. But the current version of Wallace has come a long way. The current version of Wallace is a much more engaging driver, someone easier to work with, and someone who has learned to navigate both his personal and professional lives. Quite simply, Wallace is much more enjoyable to be around. What changed? The arrival of Becks Wallace, his son, in late September 2024, was the biggest catalyst. ""Bubba is obviously very emotional, and you've seen that in a lot of his interviews the last few years,"" Freddie Kraft, Wallace's spotter and longtime friend, told ESPN. ""He would have very high highs and very low lows. ""Now it seems like the highs are even higher and the lows are never as low as they've been before. We talk after the race, and a lot of times in the past, if we had a really bad day, I would get one-word answers or no answer at all until the next day. Now I can text him and we're joking around afterward, and I think it's strictly because he's either going back to the bus and seeing Becks, or he's on the phone with Becks before we get on the airplane. ""That little boy has done so much for him that it's an incredible turnaround for Bubba."" Wallace was no different from any other parent-to-be in hearing that children change your life, that parenthood is the best thing you'll ever experience. He has enjoyed learning how to be a dad and realizing that his son does make everything more enjoyable, so on the days when things don't go well on the racetrack or his championship chances come to an end, it's not so hard to handle because Becks doesn't know or care what happened. ""You don't think about that stuff in that moment,"" Wallace said. ""You latch onto when you're with him or Amanda and nothing else matters. I could be sitting here talking to you, but thinking about practice and qualifying. You're consumed by it. You can't be changing a diaper and thinking about qualifying. It doesn't work. It's nice to have that now."" The word ""consumed"" is appropriate when telling Wallace's story. Throughout his career, Wallace let what happened on Sundays eat away at him the rest of the week, which led to a poor mental attitude both on and off the racetrack. On team radio, there were emotional explosions and despondence. His demeanor projected a desire to be anywhere else but at the racetrack. Wallace has been open about his experiences with mental health in the past, including depression, although he has never spoken about being officially diagnosed. Most of the work to become stronger has been done by himself, although that does not mean he dismisses the value of therapy; it felt awkward for him when he tried, and he didn't find anyone he could relate to. Statistically, Bubba Wallace is on course for his best-ever season, picking up a win at Indianapolis and sitting 10th in the 2025 playoffs standings. Sean Gardner/Getty Images One of the most public instances of Wallace sharing his struggles came at the end of the 2023 season when he posted a lengthy reflection on social media in which he talked about ""questioning everything,"" a ""helpless feeling,"" and how even seeing his friend, Ryan Blaney , win the championship didn't bring joy. Fatherhood. The decision to cut back on social media. Compartmentalizing. The latter has been huge for Wallace on the racetrack, helping him keep from letting one bad thing snowball into bringing everything down. ""Look, I get motherf---ed if I have a bad day and get out and say I had a bad day. [People say] I'm bitching and complaining. No, I'm stating facts,"" Wallace said. ""Part of me is biting my tongue and going with it, but at the same time, everyone is frustrated, and we've been frustrated for three hours. There is no need to add onto it. The frustration that would kick in was that I would look at our team and wonder, 'Why are we the only ones that can't figure it out?'"" The frustration behind the wheel led to holes that Wallace didn't always dig himself out of by a race's end. While it's not fair to say a driver ever gives up, Wallace struggled mentally with how badly things would go after entering a race with high expectations, leading to one bad decision after another, culminating in a mediocre day. Kraft would see it from above the racetrack and hear it on the radio, knowing when Wallace was getting in his own head. ""Now he's realizing that he belongs as a front-running guy and the cars are capable of running up front,"" Kraft said. ""Even when we don't have a great start or have a penalty, something that puts us behind the eight ball, we have enough talent and car to drive back to the front. [Crew chief Charles Denike] has done a great job of improving his mindset on that. ""It's always fun to be around Bubba, but this year it has definitely been a little more fun."" Hamlin has been equally impressed with what he's seen. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now ""Bubba's turnaround over the last few years, I can't believe it, truthfully,"" Hamlin said. ""The maturity that he has shown. He's been the lead car at 23XI, really the entire year. I think [ Tyler Reddick ] might have him on average finish because he doesn't have as many DNFs, but the 23 has been the fastest freaking car we've got. And that's something I can't believe. ""Whether it's Charles Denike and his setups or Bubba's mentality, something changed over there that has made Bubba someone you're going to have to contend with every single week. ... I couldn't be [prouder] of that 23 team and what they're doing week in and week out."" With three races left in the season, Wallace sits 10th in the standings and could potentially be looking at a career-best season in the Cup Series -- at least statistically. Perhaps it already has been because of Wallace's noticeable personal progression, as well as the team's growth, with performances that don't always translate to the results sheet (such as laps led, stage points earned, average running position during the race and speed). Reddick making the Championship 4 a year ago showed Wallace the potential was there, and it was his motivation coming into 2025. In fact, Wallace has backed up a social media post he made in January, sharing that ""the mentals are at an all-time high"" and that he ""couldn't be happier"" after taking it upon himself to be better and do better after two seasons of getting ""my ass kicked."" Naturally, having on-track success further helps his off-track attitude. ""It's been really, really cool to show up with speed every week and have an opportunity,"" Wallace said. ""That's what you want: to have an opportunity to be successful. It allows you to move freely, have less stress and take full responsibility. It's like, OK, here's the keys to it, let me go figure it out. I like figuring that stuff out when it comes to the racing side of things, and when you have the right people in the right spot, the right equipment, and all of it has to jell perfectly, but we seem to have that good chemistry going right now."" How times change. How far Wallace has come. Something that is striking to him, too. ""I've enjoyed where I've been in life,"" Wallace said. ""I look forward to waking up and competing more than I have, and it's been fun to be at the racetrack. No other way around it. That is all from enjoying every aspect of life.""",https://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/story/_/id/46606338/bubba-wallace-son-helps-turn-dad-nascar-career-around,Sport,Espn,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560661_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,172c67542142bac1b9ff38bcaa2a9bc88916de80
853159b4f6e8,‘It’ll Never Go Away’: Three Jeffrey Epsteins on What It’s Like to Live With Their Notorious Name,,"Jeffrey Epstein needs no introduction. After years of media coverage and wild conspiracy theories, the late financier is practically synonymous with human trafficking and sexual abuse. He was a real-life boogeyman who spent years preying on underage girls while being shielded from prosecution by his immense wealth and powerful connections. This made him into an enduring symbol of moral rot among American elites, not to mention a lack of justice for victims of sexual violence. Still, the Epstein saga might have gradually faded from the national consciousness, even in spite of the widespread, unfounded belief that his 2019 suicide in a jail cell while awaiting trial was in fact a murder carried out to prevent him from implicating associates in his crimes. But, because one of his longtime friends was Donald Trump — the two were close until a falling out sometime around the mid-2000s — Epstein’s ghost has continued to haunt the political landscape. It’s not just that things like a creepy birthday letter the president allegedly wrote to him have become a matter of public record (though Trump denies authoring the document); there’s also the administration’s embarrassing, ongoing failure to disclose more material related to federal investigations of Epstein after many assurances to the MAGA base that they would release these supposed bombshell files. And so “Jeffrey Epstein” is a name that still commands headlines. It also happens to be a fairly common name, in use among a great many men who have done no wrong. One database search returned information on nearly 300 Jeffrey Epsteins around the U.S. Rolling Stone reached out to dozens of them in hopes of learning how the Epstein story has affected their day-to-day lives over the past few years. Perhaps understandably, only three replied to share their experiences. The Singer Jeff L. Epstein, 53, resides in an area of New Jersey outside Philadelphia and works full-time as a singer covering Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and many others, in senior living centers, where he says residents are thankfully not too plugged into news developments involving the other Jeffrey Epstein. (He also says that only his older relatives call him Jeffrey.) When the topic does come up, he’s taken to feigning confusion, acting as if he doesn’t follow the news himself. “Every now and then some resident, like 80 years old, might say, ‘Will you ever release the tapes?'” Epstein says. “And I’m like, ‘Yeah, I don’t know what you’re talking about — what are you referring to?” This strategy, he says, tends to shut down the conversation quickly and effectively. It irks him that the case seems to be a joke to people who make these comments. “If you treat the subject seriously, there is never a reason to say that to me, ever,” he says. This Epstein first learned of the infamous Epstein in the mid-2010s. With the latter’s arrest and suicide in 2019, he recalls, things turned “nightmarish,” particularly online. He shares a screenshot of a Facebook post he made that year in a local community group where he asked for recommendations of a cleaning service, only to be met by hostile and mocking comments addressing him as Epstein the criminal, as well as a photo of that Epstein. Elsewhere on social media, people have demanded to know why his username is “Jeff Epstein,” assuming it’s an intentional provocation. In some instances, he has tried to roll with the unfortunate coincidence, like when he occasionally made appearances on the YouTube show of comedian Graham Elwood, who would introduce him by saying, “No, not that one!” Epstein acknowledges that the bit “was pretty funny.” More recently, though, Epstein says, he is trying to reclaim his name. At a weekly open mic with musician friends where he’s been a regular for two years, he says, he used to call himself “Jeff L.” to avoid any unwanted association with a notorious sex offender. Then he had a change of heart. “It just doesn’t feel right,” he says. “It’s just awkward. So maybe six months ago, I’m like, ‘I’m done. My name is Jeff Epstein.'” He told the open mic host to introduce him by his full name going forward. Initially, the host started telling audiences that he was “the good one, not the bad one,” Epstein says, but he soon put a stop to that, telling him that “the only reason” he still deals with a certain stigma is because “people keep saying that.” “It’ll never go away,” he reflects, in part because of the other Epstein’s many links to rich and powerful people, but also since “we’ll never know the total truth” of what went on in his social circles. “So people are going to make up whatever, and just keep it going,” Epstein says. The Warehouse Manager Asked whether the name has caused him much grief, another Jeff Epstein, a 45-year-old warehouse manager in New Jersey, says, “You have no idea!” His friends, at least, appear take a certain pleasure in the unfortunate coincidence. Epstein shares an email thread between him and a few pals about being approached for this interview — one person advises that he tell Rolling Stone “that you haven’t been laid in six years because of this, and make sure they put your picture and address in the article.” “I went to my primary care doctor, whom I haven’t seen in years,” Epstein says. “He walks in and says, ‘Back in the news!’ I can’t make this shit up.” He admits that the remarks are pretty much inescapable. “I get comments all the time, especially when I need to show ID,” he says. Epstein knows how to take these interactions in stride, however. “I usually tell them they are uninvited to my yacht party if they tell me to change my name.” The Flooring Company Owner Then there’s Jeff Epstein, 57, who runs a flooring company in Tuscon, Arizona — and says that his name has thankfully never put a dent in his business. “My customers get a kick out of it,” he says. “When they don’t know my full name, and I call them, because of my iPhone, it says Jeffrey Epstein is calling. And so I’ve had customers block my phone immediately, then I have my office call and tell them, ‘No, no, that’s Jeff.'” “It comes in waves,” Epstein says of conversations about being a Jeffrey Epstein. “Sometimes I don’t get anything for months at a time, and then some weeks, I’ll have three or four people mention it,” with some asking if it’s his real name. He adds, “It can be annoying, but it has never been negative, other than the inconvenience. It’s just never-ending. It’s funny, if the news is on when I walk in, I’ll hear my name three or four times in two minutes. There’s always something that reminds me every day that I share a name with this guy.” Epstein says the unusual situation has affected the rest of his family, too. While his company doesn’t make use of his surname, his brother has a business that does, which has led customers to make jokes. His brother tells them that he has a sibling named Jeffrey who has to put up with much more of this commentary. “I’m non-political, so that also helps,” Epstein says of his random connection to reviled criminal frequently invoked in partisan attacks. Even so, he has a clear personal interest in seeing the Epstein case come to some kind of resolution. “I did post ‘release the Epstein files,’ but that’s basically because I want my name back,” he says. “Yeah, let’s get it over with. Why are we not doing this?” He’s referring to the current administration’s attempts to move on from the matter, with Trump and the White House taking the bizarre, nonsensical line that lingering questions about the late Epstein’s activities constitute some kind of “ hoax ” from Democrats. “You mean my name was ruined because of… nothing?” “Would definitely love to have no one talking about my name anymore,” he continues. Although they’ve each found ways to deal with the headache, these Jeffrey Epsteins agree that it’s a tired subject. At this point, they’ve all heard the same lines thousands of times. “It’s run its course, but just won’t go away,” Epstein says. If you ever meet a Jeffrey Epstein, then, do him a solid: pretend you’ve never heard the name in your life.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jeffrey-epstein-infamous-name-1235446383,Entertainment,Rollingstone,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jeffrey-epstein-same-name.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-16T14:20:57+00:00,081027376823596f500078a90b4f80548679ef14
1a77c86c6d65,Spotify partners with the big three music labels on 'artist-first AI music products',"spotify, music production, music industry","Spotify sees the music industry's AI problem , and it's going to do… something about it. On Thursday, the company published a blog post heavy on principles, partnerships and vague plans. Unfortunately, it's practically devoid of specifics. The most explicit bit is that it's partnering with the big three music labels. Together, they'll ""develop responsible AI products that empower the artists and songwriters they represent, and connect them with the fans who support them."" The move follows Spotify's announcement last month that it would clean up the AI slop proliferating on its platform. The company frames today's news as a direct defense against competition from unauthorized AI music production. ""If the music industry doesn't lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent or compensation,"" the company wrote. Spotify says artists don’t find that current AI tools are “built to power their careers, their businesses, and their fan bases.” That will inform whatever comes out of the partners’ plans. ""We’ll develop new products for artists and fans through upfront agreements, not by asking for forgiveness later,"" the company wrote. Spotify laid out four principles that will guide its hazy plans for ""artist-first AI music products."" The first is through partnerships with labels, distributors, and publishers. (In addition to the big three of Sony, Universal and Warner, Spotify is partnering with digital rights company Merlin and the French music label Believe.) The other tenets include choice in participation, fair compensation and artist-fan connections. Although it's been forced to clean up the AI mess that grew on its platform, Spotify has adopted AI features of its own. Most notably, that includes its AI DJ . But it's also released a personalized daylist and AI Playlist features. The company differentiated its tools from unauthorized ones it's combating. It described its AI features as helping listeners to discover and connect with real artists. ""Our goal is to ensure the future of music innovation happens responsibly, and to invite the best minds in AI to help build it,"" Spotify wrote.",https://www.engadget.com/ai/spotify-partners-with-the-big-three-music-labels-on-artist-first-ai-music-products-161047159.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZceBIuksrcb9DTuARjm5zQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/b4545a20-aaa8-11f0-877f-6d5ba70bc33f,2025-10-16T16:10:47+00:00,54ab4a58902c6f1ae42f60b2064dc5b0db9999af
ccd90dcd05e2,Unionized EA staffers are not happy about that proposed Saudi-backed acquisition,"ea, acquisition, saudi arabia, communications workers of america, workers&#39; union, eurogamer","EA employees involved with the Communications Workers of America union have issued a sternly-worded statement against the recently-proposed private acquisition of the company by Saudi-backed investors, according to a report by Eurogamer . The complaints don't involve Saudi Arabia's long history of human rights violations , but rather that workers weren't represented in any negotiations for the $55 billion deal. The employees worry that any jobs lost as a result of the purchase would ""be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets."" In addition to this formal response , unionized workers have issued a petition that urges regulators to scrutinize the deal. ""EA is not a struggling company,"" the statement reads, going on to note that the company's success has been driven by workers. ""Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."" The statement calls out the huge number of layoffs that have impacted the industry in recent years. Unionized staffers note that ""every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency and power."" ""We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful,"" the statement reads. ""The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."" Eurogamer reached out to the FTC to inquire about the status of the proposed acquisition but the agency refused to comment on the grounds that it doesn't speak about ""pending mergers or acquisitions."" It's worth noting that President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is involved with the purchase. The Financial Times recently suggested that the deal won't face any real opposition, as ""what regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"" As previously noted, the proposed deal is valued at $55 billion. This would take the company private for the first time in its 35-year history. Various entities have partnered to make this deal, including the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake and Kushner's Affinity Partners. US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have also voiced concerns about this acquisition.",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/unionized-ea-staffers-are-not-happy-about-that-proposed-saudi-backed-acquisition-155559256.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/k4kQxTDRI.bRGgWp63DFsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/15d99740-aaa6-11f0-95bf-dc1cf1e54aea,2025-10-16T15:55:59+00:00,2d4d140cfcff4fef6f7aaa398521ad1550f1a1e6

The agency sent HKT an ""Order to Show Cause,"" which directs the company to explain why the FCC should not begin revocation proceedings against it. The 30-page order outlines the agency's reasoning, including a focus on applying new certification and disclosure requirements to entities ""owned by, controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary."" “Today’s Order continues the FCC’s work of ensuring that CCP-controlled entities that pose national security risks to our country cannot connect to our telecom networks,” said FCC Chairman Brendan Carr in a statement announcing the move. HKT is one of the largest telecommunications companies in Hong Kong and is a subsidiary of communications giant PCCW. Roughly 18 percent of PCCW is owned by China Unicom, a state-owned telecommunications company. HKT is not the only target of the agency's ongoing effort to root out potential vulnerabilities. On October 28, the FCC will be voting on steps to further strengthen guardrails under its equipment authorization program to protect US networks and the communications supply chain against national security threats. The past month has seen ramped-up regulatory activity from both China and the United States aimed at companies that operate in or generate revenues from one another’s markets.

The drugmaker last week hired Peter Marks , a former top U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and the move quickly sparked a fresh round of concern about conflicts of interest between the agency and industry, as well as about public trust. To wit, might the hiring provide Lilly with an unfair advantage? And do such offers somehow compromise decision-making at the FDA? Skovronsky, the company’s chief scientific officer, not surprisingly, sees it differently. In his view, the criticism is understandable, but to block officials who have served the public from joining industry would limit them from potentially making useful contributions to society going forward.

The fight will give Silva, 50, the opportunity to avenge his MMA losses to Weidman, though inside a boxing ring.

The rematch took place five months later and Silva lost by TKO after suffering a horrific leg break . ""I am super excited to embark on another battle against Chris,"" Silva said in a statement. ""We have a history and on Friday, November 14th, live only on Netflix, we're putting another stamp on our chapter together. It will be a spectacle for the fans!"" Weidman, 41, held the UFC middleweight title for 2½ years after beating Silva, making three successful title defenses against Silva, Lyoto Machida and Vitor Belfort before losing to Luke Rockhold in December 2015. After starting his career 13-0, he went 3-9 and dealt with a myriad of injuries, including a leg break of his own in 2021 . He announced his retirement from the UFC in January but signed with Global Fight League and was slated to face Rockhold in April. However, the fight never came to fruition as GFL canceled all of their events indefinitely. The standout collegiate wrestler and grappler will now try his hand in a boxing ring and look to go 3-0 against one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time. ""I'm undefeated in boxing and it's gonna stay that way on Friday, November 14, live on Netflix,"" Weidman said in a statement. ""I'm the original spider killer."" Silva has gone 3-2 as a boxer, with a win over former middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in 2021 and a loss to Jake Paul in his most recent outing in 2022. Weidman will be making his pro boxing debut. ""This one is for Brazil...the greatest MMA fighter of all time Anderson Silva makes his return to boxing, in front of the world, against Chris Weidman, the man who ended Andersons's record-setting championship reign,"" Bidarian said.

Now that conference play has nearly reached the midway point of the season and the RPI and KPI rankings are out, it's time to look at what the key elements of the bracket might look like when the field of 64 is revealed on Nov. 30 (6 p.m. ET, ESPN). There are 31 automatic bids with 33 at-large teams chosen by the NCAA volleyball committee. Volleyball seeds the top eight teams in each region, and the top four teams in each region serve as first- and second-round hosts. The rest of the bracket is filled out to balance it competitively and geographically. The highest remaining seeds also host regionals, and the 2025 Final Four is in Kansas City, Missouri, on Dec. 18, with the finals on Dec. 21. Bracket watch With 10 top-50 RPI wins and an unblemished 16-0-mark, Nebraska is the clear No. 1 overall seed. The Cornhuskers haven't lost a set since Sept. 16. Texas is the nation's only other unbeaten and is No. 2 overall. The ACC duo of Pitt and Louisville fill out the top line. Their clash at the L&N Federal Credit Union Arena on Sunday (1 p.m. ET, ESPN) is the first of two matches between the Panthers and Cardinals. With Kentucky looming on the 2-seed line, Pitt and Louisville's match on Sunday (as well as their rematch on Nov. 26) will go a long way toward deciding the No. 1 seeds. Louisville also has to navigate a home meeting with SMU on Friday night before facing the Panthers and Olivia Babcock, the frontrunner to defend her crown as the AVCA Player of the Year. Full seedings No. 1 seeds: Nebraska, Texas, Pitt, Louisville No. 2 seeds: Kentucky, SMU, Arizona State, Stanford No. 3 seeds: Indiana, Miami, Purdue, Minnesota No. 4 seeds: Creighton, Wisconsin, TCU, Texas A&M No. 5 seeds: BYU, Illinois, Penn State, UCLA No. 6 seeds: Kansas State, Cincinnati, Marquette, Baylor No. 7 seeds: Tennessee, Kansas, USC, UTEP No. 8 seeds: Michigan State, Michigan, Colorado, North Carolina No. 9 seeds: South Dakota State, Iowa State, Xavier, Florida No. 10 seeds: West Virginia, Mississippi State, Western Kentucky, San Diego No. 11 seeds: Tulsa, Iowa, UCF, Dayton No. 12 seeds: Ball State, Colgate, Towson, Coastal Carolina No. 13 seeds: Stephen F.

The issue with the Yellow Jackets is their sub-.500 overall record (7-8). They need to string some wins together, and they have that opportunity with Wake Forest, NC State and Cal coming up on the schedule.

6cd7aa911754,Apple TV and Peacock team up on a bundle that costs $15 per month,"apple tv, peacock, original programming, network programming","There's a new streaming bundle in town. Apple TV and Peacock are teaming up to offer a combined subscription that starts at $15 per month. This will allow access to all original programming from both platforms, in addition to Peacock's stable of network and cable shows. This is a mighty fine deal, given that Apple TV recently changed both its name and price . The platform costs $13 per month now on its own. Peacock starts at $11 per month. In other words, this is a discount of around $9 each month. In this economy, we'll take any savings we can get. There's one caveat here. The $15 price tag is for Peacock with ads. The subscription shoots up to $20 per month for an ad-free version. However, a standalone subscription to ad-free Peacock is $17 on its own. This bundle becomes available on October 20. Additionally, Apple One subscribers will get a 35 percent discount on Peacock Premium Plus plans. It's always nice when two lonely corporations find friendship, isn't it? VIDEO For the uninitiated, Apple TV is the company's big-wig streaming platform. It's primarily known for sci-fi like Severance , For All Mankind and the upcoming Pluribus . The platform is also host to plenty of comedy, like The Studio , Shrinking and Ted Lasso . VIDEO Peacock is NBC's streaming service. It streams old-school network programming like The Office , Grimm and Superstore . The service features a stable of original programming like Poker Face , Twisted Metal and the underrated Mrs. Davis . The platform also recently premiered a little show called The Paper , which is a spinoff of The Office .

d9f423a046dd,Snap is bringing shopping features to its AR glasses,"snap, bobby murphy, ar","Snap is continuing to lay the groundwork for its first consumer-ready AR glasses called Specs. While the company has still revealed few details about the device set to launch next year , it used its Lens Fest event to preview new features and apps that will work on the new hardware. At the event dedicated to AR developers and creators, Snap said it would enable Specs users to buy items directly from their glasses. Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said that new software tools called Commerce Kit would allow ""select developers to accept payments directly inside lenses,"" either for ""digital goods"" or as upgrades to unlock ""premium features."" Snap already allows lens creators to make money off AR effects via its Lens Creator rewards program, but offering in-lens commerce could allow the company to monetize its AR platform in a new way. ""This is the start of developer monetization for lenses on Specs, and we plan to continue to find ways you can build sustainable businesses on our platform,"" Murphy said. Whether this could turn into a meaningful business for Snap is less clear. The company has so far released two versions of its standalone AR glasses, but those devices have been aimed at Snap developers not users. That's set to change next year with its next version of glasses. CEO Evan Spiegel has promised the new glasses will be ""lightweight"" compared with the current bulky and awkward-looking frames, but has said little else about the design. When Specs do launch, we know there will be a solid lineup of AR features available. Snap has already released a standalone experience for watching Spotlight videos and a more powerful web browser. There's also a new translation lens that can translate and transcribe audio in real-time. There are more AR integrations in the works, according to Snap. Tripadvisor is working on an AR lens that will overlay ""trusted insights"" into your field-of-view as you encounter restaurants, shops and other establishments in the real world. Design platform Figma is also working on a lens, though Snap didn't share details about how these will work. The updates are a reminder of how ambitious Snap's vision for AR glasses is. The company has been nurturing an ecosystem of AR creators and developers for years; it's now getting ready to carry that work over to its nascent glasses platform. ""We see Specs powering everything from classrooms to design studios, creating opportunities and work for developers in entirely new categories,"" Murphy said. Jim Lanzone, the CEO of Engadget’s parent company Yahoo, joined the board of directors at Snap on September 12, 2024.

c53717fca8b7,Why does Amazon need five TV streamers?,"fire tv, amazon, amazon","What’s in a name? Apparently quite a bit, according to Amazon. The company recently announced yet another change to its Fire TV devices lineup, which just means they renamed a few things yet again. The family now includes the $35 Fire TV Stick HD, the $40 Fire TV Stick 4K Select, the $50 Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, the $60 Fire TV Stick 4K Max and the $140 Fire TV Cube. That was a pain to type out and probably a pain to read (my apologies). Two of those devices were “ rebranded ” previously within the past year, so if you’re confused, you’re likely not alone. What’s a humble shopper to do when you’re trying to decide which is the best (and budget-friendly) option to upgrade an old TV so you can binge-watch Hunting Wives and ask Alexa about tomorrow’s weather forecast? I’ll make your decision quite easy: just get the Fire TV Stick 4K Max . Really, if you’re looking for the best streaming device , period, we recommend turning to Google for that. But if you’ve decided Amazon’s Fire TV lineup is where you want to spend your money, the 4K Max is the best option of the bunch. Not only has it stuck around without being subject to a “rebrand” for quite some time, but it also has arguably the best balance of features and price of any Fire TV streaming device. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max gives you 4K streaming capabilities with Dolby Vision and all the HDRs that matter, Dolby Atmos audio and support for Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass. (It has some decent retro gaming chops , too, as our Jeff Dunn has previously explained.) Aside from the lack of an onboard Ethernet port present on the Fire TV Cube, the 4K Max has the same Wi-Fi 6E support as the more expensive Cube, plus the same 16GB of storage and 2GB of memory. When compared to the other dongles in the Fire TV lineup, things get even more perplexing. The $60 4K Max and the $50 4K Plus are essentially the same stick, but the latter has less storage, only Wi-Fi 6 capabilities (not 6E), a standard Alexa Voice remote and no support for the Fire TV ambient experience, which turns your TV into an Alexa smart display when you’re not actively watching anything. Step down further once more to the $40 4K Select and you miss out on Dolby Vision and extra memory, and you’ll have to settle for Wi-Fi 5. If you’re going to make all those compromises to save a few dollars, then you should just get the entry-level $35 Fire TV Stick HD . The biggest thing here is that it only supports 1080p streaming, but that will be ok for some people. We consider it to be the best budget streaming device on the market right now, and for folks just looking to make a cheap, basic upgrade to an aging set — go off and know your $35 was well spent (or, pro tip: wait for a sale and pick one up for less than $20). The case for the $140 Fire TV Cube isn’t a strong one, but it’s one that I’ll admit might be attractive to some users. It adds into the mix an Ethernet port, hands-free Alexa controls (meaning you don’t have to press a button on its remote to activate the virtual assistant, you can just talk to it) and it can control your other entertainment devices like a cable box and game console. It ultimately gives you more control over both the other things in your entertainment ecosystem and Alexa all in one device. That means Amazon has three strong streaming devices with very clear value propositions: the $35 Stick HD, the $60 4K Max and the $140 TV Cube. Affordable, mid-tier and high-end categories are covered and most people will find something that fits in their budget and their needs with these three. The two Sticks sandwiched in the middle do nothing but confuse consumers. Looking at a comparison chart of all the Fire TV streaming devices , you might start to ask yourself, do I really need Wi-Fi 6E over Wi-Fi 6? Will one extra gigabyte of memory make a difference? Can I live without the Alexa Voice Remote Enhanced ? You shouldn’t be asking yourself these questions; you have better things to do. There are only three Fire TV streaming devices worth considering, and I’d take it one step further and say most people should just get the Fire TV Stick 4K Max when it inevitably goes on sale for Black Friday for around $35. You’ll spend less and get a better product.",https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/why-does-amazon-need-five-tv-streamers-163014576.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RZbWhEXVNWsaFmkgyoaOlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NjA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/a338ea20-aaa4-11f0-adee-ac3dd8e3cdb1,2025-10-16T16:30:14+00:00,2610d96f9b6fd2fce2ce0b0e2984ccc01f092bb4

The companies’ CEOs talked about the importance of a stable FDA at the STAT Summit on Wednesday. “It is going to kill drug development if you don’t have consistency and transparency,” said Replimune CEO Sushil Patel. “It’s really going to make it very difficult for us to bring innovative treatments to patients faster.” STAT+ Exclusive Story Already have an account?

f316e773437a,AMA president deflects criticism of organization’s restrained approach to the Trump administration,"cms, physicians, stat summit","BOSTON  — American Medical Association President Bobby Mukkamala defended the restrained advocacy strategy that the country’s largest professional medical organization has taken with the Trump administration, while playing up the alignment between federal health officials and the AMA on issues like prior authorization, as part of a Thursday conversation at the STAT Summit. Mukkamala acknowledged that certain decisions made by the Trump administration — including alterations to the childhood vaccine schedule and the potential overhaul of a key federal advisory panel on preventive services — could be dangerous for patients. But he also emphasized the importance of trying to maintain a working relationship with the administration. “This is a critical role of the AMA, to let people that have the authority to help us, to help our patients — to make it easier for them,” he said. “We’re excited about the administration’s interest in things that burn the heck out of me.” He referenced the administration’s interest in making prior authorization less burdensome and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz trying to help people pick a Medicare Advantage plan. “These are amazing things to see that are in total alignment,” said Mukkamala, a Michigan ear, nose, and throat specialist. “To be critical of that is foolish.” AMA officials have not been able to meet directly with key federal health officials including health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Oz. But there are conversations happening “at the staff level,” Mukkamala said, “so it isn’t a closed door relationship.” In order to keep that door open — or, ideally, push it wider — Mukkamala believes the AMA shouldn’t be too harsh on the administration. “There’s a variability in how we can say something,” he said in response to an audience question about the risks of staying silent. Citing vaccines, he added that “absolutely, the AMA is vocal about that … but then there’s vocal in the way of being critical. And that’s not what we want to do.” Some experts disagree with this strategy. Within the AMA, younger physicians have continually expressed a desire for clearer communication and stronger public pushback to health policies not based on sound science. At the STAT Summit on Wednesday, former high-ranking Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official Dan Jernigan asserted that professional medical organizations need to do more to counter unreliable statements from federal officials. And popular YouTube creator Mike Varshavski denounced the AMA’s media output, specifically calling out how Mukkamala appears on video, reading from a script. “We can all improve on everything we do,” Mukkamala said in response to Varshavski’s criticism and whether or not the AMA’s communications could be better. “From being a parent to being a doctor to being the largest association of doctors, every day is a day for improvement.” In the meantime, there are things the administration is doing right, Mukkamala said. Kennedy has centered nutrition as a key value of federal health authorities; the administration has spoken with insurance companies about pledging to reform and streamline prior authorization; and officials are considering an exemption for doctors from the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee. “These are examples of the interoperability,” Mukkamala said. “That’s something that’s now a priority of the secretary — that’s freaking awesome.” Rather than antagonizing the administration, Mukkamala believes that it’s important to explain the physician’s perspective to the public. “I think with conversations like this, the door will end up hopefully wide open and welcoming,” Mukkamala said, referencing his appearance on stage at the conference. “That’s what’s going to be critical to change the potential negative consequence into something that is wonderful for the health of this country.”",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/16/ama-president-deflects-criticism-of-organizations-restrained-approach-to-the-trump-administration,Health,Statnews,Theresa Gaffney,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/R52_2032-1-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-16T16:30:54+00:00,16b1db0e1055940b1dd82c8ba1bd20ec2e08c436
f5a123700e66,Yankees' Aaron Judge avoids surgery; Carlos Rodón could miss opener,,"Oct 16, 2025, 12:27 PM ET New York Yankees star Aaron Judge won't need surgery on his elbow, but left-hander Carlos Rodon underwent an operation this week and could miss Opening Day. Judge's throwing was limited after he hurt the flexor tendon in his right elbow in July. Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Thursday an MRI after the team was eliminated last week showed ""no surgery is going to be needed."" ""He'll take some time off and continue to do strengthening things and rehab and stuff,"" Boone said. ""But it felt like he finished the season in a pretty good place, as we saw continued improvements with him."" Judge, 33, led the majors in batting average (.331), OPS (1.144) and WAR (9.7) while finishing with 53 home runs and 114 RBIs. Boone said he expects Judge to be New York's every-day right fielder in 2026 and downplayed the idea that the two-time American League MVP could see some playing time at first base. Judge hurt his elbow making a throw at Toronto on July 22. The seven-time All-Star returned on Aug. 5 from a 10-day stint on the injured list and threw gingerly upon his outfield return on Sept. 5. He built up arm strength and made a 90.2 mph throw from right field in the AL Division Series opener. Rodón was operated on by Dr. Neal ElAttrache on Wednesday to remove loose bodies in his left elbow and shave a bone spur. He has eight weeks of no throwing, and the start of his season could be delayed by a couple of weeks, Boone said. Rodón, who turns 33 in December, was 18-9 with a 3.09 ERA. Boone also said slugger Giancarlo Stanton does not need surgery on his elbows. Boone added that bullpen coach Mike Harkey and first-base/infield coach Travis Chapman won't return for 2026 and assistant hitting coach Pat Roessler won't return in that role.

dd486b740d3d,Warriors' Jonathan Kuminga fined $35K for actions toward official,,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The NBA fined Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga $35,000 for the actions that led to his ejection late in the first half of a preseason win in Portland on Tuesday night. Kuminga was upset after he didn't receive a whistle on a shot attempt with seven seconds left in the second quarter. Kuminga stumbled while attempting a barreling transition drive through two defenders, missed the layup and immediately went after nearby official Rodney Mott, clapping in Mott's face. Mott ejected Kuminga. Two days later, the league fined Kuminga for ""making inappropriate contact with and continuing to pursue a game official."" After the game, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he ""kind of liked [the ejection], actually"" because he has been searching for some extra fire from Kuminga. ""He got fouled,"" Kerr said. ""It was a frustration play. I have no problem with it. He deserved the foul. He was getting fouled quite a bit. It was a physical game."" After some contentious contract negotiations this summer, Kuminga returned to the Warriors on a two-year, $46.8 million contract earlier this month, arriving at training camp a couple days late. He has flashed some improved playmaking in the preseason and had 7 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists at the moment of his ejection. ""The way he ran on [the ejection] play, the activity he played with, the rebounding,"" Kerr said. ""That's the JK who can really help our team, I loved the way he played. I love the fire, the passion, I don't mind the ejection at all."" Kuminga's arm appeared to be whacked on the drive, but he told ESPN in the postgame locker room that he was most upset about his right ankle getting clipped on his gather step. Kuminga badly twisted his right ankle last season and said he had a flashback to that injury when Portland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija accidentally stepped on it, causing him to lose his temper on the official. ""I wasn't surprised he got ejected because he kind of got right in [Mott's] face,"" Kerr said. ""You can't do that.

4ea6b29da372,Soccer,,"The floodgates haven't opened entirely to teenage signings in the NWSL , but they are no longer so rare that the mere age of a player turns heads. The NWSL still lacks a unified academy system, but with the college draft being abolished and combines -- including a youth combine to scout talent as young as 13 -- age is not holding recruitment back as it did in years past. Now, more teams are increasingly identifying young players who can make a difference -- and several already are, in big ways. So we've again ranked every player in the league age 19 and under -- including those on inbound and outbound loans -- to look at who's got next in one of the best leagues in the world. The best of the bunch have already cracked into their senior national teams. Others are tearing it up at the youth international level, or slowly chipping away at growing into their future selves. Several of the stars in the making from last year's U19 rankings have aged out of this category: U.S. women's national team stars Alyssa Thompson , Jaedyn Shaw and Olivia Moultrie , and Japan international Manaka Matsukubo have all since turned 20. (Thompson left the NWSL in September in a blockbuster transfer to Chelsea , anyway.) Still, there are four more teenagers in the NWSL's pool this year than in last year's ranking. Who is the best right now? And who has shown potential for the future? Let's get to it. - After scandals, can new owners return Portland Thorns to glory? - Alex Morgan talks next chapter after USWNT, NWSL retirement - NWSL commissioner Berman gets contract extension Gisele Thompson (Angel City), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current) and Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign) are three of the top young players in the NWSL this season. ESPN Illustration Age: 18 Position: Defender Club: Houston Dash (on loan with Dux Logroño) Country: USA Matthews is on loan in Spain until June 30, 2026, which the Dash hope will allow the 18-year-old to gain the necessary minutes to step into a bigger role with Houston come next summer. She's a regular with the U.S. youth national teams after training with Jamaica 's senior team in the past. Age: 18 Position: Defender Club: Kansas City Current Country: USA Scott is still finding her way in the league, having played in just two matches. Her place on the best and deepest team in the league doesn't help with earning game time right now, but it is a great long-term development tool. The Current loaned Scott to Racing Louisville in August, but the defender was recently recalled without making an appearance. She has played for the U.S. at several youth national team levels. Age: 15 Position: Forward Club: NJ/NY Gotham FC Country: USA Still the youngest player in the league, Whitham has earned minutes in six league games as well as several Concacaf Champions Cup games. Those minutes, particularly in Concacaf, should prove invaluable in her development. Age: 16 Position: Forward Club: Utah Royals Country: USA Ream signed with Utah as a 15-year-old and in August, she became the youngest goal-scorer in NWSL history -- a game-winner over the Portland Thorns in Providence Park, to boot. The Utah native is part of the U.S. team set to compete at the U17 World Cup later this month. Age: 17 Position: Forward Club: Chicago Stars FC Country: USA The Stars have had a difficult season in a myriad of ways, but Johnson offers some hope for the future. She scored her first pro goal earlier this month before departing for the U17 World Cup. Chicago signed her to a long-term deal, so she is part of another rebuild there. Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Club: Seattle Reign FC Country: USA Earning regular minutes is a major part of development at such a young age, and McCammon has quietly chipped away at that task in Seattle. With no goal contributions, her stats don't jump off the page, but 14 matches played -- including five starts -- for a team contending for a home playoff game shows the trust that Reign head coach Laura Harvey has in the young midfielder. Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Club: Houston Dash (pre-contract with Boston Legacy for 2026) Country: USA Ricketts will get a fresh start next year with NWSL expansion team Boston Legacy FC, who signed the midfielder to a two-year deal with a mutual option for 2029. Ricketts plays with a flair on the wing that can excite any casual observer. Her reality in Portland was that of a teenager -- who is already wrapping up her third professional season! -- fighting for minutes on one of the most talented teams in the league. Boston's start-up nature should mean more gametime and more meaningful development. The potential has been there in glimpses. Age: 17 Position: Forward Club: Kansas City Current Country: USA It was just last year that Pfeiffer burst onto the scene and scored for the Kansas Current in her debut as a 16-year-old. She plays with the swagger and confidence of a young player who knows no limits. She'd be higher on this list too, if not for a knee injury that cut her 2024 season short and kept her out for half of 2025. Age: 18 Position: Forward Club: Kansas City Current Country: USA Long, the daughter of Current co-owners Angie and Chris, has slowly built up first-team minutes in her debut season after leaving Duke University as a freshman to turn pro. She has been a regular at the U.S. youth level and helped the U17s finish third at the 2024 World Cup. She has one assist in nine appearances for Kansas City -- no small feat considering the team's depth of international firepower up top. Age: 17 Position: Winger Club: San Diego Wave FC Country: USA Barcenas is probably the most viral player on this list. Odds are if you follow the NWSL, you've seen a clip of her crossing up a defender with a stepover move or a spin turn. Her next challenge is and has been about production -- completing those plays to turn them into serious scoring opportunities for her team. She has done more of that in 2025 as a reliable substitute (even with limited minutes). play 0:47 Melanie Barcenas slots in the goal for San Diego Wave FC Melanie Barcenas slots in the goal for San Diego Wave FC Age: 18 Position: Forward Club: Angel City FC (on loan to Djurgården) Country: South Korea Progress has been incremental for Phair, who signed a long-term extension this summer and immediately went on loan to Sweden 's Damallsvenskan. She has earned more minutes there than she had at Angel City in the first half of the season, but Phair is still fighting for first-team appearances. It's worth remembering that Phair turned pro at 16 and had already played at a senior World Cup for South Korea. She has a nose for goal, and those around Angel City expect that to start to pay off in the NWSL. Age: 18 Position: Forward Club: Portland Thorns FC Country: Colombia Portland invested significantly in signing Loboa -- her contract runs through 2028 with a club option for 2029 -- after she scored her first international goal and played in all six games at Copa America this summer for finalists Colombia. That included a full 90 in the group stage against Brazil and starting the final against Brazil. Loboa debuted in her home country as a 14-year-old and while NWSL fans haven't yet seen much of her, the forward's experience at Copa America for a relatively strong team speaks to her potential. Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Club: Portland Thorns FC (on loan from Arsenal ) Country: England Harbert's entire Arsenal senior career to date has been spent on loan, but those around the club have high expectations for the England youth international and expect she will eventually make it to the Lionesses' senior team. Her loan to Portland is only through the end of the 2025 NWSL season, meaning it's brief, but it's also the highest level of first-team exposure she's had to date outside of Arsenal. Even if Portland proves to be a pit stop, Harbert's ceiling is high. Age: 18 Position: Defender Club: San Diego Wave FC Country: USA Armstrong is strong in duels and growing into her own as a center-back. Granted, San Diego's 31 goals conceded this season isn't great, but Armstrong, in large part, was tasked with filling the gigantic shoes of Naomi Girma , who left for Chelsea in the offseason. Armstrong started the year as a 17-year-old thrown straight into the center-back role, and she has largely shown she has the ability to handle it. Age: 19 Position: Forward Club: Seattle Reign FC Country: USA Adames leads all teenagers this year with six goals, achieving that in just 989 minutes while coming off the bench half the time. Adames has game-changing abilities on the ball and can change matches off the bench. Her late game-winner in San Diego in June was a taste of how special she can be on the ball: play 1:05 Emeri Adames gives Seattle Reign late lead Emeri Adames finds the top corner to give the Seattle Reign a late lead vs. the San Diego Wave. Age: 17 Position: Forward Club: San Diego Wave FC Country: USA Ascanio has drawn comparisons to a young Tobin Heath -- who happens to be her childhood idol. Ascanio's production is up from last year, with four goals and an assist for a Wave team that has generally struggled going forward. Ascanio's style is just different -- free-flowing, smooth, confident -- in a way that might draw comparisons to a young Heath. It's a rare combination, especially in the USWNT pool. Age: 19 Position: Midfielder Club: North Carolina Courage Country: USA Have you seen that assist on Manaka Matsukubo's recent goal for the North Carolina Courage? That was Riley Jackson doing what she does on the ball. Her final pass can be exquisite: play 0:55 Manaka Matsukubo gets on the scoresheet for North Carolina Courage Manaka Matsukubo gets on the scoresheet for North Carolina Courage Yes, that was her lone assist of the year, but she leads all players on this list in expected assists (3.77), which speaks to her potential. North Carolina has also struggled as a team this season, but that dip is not indicative of Jackson's potential. Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Club: Angel City FC Country: USA play 1:06 Kennedy Fuller slots in the goal for Angel City FC Kennedy Fuller gets on the scoresheet for Angel City FC Fuller's four goals and three assists have been a bright spot in an inconsistent season filled with change for Angel City. Still, Fuller has the makings of a long-term No. 10 for club and, potentially, for country. Fuller is a dynamic playmaker whose decision making at speed is exceptional for her age. She is also productive for a midfielder -- regardless of age -- with seven total goal contributions. Fuller has made tremendous gains in her second season as a professional. Age: 19 Position: Defender Club: Seattle Reign FC Country: USA Multiple coaches have compared Bugg's skill set to that of USWNT defender Naomi Girma, who landed at No. 2 on ESPN's ranking of the top 50 players last year. Need we go on? (OK, we will.) Bugg is the central anchor to Seattle Reign FC's defense, and she recently got her first cap with the senior USWNT. She possess the subtle balance of vision and technical skill of an elite center back, and she is also good for an epic highlight. Age: 19 Position: Defender Club: Angel City FC Country: USA Thompson's older sister, Alyssa, is better known internationally -- especially after her blockbuster transfer to Chelsea on England's deadline day -- but Gisele is also a talented player turning heads within the NWSL and U.S. Soccer. She has made her name thus far at fullback and has five assists for Angel City, which is tied for the NWSL lead. Her best position in the long term might still be higher up the field. Age: 19 Position: Midfielder Club: Kansas City Current Country: USA Hutton's days as a teenager are dwindling, but her bright career as a pro and U.S. international is only just beginning. She is the starting defensive midfielder and a key cog for what might become the best NWSL team in history. Hutton is a brave, two-way midfielder who can protect the back line with crunching tackles and spark the attack with progressive passes. Get ready to see her at the 2027 World Cup and beyond for the USWNT.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46609199/nwsl-teenager-ranking-u19-analysis-gisele-thompson-claire-hutton-jordyn-bugg,Sport,Espn,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2F251016_soc_u19%2Dranking_16x9.jpg,,74fa238c92bd402f7e03331f9111935edfbe5fbc

A few weeks ago, the company confirmed an agreement to go private in a $55 billion sale . And now we know that Battlefield 6 sold over 7 million copies in its first three days. The game also had over 172 million online matches played during the holiday weekend. On top of that, it logged 15 million hours watched on streaming services. Battlefield 6 's sales numbers make it the biggest opening yet for the franchise. By comparison, 2021's Battlefield 2042 reportedly sold a relatively paltry 4.2 million copies in its first week. The quotes in EA's blog post read like awards ceremony acceptance speeches. ""First and foremost, we want to thank our players,"" franchise General Manager Byron Beede said. ""We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point,"" Executive VP Vince Zampella added. The game's launch came weeks after the company's announcement that it will go private. The gaming giant will be owned by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. On Wednesday, unionized EA staffers spoke out against the acquisition , warning that ""every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency and power."" Battlefield 6 launched on October 10. It's available for PC , PS5 , and Xbox Series X/S .

His stories explore how tech is changing the practice of health care and the business and policy challenges to realizing tech’s promise. He’s also the co-author of the free, twice weekly STAT Health Tech newsletter . You can reach Mario on Signal at mariojoze.13. Y ou’re reading the web edition of STAT’s Health Tech newsletter, our guide to how technology is transforming the life sciences. Sign up to get it delivered in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. Five things I’m seeing in HLTH announcements so far As the HLTH conference in Las Vegas creeps ups, my inbox is lighting up with announcements. Here’s my first pass at making sense of it all by lumping announcements into categories. Mega raises: Oura, Town Hall Smart ring maker Oura announced its previously rumored $900 million fundraise valuing a company at about $11 billion. Is this a HLTH announcement or just coincidentally announced now? Interesting if the company really sees itself as lumped in with the health care nerds. It’s also interesting that Oura hasn’t gone public, which is the first thing CEO Tom Hale was asked about on CNBC . He gave, in my opinion, unsatisfactory answers about hiring and expansion and focusing on customers. He bragged about not needing to report quarterly, and I do wonder if the company’s quarterly numbers would really satisfy investors. In terms of projections, Hale said the company has sold about 5.5 million rings to date, and he  believes they’ll “sell another five in the next, you know, year; this category is exploding.” Town Hall Ventures, the investment company run by former CMS Administrator Andy Slavitt announced a $440 million new fund. The firm has invested in some companies we pay attention to including Ambience Healthcare, Qualified Health, Strive Health, and Thyme Care. Other raises: Radiology, telehealth, remote care MD Integrations , a telehealth provider network that helps prop up other telehealth platforms, raised $77 million from Updata Partners and Denali Growth Partners . Brook.ai , maker of tech for remote patient care, raised a $28 million Series B round led by UMass Memorial Health and Morningside. Medmo, “an orchestration platform for radiology appointments,” announced a $15 million Series A round led by Covera Health. OneImaging, a company that facilitates access to radiology, announced $38 million led by Vy Capital. M&A trends continue Last week, I published a story about how we’re seeing an uptick in digital health M&A driven by big private equity companies building health care infrastructure rollups, as well as lots of little acquisitions of companies that probably don’t have a future as standalone businesses. We’ve already got new examples of both: Revenue cycle management company R1 acquired Phare Health, “a healthcare technology company building AI-native solutions for inpatient coding and clinical documentation improvement.” Cairns Health , maker of an “AI driven lifestyle assistant” that supports seniors and their caregivers, acquired Together by Renee , an app that uses a smartphone camera for health tracking tasks like capturing vitals or logging medication. Adolescent mental health My sources in the mental health world are noticing an uptick in activity around mental health companies that support young people, and we’ve seen a few notable examples. Marble Health raised $15.5 million Series A round led by Costanoa with participation from Town Hall Ventures and Khosla Ventures. “Marble will use the funding to expand access to critical mental health care in schools across the U.S. and grow its team to accelerate innovation and impact at scale.” Not exactly a HLTH announcement but Hazel Health, another youth mental health provider, just announced it acquired Little Otter, its second acquisition of the year. Behavioral Health Business reports the company has a new CEO, board member and Cityblock Health founding CEO Iyah Romm. AI additions With the rise of AI technology, everyone wants to share how they are putting the tech to work. SonderMind, a provider of insurance-covered virtual mental health care, detailed its latest “clinically-backed” AI tech to boost the efficiency of its operations. Earlier in the week, I covered Lyra Health’s launch of a “clinical grade” mental health chatbot. Fast-moving AI platform Innovaccer announced an “AI-powered payer platform” called Galaxy to aid with risk adjustment and more. Innovaccer is best known for its work on the health system side. Hello Heart — a service that aims to prevent heart disease in people at risk by helping them manage their cholesterol, blood pressure, and more — added an AI assistant , called Nia. TytoCare, maker of a “home smart clinic” based a physical exam device announced a  “Smart Clinic Companion.” Other news of note Mayo Clinic Platform announced a new crop of AI startups it will support in an accelerator program. Hims and Hers Health announced it launched a new menopause and perimenopause speciality, joining a growing army of companies offering such care . Former Intermountain Healthcare CEO Marc Harrison mysteriously vanished from his post atop General Catalyst’s HATCo , just as the company’s acquisition of health system Summa Health was nearing its close. According to Axios , he was “removed” following disagreements over strategy for the venture.

The latest update to Tesla's Full Self-Driving System adds a mode called Mad Max, ""which comes with higher speeds and more frequent lane changes"" than the system's Hurry mode. This feature isn't new; it was part of the Autopilot mode in 2018 that pre-dated FSD. According to Electrek , the re-introduction of Mad Max mode is going exactly as well as you'd expect: ""It hasn’t been out for 24 hours, and it has already been spotted rolling stop signs and driving more than 15 mph (24 km/h) over the speed limit."" Everything about this is a comically bad idea, or it would be comic if it wasn't so downright dangerous. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration just opened an investigation into the company's FSD system last week after receiving more than 50 reports of traffic safety violations in addition to numerous crashes. And this is just the most recent time the regulator has put FSD in its crosshairs.

c9b6b6557dde,OxygenOS 16 has new lock screen customization options and a novel Gemini integration,"customization options, android 16, oneplus","OnePlus has finally shown off its take on Android 16. OxygenOS 16 , first shipping on the upcoming OnePlus 15, combines the new customization options of Android, with smoother animations and a take on AI that seems directly lifted from Nothing OS. The centerpiece of OxygenOS 16 is a deeper integration between OnePlus' ""Mind Space"" app and Google Gemini. Mind Space debuted alongside the Plus Key — the replacement for OnePlus' classic Alert Slider — on some OnePlus 13 phones earlier this year. Like Nothing's Essential Space , it captures screenshots and voice memos and automatically sorts them into folders you can refer to later. The big innovation of OxygenOS 16 is that you can now ask Gemini to refer to content in Mind Space to personalize responses. The idea being that the added context will make the AI assistant's responses more helpful. New features being introduced with OxygenOS 16. (OnePlus) OnePlus is also hopping on the AI writing and photo editing bandwagon. AI Writer in OxygenOS 16 can convert text into mind maps and tables with a few taps, and also generate social media captions based on a photo. The usual options for proofreading and summarizing text are also built-in. For photos, OnePlus is adding what it calls AI Portrait Glow to make faces visible even in poor lighting conditions and AI Perfect Shot, which appears to combine multiple photos to generate a single image where everyone's eyes are open, like Google's Best Take feature . Beyond those AI-enabled features, OnePlus says it's also improving customization options and animations across OxygenOS. With OxygenOS 16 you'll be able to customize your lock screen with a variety different fonts and layouts, including the option to convert a still image into an animated GIF or use a video lock screen. On your home screen, OxygenOS 16 is also getting a collection of new widgets and the ability to scale app icons — another idea present in Nothing OS. Opening and moving between apps should also feel smoother thanks to new, speedier animations and an update to how the OS loads content. Essentially, with Parallel Processing 2.0, OxygenOS 16 ""allows new animations to begin before previous actions complete,"" which is supposed to make everything feel more fluid. Those are just the highlights of OxygenOS 16, which also includes an expansion of the tablet multitasking system OnePlus uses on its OnePlus Pad tablets, and new connectivity options that let you mirror your phone screen to macOS or Windows computers. OxygenOS 16 will be released alongside the OnePlus 15, which doesn't have a release date, but is expected to launch this fall. The new OS update will also be available on recent OnePlus devices starting in November 2025, like the OnePlus 13 , OnePlus Pad 3 and OnePlus Open .

Hendrickson is listed as questionable for the game because of a hip injury. The source told Fowler that Hendrickson is hopeful to return for the Bengals' Week 8 game against the New York Jets . Hendrickson, who did not play the second half of Sunday's 27-18 loss to the Green Bay Packers after injuring his hip, did not practice this week. Hendrickson, who had 17.5 sacks in both 2023 and '24, leads the Bengals with four sacks in six games this season. Despite Hendrickson's expected absence, Cincinnati will get a boost on the defensive line as rookie edge rusher Shemar Stewart is set to return following a four-game absence. Stewart hasn't played since injuring his ankle in Week 2. Earlier in the week, Bengals defensive coordinator Al Golden said he expected Stewart to receive significant playing time against the AFC North leaders. The Bengals (2-4) are trying to snap a four-game losing streak and stay in the hunt in an underwhelming AFC North.

The Golden Knights announced Hart's addition Thursday, noting in a statement that the goalie had been reinstated by the NHL and NHL Players' Association. ""The Golden Knights are aligned with the process and assessment the NHL and NHLPA made in their decision,"" the team said . ""We remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward."" Sources said Hart, 27, is on a paid tryout that is expected to be converted to an NHL contract. If Vegas signs Hart, he will be eligible to begin playing in the NHL on Dec. 1. Hart was one of five players on Canada's 2018 under-20 world junior team who was found not guilty of sexual assault charges in July. The trial in London, Ontario, stemmed from an alleged assault that took place after the 2018 Hockey Canada Foundation Gala. The players were criminally charged in 2024. At the time, Hart was the starting goaltender for the Philadelphia Flyers . He took an indefinite leave of absence shortly before the charges were announced, and the Flyers said last month that Hart would not be rejoining the team . Unlike other players involved in the case, Hart chose not to play professionally overseas and instead trained in Nashville. Sources said Hart will report to Vegas, where he can begin training with the team, according to conditions set by the NHL and NHLPA. He is expected to then go to Henderson, Nevada, and get some game action beginning Nov. 15 with the Golden Knights' minor league affiliate. Several teams, including the Carolina Hurricanes , had explored the possibility of signing Hart, sources said. In March, Vegas signed starting goaltender Adin Hill to a six-year extension. The team also has 25-year-old Akira Schmid under contract for this season. Hart was a second-round pick by Philadelphia in the 2016 draft. He has played in 227 career NHL games, recording a 2.94 goals-against average and .906 save percentage. The other four players in the Team Canada case -- Dillon Dubé, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton and Michael McLeod -- are not expected to join NHL teams in the immediate future, sources said. The Ottawa Senators hold Formenton's rights but are not expected to sign him, although other teams have explored trading for his rights. McLeod signed a three-year deal earlier this month to play in Russia's Kontinental Hockey League.",https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/46616724/golden-knights-bring-carter-hart-goalie-acquittal,Sport,Espn,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2022%2F1115%2Fr1091589_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,eb54e202c05d57870afc8c232bd99d194b9669ce
4caa38e964c1,Reports: Milan fear injured Christian Pulisic out for a month,,"Oct 16, 2025, 02:13 PM ET AC Milan and United States star Christian Pulisic is headed back to Italy after international duty with a hamstring injury, and although the U.S. winger still has to be fully evaluated by his club, reports say he could be sidelined for nearly a month. That would mean Pulisic would not only miss Sunday's match against Fiorentina but also Serie A matches against Pisa , Atalanta , Roma and Parma as the friendly matches played by the U.S. could cost Milan dearly. Despite the reports, a source told ESPN that Pulisic's return flight to Milan had been delayed and that he was still in the United States, adding that no scans had been done yet to determine the extent of his injury. Pulisic has been Milan's best player by far this season, with six goals and two assists in seven matches before a rare missed penalty in a goalless draw against Juventus before the international break. Pulisic, 27, was slowed by a right ankle injury last week and only entered Friday's 1-1 draw against Ecuador in the 73rd minute. Despite that -- and the matches only being friendlies -- he started Tuesday's 2-1 win over Australia but was forced off after 26 minutes with an apparent hamstring injury. After the match, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino suggested the change in climate and altitude between the team's first game in Austin and the game against Australia in Denver as a possible contributing factor to Pulisic's injury. ""I think it's a thing that is a massive risk. I don't want to say that Christian or if it's something because, but I think it was really tough for the player,"" Pochettino said. ""We know to prepare the game and then to play. We got really sad about this [Pulisic] situation because I think it is difficult. ""I think the [temperature] difference [between Austin and Colorado] and that can affect your body and everything. That is difficult. But yes, that is a thing that we need to fix for the future when we come from Europe because [the altitude] can affect [things]."" The Rossoneri will hope to have him back at least for the derby match against Inter Milan on Nov. 23 -- after the next international break. Milan is third in Serie A , two points below AS Roma and defending champion Napoli . Information from The Associated Press was used in this story.

0f2bf19c38df,Google's Ask Photos feature isn't available in Texas and Illinois,"google photos, google, engadget, illinois, texas","One of Google's Gemini-powered photo features is MIA in Texas and Illinois. The company confirmed to Engadget that Ask Photos is currently unavailable in the two states. It didn't say why. Google Photos' Conversational Editing is reportedly missing in those states, too. ""The ability to ask Photos to edit your images is not available to users in Texas and Illinois at this time,"" Google's statement to Engadget reads. ""We are working to determine how to make Ask Photos available to more users."" As for why that is, we don't have confirmation. But the Houston Chronicle , which first reported the news, pointed to a pair of lawsuit settlements as a likely culprit. In 2022, Google settled an Illinois class action suit over Google Photos data privacy concerns for $200 million. Earlier this year, it settled one with Texas for $1.4 billion over collecting user data without permission. The common theme in both settlements was biometric data collection. Lo and behold, both of the missing AI features require ""face grouping"" to be turned on. That Google Photos feature uses automated facial recognition to cluster pictures of the same person. The tricky part comes when state laws require informed consent for data collection. 9to5Google notes that only the photographer — and not the many subjects of their pictures — have typically agreed to Google's terms and conditions. That creates a head-spinning legal conundrum that could have easily led Google to play it safe. Ask Google Photos lets you type or speak queries about your picture library .

6577381a604b,"Former NIH leaders lament ‘constant chaos’ at the agency, and caution it’s not over","nih, research, scientists","BOSTON — Jeremy Berg walked on stage sporting a curious look: a red tie patterned with a word cloud drawn from the applications of 197 researchers who vied to be part of a National Institutes of Health initiative aimed at accelerating junior scientists’ academic careers. The MOSAIC program, which provided researchers seed funding to start their own labs, was eliminated months ago after the federal government deprioritized and cut funding for scientific research the Trump administration deemed as promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. The former director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences wore the tie — featuring words such as “CELL,” “DISEASE,” and “EPIGENETICS — to draw attention to research areas affected by months of turmoil. “It’s been like living in a washing machine, it’s been constant chaos,” said Berg, speaking Thursday on a STAT Summit panel of former NIH leaders and a researcher documenting the impact of funding cuts. The chaos is not confined to a single program, said the panelists. And the worst may be yet to come. “I get asked this constantly: When will we start rebuilding? I don’t think we can know until we know the full extent of the destruction. There’s no reason to think we’ve bottomed out,” said Eric Green, who was forced to retire in March as director at the National Human Genome Research Institute. It’s hard to rebuild when roughly half of the agency’s 27 institutes and centers have acting administrators, Green added. The list of impacts at the NIH since President Trump’s return to office is already long. Health disparities research has withered , vaccine research has been curtailed, and political appointees have gummed up funding disbursements . Even though the agency was able to spend its entire $47 billion budget by the end of the 2025 fiscal year, the number of grants awarded dropped precipitously . Berg said that his attempts to communicate with Director Jay Bhattacharya have been frustrating. “I’m less convinced that he’s receptive to rational conversations,” Berg said about a dismissive reply that Bhattacharya sent him in response to a tallying of NIH grant spending. Asked for a response, Department of Health and Human Services press secretary Emily Hilliard emailed STAT: “Dr. Bhattacharya is restoring the agency to its tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science. For too long, resources have drifted toward projects with limited relevance to the health challenges facing Americans. As part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again, NIH is reviewing funded research to ensure taxpayer dollars target chronic disease and deliver measurable public health impact.” Mallory Harris, senior data analyst at the Science & Community Impacts Mapping Project, said cuts to training grants and other NIH programs are having a chilling effect on researchers, leading to a “lost generation.” “In the coming years, people are going to decide not to come to the U.S. very quickly. Our workforce is going to shrink and we’re going to be losing people who could have been the next Nobel Prize winners,” she said. “It is going to take a while for us to really see how deeply these impacts are going to be felt.” Harris worked on a project that found that cuts to federal health research have already resulted in $11 billion and 49,000 jobs lost . Going forward, those numbers will increase to $17 billion and 72,000 jobs lost per year, according to the project’s website. “Younger people are going to be looking at this and going, ‘Do I really want to go down this path if there are better options?’” said Berg. Asked whether the research cuts are costing lives, the panelists said it’s hard to calculate the impact of research not done. But Harris cited Bhattacharya’s own work as a great example of what is lost when research is stalled or ended. “I’ll point out one paper … by one Jay Bhattacharya, about the amount of lives that are saved in a flu pandemic if you can get a vaccine out early,” said Harris. “We just cut mRNA vaccine research , which we know gives us — we were able to turn around a vaccine in, what, 200 days? So what does that mean for the next pandemic, which will happen?”",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/16/former-nih-leaders-describe-constant-chaos,Health,Statnews,O.

Judge Beatrice Butchko Sanchez signed off on Masvidal's request to grant the judgement after an arbitrator awarded the former BMF champion $5,315,268.64 and additional post-judgment interest from the fight. Masvidal sued Fanmio in January and stated that his deal for the Diaz fight was to include a purse of $6 million, plus an additional $1 million if he won the fight. Masvidal would lose the fight by decision and later claimed that his only payments were a $150,000 advance and a $1 million payment. An arbitrator sided with Masvidal and with the final sign-off, this matter has been put to rest. However, Fanmio is still engaged in lawsuits with fighters. Nate Diaz filed a lawsuit against Fanmio two weeks after the Masvidal, claiming he was owed over $9 million . An arbitrator awarded Diaz $6 million, along with attorney fees. That case is still awaiting a final sign-off.

4b90c0239b19,Vince McMahon to enter pretrial program in reckless driving case,,"Oct 16, 2025, 03:05 PM ET STAMFORD, Conn. -- Former WWE CEO Vince McMahon has been allowed to enter a pretrial program to resolve a reckless driving charge stemming from an accident this summer in Connecticut. A state Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that McMahon could enter the program if he made a $1,000 charitable contribution and only drove if properly licensed and insured. If he does that, the reckless driving charge and another charge of following too closely will be dismissed in one year. McMahon was accused of causing a July 24 crash on the Merritt Parkway in Westport that wrecked his Bentley and damaged two other cars, state police said. No one was injured in the accident, and the other drivers did not object to McMahon's application for the pretrial program. The police report said McMahon was driving northbound on the parkway, also known as Route 15, when he rear-ended a BMW and crashed into wooden guardrail. A car traveling in the southbound lanes struck debris from the crash that flew over the guardrail. McMahon did not speak during the brief hearing. His attorney, Mark Sherman, said afterward that ""not every car accident is a crime. That's what happened here, an accident,."" McMahon stepped down as WWE's CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into sexual misconduct allegations. He also resigned as executive chairman of the board of directors of TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of WWE, last year, a day after a former WWE employee filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against him. McMahon has denied the allegations. The lawsuit remains pending. McMahon bought what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1982 and transformed it from a regional wrestling company into a worldwide phenomenon. Besides running the company with his wife, Linda, who is now the U.S. Secretary of Education, he also performed at WWE events as himself.",https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/46617146/vince-mcmahon-enter-pretrial-program-reckless-driving-case,Sport,Espn,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0730%2Fr1525703_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,1651189fadb2b43304b61b41e0431763401a66b3
0f3eef2e080f,Apple's M6 MacBook Pro generation will reportedly offer touchscreens,"macbook pro, touchscreen laptops, apple, mark gurman, macbooks","Apple insiders are pointing to a tactile new future for the company's laptops. Last month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that Apple would incorporate touchscreens into MacBooks some time in the next few years, ""further blurring the line with the iPad."" Today, Mark Gurman at Bloomberg confirmed that prediction, sharing even more specifics about the touchscreen approach for a MacBook Pro that is currently projected for release in late 2026 or early 2027. Gurman reports that the touchscreen laptops are internally known as K114 and K116, and will run on M6 chips; Apple just introduced the M5 generation of its silicon for this year's iteration of the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro . His sources also say that the laptops will have OLED screens and will boast ""a reinforced hinge and screen hardware"" so that the display portion doesn't move when being used. The laptops will still have a trackpad and keyboard for non-touchscreen control, and will be housed in ""thinner and lighter frames."" Finally, this laptop will reportedly abandon the notch housing for the MacBook Pro's camera in favor of a hole-punch design that leaves a display area around that sensor. Longtime Apple leader Steve Jobs was adamantly opposed to touchscreen computers. But most other computer companies have had touchscreen models available for about a decade, so Apple did adhere to that philosophy for a really long time. Rather than bring touch to a laptop, for a while Apple was trying to position the iPad as being capable of doing all the tasks you'd use a laptop for, as epitomized in the notorious "" what's a computer? "" ad. It should be interesting to see how touch MacBooks and iPads will coexist.",https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-m6-macbook-pro-generation-will-reportedly-offer-touchscreens-203029809.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hsXIyDuVAvZRwprb4GS43w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zdnet_articles_730/1d0ec5a4ea93cef67f144f51787222c9,2025-10-16T20:30:29+00:00,8179d4054615788e7cd1c682dd642bb2d9a02857

The company later tried to connect Messenger and Instagram Direct Messaging into one communication platform, but backed away from the idea in 2023.

8e28f433c8ee,Trump announces plan to expand fertility treatment coverage alongside latest pharma deal,"donald trump, drug prices, health insurance, reproductive health","The Trump administration has struck a deal with EMD Serono to lower drug prices — part of a larger push from the administration to expand coverage and improve affordability for fertility services, officials announced at the White House on Thursday. The administration’s plan has several components, including the drugmaker pledging to lower drug prices, new benefits rules to encourage employers to offer in vitro fertilization coverage outside of health insurance, and an Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher for another fertility drug not currently available in the U.S. EMD Serono is the third such drugmaker that has struck a deal with the president, with announcements from Pfizer and AstraZeneca in recent weeks. EMD Serono has pledged to offer direct-to-consumer sales of its IVF therapies and participate in the TrumpRx purchasing platform in 2026. EMD Serono, the U.S. subsidiary of Germany company Merck, manufactures some of the most commonly -prescribed IVF medications, including Gonal-f to stimulate the ovaries to create eggs, Ovidrel to trigger the eggs to release at a specific time, and Cetrotide to prevent premature ovulation. The new program will make the company’s medications available at an 84% discount compared to list prices, said Libby Horne, senior vice president of U.S. fertility & endocrinology at EMD Serono. Administration officials claimed the deal would result in IVF treatment costs being cut in half. Like deals with other pharma companies, EMD Serono will not face national security tariffs that have been looming over the sector , should the company invest in U.S. manufacturing, but it has not yet made a new commitment. The deal marks the latest move from the administration to lower drug costs through a months-long pressure campaign. But the administration and companies have declined to release the details of their agreements, and experts have been skeptical that the deals before Thursday’s would have a substantial impact on what most Americans pay. But this was a “special deal,” a senior administration official told reporters before the announcement, because it expands access and lowers costs for a high-demand set of treatments. The agreement was also unique because Trump campaigned on expanding access to IVF, calling for universal coverage without specifics of implementation, even as some Republican-led states pursued laws that threatened IVF access by defining life as beginning at conception. More pharma companies, which have been scrambling to make a deal with the administration, could see the announcement as offering a new approach to an agreement: putting popular medications at the center of their deals. One in six people struggle with infertility worldwide, according to the World Health Organization . In vitro fertilization has become the standard procedure for tackling infertility. The treatment involves stimulating the production of eggs, retrieving those eggs, and combining them in a lab dish with sperm to create fertilized embryos. It is an intensive process filled with multiple rounds of medication. The deal also includes pharmacy benefit managers, administration officials said. CVS Specialty’s fertility pharmacy and Express Scripts Freedom Fertility Pharmacy agreed to “materially reduce their expenses” associated with fertility treatments, officials said, adding that the administration has not made any pledges to the PBMs in return. Despite becoming more mainstream, IVF has remained out of reach financially for most families. The cost of a single cycle ranges from $15,000 to $30,000, according to estimates from HHS , and insurers have typically considered the treatment to be “medically unnecessary.” Drugs can make up some $2,000 to $7,000 of the cost, according to GoodRx . Genetic testing and donor eggs can make the process more expensive. Employers are increasingly opting to cover fertility treatments, with 21 states mandating private insurance coverage. But the mandate does not apply to self-insured plans, which includes some 61% of workers . And IVF employer coverage is not mandated in 29 states. Most state Medicaid programs do not cover the service. The administration officials said there were no ongoing conversations to subsidize IVF coverage through employer-sponsored insurance. Instead, their hope is that lower drug prices and an unbundling of fertility treatments from standard health insurance will offer more incentive — and increased flexibility — for employers to add coverage. The changes in coverage rules from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services would also help employees potentially spend less out of pocket, the officials argued. In exchange for leading the way on lowering prices, EMD Serono will receive a priority voucher from the FDA to expedite review of its drug Pergoveris. The drug, like Gonal-f, stimulates the development of egg-producing structures in the ovaries. But it is delivered via fewer injections and might lead to a better patient experience and lower costs, EMD Serono said in a statement. The drug is approved in 74 countries. The FDA announced the Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher program in June, pledging to offer speedy drug reviews to companies that align with the Trump administration’s health priorities. The goal is to offer companies a response on their drug submission within one to two months. EMD Serono is the first recipient. Trump asked employers to offer insurance for IVF going forward, though there is no new requirement to do so. CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz predicted at the announcement that the new policies would mean more babies going forward — “Trump babies,” he said.",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/16/trump-ivf-plan-increase-access-fertility-treatment,Health,Statnews,"Daniel Payne, Lizzy Lawrence",https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241039356-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-16T21:10:05+00:00,11047145259b42eb40b8035c1bfdf6fe755a2d47

Cignetti guided the Hoosiers to a 10-2 record and a surprising College Football Playoff appearance in his first season at the school in 2024. This season, the No. 3 Hoosiers are 6-0 heading into Saturday's game against Michigan State . In a video posted to Indiana's social media accounts , Cignetti said, ""I couldn't be more proud to be a Hoosier, and I plan on retiring as a Hoosier.

Hoosiers athletic director Scott Dolson says Cignetti's new deal shows the school is ""all-in."" ""We didn't come this far to only come this far,"" Dolson told ESPN. ""We're all-in, and going to continue to invest and make certain that we've got our priorities in line. He's Priority 1, and then it's retaining our staff, and it's having the resources to build a roster."" Cignetti, 64, was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year and national coach of the year by several organizations in 2024. The Hoosiers are 17-2 under Cignetti, including an 11-1 record against Big Ten opponents. On Oct. 11, the Hoosiers stunned then-No. 3 Oregon 30-20 on the road . It was Indiana's first victory against a top-five opponent since upsetting then-No. 3 Purdue 19-14 in 1967. The new deal with Cignetti goes through the 2033 regular season. ""At Indiana University, we are committed to performing at the highest levels in everything we do, and no one has exemplified that more than Coach Cignetti,"" Indiana University president Pamela Whitten said in a statement. ""Put simply, Cig is a winner. From last year's College Football Playoff appearance to this year's top-three national ranking, the IU football program's success has been tremendous."" Cignetti, who previously coached at James Madison , Elon and Indiana University of Pennsylvania, was expected to be one of the hottest names on the market before signing an extension with the Hoosiers. Under his previous deal, Cignetti's buyout was set to drop to $10 million on Dec. 1, a number that now climbs to $15 million under the new contract, sources tell ESPN's Pete Thamel, as Indiana looks to eliminate any distractions moving forward in pursuit of their second-consecutive College Football Playoff bid. ""He loves football and he loves his family, and that's his whole life,"" Dolson added. ""So having his family in a place that they're comfortable, if you set aside just the normal football support, but being in an environment that they enjoy, and it's super important, and I feel really good about that."" Utilizing the transfer portal, Cignetti has transformed the once-woebegone Hoosiers into a Big Ten title contender. Indiana had never won 10 games in a season before his arrival in the 127-year history of the program.

Green represents a tremendous success story for the Bucks as an Iowa native who went from undrafted in 2022 to landing a two-way contract, then a standard deal and now a lucrative long-term pact. Green is now under contract through the 2029-30 season in Milwaukee as the Bucks keep him from entering free agency next summer - a critical commitment given that the 26-year-old has emerged as the full-time starter for Doc Rivers entering the new campaign. Green scored 541 points last season after scoring just 406 points in his first two NBA seasons, for an average of 7.4 per game. He is one of the elite shooters in the league as a career 42% 3-point shooter and has shot at least 40% on 3-pointers in all three seasons of his NBA career. Green has only started eight regular-season games in his career, but during the first round of the playoffs in April, Rivers inserted Green into the starting lineup for a must-win Game 5 and Green responded with 19 points and played 46 minutes. His playoff production increased to 11.0 points while shooting 51% from 3 during a strong postseason, which he has followed up with a spot in the starting lineup for all four of the Bucks' preseason games this month.

According to a trademark application, MrBeast is planning to expand into the world of finance There might be eight more years before YouTube superstar MrBeast can officially run for President of the United States, but that doesn’t mean the creator is sitting idle. The YouTube stunt king , also known by his government name Jimmy Donaldson, is toying with plans to open his own financial service, according to a trademark application. Donaldson filed an application with the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office for a service called MrBeast Financial on Oct. 13.  The application description says the new name is for “mobile app and online services for a range of banking , financial advisory, crypto exchange, and other services,” an expansion into finance that matches the creator’s fervor to continually incorporate his brand into every facet of the American business world. According to Business Insider , Donaldson’s company Beast Industries pitched investors the idea of credit cards, loans, and cryptocurrency alongside a creator-focused platform to help others achieve his YouTube success. With 446 million followers on his main YouTube channel alone, Donaldson is the world’s most subscribed YouTuber of all time . Since Donaldson first began posting videos in 2011, he’s gone from a one-off stunt video maker to one of the driving forces in the creator ecosystem — his most viral videos revolving around pushing people to do a range of goofy to borderline-dangerous stunts for life-changing amounts of cold hard cash. In addition to constantly manufacturing attention grabbing videos like “100 Kids Vs. World’s Strongest Man!” “Survive 100 Days In Nuclear Bunker, Win $500,000” and “I Spent 50 Hours Buried Alive,” Donaldson has also expanded into the food world with his burger brand MrBeast Burgers, the chocolate company Feastables, and a lunch kit called Lunchly. “I want to be the biggest YouTube channel ever,” he told Rolling Stone in a 2022 cover story . “Not even for my ego. I don’t know. I just want it. It just gives me something to strive for, to get out of bed and grind for. But it’s also just vanity.” There’s no additional information about when MrBeast Financial will be available for Donaldson’s fans to use — and representatives for Donaldson declined to comment to Rolling Stone — which means MrBeast fans may have more time to wait before they can get their favorite YouTuber to give them a line of credit. But don’t worry, there’s plenty of cash to gaze at on any one of Donaldson’s YouTube channels.

You can already hail a ride in Waymo’s Arizona service area, but this new partnership will give the company's cars something to do when they're not transporting human cargo. To start, Waymo says that deliveries will be limited to things you can order through DashMart, DoorDash's storefront for convenience and grocery stores. Eventually, though, deliveries will ""include more local Phoenix merchants and a wider variety of offerings."" In order to try out a Waymo delivery, you'll have to place your order through DoorDash and ""opt in to autonomous delivery"" during checkout. Once Waymo's car arrives, much like DoorDash's Dot robot , you'll then have to physically leave your home and collect your order from the car's trunk to complete the delivery. Part of the convenience (and complication) of DoorDash is getting what you ordered brought to your door. A Waymo delivery might turn some people off, since it makes that option impossible. Of course, this isn't the first time Waymo has delivered food in Phoenix. In 2024 the company partnered with Uber Eats for a similar program, with similar limitations around how deliveries were completed and where food could be ordered from. Waymo runs its own robotaxi service in Arizona, Waymo One, but depending on the region, it's also offered rides through third-party partners like Uber. Its partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash seem like variations on the same idea. In 2020, Waymo was exploring using self-driving long-haul trucks for deliveries. The company abandoned those plans in 2023 to prioritize robotaxis and the Waymo Driver software, but these tests with DoorDash and Uber Eats could be a signal that Waymo is interested in pursuing deliveries on a smaller scale.",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-will-also-drive-for-doordash-in-phoenix-213535127.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Fi07Sf0iTtJNKvo_j1769w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/4ad51979f8e4149b204d11f51ba738ea,2025-10-16T21:35:35+00:00,dff773628033e8a1d878beb78a18c16bfc4d5071
cddec2c3983c,The Crew 2 is now playable offline,"offline mode, online game, crew credits, driving game, hybrid mode, multiplayer content","The Crew 2 was updated today to include Hybrid Mode , adding an offline mode to the driving game. Online and offline modes are separate saves, so if you snag a sweet ride while playing offline, it won't be available the next time you join an online session. Players will have the option to re-export their online save to the offline one, but it will overwrite and erase all offline-only progress. Multiplayer content, user-generated content, LIVE Summits and Crew Credits purchases will not be available in the offline mode. It's a bare-bones option, but the addition of offline mode is a welcome move from Ubisoft. The company's decision to delete The Crew from players' libraries after servers for the online game shut down sparked some big debates about ownership and preservation. One of the notable voices emerging from that conversation was the Stop Killing Games movement, which is pushing for EU legislation to ensure access to games even after their devs stop supporting a project. Having a way to continue accessing The Crew 2 even if (or more likely when) the game loses online support was something the developer had promised, so it's nice to have Ubisoft follow through. ""Whether you're looking to preserve your progression for the future or simply enjoy the freedom of playing without a connection, Hybrid Mode ensures The Crew 2 remains accessible for years to come,"" the company said in the blog post.",https://www.engadget.com/the-crew-2-is-now-playable-offline-211629508.html,Technology,Engadget,,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iMBDft1s_lkB7XywNbNDdQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MjY-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/videos/user-uploaded/The_Crew_2_hybrid_mode.jpg,2025-10-16T21:16:29+00:00,a4fea6f865ad51af6851f156543cab9bef712351
91eebb03e2a5,"Packers' Micah Parsons rants on one-sided officiating, tush push",,"GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Micah Parsons hates the tush push, thinks offensive players get away with holding far too often and had to change his facemask during the last game because he got poked in an eye and popped a blood vessel on a play that didn't draw a penalty. And the Green Bay Packers defensive end said it all knowing that it could back to haunt him -- both when his team plays the Philadelphia Eagles next month and when the NFL hears his comments. Though Parsons said Thursday that he doesn't think the NFL will do anything about the situation, Packers coach Matt LaFleur said he plans to at least talk to the officials before Sunday's game at the Arizona Cardinals about what he perceives as missed holding calls. ""That's definitely a conversation pregame,"" LaFleur said. LaFleur said earlier in the week that he believes Parsons is ""frustrated by it, and there are some that are egregious, and I think those need to be called."" It doesn't sound as if Parsons believes much will change. ""Naw, I don't think it matters,"" Parsons said. ""The refs are going to call what they call. All we can do is just hope we get called a fair game. I don't care what the fans want sometimes. If your team holds, they should get better tackles, better guards. S---, don't blame that on us."" According to ESPN Research, Green Bay has had only six holding penalties called on its opponents this season, tied for the third fewest in the league (although the Packers have already had their bye and have played one fewer game than all but five other teams). ""Like, five years of not getting a call, you eventually stop worrying about it,"" Parsons said. ""I think I've just got to keep going. That's the hunt, yeah. That's part of the challenges. You've got to keep going. And that's bothersome. That worries them. They know that. ""That's the part of being one of the best. That comes with some territory, parts that you hate and the parts that the league lets go. They know you can tell how they call the games. They don't call offsides for offense, but they'll call it on defense. They won't call offensive pass interference, but they'll call defensive pass interference. We know what they're trying to do. They want to load the points up so fans can be happy. They'll call defensive holding, but they won't call offensive holding. Let's just wake up."" Parsons leads the NFL with 4.6 pressures per game, according to ESPN Research. He was credited with five pressures Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals but did not record a quarterback hit for the only time this season. Parsons also said there's a double standard when it comes to player safety. He said that when he got poked in an eye by a Bengals player and popped a blood vessel, there was no call for illegal hands to the face. He said he changed to a more protective facemask during the game. ""If you're going to say it's about protecting players, then protect all players,"" Parsons said. ""Don't just protect one side of the ball. Like, I don't mind guys chipping from the outside, but running backs want to come and [hit] players while we're engaged with offensive linemen, that's complete bulls---. That's not good football. That's not safe football. ""You want to fine guys for putting their head down [and leading with the helmet], but you can be engaged with an offensive tackle and a guard can put his head right into your head. What are we talking about here? Look at how many times that's on film, guys putting their head down and trying to come clean your clock. But you can't do that to offensive players. S---. You'll get a $50,000 fine. I might get a fine for this [news] conference."" Those weren't Parsons' only comments that might get some attention. Parsons posted on social media his disdain for the Eagles' tush push play after they ran it four straight times in last week's game against the New York Giants . The Eagles have lost two straight games after starting 4-0, and despite their success with the tush push, they have scored just 17 points in each of their past two games. ""S---, if you ask the Eagles' offensive players, they'll probably say, 'That's the best thing we're doing on offense right now,'"" Parsons said. ""It's the most consistent thing they've got. That might come [back] and bite me one day.""

532a56ce875e,MLB,,"Oct 16, 2025, 05:21 PM ET PHILADELPHIA -- Bryce Harper turned 33 on Thursday, and the celebration for the new father of four just might not stretch very far inside the Philadelphia Phillies ' front office. After a season in which Harper's .844 OPS was his lowest since 2016 and his .261 average was his worst since 2019, Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski analyzed whether Harper - a two-time NL MVP - can return to form as one of baseball's best players with six years left on his 13-year, $330 million deal. ""He's still a quality player. He's still an All-Star caliber player,"" Dombrowski said Thursday as he broke down the season. ""He didn't have an elite season like he's had in the past. I guess we only find out if he becomes elite or he continues to be good."" Just good? That has to sting for a player such as Harper who helped carried the Phillies out of baseball irrelevancy and into the playoffs for the first time in 11 years in 2022. Yes, Harper missed a month of the season as he recovered from a wrist injury, but the numbers did show an overall dip in production. Against the Dodgers in the NL Division Series, Harper was just 3-for-15 batting with no RBI in the four-game loss. ""Can he rise to the next level again? I don't really know that answer,"" Dombrowski said. ""He's the one that will dictate that more than anything else. I don't think he's content with the year that he had. Again, it wasn't a bad year. But when I think of Bryce Harper, you think elite, you think of one of the top-10 players in baseball and I don't think it fit into that category."" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Harper - who made a Gold Glove-caliber move from right field to first base and made the fastest return to the majors following Tommy John surgery of any player in big league history - may not have had the kind of success he was accustomed to over his 14-year career. It just didn't mean Harper's best years were behind him. ""I think he's highly motivated to have the best season of his career next year,"" Thomson said. Harper will certainly return next season as the Phillies try and figure out how to snap out of a four-year postseason malaise that has yet to win them a World Series. While Dombrowski has heavy decisions to make about a roster with several key free agents, he's not necessarily feeling the heat to shake-up the team. ""Need to be more change? We won 96 games,"" Dombrowski said. The Phillies' hitting woes each October could be settled if Harper can rediscover that sweet left-handed stroke that once made him one of baseball's most feared hitters. ""What I'd like to see is just him be himself, try not to do too much,"" Thomson said. ""Really focus on hitting the ball the other way. When he stays on the ball, he is such a great hitter. I think he just gets in the mindset that he tries to do a little too much because he knows that he's Bryce Harper."" Who's staying Thomson will return for his fifth season and Dombrowski said the Phillies would likely work on a one-year extension beyond the 2026 season. Thomson has one year left on his deal. The entire coaching staff - including embattled hitting coach Kevin Long - will return, though the Phillies are looking for a new bench coach. Mike Calitri will become a major league field coordinator, and the Phillies would like to add someone with managerial experience to take his place. The Phillies have increased their win total each of the last four years (87-90-95-96) while their postseason runs have gotten worse: losing in the 2022 World Series, the 2023 NLCS and consecutive series losses in the NLDS. Dombrowski said the organization needed to ""keep it in perspective"" that the Phillies lost to a Dodgers team that could be steamrolling toward a second straight World Series title. ""I don't think you just break up clubs,"" because they lose again in the playoffs, Dombrowski said. NL home run and RBI champion Kyle Schwarber , veteran catcher J.T. Realmuto and rotation stalwart Ranger Suarez are all free agents. Outfielder Harrison Bader , who raised his value with a dynamite two months with the Phillies, has a mutual option he is sure to decline. ""We love to have them all,"" Dombrowski said. ""It's probably impractical we're going to have all four of them back."" The Phillies hold a $9 million club option or a $500,000 buyout on left-handed reliver Jose Alvarado , whose season was interrupted by an 80-game suspension for violating baseball's performance-enhancing drugs policy. Dombrowski said the Phillies could decline the option and work out a new deal with Alvarado. ""I'd be surprised, without making any announcements, that Alvarado's not back with us,"" Dombrowski said. Dombrowski said Zack Wheeler could be ready to return to the major leagues after May following surgery and complications from a blood clot. The Phillies' ace, Wheeler is set to begin his rehabilitation next week. The 35-year-old Wheeler went 10-5 with a 2.71 ERA and led the majors with 195 strikeouts when he was sidelined in August. No matter how the roster looks in 20206, how do the Phillies - with owner John Middleton supporting a $291.7 million payroll - snap out of the same October pattern of frigid bats from their highest-priced players that doomed them again against the Dodgers? ""We have a very substantial big league payroll and I don't see that that's going to change,"" Dombrowski said. ""John is very supportive of that. We have a good club with a lot of good players. But you don't have unlimited (funds). I read some places where how they get better is they sign this guy, they sign that guy. I don't think we're going to have a $400 million payroll. I just don't think that's a practicality."" The Phillies will also need to figure out what to do with right fielder Nick Castellanos - who has one year left on the five-year, $100 million deal signed ahead of the 2022 season - seemed unhappy and cited personal issues with Thomson after losing his starting job late in the season? Dombrowski said he became involved and settled the issue. There was no firm commitment Castellanos would return. Outfielder Max Kepler will not return after he hit just .216 in his lone season on a one-year, $10 million deal. Reliever Dave Robertson also will not return. Meanwhile, the team continues to support Orion Kerkering , who made a wild throw past home instead of tossing to first that cost the Phillies Game 4 and the series . The only highlight replayed as much in Philadelphia than Kerkering's errant decision was the sight of Thomson and many of his teammates consoling him in the dugout. ""He will get whatever assistance, and we will offer him whatever assistance that he needs,"" Dombrowski said. ""We'll continue to work with him to try and get him through that. I think he can do that, but I also know it's a challenge for him and we'll keep in contact with him on a continued basis."" Reliever Matt Strahm raised some eyebrows after the Phillies were eliminated on Kerkering's error when he said there wasn't routine pitchers' fielding practice. ""The only thing I can think of is, if you don't routinely practice it, how do you expect to make it happen every time? As an older guy in the bullpen, I guess I should have taken it upon myself to make sure we're doing our (pitchers' fielding practice),"" Strahm told The Athletic. Dombrowski, however, took issue with Strahm's assessment. ""We did plenty. Actually, as it turns out, we did do PFPs in the postseason. (Strahm) didn't do them. But we did them,"" he said.

04d2bb2532ca,NFL,,"FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl wide receiver CeeDee Lamb said he is ready to return to the lineup Sunday against the Washington Commanders after missing the last three games with a high left ankle sprain. Lamb went through a limited practice for the second straight day Thursday, but he said it won't take him long to get back up to speed. ""I feel like I'm moving around, running around, being me,"" Lamb said. ""Happy as can be obviously just believing in my ankle. Obviously, I feel like it's back to where I needed it to be."" Lamb said he could have returned last weekend against the Carolina Panthers , but the extra week gave him more confidence. ""I feel like that's why we took an extra week just to make sure that I had that comfort,"" he said. ""Just to make sure that I had that same explosiveness, just to make sure that I had that same stability."" Lamb suffered the injury in the first half of a Week 3 loss to the Chicago Bears . Without him, the Cowboys have maintained a high-scoring offense with quarterback Dak Prescott (10 touchdown passes, no interception) and wide receiver George Pickens (two 100-yard games, four touchdowns). ""A lot of excitement,"" Prescott said of Lamb's return. ""Just the last two days of practice, he looks good. He's ready to go. Obviously, I saw him last weekend during rehab and he probably could've went then. Being careful. But he's ready to go. Looks great. It's going to be fun."" Lamb had two 100-yard outings to open the season before getting hurt. With 51 scrimmage yards against the Commanders, Lamb would reach 7,000 yards for his career, reaching that mark in 85 games, which would be the quickest in team history. Lamb also has a streak of three straight 100-catch, 1,000-yard seasons. ""That's not why I'm hungry,"" Lamb said. ""Why I'm hungry is me missing time and doing what I love and playing with the guys that I love and breaking the huddle and being able to just go out there and be me."" The pairing of Lamb and Pickens, who has a touchdown catch in five straight games, could take the offense to a different level. In Lamb's absence, the Cowboys moved Pickens throughout the formation. Now they can move both to create mismatches. ""I think if CeeDee doesn't get hurt, GP's probably just going to be an outside receiver for the most part,"" Prescott said. ""Having him move around, him having those games, showing his ability, showing what he can do, showing not only how he relishes (it) with him getting more opportunities, but him asking more responsibility, you're going to have to figure out where both of them are (now) ... Having the ability to have two guys like that and just put them wherever we feel each and every play, it's only going to be beneficial to us.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46618807/ceedee-lamb-happy-ankle-ready-return-cowboys,Sport,Espn,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0816%2Fr1532529_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,568ccbd68dc62032cb63e25020b1257948945d3d
d48caf9cf58d,NBA,,"DETROIT -- Pistons guard Jaden Ivey 's long-awaited return hit a snag as he will miss the next four weeks following right knee surgery, the team announced Thursday. Ivey missed the last 49 games last season after a left fibula injury, and played one preseason game before issues of discomfort arose. Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said it wasn't a particular play that birthed the injury. ""It was something that was developing over his work. Obviously, from coming back but in training camp also, he started to feel something."" Bickerstaff said before the Pistons' final preseason game against the Washington Wizards . ""We took precautions, and then the medical team did their assessments and those things, and then had to make the decision that ultimately led us to where we are today."" Ivey, the fifth pick in the 2022 draft, was in the midst of a breakout season last year before colliding with Magic guard Cole Anthony on New Year's Day. He was averaging 17.6 points and shooting 41 percent from 3-point range, both career highs. The Pistons acquired veteran guard Dennis Schroder to play backup point guard in the wake of Ivey's injury last season. Bickerstaff believes guards Marcus Sasser and two-way guard Daniss Jenkins can fill in the blanks during this absence. Third-year forward Ausar Thompson has been given more responsibility in training camp to be a primary facilitator when All-NBA guard Cade Cunningham goes to the bench. As for Ivey, it could be 10 months before he sees regular-season action again, and he's up for a rookie-scale extension should the team and he agree on a contract before the Oct. 20 deadline. The Pistons will be careful with his recovery given the back-to-back injuries to one of the league's fastest players. ""Our priority is to do what's right by our guys, and never put them in a position where we feel like we have to rush them back,"" Bickerstaff said.

Today, Reddit Answers is in the spotlight after a moderator flagged the AI tool for providing dangerous medical advice that they were unable to disable or hide from view. The mod saw Reddit Answers suggest that people experiencing chronic pain stop taking their current prescriptions and take high-dose kratom, which is an unregulated substance that is illegal in some states. The user said they then asked Reddit Answers about other medical questions. They received potentially dangerous advice for treating neo-natal fever alongside some accurate actions as well as suggestions that heroin could be used for chronic pain relief. Several other mods, particularly from health-focused subreddits, replied to the original post adding their concerns that they have no way to turn off or flag a problem when Reddit Answers has provided inaccurate or dangerous information in their communities. A representative from Reddit told 404 Media that Reddit Answers had been updated to address some of the mods' concerns. ""This update ensures that ‘Related Answers’ to sensitive topics, which may have been previously visible on the post detail page (also known as the conversation page), will no longer be displayed,"" the spokesperson told the publication. ""This change has been implemented to enhance user experience and maintain appropriate content visibility within the platform."" We've reached out to Reddit for additional comment about what topics are being excluded but have not received a reply at this time. While the rep told 404 Media that Reddit Answers ""excludes content from private, quarantined and NSFW communities, as well as some mature topics,"" the AI tool clearly doesn't seem equipped to properly deliver medical information, much less to handle the snark, sarcasm or potential bad advice that may be given by other Redditors.

Kamara said Thursday that he wants to stay in New Orleans. Kamara was asked about an NFL Network report that said Saints general manager Mickey Loomis approached him after he received interest from other teams. The report said Loomis asked Kamara if there was anywhere he would like to go. ""Yeah, I don't know where that [came from]. We talked about it [the report] and we was looking at each other like the little Spiderman meme: 'Did you say something? Did I say something?' I don't know where that came from, but I think I've been vocal enough that ... I don't want to go anywhere,"" Kamara said. ""And I said it countless times, y'all know that. I think everybody knows that. The fanbase knows that. And at the end of the day, it's business. So I don't go upstairs, and I don't have an office upstairs. I got an office in Charlotte at NASCAR, but I don't got an office upstairs, so I don't really sit in those meetings, and I don't really know what happens up there."" What would happen if the team did approach him about a trade? ""I just got to keep my head down,"" Kamara said. ""And I don't know, if I was a GM, I guess I would go to the player and be like, 'Hey, we're trading you. Just so you know.' So, if Mickey come downstairs and says that, then I'm going to go drink a pina colada somewhere."" Kamara had a similar refrain last summer when he was seeking a new contract from the team and said he would like to be a Saint through the end of his career. Kamara has been with the Saints since they selected him in the third round of the 2017 draft, a season in which he earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Honors. ""I want to be a Saint for a long time, for as long as my career goes,"" Kamara said at the time . That's all I'm looking for really,"" Kamara said at the time. Kamara signed an extension midway through last season that will keep him in New Orleans through the 2026 season and $3 million of his base salary is guaranteed for 2026. Kamara turned 30 in July. Kamara said he doesn't know what teams he's been linked to or who needs a running back but is used to the speculation. ""I mean it's been like that for years and it just is what it is. I'm just focused on what I'm doing. I don't really think about it too much,"" Kamara said. Saints wide receiver Chris Olave , who has also been part of potential trade speculation, acknowledged that he knew about the chatter and chalked it up to being a natural part of the conversation that surrounds the team's 1-5 record. ""That's part of the business, man,"" Olave said. ""It's been like that all year, in the offseason. Even right now, I ain't really been on social media, but I know it's cooking right now that we're 1-5. So, there's always rumors, the internet trying to always create some buzz. But I had a conversation with the people in the building so I'm very confident."" Olave did not elaborate on who he spoke to in the building, saying he'd prefer to keep that private. ""It is all over the internet, so they just talked to me and told me what was going on,"" Olave said. ""I keep that between me and [them]."" Kamara, who has been dealing with an ankle injury for the last few weeks, did not practice Wednesday but returned to practice on Thursday as part of a maintenance program while he heals. He has started all six games and has carried the ball 83 times for 314 yards and a touchdown this season. Olave, who was limited in practice on Wednesday with a hip injury, has 39 catches for 342 yard and a touchdown this season.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46618812/saints-alvin-kamara-chris-olave-address-trade-rumors,Sport,Espn,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1016%2Fr1561274_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e208357dfbeae4a35cee7323b0ea2b6702bf8adf

add57aff07cc,49ers' George Kittle says he plans to return Sunday vs. Falcons,,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- While San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle just opened his practice window this week and has a full 21 days to return from his hamstring injury before a decision must be made, he made his plans for Sunday night against the Atlanta Falcons clear on Thursday afternoon. ""I fully plan on playing on Sunday,"" Kittle said. ""As long as [coach] Kyle [Shanahan] lets me. It's up to him. But hopefully I'm out there. Which I think I will be."" The 49ers have been without their star tight end since early in the Sept. 7 season opener against the Seattle Seahawks . After 22 snaps, Kittle injured his right hamstring while running a deep route down the right sideline with 10:06 left in the second quarter. Kittle, speaking to the media Thursday for the first time since the injury, said he knew something was wrong immediately and that the injury was actually a ""full tear"" of his hamstring. ""I just felt like a rubber band snapped in my hamstring,"" Kittle said. ""I was like, 'Ah, I've just got to go to the locker room after that one.'"" According to Kittle, he got a bit lucky with where the tear in his hamstring was, as it did not completely tear away from the bone. Because of that, Kittle's recovery time was significantly less than the three to six months it can take for a more severe tear to heal. Still, Kittle has been not so patiently waiting to return to the field after missing the past five games as the Niners have managed to jump out to a 4-2 start. The five contests Kittle has missed are the second most he has missed in a season, trailing 2020, when he missed eight games because of knee and foot injuries. Based on league rules that require players on injured reserve to miss at least four games, Kittle technically could have returned for last week's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . But Kittle said Thursday he wanted to be sure he wasn't rushing back because he didn't want to make the injury worse. ""I have been so very excited to play football since last season ended, and being only able to play 20-something snaps has been very difficult for me,"" Kittle said. ""I've been trying my best to get back as fast as I can without being an idiot and rushing it."" Kittle was listed as a limited participant in practice Wednesday and Thursday, though he noted after Thursday's session that he feels ""really good"" and ""today felt better than yesterday."" A potential Kittle return has created plenty of excitement among his teammates, many of whom have said they feed off his enthusiasm in addition to how productive he is on the field. ""George is awesome,"" quarterback Mac Jones said. ""He's just great energy in the huddle and he's just George. ... He's not going to change whether it's practice or game day, so you know what you're going to get. I'm excited to see where he's at."" If the 49ers activate Kittle for Sunday against the Falcons, they will need to make a corresponding roster move. Linebacker Fred Warner is slated to go on injured reserve with a dislocated and fractured right ankle. One other big question facing the Niners as Kittle works toward a return: Who will be throwing him the ball? Things seem to be trending toward Jones getting another start Sunday night as starter Brock Purdy continues recovering from a toe injury. Purdy was again limited in Thursday's practice, with Jones, who has been battling knee and oblique injuries, upgraded from a limited participant Wednesday to a full participant Thursday. ""[I] definitely felt like I need to practice regardless of how it felt,"" Jones said. ""Get the timing and everything down, so we feel good about it during the game."" Jones wasn't the only Niner trending positively on Thursday's injury report. Defensive tackles Kalia Davis (hand), CJ West (thumb) and Kevin Givens (pectoral) were also bumped up from limited to full participation. Right guard Dominick Puni (knee) and receiver Skyy Moore (ankle) also returned to practice on a limited basis after missing Wednesday. Wide receivers Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (calf) did not participate, with Valdes-Scantling a new addition from Wednesday.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46619843/49ers-george-kittle-says-plans-return-sunday-vs-falcons,Sport,Espn,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0908%2Fr1542890_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,8ba2857f35a35ec7992f43afa366588df2f58f74

e469dcd11fee,NFL,,"EAGAN, Minn. -- If football doesn't work out for Justin Jefferson , he might want to give acting a try. The Minnesota Vikings wide receiver was the star of a 30-minute edition of Eli Manning's ""The Undercovers,"" airing on Amazon Prime Video, that was released this week. Amazon posted a three-minute excerpt Thursday, featuring Jefferson -- disguised as a veteran photographer -- pranking Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. Jefferson introduced himself as ""Darius Frost,"" using a high-pitched voice. He wore a fishing hat that covered his signature braids and asked a series of Minnesota trivia questions to string along Adofo-Mensah for an extended photo shoot. Jefferson told local reporters Thursday that he was surprised Adofo-Mensah didn't recognize him until the end of the shoot, which was filmed this summer. In the video, Jefferson intentionally mispronounced ""Kwesi"" and asked him for a $140 million contract -- the same value as the deal Jefferson signed in 2024. ""Shout out to Kwesi,"" Jefferson said Thursday. ""Just going along with it. I mean, he definitely didn't know who I was or what was going on during the time, so we got him definitely good. I appreciate him for being a part of it."" In the full show, the Vikings also gathered three assistant coaches -- offensive coordinator Wes Phillips, receivers coach Keenan McCardell and assistant receivers coach Tony Sorrentino -- for a photo shoot. After Jefferson asked them to make ""silly"" faces and move closer together, Sorrentino recognized him. Later in the episode, Jefferson traveled to a flag football tournament in St. Paul to shoot photos from the sideline. He asked several confused onlookers if they knew that the Minnesota state bird is the ""common loon,"" and approached others to take ""portraits."" Finally, he asked a group of organizers if he could play. While still in character, Jefferson ran routes and made catches that few people in the world could emulate. Eventually, the players realized whom they were up against. Jefferson thanked them for allowing him to feel ""normal"" for a bit. ""Just with this job comes ... a lot of things that I'm not really able to do anymore,"" he said Thursday. ""So, it was good to be in the mix of everything and people not noticing who I am, asking for pictures and autographs and just really just letting me be. I definitely didn't feel like that in a very long time. So it was cool being a part of that.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46618921/justin-jefferson-minnesota-vikings-prank-general-manager-kwesi-adofo-mensah,Sport,Espn,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1016%2Fr1561278_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,34dfebccddd39f480eefaf706960246f0d8a8ccc
