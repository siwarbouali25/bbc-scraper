5b3062cc6487,Israelis and Palestinians Await Hostage-Prisoner Swap With Relief and Elation,"israel gaza war, palestinians, kidnapping and hostages, israel katz, benjamin netanyahu, abdel fattah el-sisi, donald trump, hamas, egypt, gaza city, gaza strip, israel, jerusalem, sharm el sheikh, internal-open-access-from-nl","Israelis and Palestinians prepared on Sunday for an exchange of all of the living hostages still held in Gaza for about 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, the cornerstone of a new cease-fire agreement. The Israeli government said the exchange was expected to begin on Monday morning local time, but Israel was prepared for it to happen even sooner. Under the agreement, Israel is supposed to free the Palestinian prisoners — scores of them serving life terms for deadly attacks on Israelis — in parallel with the hostage releases. “This is a historic event that blends sorrow over the release of murderers and joy over the return of hostages,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a recorded statement broadcast on Sunday evening. On both sides, there was relief mixed with elation after two devastating years of war. Adding to the hope: The open-ended truce between Israel and Hamas, which was brokered by the United States and Arab mediators and began at noon on Friday, appeared to be holding over the weekend. As part of the first phase of the cease-fire deal , Israeli forces have withdrawn to a new defensive line inside Gaza. The war created a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the deal provides a pathway for desperately needed food, medicine and other supplies, which are starting to flow in. On Sunday, efforts appeared to be underway to increase aid deliveries, with dozens of trucks crossing the border from Egypt, according to news footage. The number of trucks entering Gaza is supposed to double under the cease-fire, to about 600 per day. The United Nations World Food Program said on Saturday that it had begun scaling up its operations in Gaza and that in the coming weeks it planned to increase the number of bakeries it supports to 30 from 10. The war in Gaza killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Most of the two million residents of Gaza were displaced multiple times. With the cease-fire signed, thousands of displaced Palestinian residents have headed back to Gaza City in the north of the territory over the past days. President Trump left the United States on Sunday and land in Israel on Monday for a short visit. He is set to meet with the families of hostages and address the Israeli Knesset, or Parliament, in Jerusalem. He then is scheduled to fly to Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea, where he and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt will lead a summit with other Arab partners who supported the deal. World leaders have also been invited to attend. Unveiling the cease-fire plan late last month, Mr. Trump described the occasion as “potentially one of the great days ever in civilization.” His celebratory declarations about bringing peace to the Middle East may be premature, however. Mr. Netanyahu struck a more sober tone in his own statement on Sunday, speaking in Hebrew to his domestic audience. “Everywhere we fought, we won,” he said. “But in the same breath, I must tell you: The campaign is not over,” Mr. Netanyahu cautioned. “There are still very great security challenges ahead of us. Some of our enemies are trying to rebuild themselves to attack us again. And as we say, ‘We’re on it.’” Analysts say the Gaza cease-fire deal lacks details and leaves many critical questions unanswered, including whether Hamas will be disarmed and stripped of its power in Gaza and how the territory will be governed after the war. Mr. Trump’s road map for ending the war envisions Hamas laying down its weapons and the demilitarization of Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu has long insisted on those steps as conditions for ending the war in Gaza. But Hamas officials have expressed deep reservations about both steps. It is also unclear which, if any, countries were planning to send troops to join an international stabilization force that Mr. Trump had suggested would handle security in postwar Gaza. Adding to the confusion, Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, issued a statement on Sunday saying that the greatest challenge for his country after the hostages’ release would be “the destruction of all of Hamas’s terror tunnels in Gaza.” Mr. Katz said that mission would be carried out directly by Israeli military forces “and by means of the international mechanism that will be established under the leadership and supervision of the United States.” Destroying the tunnels would be the main expression of the demilitarization of Gaza and the dismantling Hamas’s weapons, Mr. Katz said. He said he had “instructed the Israeli military to prepare to carry out the mission.” But Israeli forces have now withdrawn from Gaza City, where much of the Hamas military infrastructure remains intact, according to Israeli leaders, who only recently described the city as one of the militant group’s last bastions. Israeli forces had been taking over the core of Gaza City in a new phase of their campaign aimed at destroying Hamas’s military and governing abilities when the deal stopped them in their tracks. Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli forces cannot return to areas from which they have withdrawn as long as Hamas is seen as complying with the deal. Asked about Mr. Katz’s statement, an Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under army rules, said there were different ways to deal with the demilitarization of Gaza and disarming Hamas. He said that Israeli forces could still operate east of their new line within Gaza, in areas they control, and that the international mechanism was still to be determined. But one commentator warned Israel may have less freedom to resume fighting this time around. “Israel is mistaken in thinking that it will be able to afford either to return to war or to maintain a Lebanese model of frequent attacks,” Yoav Limor, a commentator on military affairs for Israel Hayom, a right-wing daily, wrote Sunday. He was referring to Israel’s frequent military strikes against targets in Lebanon despite a cease-fire reached almost a year ago that was meant to end its war with Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militia. “That will never be tolerated, and judging by Trump’s recent statements, he, too, is determined to move on and has no interest in getting sucked back into Gaza’s problems,” Mr. Limor said. Hamas set off the war in Gaza by leading an attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians. It was the deadliest day in the country’s history. Roughly 250 other people were abducted. Scores of hostages were released during two past, temporary cease-fires, and a handful were rescued in military operations. The Israeli government says that 20 hostages are now expected to be freed, and the remains of 26 who died in captivity are to be returned. The condition of two other captives has not been confirmed.

ad0e17a12e8e,"Why Now? The Lost Chances to Reach a Hostage Deal, and a Cease-Fire, Months Ago","us politics, israel gaza war, war;armed conflicts, peace process, palestinians, hamas, donald trump, benjamin netanyahu, joe biden, steven witkoff, israel, gaza strip, internal-open-access-from-nl","Why now? Why did it take 736 days? That was the question coursing through the celebrations on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday night, as hundreds of thousands of people poured into Hostage Square. They were anticipating the release early Monday of the 20 hostages believed still alive and the possible end of a brutal war that left Gaza destroyed, and Israel at once stronger and more diplomatically isolated than ever. Holding up photos of the remaining hostages, the crowds cheered on Saturday evening at the mention of President Trump, who many Israelis believe forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize this moment. They listened intently to Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, address the cheering throngs. But overarching the moment was the question of whether this deal could have been done far sooner, when more hostages may have been alive, and before tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed. That argument lay behind the boos that ran through the crowd when Mr. Witkoff mentioned Mr. Netanyahu. Hearing the reaction, Mr. Witkoff tried to defend Mr. Netanyahu, insisting that “I was in the trenches with the prime minister” and saw how he was seeking “a safer, stronger future for the Jewish people.” That was met with more booing. Historians may argue for years whether the Israel-Hamas war could have ended a year ago this week, when Israeli forces tripped upon and killed Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. Or, alternatively, whether Israel and Hamas missed a chance to build on the cease-fire that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his aides left in place before Mr. Trump took over. Despite the fact that Mr. Witkoff was involved in the January deal, it did not stick, and early in Mr. Trump’s term the war resumed, bringing with it more death and suffering. Debates over how wars could have ended sooner, and saved thousands or millions of lives, are hardly new. Historians are still arguing over whether Japan would have surrendered anyway if President Harry S. Truman had decided against dropping two atomic weapons; whether President Richard M. Nixon waited years too long to get out of Vietnam. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump argued for an earlier exit from Afghanistan. “This is a different moment — we didn’t have then what President Trump has now,” Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden’s secretary of state, said in a telephone interview over the weekend. “Hamas is defeated as a military organization, isolated diplomatically, it’s lost its patrons — Iran, Hezbollah and the Houthis — and it has alienated the people of Gaza.” He added: “Israel long ago achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas’s capacity to repeat Oct. 7 and killing the leaders responsible — at great cost to Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire. The Israeli people want the remaining hostages home and the war to end.” Here is a look at some of the explanations for why the hostage release — and perhaps a new start for Gaza — is happening now. Feints, Bluffs and an Election Two years ago this week, after the Oct. 7 attack, Mr. Biden traveled to Israel to show his solidarity. But he also issued a warning — strongly in private, his aides reported later, and more gently in public — that there was a risk to overreaction. “Justice must be done,” Mr. Biden said on his one-day visit on Oct. 18, 2023. “But I caution that, while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.” Mr. Biden was reacting to the fact that Israel had already cut off virtually all food and fuel to Gaza. For a while, the United States kept the pressure off the Israelis, even vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution to keep humanitarian corridors open to allow the flow of food and civilians. Mr. Biden would need time, American officials maintained, to quietly negotiate a deal. But neither side was ready. Hamas spent the summer of 2024 arguing over how far Israeli forces would have to pull back along the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip along the border between Gaza and Egypt. “The blame is on Hamas, because it could have been done all these steps earlier, but they refused to discuss disarmament or relinquishing control,” said Amos Yadlin, a former head of military intelligence for Israel who runs MIND Israel, a strategic consulting company. “But it is also on Netanyahu, because it wasn’t until last summer that he was even willing to lay out demands for ending the war.” Then Mr. Trump won the presidency back, and the Biden administration was determined to get a cease-fire in place by January, before it left office. It drafted a peace plan, much of which was quite similar to the “20 point plan” Mr. Trump recently issued. There was slow progress: More than 130 hostages had been released by the time the January cease-fire took place. “We handed over a cease-fire that silenced the guns, had hostages coming out and aid going in, along with a day-after plan to make it permanent,” Mr. Blinken said. But when the new administration took over, “the moment was squandered,” he added. “Israel and Hamas went back to war for eight months.” Israeli officials tell a different story. Mr. Biden was a lame duck, they noted, and disengaged. Trump was a known entity, less likely to lecture Mr. Netanyahu in private or public. They put their money on a new president, and a new negotiating team. A Changed Battlefield in 2025 Much changed in Israel’s favor in the new year. Mr. Sinwar’s death sent Hamas into a leadership crisis. Israel’s military pressure grew as Hamas’ supply of ammunition was depleted. And “the 12-day war with Iran really moved the needle,” said Brett McGurk, who had negotiated in the region since the Bush administration and was running the talks for Mr. Biden. Suddenly, Hamas realized that the country that had both bankrolled and supplied it could no longer be relied upon. Multiple factors, Palestinian analysts say, pushed Hamas to begin rethinking the value of continuing to hold the hostages. “In the beginning, Hamas thought taking the hostages would deter the Israeli government from waging a big war,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian professor of political science in Egypt, who fled Gaza early in the war. Now, the logic of holding hostages may have flipped: Rather than protect Gaza from attack, several analysts have noted, their existence was giving Mr. Netanyahu an excuse to press ahead. “If Hamas said no, the war would have gone on — the bloodshed, the destruction and the killing would have gone on and on,” Mr. Abusada said. “So Hamas decided: Let’s just accept this offer and believe the guarantees that the war will not return.” The Trump Factor Mr. Trump famously has little time or patience for traditional diplomacy. If the State Department’s approach to cease-fires and peace negotiations is to labor over maps and work through diplomatic channels, defining boundaries and anticipating loopholes, Mr. Trump negotiates the way he struck real estate deals in New York: in broad concepts, leaving the details to others . Administration officials say the result suggests that this should be Mr. Trump’s model for the future. “He pursued a very nontraditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it,” Vice President JD Vance said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “And, of course, the president was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it.” Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Netanyahu largely benefited from a changed tone. Mr. Trump has hosted him at the White House four times, more than any other world leader. He has called for the cancellation of the prime minister’s corruption trial, he has opposed calls for the recognition of a Palestinian state, and he has ordered U.S. forces to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. On Gaza, the president put few, if any, guardrails on Israel’s offensive, bucking international demands for a cease-fire. Moreover, to the delight of Israel’s hard right, the new president wasted weeks consumed with a bizarre plan to annex Gaza, somehow pushing out the Palestinians and building a glistening beach resort, similar to Miami. (Mr. Trump once held a similar fantasy about North Korea, and even made North Korea’s leader a short film, with mock-ups of water parks and luxury condos.) In the case of Gaza, he circulated an AI-created video of a luxury resort city, with images of him and Mr. Netanyahu sipping coffee. The prime minister humored him, praising his vision even while stepping up military pressure. And Mr. Trump signaled the importance of a deal by bringing Mr. Kushner back into the swirl of diplomacy, hoping that his business connections with Qatar and other players in the region could be leveraged to good advantage. It was Mr. Kushner who negotiated the Abraham Accords in the first term, in which Arab states recognized Israel — a huge step. Of course, those connections fuel Mr. Trump’s critics, who see a blurring of diplomacy and for-profit deals. But the Israeli attempt to kill Hamas negotiators in Qatar, dropping a bomb on their temporary residence, both angered Mr. Trump and awakened him . It gave the United States the opportunity to rally Arab states around the 20-point plan, even if they thought many of the details would not work. And so when Mr. Trump called Mr. Netanyahu to the White House in September, following the opening of the U.N. General Assembly, the prime minister was in no position to resist him. He had to call the prime minister of Qatar and read an apology to him — while White House photographers recorded the moment. The message was clear: Mr. Netanyahu was now in a new world, where he had to heed some American mandates. Then Mr. Trump pressed the Israeli leader to sign on to his 20-point plan, with its cease-fire and the insertion of a “technocratic” temporary government in Gaza backed by an international stability force. While it fell short of Mr. Netanyahu’s maximalist demands, he had to agree to the document. He was both indebted to Mr. Trump and aware that provoking his capricious counterpart could lead to negative consequences for himself and for Israel. He may have also been betting that Hamas would reject the deal, because it required the terrorist group to disarm and leave the territory. Hamas said “yes, but,” agreeing to the first terms — the hostage release in return for a prisoner swap — but insisting on more negotiations on the critical next steps. Mr. Trump ignored the “but,” and simply took the partial yes as full agreement. “Trump succeeded in convincing Prime Minister Netanyahu to do what perhaps should have been done right after Israel’s victory over Iran — or even earlier, during the second phase of the January 2025 deal,” Mr. Yadlin wrote on Sunday in The Jerusalem Post. “He grasped what Netanyahu did not: that the war was inflicting immense diplomatic damage and that ‘total victory’ in Gaza was unattainable without killing the hostages, sacrificing soldiers and harming civilians behind whom Hamas hides. He understood the Israeli public mood far better than the government — an overwhelming 80 percent supported bringing the hostages home even at the cost of ending the war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/us/politics/lost-chances-hostage-deal-gaza-israel.html,World,BBC,By David E.

e0f60775e263,A Test Now for Israel: Can It Repair Its Ties to Americans?,"israel gaza war, polls, judaism, benjamin netanyahu, israel, us","The war in Gaza may finally be ending, after two years of bloodshed and destruction. But among the damage that has been done is a series of devastating blows to Israel’s relationship with the citizens of its most important and most stalwart ally, the United States. Israel’s reputation in the United States is in tatters, and not only on college campuses or among progressives. For the first time since it began asking Americans about their sympathies in 1998, a New York Times poll last month found that slightly more voters sided with the Palestinians than with Israelis. American Jews, long Israel’s strongest domestic backers, have turned sharply critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Gaza conflict. A majority believe Israel has committed war crimes as it has killed tens of thousands of civilians and restricted food aid, and four in 10 believe it is guilty of genocide, a new Washington Post survey found — a charge Israel denies. The shift has created new incentives for even moderate Democrats in Congress to get tough on Israel , including by curtailing U.S. military aid. The damage is also increasingly bipartisan. Despite Republican efforts to identify their party with Israel and to tag Democrats as providing aid and comfort to its enemies, younger evangelical Christians are breaking with their parents on the issue, seeing Israel as an oppressor rather than as a victim. And the breakup extends beyond evangelicals. “Everybody under 30 is against Israel,” the conservative commentator Megyn Kelly offhandedly told Tucker Carlson on his podcast last month. The question is whether those younger Americans will be lost to Israel long-term — and what Israel’s advocates will do to try to reverse that. Shibley Telhami, a pollster and scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the University of Maryland, argues that it’s too late. “We now have a paradigmatic Gaza generation like we had a Vietnam generation and a Pearl Harbor generation,” he said. “There’s this growing sense among people that what they’re witnessing is genocide in real time, amplified by new media, which we didn’t have in Vietnam. It’s a new generation where Israel is seen as a villain. And I don’t think that’s likely to go away.” Yossi Klein Halevi, an American-born Israeli writer, said he was struck on a recent campus tour in the United States not so much by the rhetoric of the anti-Zionist activists he met, but by the degree to which they appeared to be influencing their apolitical peers. “They’re absorbing this toxic idea that there’s something basically illegitimate about a Jewish state,” Mr. Halevi said. “That’s my concern: this general perception that Israel has a bad odor attached to it.” Others argue that an end to the fighting, and to the horrific images from Gaza that have flooded social-media feeds for two years, could allow American boosters of Israel to regain their footing. “I do think there would be a bit of a reset in the way Israel is viewed,” said Halie Soifer, chief executive of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. “There is room for a bounce-back,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an American-born Israeli pollster who is a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “People tend to overestimate how bad the damage has been. Just stopping the slaughter will allow some people to go back to their comfort zone of being supportive.” What undergirds that more sanguine view is a belief that the foundation of the U.S.-Israeli relationship remains solid. That is most persuasive when it comes to shared national interests, like the deep, mutually beneficial collaborations between the two countries’ intelligence communities, militaries and technology sectors — collaborations that may be more visible to government officials than to the public at large. “We’re an asset in the great-power competition against China. We’re at the core of American interests in the Middle East,” said Avner Golov, a former official on Israel’s National Security Council who tracks the Israeli-American relationship for MIND Israel, a Tel Aviv think tank. “When my grandfather came here, he only wanted a safe haven for the Jews,” Mr. Golov added. “He never dreamt that Israeli technology would be able to play a significant role in shaping the world order and preserving U.S. superiority over its adversaries.” It is less clear, however, that the two countries, which long shared similar aspirations — to be a promised land for the persecuted, to be a gleaming city on a hill and an example for other nations — can count on those ideals as a basis for continued close ties. Mr. Halevi, a fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, said such aims were now up for debate in both countries, riven as they are by political polarization. On one side, he said, is the liberal Israeli story of the post-Holocaust creation of a Jewish state that “struggled for liberal values under constant pressure.” That story, “which is my story,” Mr. Halevi said, appeals to Democrats. Then there is the Israeli government’s story, of Israel as America’s “bulwark against the Muslim world,” Mr. Halevi said, “which resonates for the American right.” “It’s hard to base a relationship between the two countries on shared values,” he said, “when neither country can agree within itself on its own values.” Elections in Israel in the coming year could change things, experts say — not only if Mr. Netanyahu is voted out, but also if a new government reflects the country’s broad middle ground. Mr. Golov said that the polls portended a rejection of political extremes. He also suggested that Israel’s democracy had much to commend it, even in comparison with America’s at the moment, given the way that popular protests in Israel had pressured Mr. Netanyahu and encouraged Mr. Trump to end the war. “It’s a success story of an Israeli public that on one hand is sending its children to Gaza, and on the other hand is protesting every week,” he said. “And nobody shot anyone,” he noted pointedly. “If these protests will succeed, and I think they will,” Mr. Golov added, “nobody will be able to say that Israeli society lost its liberal nature. I think it regained it.” However difficult it may be to repair the relationship and to win over Americans who have turned against Israel over the war, experts agree that Israel will have little choice but to try, because of the degree to which Mr. Netanyahu has allowed Israel to become isolated internationally. “Israel has no hedging strategy,” said Ted Sasson, a professor at Middlebury College and a fellow at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. “It absolutely needs the U.S. It has nowhere else to turn. It’s firmly committed to that alliance, and it’s going to have to work harder to persuade Congress and a future American president to provide the kind of support that Biden and Trump have provided.” Eventually, an end to the war should mean an end to the worldwide focus on Israel’s conduct of it, said Ted Deutch, president of the American Jewish Committee. He said he eagerly awaited a point at which “the humanitarian situation gets better and the hostages are released, and Arab countries are investing in the future of Gaza.” Then, he said, “the conversation can be about what’s next, about what the region can look like, what Gaza can look like.” “I’m more hopeful today than I have been for hundreds of days,” said William Daroff, chief executive of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, an umbrella lobbying group. Others are less optimistic. Mort Klein, who leads the right-wing Zionist Organization of America, said he feared that the war had poisoned attitudes toward Israel almost irretrievably. “It’s become Jew-hatred,” he said. “I don’t know how that is resolved.” What seems indisputable is that the stakes for Israel, and for its advocates in the United States, are enormously high. Mr. Telhami, the University of Maryland professor, said that Israel’s dependence on U.S. support had become so glaring over the course of the war — in political, military and economic terms — that Israel would be motivated to treat its possible defeat in the court of American public opinion as an “existential threat.” “The game for maintaining the support for Israel is priority No. 1,” he said, adding, “Because the battle in America for Israel is perceived as part of the battle for Israel itself.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/middleeast/israel-us-polls-support.html,World,BBC,By David M.

52178aab95be,Viktor Orban’s ‘Propaganda State’ Is Starting to Show Cracks,"politics, propaganda, mass media, fidesz party, viktor orban, hungary, freedom of the press, peter magyar, ukraine, russian invasion of ukraine (2022)","Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary has long been hailed as a model by right-wing politicians in the United States and Europe, lauded for a string of election victories and his crackdowns on migrants and on activists pushing progressive social issues. “It’s nice to have a strong man running your country,” President Trump said last year of Mr. Orban, who has been in power for 15 years. Mr. Orban’s strength, reinforced by a sprawling propaganda machine geared to the destruction of his opponents, has seen off would-be rivals on both the left and the right in four consecutive elections. Now for the first time, however, he is struggling to land a knockout blow on his enemies. His most potent current rival, Peter Magyar, a former loyalist who heads a surging opposition movement , has in recent months been savaged by media controlled by Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party as an abusive husband, a traitor, a crook and a sex pest. The nonstop vilification — described by Mr. Magyar as a “tsunami of lies” — has been surprising in only one respect: It has not worked. “Until now, these campaigns are not a success. That is clear,” said Agoston Mraz, a Fidesz supporter whose Nezöpont Institute does polling for the government. Most opinion polls , though not Nezöpont’s, give Mr. Magyar’s upstart party, Tisza, a wide lead over Fidesz before a general election in the spring. Mr. Orban’s current troubles, which have dented his aura of invincibility, come after a decade of tightening press control and a highly effective deployment of propaganda to crush previous rivals. In addition, Mr. Magyar has gone on offense, hammering away at corruption. He has denounced what he calls “Orban’s Versailles,” a vast walled-off estate with mansions owned by the prime minister’s family , and has detailed the property holdings and other assets of Istvan Tiborcz, Mr. Orban’s son-in-law and a mysteriously successful businessman. Mr. Magyar could still stumble, and Fidesz has a record of finding or inventing compromising material on its opponents — it destroyed a macho far-right challenger, Gabor Vona, with a campaign of innuendo suggesting that he was gay. According to Laszlo Keri, who taught the prime minister at university, the growing cracks in Mr. Orban’s previously impregnable facade have shown the limits of what Mr. Keri described as “a propaganda state.” While Hungary suffers from a falling birthrate , high inflation and a spluttering economy, the Fidesz-controlled news media laud Mr. Orban as a defender of the common man and Europe’s pre-eminent champion of “family friendly” policies. “Orban and his media talk all the time about Hungary’s bright future, but people see their daily reality,” said Mr. Keri, who supports Mr. Magyar. He added, “There are two parallel worlds, and the tension between them makes people very angry.” Even Mr. Orban’s efforts to rally support by targeting the L.G.B.T. community appear to be backfiring. In June, more than 100,000 people marched in the annual Pride parade in Budapest , far more than in previous such events, after the government banned it. The event, Mr. Orban told supporters, was “repulsive and shameful” and showed why his political opponents, whom he accused of staging the march on orders from the European Union headquarters in Brussels, “must not be allowed near the helm of government.” “This is a very sad story of a very talented politician who could have been an outstanding statesman not only in Hungary but in the whole of Europe,” Mr. Keri said. Mr. Orban and his party “have learned nothing over the last 15 years but how to attack and destroy their opponents,” he added. Liberal Beginnings While Mr. Orban today relishes his image as a scourge of what he calls “ woke globalists ,” he started his political life as a champion of liberal values. He attended Oxford University on a scholarship funded by George Soros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist he now casts as a satanic puppeteer behind liberal causes. Mr. Orban’s political metamorphosis began after Fidesz flopped in a 1994 election. “He saw that he could not become prime minister from the center,” recalled Zsuzsanna Szelenyi, a liberal who became a Fidesz member of Parliament after the 1989 collapse of communism. She split with Mr. Orban, she said, after he “pulled the whole party out of its original orbit.” Mr. Orban, she said, found inspiration in Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate and a pioneer of right-wing populism who had become prime minister of Italy just as Fidesz was struggling to stay afloat. Mr. Orban did not undergo any ideological conversion, said Miklos Haraszti, 80, a liberal who bonded with Hungary’s future prime minister in the 1980s over their shared desire to topple communism but later broke with him. Instead, Mr. Orban saw populist nationalism as an easier sell in a crowded political field, Mr. Harazsti said. “Unfortunately, he changed sides” to win votes, he said. Targeting the Media Mr. Orban became prime minister in 1998 after tilting to the right. In 2002, he lost a general election, despite his government’s relatively successful record. That government had secured NATO membership for Hungary, made progress toward joining the European Union and eased the pain caused by harsh austerity measures imposed under its predecessors. The defeat, recalled Istvan Elek, a senior adviser to Mr. Orban at the time, “came as a terrible shock.” Mr. Orban, he said, blamed it on hostile news coverage and concluded that “dealing with the media has to be a priority.” After eight years in the political wilderness, Mr. Orban returned as prime minister in 2010 and, blazing a trail later followed by like-minded leaders in Brazil and India, quickly began silencing or taking over outlets his Fidesz party considered hostile. One of the first targets was Klubradio, a small but influential radio station. Andras Arato, its founder, said he was shocked by how quickly the new government moved. Soon after the 2010 election, he said, the national lottery and other state-controlled entities stopped advertising on Klubradio. Private companies worried about upsetting the government followed suit. Then came unexpected tax inspections and a decision by Hungary’s media council, stacked with Mr. Orban’s supporters, to cancel the station’s frequencies outside Budapest. “We lost 90 percent of our income in the first six months after Orban’s return,” Mr. Arato recalled. Extending its campaign, the new government pushed through legislation empowering a new National Media and Communications Authority to impose heavy fines for coverage it considered unbalanced or offensive. Klubradio finally went off the air in 2021 when the media authority refused to extend its license. It now exists only online . Scores of media outlets were subject to similar actions , leaving Fidesz in control , either directly or through loyal business groups, of most Hungarian news sources. Hungary’s media scene has become so one-sided that “everything is warped,” said Miklos Borsa, a former anchor on Hungary’s state-controlled M1 television news channel. “It is like the funny mirrors you get in an amusement park.” Migrant Crisis Mr. Orban and his media machine went into overdrive during the migrant crisis of 2015-2016, when more than a million refugees and migrants crossed into Europe . He took a tough stand, building a high fence and deploying security forces to prevent migrants from entering the country illegally. Many other members of the European Union have since adopted Hungary’s approach. But Mr. Orban shocked even supporters of tight border controls by unleashing a torrent of often-racist abuse. He falsely characterized migrants as disease-ridden threats to public health, extremists planning terrorist acts and agents of a plot to replace native Europeans with foreigners. Krisztina Balogh, who was then a journalist with state television, recalled being asked by her editor to find a doctor “who will say on camera that migrants are bringing in diseases.” The doctors she initially contacted said this was untrue, but she eventually found one, a Fidesz supporter, who provided what her editor wanted. “This was just manipulation,” Ms. Balogh said. Opposition politicians, she recalled, were always presented on her state television as “weak, stupid and only interested in destroying what Fidesz had built.” In 2018, Mr. Orban’s party won another landslide election victory. The Challenge of Covid Unlike today, the Fidesz media apparatus during the party’s first decade in power had an easy time making its message stick, trumpeting the government’s achievements. The economy, juiced by billions of dollars in funding from Brussels, was growing fast after recovering from the 2008 global financial crisis, which had damaged the political fortunes of Hungary’s socialists, in power when the crisis hit. International investment surged and real wages rose. The coronavirus pandemic ended all of that, pushing government propaganda in a new direction. As Hungary’s death rate rose to the third-highest in the world, its economy stalled and the public mood soured, Mr. Orban and his media machine revved up a culture war , stoking fury over issues like L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Assailing his foes as radical leftists intent on turning Hungarian boys into girls, Mr. Orban introduced a raft of laws and constitutional changes targeting sexual minorities. Then Russia came to the rescue. Its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 provided Fidesz with a powerful line of attack, and the propaganda machine began denouncing Mr. Marki-Zay as a reckless enemy of peace. “They realized that the war was their winning lottery ticket,” recalled Mr. Marki- Zay, who suddenly found himself branded a warmonger who would send Hungarians to fight Russia, something he had never suggested. He tried telling voters that all he wanted to do was support efforts by NATO and the European Union to help Ukraine. But drowned out by distortions on television and in other news media controlled by the governing party, “I just could not get through to them,” he recalled. Fidesz won another landslide. New Attacks Loom With an election just six months away, Fidesz has been scrambling to upgrade its lines of attack against Mr. Magyar, the conservative opposition politician. Efforts to brand him as a closet liberal who supported L.G.B.T. rights flopped when Mr. Magyar stayed silent over the Budapest Pride parade ban. A push to knock him out of the running by prosecuting him for various purported crimes also foundered when the European Parliament, of which he is a member, refused last month to lift his immunity. In another blow, a fierce critic of Mr. Orban’s rule, Laszlo Krasznahorkai, won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday. The prime minister congratulated the self-exiled writer for bringing “pride to our nation.” Mr. Krasznahorkai thanked Mr. Orban for his congratulatory message but added: “I will always oppose his political action and ideas.” Akos Hadhazy, a former local councilor for Fidesz who is now an opposition member of Parliament, said he worried most about what Mr. Orban might do if he fails to find effective new fuel for his propaganda machine to ensure that Mr. Magyar loses. “In all hybrid regimes, there comes a time when propaganda is not enough,” he said of governments with both autocratic and democratic characteristics. When propaganda stops working, he added, “you need to take harsher measures to keep winning.” Mate Halmos contributed reporting from Budapest.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/europe/orban-hungary-media-propaganda-magyar.html,World,BBC,By Andrew Higgins,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/multimedia/00int-hungary-orban-01-vhgj/00int-hungary-orban-01-vhgj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:12.494000+00:00,463f9241b099e376085dd7c18996b4e73da260f3
a2a9fb25e728,Border Clash Between Afghanistan and Pakistan Threatens a Wider Conflict,"international relations, war;armed conflicts, taliban, pakistani taliban, shehbaz sharif, afghanistan, pakistan, internal-open-access-from-nl","Tensions along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan surged on Sunday after a deadly overnight clash between the countries’ militaries, with both sides exchanging heavy fire in one of the sharpest escalations of violence between the neighbors in years. Afghan officials said on Sunday that their security forces had targeted Pakistani military outposts along the border in what they described as “retaliatory operations,” following what Kabul said were Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan last week. At least 23 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 29 others were injured on Saturday, according to Pakistan’s military. The Taliban government said nine Afghan soldiers had died and at least 16 others had been injured. The overnight fighting raised concerns that the violence could spill into a broader conflict between the two countries, whose governments have gradually grown hostile to each other since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan in 2021. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman, told reporters on Sunday that the fighting had stopped at midnight after Qatar and Saudi Arabia urged restraint. He warned Pakistan that any violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty would prompt retaliation. The Afghan attack overnight included heavy fire and raids within Pakistan, the Pakistani military said in a statement on Sunday. It said it responded with heavy artillery, airstrikes and raids within Afghanistan. Both sides also claimed dozens of victims, but none of their claims could be independently verified because access to the border region remains severely restricted. The Afghan offensive was a response to attacks on Wednesday in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and at a market near the border, which the Taliban government blamed on Pakistan. Pakistan said on Friday that it had conducted “a series of retribution operations” against Pakistani militants, but it did not mention Afghanistan directly. Nor did Pakistan claim responsibility for the explosions on Thursday in Kabul and at the border market. Without addressing the specifics of the most recent violence, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan on Sunday praised his country’s armed forces for what he described as a “strong and effective response” to recent Afghan provocations along the border, saying the military had “destroyed several of their border posts, forcing a retreat.” The militaries of both nations have frequently clashed along their shared border, a nearly 1,600-mile-long line that snakes along mountainous areas. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Taliban government of providing a haven to the banned group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the T.T.P. or Pakistani Taliban , whose attacks have killed hundreds of Pakistani security forces in recent years. It has also accused its archnemesis, India, of supporting the T.T.P. The T.T.P. leadership has received financial support from the Afghan government, and its militants have trained freely in Afghanistan, according to Pakistani military officials and independent and United Nations experts. The Taliban in Afghanistan deny backing the Pakistani group. The Afghan and Pakistani governments have tried to mend the relationship in recent years, despite sporadic clashes and ongoing points of diplomatic tension. The countries’ top diplomats met in August with their Chinese counterpart, but Pakistan has not recognized the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate authority. Still, there are close ties between both nations. Pakistan is Afghanistan’s top export partner, and it hosts millions of Afghans who fled insecurity and unemployment over the past decades. Major border crossings between the two countries have been closed since the overnight clashes, according to Pakistani and Afghan officials. In recent months, tens of thousands of Afghans living in Pakistan have crossed back into Afghanistan amid a wave of expulsions ordered by the Pakistani government. The clash on Saturday only lasted for a few hours, possibly because both countries may be wary of escalating tensions further, said Adam Weinstein, a Afghanistan and Pakistan analyst at the Quincy Institute, a research center in Washington. “Pakistan doesn’t yet want to engage in some kind of regime change, but the Taliban know that they would be outgunned by the Pakistanis if they pushed the fighting further,” Mr. Weinstein said. Pakistan can carry out airstrikes across most of Afghanistan, but the Taliban are more limited to cross-border artillery and the potential use of the T.T.P. militants to add pressure inside Pakistan, he added. On Saturday, the T.T.P. claimed responsibility for a series of attacks across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a Pakistani province bordering Afghanistan, that killed several security personnel and civilians, including in a bombing near a police training facility. Residents in border districts on both sides said in telephone interviews that they witnessed intense overnight clashes that raged for several hours. “The fighting went on for hours without pause,” said Shabbir Khan, a resident of Kurram, a Pakistani border district, describing the sound of heavy weapons echoing through the mountains. Aziz Sayar, a resident of the Sawkai district in Afghanistan’s Kunar Province, near the border of Pakistan, said the gunfire began around 9 p.m. and continued for over three hours. “Our children screamed in fear as bullets echoed through the night,” he said.

4b895afb88a4,World Cup Qualifiers Become a Venue for European Protests of Israel,"international relations, israel gaza war, civil unrest, soccer, palestinians, hamas, fifa, gianni infantino, lise klaveness, europe, israel, italy, norway, internal-open-access-from-nl","The giant flags, unfurled about five minutes before kickoff, had nothing to do with the two teams about to play in a match that would help determine qualification for next year’s World Cup, global soccer’s biggest event. As the national teams from Norway and Israel prepared to take the field on Saturday night, Norwegian fans raised a Palestinian tricolor flag and a banner that read “Let Children Live.” Moments later, as Israel’s players lined up and their national anthem played, some in the home crowd booed and whistled. The scene and a pregame protest march by about 1,500 people were examples of how the world’s most popular sport has become a venue for demonstrations against Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza. They are likely to persist even after a cease-fire took hold that mediators hoped would lead to the end of the two-year war. Israeli soccer officials expected more protests at the team’s next World Cup qualifier in Udine, in northern Italy, on Tuesday. “It is our reality today,” Israel’s goalkeeper Daniel Peretz said after conceding all the goals in a chastening 5-0 defeat for his team. From a soccer standpoint, the match was high-profile. It was billed as one of the most important in Norway’s soccer history, putting the country one victory away from returning to the men’s World Cup after nearly 30 years. However, many Norwegian soccer officials and fans have long been outspoken about Israeli participation in the World Cup and viewed the match as an opportunity to highlight their message. Norway’s soccer federation announced months earlier that it would donate the proceeds from Saturday’s match to Doctors Without Borders for humanitarian work in Gaza. A team sponsor said it would also donate 300,000 euros, or about $350,000. In a corner of Andy’s Pub, a soccer-themed bar in Oslo, about a half dozen men from Tromso, a city close to the Arctic Circle, were downing beers before the match and dressed in Norwegian jerseys from the 1990s, when the team last played in the World Cup. But they were missing one of their regulars. Ronny Jordness, 55, said his brother Kurt was boycotting the game. “I tried to convince him that all the money goes to Gaza so he should come, but I was still not able to,” Mr. Jordness said. Israeli officials were frustrated that the Norwegians had singled out the game for the charity donation, and reporters traveling with the team aggressively questioned Lise Klaveness, Norway soccer’s president, about it and other issues in a feisty news conference the day before the game. Ms. Klaveness has been a focus of Israeli anger. She has said Israel should be barred from global soccer, as Russia has been since it began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. She has accused Israel of breaching the rules of FIFA, the sport’s governing body, including with teams in its professional soccer league that play from Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and she has criticized FIFA for taking nearly two years to investigate the issue. The donation, Ms. Klaveness said in an interview at her office on Saturday, was made in part to convince Norwegians that it was acceptable to support their team. “We knew that it will be a very political backdrop to the game and people will find it very difficult in Norway to come to the game and support Norway,” she said. Outside in Oslo, organizers of a pro-Palestinian protest held a rally to kick off a 90-minute march through the city to the stadium. They attracted support from passers-by who cheered from apartment windows and vehicles that had stopped to let them pass. The organizers said that the cease-fire deal in Gaza didn’t go far enough. Under the plan , Hamas agreed to release the remaining hostages it took during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for the return of Palestinian prisoners and the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops. “It’s not the end of the occupation,” said Line Khateeb, one of the protest’s organizers. “It doesn’t mean the West Bank is free. It doesn’t mean Palestine is free. We need to keep pushing and putting sanctions on Israel to hold them accountable in order to have a proper free Palestine.” The security operation for the game, which included a no-fly zone over the stadium and road closures, was the biggest for any sporting event in Norway since it hosted the Winter Olympics in 1994. Israel’s 60-person traveling contingent included 16 security agents. Outside, the police arrested more than 20 protesters. The emotions of the moment are a constant accompaniment to Israel’s national team. Coach Ran Ben-Shimon theatrically pulled a light blue kipa out of his pocket halfway through a news conference before the match, placed it on his head and said a prayer in Hebrew for the return of the remaining hostages and soldiers in Gaza. “I feel like here, I am a politician from the government of Israel rather than a footballer who is supposed to play tomorrow against Norway,” the team’s captain, Eli Dasa, said at one point, growing frustrated at the line of questioning. Before a game two years ago, he displayed what he said was a soccer shoe that belonged to an Israeli child kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. Other Israeli teams have faced antisemitic attacks since the war began. Dozens of people were arrested in Amsterdam last November over what officials described as antisemitic attacks on fans of the Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv, as well as over vandalism and inflammatory behavior on both sides at a European club match, including anti-Arab chants. While Norway soccer officials had long called for action against Israel, other countries moved in that direction more recently as opinion in Europe over the conflict in Gaza began to shift more decisively against Israel. In recent weeks, reports had begun to emerge that European soccer leaders were moving to bar Israeli teams from competition. Israeli teams have traditionally played against European national and club organizations. Talk of a meeting to decide on a possible ban began to intensify, Ms. Klaveness said. Then, President Trump announced a comprehensive peace plan alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and pressed Hamas to agree to it. In addition to the major diplomatic implications, the plan eased the intensifying discussions to bar Israel’s soccer teams. “It was a real movement to have a meeting,” Ms. Klaveness said. “But then the peace talks started, and then everything cooled down.” Soccer officials, too, have been affected. Protesters appeared outside the homes of the Italian soccer president, Gabriele Gravina, and the national team coach, Gennaro Gattuso. Mr. Gattuso said last week that he expected more demonstrators outside Stadio Friuli in Udine than fans inside for Tuesday’s qualifying match between Israel and Italy. FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, an ally of Mr. Trump’s, sought last week to calm fan opposition to Israel. “Now there is a cease-fire; everyone should be happy about that,” Mr. Infantino said on the sidelines of a meeting of European soccer executives in Rome. “Everyone should support that process.” As the game in Oslo approached its end, with Norwegian fans jubilant and on the cusp of returning to the World Cup, a megaphone that had been used to start chants for Norway was handed to a man in a kaffiyeh, a symbol of the Palestinian resistance movement. Moments later, the words “Free, free Palestine” rang out.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/europe/israel-soccer-protests-norway-italy.html,World,BBC,By Tariq Panja,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/world/12int-europe-israel-soccer-0001/12int-europe-israel-soccer-0001-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T14:36:24+00:00,eb60e63bfda8aeb7ca3f80f3c0a5a19a48346a29

The prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, was one of the central mediators in efforts to end the war in Gaza, and the Qataris have maintained close contacts with Hamas’s leadership for years. He spoke to The New York Times soon after Israel and Hamas agreed to halt hostilities in Gaza and exchange all the remaining hostages in the territory for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The deal left some of the thorniest issues in the conflict for a later stage, including the future of Hamas’s weapons and how Gaza would be governed after the end of the war. “If we went for full-package negotiations, we wouldn’t have reached these results,” Sheikh Mohammed said on Friday in Paris. He spoke after a meeting there with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Arab and European foreign ministers about postwar Gaza. Sheikh Mohammed said Hamas had expressed a willingness to talk about a different kind of relationship with Israel. “Hamas are actually open to have a discussion about how they won’t pose a threat for Israel,” the prime minister said.

f317785f7103,Bangladesh Detains Army Officers Accused of Crimes Under Previous Regime,"bangladesh, hasina wazed;sheikh hasina, human rights, military, appointments and executive changes, police brutality;police misconduct;police shootings, internal-open-access-from-nl","Bangladesh’s army said it had taken into custody more than a dozen of its officers accused of serious crimes committed under Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year rule ended last year amid widespread protests . The move, announced by the military on Saturday, is a rare instance of large-scale detentions of military officers since Ms. Hasina’s ouster and flight. The detentions came days after the country’s International Crimes Tribunal, an expedited civilian court set up to prosecute major crimes, issued arrest warrants for 32 people, including Ms. Hasina; her military secretary, Maj. Gen. Kabir Ahmed; and current and former security officers. The charges against them include abduction, torture and enforced disappearances, as well as unleashing brutal force against protesters that left more than 1,400 dead. It is the latest of several arrest warrants issued against Ms. Hasina since she was forced out in August 2024, fleeing the country as angry crowds converged on her residence . But she is unlikely to face trial anytime soon. India, where she is now, has not responded to calls for her extradition. Bangladesh, led by the interim leader Muhammad Yunus , has struggled with its transition from authoritarian rule, as divisive political jockeying heats up ahead of elections scheduled for February 2026. Members of Ms. Hasina’s political party have accused the interim government of political score-settling. The tribunal issuing the warrants, which despite its name is a domestic court, also has a troubled past, having been used by Ms. Hasina to target opponents. Maj. Gen. Md Hakimuzzaman, a spokesman for the military, said at a news conference on Saturday that at least 14 serving officers and one who was starting retirement were in army custody as part of the “legal process.” Many of the others named in the arrest warrants have either fled the country or gone into hiding. Those detained are expected to face hearings at the tribunal on Oct. 22, which will determine whether they are freed on bail or face police arrest. Some analysts interpreted the army’s announcement that the officers were in its “custody” as a way of protecting its turf, or of evading the usual process of arrest by the police. Comments by Mohammad Tajul Islam, the special court’s chief, added to the uncertainty about the detentions. He told reporters on Sunday that the legal process requires a person who is arrested to be produced before a court within 24 hours. “Since no one has officially informed us through documentary procedure that the person has been detained, we are not taking into account what has appeared in the media,” he said. General Hakimuzzaman said the officers with arrest warrants were not on army duty at the time of the crimes they were charged with, but had been dispatched to other forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, which served more directly under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. “Despite this fact, they are now in our custody because they are members of the army,” General Hakimuzzaman said. During Ms. Hasina’s increasingly authoritarian rule, the police and military were accused of killing, torturing and disappearing political opponents and other dissenters. The military intelligence, in which General Ahmed served, and many units of police and counterterrorism forces ran detention centers that became known as Aynaghar, or “the House of Mirrors.” There, hundreds of people were shut out of sight in underground military detention centers, often for years on end. Pushed to the edge of insanity and death, some have spoken out since Ms. Hasina’s ouster to tell of the horrors they endured. “Those who committed the crimes must face trial,” Mr. Islam, the chief of the special court, said on Thursday, when the warrants were issued. “They stood against the law, the Constitution and the uniform while holding the position of responsibility and drawing salaries from the taxpayers’ money.” Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/asia/bangladesh-arrests-hasina-crimes.html,World,BBC,By Saif Hasnat,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12int-bangladesh-arrests-01-mgwk/12int-bangladesh-arrests-01-mgwk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T15:38:40+00:00,ea28ab2704382cbe927251c944b2cebe66ed2ba2
35edced2fc48,Trump Is Blowing Up Boats Off Venezuela. Could Mexico’s Cartels Be Next?,"us foreign policy, mexico, drug cartel, military, drug abuse, claudia sheinbaum, donald trump, marco rubio, caribbean, latin america, venezuela, sinaloa cartel","As President Trump has blown up one boat after another off Venezuela’s coast and declared an “ armed conflict ” against drug cartels, a question with stark consequences has arisen much closer to the United States. Could Mexico, where far more drugs are made by some of the world’s most powerful criminal groups, be next? “I would be honored to go in and do it,” Mr. Trump said in May , about using U.S. forces to hunt cartel members. “The cartels are trying to destroy our country. They’re evil.” Yet three senior Mexican officials said in interviews that, although they are watching the U.S. military action with caution, Mexico is not worried — for now. That is because, they said, the cooperation between the countries has become simply too robust and yielded too many results on migration and drugs for them to imagine the Trump administration jeopardizing it by conducting unilateral military strikes. Their assessments were reinforced by two Trump administration officials who emphasized collaboration between the countries. But perhaps more surprisingly, these views were shared by several members of a top cartel who said they were unafraid of American intervention. They were more focused on an ongoing conflict within their ranks, they said. So far, the U.S. government says it has targeted only boats leaving Venezuela, a country ruled by an autocratic government that Washington has long wanted gone. Mexico, the largest U.S. trading partner, presents a far different case. Any U.S. intervention would have major diplomatic, economic and political consequences, given Mexico’s red line over impeding on its sovereignty. The Mexican officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomacy, have top jobs in areas spanning foreign affairs and security. They said that they have gotten little sense from their U.S. counterparts that Mexico is in the cross hairs. Still, that experts are asking the question at all says much about how far the Trump administration has shifted U.S. relations with Latin America. And many American and Mexican political and security analysts cautioned that Mexico was hardly out of the woods, given Mr. Trump’s approach to the cartels as targets of war and the reality that the biggest and most powerful cartels are just south of the border. One of the Mexican officials stressed that while the government did not see unilateral American strikes inside Mexico as an immediate threat, the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean posed a long-term concern. In Washington, American officials have sounded similar notes about prioritizing collaboration. Two Trump administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said that because of the two nations’ increased cooperation, the United States is focused on working with Mexico rather than making unilateral strikes on criminals. The Trump administration believes its threats against Mexico have caused it to step up against cartels, one official said, eliminating the need for U.S. forces to get involved, at least for now. Another official said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Mexico last month reaffirmed the sense that the countries were aligned on security. Mr. Rubio met with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico on Sept. 3, the day after Mr. Trump first announced that U.S. forces had struck a boat in the Caribbean. In comments to reporters, Mr. Rubio had harsh words about smugglers from Venezuela. “We’re not going to sit back anymore and watch these people sail up and down the Caribbean like a cruise ship,” he said. Stopping boats and seizing cargo does not stop smugglers, he added. “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” But on Mexico, he mostly offered praise. “It is the closest security cooperation we have ever had,” he said. After the meeting, the two nations put out a joint statement about security cooperation , noting it was based on “respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,” as well as “mutual trust.” At the top of the Mexican government, Ms. Sheinbaum has repeatedly drawn a line in the sand over U.S. military intervention. “Under no circumstances will the people of Mexico accept interventions that violate our territory,” she said at a rally in Mexico City on Sunday. “Whether by land, water, sea or air.” Strikingly, Ms. Sheinbaum’s firm public stance against U.S. interventions has reassured one of the very criminal networks she and Mr. Trump have vowed to dismantle: the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the world’s most notorious criminal organizations and potentially a larger supplier of drugs than all Venezuelan smugglers combined. In interviews, five cartel operatives dismissed the idea that the U.S. military could strike within Mexico next. Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, they said their more pressing concern was the relentless fighting among rival criminal factions. Most were only vaguely aware of the recent American attacks in the Caribbean. One cartel member, a 39-year-old midlevel operative who oversees security operations in Culiacán, the group’s stronghold, said that he had little fear of U.S. intervention because he believed Ms. Sheinbaum would not allow it. “It will never happen,” he said. “He can’t do that,” he added of Mr. Trump. Even if the United States did strike their smugglers at sea, he said, disruption would be minimal. “We don’t only have maritime routes, we have land and air as well,” he said. “There is always a way.” In addition to fighting each other, Mexico’s criminal groups are also under heightened pressure from the Mexican government. In Ms. Sheinbaum’s first year in office, which ended Sept. 30, Mexican authorities said they arrested nearly 35,000 people for high-impact crimes and destroyed nearly 1,600 drug labs. Under her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, there were an average of 8,900 such arrests annually and 380 destroyed labs, they said. Mexican authorities also say they have seized 3.8 million fentanyl pills, a statistic not tracked consistently under Mr. López Obrador. As a result, the Mexican government said, homicides have dropped by almost a third, to their lowest level in a decade, and fewer drugs are being seized at the border. The Mexican government has also increased efforts on migration, helping to bring illegal border crossings to their lowest level in years. One of the senior Mexican officials said that there is daily cooperation between U.S. and Mexican authorities on cartels, including regular U.S. surveillance flights over Mexican territory. But U.S. authorities do not — and will not — use force in Mexico, in part because the Mexican Constitution bans it, the official said. There is another, nearly $1 trillion reason why many believe the United States will not strike Mexico: The nations are deeply interdependent, with about $950 billion in goods and services flowing between them each year. Disrupting such trade could potentially cause economic devastation in border states of both countries, and drive migrants to seek work inside the United States. At the same time, analysts warned that Mexico may be placing too much faith in diplomacy with a notoriously mercurial U.S. president. “Sheinbaum acts, delivers and gives, but it’s never enough for the U.S.,” said David Mora, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. “The problem is the volatility and unpredictability of the Trump administration.” On the ground, attitudes are more complex. At least three national surveys this year have found that more than 60 percent of Mexicans opposed the idea of the U.S. conducting military operations in Mexico. One poll also showed that 31 percent of Mexicans welcomed the idea. In parts of Sinaloa, where bloodshed has become part of daily life, some conservative and business groups would embrace U.S. strikes, said Adrián López, editor of El Noroeste, the state’s largest newspaper. Businesses there have suffered enormous losses because of the cartel wars, and many Mexicans perceive the United States as more effective in combating organized crime, he said, making “the logic of U.S. intervention is appealing.” “People here say, ‘If that makes the violence stop,’” he said. “‘Where do I sign?’” “But,” he added, “we should be careful what we wish for.” Annie Correal, Miriam Castillo and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.

22d2fbba49ca,Social Media Restrictions and 2-Day Internet Shutdown Rattle Afghanistan,"social media, communications and media blackouts, women and girls, computers and the internet, tech industry, censorship, taliban, afghanistan","Airports and banks were forced to shut down. Government employees idled aimlessly in the corridors of their ministries. Teenage girls, barred from attending school, lost much of their access to the outside world. In shutting down the internet and cellphone services across Afghanistan last month, the Taliban government turned the clock back decades, in a move reminiscent of their first time in power from 1996 to 2001. Connectivity came back after two days, but this week, the Afghan government blocked certain types of content on social media apps like Instagram and Facebook, signaling that it would only tolerate tightly controlled access to the internet. Over the four years since they returned to power, the Taliban have gradually strengthened their grip on Afghan society, at times prohibiting content creators from posting on YouTube in one province, or forbidding television channels from broadcasting images of living beings in another. But the internet blackout and the suspension of cellphone services hit the entire country at the same time last month, leaving many Afghans worried that it could go on indefinitely, or happen again even after service was restored. “We are always at home, so the internet was our only way to tell other people that we are alive,” said Mahsa, 19, who was in the middle of a math lesson with a U.S.-sponsored online education program when the blackout began. (The New York Times agreed to identify her by only her first name because she feared backlash by the government.) Because the Taliban have banned education for girls after sixth grade, online education has been the only avenue for female students like Mahsa to pursue their studies. Afghan officials have not communicated publicly about the shutdown, and spokesmen from multiple government agencies have not responded to requests for comment. But officials outside the country and analysts have said the internet shutdown was the result of an order by Afghanistan’s leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has sought to restrict internet access to prevent “immoral acts.” “The internet shutdown is the most damaging decision the emir has made after closing schools for girls,” Asfandyar Mir, a senior fellow in the South Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington, said about Mr. Akhundzada. “This time, it affected everyone and had immediate consequences, including for the economy.” Why the internet came back after two days remains unclear. But officials outside the country, analysts and one aide to an Afghan government official said in interviews that some Afghan officials had most likely recognized that the shutdown was unsustainable and had restored internet access — with or without Mr. Akhundzada’s approval. The Times was not able to independently verify the claim. If confirmed, the resistance from government officials would be the latest signal of a schism between Kabul-based ministers who are in favor of fewer social restrictions, including lifting those on women and girls, and the ultraconservative Mr. Akhundzada, who lives in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, away from the central government. “Defiance of the Emir is anathema to Taliban ideology, which is based on allegiance to him,” said Graeme Smith, an author and analyst with two decades of experience in Afghanistan . “But this looks like a rare example of internal pushback against the leader.” The internet shutdown was not addressed at a gathering convened by Mr. Akhundzada in Kandahar with hundreds of provincial and district governors shortly after online access was restored, according to two participants. Signs of dissension within the group were not present either, though Mr. Akhundzada urged the attendees to show unity and respect their superiors, according to the two participants. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to publicly discuss the meeting. For countless Afghans, the internet shutdown paralyzed daily life. Although internet access is patchy in some parts of Afghanistan, smartphone use has proliferated in recent years with the expansion of 4G networks and the widespread availability of cheap devices. In Herat, a buzzing city in northwestern Afghanistan, the blackout nearly ruined Nazir Hussaini’s two travel businesses, he said. He could not exchange currency nor register visa applications for clients seeking to cross into Iran, about 70 miles away. “It felt like we were thrown back 30 years, trapped in the dark and unable to breathe,” Mr. Hussaini said. Muhammad, a police officer in Kabul, was on his way to the police station for a late shift when the internet went off around 5 p.m. on Sept. 29. When a crime is reported in the area where he serves, which is home to hundreds of thousands of people, Muhammad said that he and his colleagues would first share the news in an internal WhatsApp group. But as they could not communicate online for two days, and local elders who would usually call them to report a crime could not reach them, Muhammad said that he and his colleagues did not conduct any investigations. The internet shutdown further harmed the Afghan economy, already battered by multiple crises . It cut off many Afghans from their relatives who send much-needed funds from abroad. It imperiled the work of U.N. agencies and humanitarian agencies that have provided relief to the victims of an earthquake that killed more than 2,200 people last month, and to many of the nearly three million Afghans who have returned to Afghanistan this year amid a wave of forced returns and deportations from neighboring Pakistan and Iran. Human rights defenders and Afghanistan observers have warned that restricted access to online media platforms would severely undermine women’s and girls’ mental health. Mahsa, the high school student, echoed those concerns. “With a shutdown or restricted access to internet, you’re in a gray zone,” she said, “and if something happens to me, nobody will know.” Taimoor Shah, Yaqoob Akbary and Safiullah Padshah contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/asia/afghanistan-social-media-internet-shutdown.html,World,BBC,By Elian Peltier,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11afghanistan-internet-wbkq/11afghanistan-internet-wbkq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:01:33+00:00,d2ee01295c1e73e86cd25de6fb273988a0632ff8
d31e5c4d35c5,Arson in Nepal Looked Like Spontaneous Rage. Evidence Suggests Otherwise.,"arson, nepal, politics, forensic science, civil unrest, nepali congress party, unified communist party of nepal maoist","Many of Nepal’s trappings of state went up in smoke in a single afternoon. On Sept. 9, coordinated arson attacks across the Himalayan nation destroyed hundreds of government buildings, from a storied palace and top courts to grand ministries and humble ward offices. Hundreds of other properties were targeted, too, including businesses and schools connected to the political elite, as well as homes of current and retired politicians. The widespread arson followed the fatal shootings the day before of 19 anti-corruption protesters by security forces in Kathmandu, the capital. The prevailing narrative is that mobs of young protesters sought retribution, setting fires as their outrage over the killings flared. But a New York Times investigation — based on dozens of interviews with witnesses, participants and arson experts; a review of photos and videos from the havoc; and visits by The Times to the wreckage sites — reveals new details that cast doubt on the idea that such a tightly coordinated nationwide campaign of destruction could have been an entirely spontaneous response to the deaths the day before. A few hours after the shootings on Sept. 8, “ready-to-use lists” began surfacing online with the private details of members of society accused of being part of Nepal’s graft and patronage network. The next afternoon, most of these people’s residences began to burn. Nepal’s executive, legislative and judicial branches were also consumed by fire. The scale of the devastation was catastrophic, akin to hundreds of airstrikes in a handful of hours. “You don’t get so many buildings on fire in a short time frame without a good deal of organizational prowess,” said Richard Hagger, a senior fire investigator at Andrew Moore & Associates. “Something like that takes weeks, if not months, of planning.” The crowds that attacked the heart of the Nepali government marauded largely unimpeded other than around the Parliament complex, which was guarded by a contingent of riot police. Nepali troops, who were barely seen on the streets that day, had been told not to intervene, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said. They, as well as other witnesses and officials interviewed for this article, talked to The Times on condition of anonymity because they had not been approved to brief the public or were worried about retaliation. The bedlam on Sept. 9 was punctuated by the resignation of Nepal’s prime minister. Soon, the government fell. Nepal’s bureaucracy was charred. In Kathmandu and its suburbs, more than 110 police stations were set on fire, according to a police spokesman. The damage and lost business is still being tallied, but initial estimates put it at more than a third of Nepal’s gross domestic product, one cabinet minister said. Fire investigators caution that it is impossible to reconstruct what happened on Sept. 9 without testing debris samples, interviewing witnesses and examining the buildings. Yet none of this vital analysis has been conducted by the police lab that normally handles such cases. It is unclear whether the official inaction is the result of any specific orders. But with each day, it is less likely that science can determine who burned down Nepal’s government, how it was done and why. Pawan Dhungana, a section chief of the Nepali police’s central forensic science lab, confirmed that no one in his team has been called to investigate since the fires blazed last month. His lab has received nothing to test. Any fire debris has probably degraded to the point of irrelevance, he said. “Seeing all these conflagrations, not just in Kathmandu but all around the country, one can suspect it was preplanned,” Mr. Dhungana said. “Of course, we don’t have any evidence of anything.” The interim government of Prime Minister Sushila Karki has formed a commission to investigate the mass fires and the excessive use of force against the protesters. But another Nepali forensic police officer said that Nepal’s judicial backlog means that it could take up to seven years for any investigation to be completed. Nepali business associations have urged far faster action to restore investor confidence. No one has claimed responsibility for the fires, although theories have spread as fast as the blazes did. On Sept. 9, the throngs moved within two hours from Parliament to the Supreme Court to the Singha Durbar complex, with its former palace and about 20 government ministries. The main building began smoking within half an hour of the crowd’s arrival, witnesses said. Such a rapid ignition, followed by flames that seemed more intense than those fed simply by interior furnishings, suggests trails of specialized accelerants were laid beforehand to create a so-called fire path, arson experts said. “Looking at photographs, I suspect that sodium or magnesium or other chemicals were used because of the size of the conflagrations,” Mr. Dhungana said. “But without analyzing, we cannot say anything for sure.” These chemicals are controlled substances and require expertise to deploy. They cannot be purchased easily like more common accelerants, such as kerosene. But many gallons of liquid fuel would still be needed to ensure that big buildings burn. Notably, some of the building’s upper windows were open when the mobs arrived, which they usually were not, according to workers there. This ventilation likely helped the fire to spread, arson experts said. But whether this was done deliberately cannot be determined without on-the-ground detective work. “The factors to say more likely than not that it was some sort of organized conspiracy are the size of the building, the devastation of the building, the ferocity of the fire,” said Kenneth Kee, a principal consultant at Fire Science Forensics in Singapore. “Then you have to ask: ‘How did the accelerants get in the building? Was it an inside job? Did security abandon their posts?’” Elsewhere in Kathmandu and in towns all across Nepal, the mobs worked more openly. They followed the lists that had circulated the night before. The targets included the homes of Nepal’s political grandees, including the top ranks of the three big political parties — the Nepali Congress, the Maoists and the Communists. (Cases of mistaken identity were mixed in, too.) These arsonists were armed with containers of fuel and bottles capped with cloth wicks, witnesses and participants in the violence said. Some carried sticks, rifles and kukris, a local curved dagger. Three young men who took part in the arson said that they worked in shifts that day and that older men they did not know handed out petrol bombs filled with motorcycle fuel. Two of them shared videos of the attacks. Neighbors living next to one of the targeted homes said they saw a group of men in their mid-30s disgorging the contents of gas canisters. Seeing the flames shoot up, one perpetrator remarked that this meant they would be getting paid, the neighbors said. Arson has been a fixture of Nepali political culture. During their decade-long insurgency against the now-abolished monarchy, Maoists set fires and rigged explosives, targeting symbols of the state or powerful businesses. Deliberate fires continued after the civil war ended in 2006. In 2019, for instance, the Communists, who splintered from the Maoists, admitted to setting on fire more than a dozen cellular towers across the nation to protest supposed corruption by the telecom operator. None of the big three political parties was spared this time around. Those who escaped the destruction included the fourth- and fifth-largest parties, one headed by a politician who was part of a mass jailbreak on Sept. 9 and the other a pro-royalist bloc. About 60,000 case files at the Supreme Court burned, even those supposedly protected by fire-resistant boxes, a court employee said. At the anti-corruption court, members of the mob yelled out, looking for rooms holding specific documents, two lawyers said. Business owners in several cities said that the arsonists set fires on alternate floors, a tactic to link blazes, which could point to systematic attacks, fire experts said. Even the central police forensic lab was besieged by men throwing petrol bombs. The fire did not catch, and the lab was unscathed. “We all want to know who did this,” Mr. Dhungana said. “But it’s almost like we cannot find out.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/asia/nepal-protests-genz-arson.html,World,BBC,By Hannah Beech and Sajal Pradhan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08int-nepal-arson-gzcw/08int-nepal-arson-gzcw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:50+00:00,a7f09b5fcfbadbe5a5f82dfd587637ced401bd1d
95f358934549,China Detains Dozens of Members of Underground Church,"separation of church and state, politics, christianity, coronavirus;covid-19;pandemic, communist party of china, mike pence, xi jinping, china, guangxi china, us","The authorities in China have detained the pastor of one of the country’s most prominent underground churches, along with dozens of other people affiliated with his church, according to the pastor’s family and members of the church, prompting worries about a renewed crackdown on religion. The pastor, Jin Mingri, who also goes by the name Ezra, founded Beijing Zion Church in 2007. It grew into one of the country’s largest unofficial congregations, with several satellite campuses and over 1,000 people attending its weekend services. Mr. Jin, 56, was detained on Friday at his home in the city of Beihai in Guangxi Province, according to his daughter, Grace Jin, who lives in the United States. Around the same time, nearly 30 other Zion Church pastors or workers were taken into custody or went missing around the country, including in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and other cities, she said. Calls to the Beihai police rang unanswered on Sunday. Ms. Jin said her family had not been able to reach her father but that they had heard from other church members, some of whom were released after their initial detentions, that he was being accused of illegal dissemination of religious information. The Chinese Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but in practice, the Chinese Communist Party permits only tightly controlled, state-approved congregations to operate openly. Still, it is estimated that tens of millions of Chinese Christians worship in underground churches, also called house churches. Under China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, persecution of those unofficial congregations has increased, alongside a more general crackdown on religion in general, especially Islam. In 2018, a nationwide crackdown led to the closure of several prominent house churches, including Beijing Zion . The government regularly encourages ordinary Chinese to report unsanctioned religious gatherings, which it sometimes calls cults, to the police. After 2018, Mr. Jin was subjected to frequent surveillance and harassment, his daughter said, and forced to leave Beijing. He was also barred from leaving China to visit his family members, who left the country in 2018. Ms. Jin, her mother and her two younger brothers now live in the United States. But Mr. Jin continued to lead Zion by convening smaller, more scattered gatherings, as well as sharing videos of sermons online, Ms. Jin said. During the coronavirus pandemic, when many other churches stopped operating, Zion grew rapidly, drawing audiences of sometimes 10,000 people across the country on platforms including Zoom, YouTube and WeChat, Ms. Jin said. In recent months, though, many at Zion began to worry that another crackdown was imminent. Surveillance on Mr. Jin seemed to have ramped up, Ms. Jin said. In September, the government issued new regulations limiting religious activity online to officially registered channels. Mr. Jin had also suggested to the state security officers monitoring him that he might retire from Zion so that he could join his family, Ms. Jin said. But she said the officers refused to let him leave. “After this kind of posturing, it seemed like something big was going to happen again,” Ms. Jin said. “We just didn’t know when or to what extent. But I also feel like my dad is always the optimist.” She added, “He is sort of like, ‘Well I can’t live in fear every day, so I’m just going to continue on with what I need to do.’” After news of Mr. Jin’s arrest emerged, Mike Pence, the former vice president, called on the Chinese government to release him, in a post on X . Corey Jackson, the founder of Luke Alliance, a U.S.-based group that advocates for persecuted Christians in China, said that the detentions were “without a doubt” the biggest crackdown on Christianity in China since 2018. “If this is the first move, then it could be far worse down the line,” he said. But he also said he expected Chinese Christians to keep trying to gather. “The Chinese church is probably stronger than the world realizes, maybe stronger than the Communist Party realizes,” he said. “And I think that’s part of the problem the Communist Party is facing.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/asia/china-church-pastor-detained.html,World,BBC,By Vivian Wang,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12int-china-pastor-glvb/12int-china-pastor-glvb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T03:27:10.824000+00:00,1d731853a7a100456470904ae5c5e76024e113c7
8a6748c2c07a,Bolivia Pushes to Reclaim the Coca Leaf From the Stigma of Cocaine,"bolivia, coca, regulation and deregulation, indigenous peoples, agriculture, drug abuse, cocaine and crack, evo morales","For decades, coca has been treated as contraband, the raw material for cocaine. The police rip out plants across the Andes, and Washington has poured billions into eradication campaigns. And yet here in Bolivia, where growing, selling and consuming coca is legal, a government communications officer steadied a tripod in the tiny Andean town of San José de Pery one afternoon, filming a farmer as he prepared the soil for coca. “I’m going to explain how to use this tool called a wallhua,” said the farmer, Jaime Mamani, 64, lifting a three-pronged rake. “There — you’ve just planted the seedling.” To many, coca exists solely as the basis of cocaine, a plant harvested, mixed with chemicals, altered in covert labs and trafficked across the globe. But in its natural form it is something else entirely: a mild stimulant chewed, brewed and revered in Andean communities for millennia. In fact, coca is such an integral part of the small, landlocked South American nation of Bolivia that its government is leading a campaign to press the United Nations to remove the leaf from the world’s list of most dangerous drugs. The U.N. classifies coca alongside fentanyl and heroin as “highly addictive and liable to abuse.” The United States has long opposed any changes, warning it would make it easier to expand cocaine production. In Colombia, the world’s largest cocaine producer, Washington has spent billions on eradication and counternarcotics operations — even as output continues rising. The results of a formal U.N. review are expected by March. Removing the coca leaf from the dangerous-drug list would free countries that have signed a U.N. convention on drugs from their requirement to criminalize coca. (Bolivia has been exempted from that rule.) Downgrading coca to a less restrictive category could still open the way for legal trade, scientific research and industrial development. But it is far from certain the United Nations will make any changes at all. Proponents argue that the leaf itself is not inherently harmful, and that equating it with cocaine criminalizes a cornerstone of Andean Indigenous heritage. A draft report by the World Health Organization, the U.N.’s public health agency, concluded that coca had very low potential for dependence and posed no major health risks. Still, some vendors in Bolivia sell coca leaves mixed with stimulants like caffeine called “reloaded coca,” and local journalists have documented potential health risks of these unregistered products. Bolivia’s efforts to change the coca leaf’s legal status may be affected by the runoff presidential election on Oct. 19. That contest is between two conservative candidates, and it is unclear whether either would champion coca as strongly as the leftist governments that have ruled for two decades. Farmers in designated zones cultivate coca in Bolivia to sell in state-run markets. Cocaine is produced in Bolivia, but its output ranks behind Colombia and Peru; much of the country’s coca is grown for traditional, legal use. And coca is everywhere in Bolivia: slipped into tea bags in upscale hotels, sold from street kiosks in flavors like orange and watermelon, chewed by drivers on long hauls, even placed in bowls on government officials’ desks. That ubiquity is relatively recent. The push to rip up crops that had sustained Indigenous communities for centuries as part of the U.S.-led war on drugs bred resentment and political mobilization, helping to propel the rise of Evo Morales, a coca growers’ union leader who in 2006 became Bolivia’s first Indigenous president. Mr. Morales made the plant central to his agenda. Under the banner of “ Coca Yes, Cocaine No, ” his government promoted traditional and modern uses, including coca tea, flour, toothpaste and other products, while still pledging to combat cocaine trafficking. His government enshrined coca as part of the nation’s cultural heritage in the 2009 Constitution, underscoring Indigenous identity and resistance to foreign drug policies. In 2012, Bolivia withdrew from the United Nations’ agreement on drugs, but it rejoined the following year after the U.N. granted an exemption allowing coca use within Bolivia’s borders. Bolivia passed a law in 2017 regulating cultivation, trade and consumption, formalizing a legal domestic market. “When I was a child, it was very frowned upon,” said Omar Pintones, 36, a coordinator for the government agency that oversees the coca industry. “Coca leaf consumption was for lower-class people. So there was often that element of shame.” Today, he added, “many professionals, lawyers, doctors, people at universities, people in all walks of life,” use coca leaves. In San José de Pery, a five-hour drive from the capital of La Paz, residents are proud of their coca work. Farmers rise as early as 3 a.m., tending plants that take three to four months to mature. Harvested leaves are dried, bundled and sold to distributors who supply retailers across Bolivia. The government sets a limit of roughly 54,000 acres nationwide for the legal cultivation of coca to help keep prices high for local farmers. The industry generates direct and indirect employment for tens of thousands of families. Luis Arce, who succeeded Mr. Morales as president in 2020, has taken Bolivia’s case to remove coca from the list of the most perilous drugs to the World Health Organization. An agency spokesman said its assessment would balance “the harms versus potential benefits” of the coca leaf, while also determining how easily it can be turned into cocaine. The Vice Ministry of Coca and Integral Development, a uniquely Bolivian institution, oversees the country’s coca industry. Bolivians in traditional Indigenous clothing routinely fill its hallways to renew their coca licenses. Mr. Pintones, who works for the ministry, said he and many of its employees come from coca-growing families and pushed to legalize coca. “I have eaten, grown, dressed, studied, and supported my family thanks to the coca leaf,” he said. “I consume coca leaves daily here at work and in my daily life. And I have never gone crazy or lost consciousness.” The ministry is collaborating with companies experimenting with new products — coca soda, ice cream, ointments, syrups and soaps — as well as with universities to study the leaf. Studies suggest coca may help increase alertness and lower blood pressure. Research has also pointed to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that could help fight infection. If the United Nations decides to loosen restrictions on the coca leaf, and other nations move to decriminalize, that could open a market for global trade in coca products. “Coca leaves have generated many jobs in Bolivia,” Mateo Mamani, Bolivia’s vice minister of coca, said in an interview, and being able to export the coca leaf would “generate good income for the state.” Researchers in Bolivia are conducting more studies on coca derivatives and their potential health benefits. “That’s what we want the world to understand,” Mr. Mamani said. “Yes it is used for illicit purposes, but if we look at the coca leaf in a positive light, we can get a lot out of it.” In Colombia and Peru, traditional coca use is also constitutionally protected, but it is not as ubiquitous as in Bolivia. Supporters of removing coca leaf from the U.N.’s list say separating traditional use from cocaine trafficking is feasible because tightly regulated legal markets could be closely monitored. U.S. officials argue that even if the leaf itself is relatively harmless, it is still the raw material for cocaine, and recognizing or legalizing coca internationally could weaken efforts to suppress cultivation and make enforcement harder. The Trump administration has cited cocaine trafficking to justify its attacks on boats officials say leave Venezuela bound for the United States. But even if an international coca market were to open, some critics said they worry that the greatest profits would be reaped by large corporations, and the windfall would not trickle down to Indigenous communities. Sdenka Silva, a Bolivian sociologist who has worked with coca farmers, founded the Museum of Coca, a small building nestled among backpacker hostels in central La Paz that educates visitors about the plant’s 8,000-year history among Indigenous communities. When cocaine was legal in many countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, she said, colonial powers like the Dutch cultivated coca in what is now Indonesia at a lower cost than elsewhere, undercutting the industries in Peru and Bolivia. “I’m afraid that something like that will happen with big companies,” she said. But coca’s champions are hopeful. “This should not be political,” Mr. Arce, the outgoing president, who is not seeking re-election, said in an interview. “The coca leaf is not a narcotic.’’",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/americas/bolivia-coca-plant-leaf-cocaine.html,World,BBC,By Genevieve Glatsky and Sara Wayra,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/world/11int-bolivia-coca-promo/11int-bolivia-coca-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T07:00:20+00:00,ec4a0035fafb7cb789443e02e34502007f25be3c

0c482d499a3b,China’s High Ambitions for Clean Energy,"tibet, energy industry, renewable energy, wind power, solar energy, electric power, israel, kidnapping and hostages","High energy This summer, I got a good look at China’s clean-energy future, more than 3,000 meters above sea level in Tibet. Solar panels stretch to the horizon and cover an area seven times the size of Manhattan. (They soak up sunlight that is much brighter than at sea level because the air is so thin.) Wind turbines dot nearby ridgelines, capturing night breezes. Hydropower dams sit where rivers spill down long chasms at the edges of the plateau. And high-voltage power lines carry this electricity to businesses and homes more than 1,500 kilometers away. The intention is to harness the region’s bright sunshine, cold temperatures and sky-touching altitude to power the plateau and beyond, including data centers used in China’s A.I. development. While China still burns as much coal as the rest of the world combined, last month President Xi Jinping promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and expand renewable energy by sixfold in the coming years. A big part of that effort is in sparsely inhabited Qinghai, a province in western China in a region known among the Tibetans as Amdo. I came as part of a government-organized media tour of clean-energy sites in Qinghai, which usually bars foreign journalists to hide dissent by its large ethnic Tibetan population. (The Times paid for my travel.) Today, I’ll tell you what I saw. China is not the first country to experiment with high-altitude clean energy. But other places — in Switzerland and Chile, for instance — are mountainous and steep. Qinghai, slightly bigger than France, is mostly flat. That’s perfect for solar panels and the roads needed to bring them in. And the cold air improves the panels’ efficiency. The ones in Qinghai could run every household in Chicago. And China is building more, including panels at 5,000 meters. The main group of solar farms, known as the Talatan Solar Park, dwarfs every other cluster of solar farms in the world. It covers 420 square kilometers in Gonghe County, an alpine desert. Electricity from solar and wind power in Qinghai (the birthplace of the current Dalai Lama, now in exile) costs about 40 percent less than coal-fired power. As a result, several electricity-intensive industries are moving to the region. One type of plant turns quartzite from mines into polysilicon to make solar panels. And Qinghai plans to quintuple the number of data centers in the province. At this altitude, they consume 40 percent less electricity than centers at sea level because they barely need air-conditioning. (Air warmed by the servers is piped away to heat other buildings.) As an incentive to build solar farms, many western Chinese provinces initially offered free land to companies. When the Talatan solar project installed its first panels in 2012, they were low to the ground. Ethnic Tibetan herders use the region’s sparse vegetation to graze their sheep, but the animals had trouble getting to the grass. Now, installers place the panels on higher mountings. Dislocating people for power projects is politically sensitive all over the world. But high-altitude projects affect relatively few people. China pushed more than one million people out of their homes in west-central China a quarter-century ago and flooded a vast area for the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam. This year, China has been installing enough solar panels every three weeks to match the power-generation capacity of that dam. See more photos here . Israelis and Palestinians await a hostage-prisoner swap The Israeli government said that the release of all of the hostages still alive in Gaza was expected to begin early today . At the same time, Israel is supposed to free about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The swap is taking place under a cease-fire deal that could eventually end two devastating years of war. President Trump is traveling to Israel to meet with the families of hostages and address the Israeli parliament. He is then scheduled to fly to Egypt for a summit with Arab leaders who supported the deal. Israeli authorities believe there are about 20 living hostages being held in Gaza, along with the remains of about 25 deceased captives. Here’s what we know about them . The agreement also provides for a major influx of aid into the Gaza Strip, which has been gripped by a severe humanitarian crisis that has worsened throughout the war.

Qantas said in a statement that cybercriminals stole 5.7 million of its customer records by targeting a call center that used a third-party customer service platform. Qantas said it was one of a number of companies around the world that were targeted in the attack. Qantas did not say how many of the records had been released. It also did not name the third-party platform or say which other companies had been targeted. The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the stolen records were limited to names, email addresses and frequent-flyer details, Qantas said in the statement. A smaller portion covered customers’ business or home addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, genders or meal preferences. Qantas said no further intrusions had occurred and that it was cooperating with Australian security agencies. The company also said it had obtained a court injunction to prevent the stolen data from being “accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published.” Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert in Australia, said that the leak appeared to be the first stemming from the July attack. The authorities investigating that attack have not disclosed which other firms were affected or how extensive the campaign may have been. Mr. Hunt said the court injunction was unlikely to have much impact, noting similar orders that had been issued and ignored in Australia and Britain. He said such orders essentially just ask criminals not to publish stolen data. “It’s completely useless,” Mr. Hunt said in an interview. Cyberattackers have exposed the personal data of millions of Australians by striking companies in telecommunications, health care and aviation. In 2022, the telecommunications company Optus disclosed a breach that compromised information for nearly 9.8 million customers, including names, birth dates, and identification numbers, the company said at the time. At the time, the breach was the largest in Australian history. The same year, Medibank Private reported that hacker s had accessed data from about 9.7 million policyholders, including medical claim details. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has begun civil penalty proceedings against Medibank. In 2024, the federal government announced that MediSecure, a provider of electronic prescription services, had sustained a cyberattack that affected about 13 million people, according to Australia’s Department of Home Affairs. Businesses and government agencies in Australia reported 1,113 data breaches in 2024, the highest since mandatory reporting began in 2018, according to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. That marked an about 25 percent increase from 893 breaches reported the previous year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/world/australia/australia-qantas-airlines-cyber-attack.html,World,BBC,By Mark Walker,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13xp-Qantas-1-bcqh/13xp-Qantas-1-bcqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-12T10:30:02+00:00,32b42acb261f412343eaf5a4f9dae46b49de7400
0b68de7d612f,Will the World’s Oldest President Win Another Term?,"paul biya, cameroon, president of the united states, election, voter fraud;electoral fraud, generation z;gen z, internal-open-access-from-nl","Paul Biya, the world’s oldest president, is seeking to extend his 42-year rule of Cameroon. Voters in Cameroon, in Central Africa, will go to the polls on Sunday. Absent from the ballot is Maurice Kamto, Mr. Biya’s main opponent, who was barred from running by the country’s electoral board. Analysts said the vote would be the most consequential in the country’s recent history. Living conditions have plummeted as the prices of fuel and other basic goods have increased. Mr. Biya, 92, promised that if re-elected, he would fix the economy, take on youth unemployment and address poverty. “I will never resign myself to the current situation,” he said at a rally on Tuesday. “Certainly, much has already been done. But I can assure you that the best is still to come.” But his tight grip on power may be waning. An unexpectedly spirited opposition led by former allies and young voters has taken root in recent months, inspired by a wave of Gen Z uprisings in Africa and around the world. What’s the state of the race? Mr. Kamto was barred from the ballot after the electoral commission controversially delayed a parliamentary election until next year. That decision left Mr. Kamto’s party with no seats, making him ineligible to run for president. He tried to run under a different party, but the commission rejected him. Mr. Biya appeared to be on course for another easy victory until Issa Tchiroma Bakary, his former spokesman and minister of employment, resigned from the government in June and began his own campaign. Mr. Bakary comes from the north, a traditional stronghold for Mr. Biya that represents a huge segment of the electorate. Bello Bouba Maigari, who was in charge of tourism until recently, is also running for president. Mr. Biya is still widely seen as the favorite. His supporters say his age is not an issue, though he would be 99 years old by the end of his next seven-year term. Chuo Walters, a lawyer and professor at the University of Bertoua who favors Mr. Biya, said the president “can think a thousand times faster than a 25- or 30-year-old.” Most analysts say elections in Cameroon are rigged in favor of keeping Mr. Biya in power. “The institutions are designed to ensure he wins,” said Hubert Kinkoh, a political and security analyst. Opponents accuse Mr. Biya of using his authority to intimidate the opposition and to control the courts and electoral commission. The youth vote Critics say Mr. Biya’s age and lack of a clear succession plan have created a leadership vacuum, gutted the economy and galvanized young people into political activism. “Young people here see Gen Z revolutions in countries like Kenya,” said Ngala Desmond Ngala, a Cameroonian youth activist. “They’re looking at what’s happening in these countries and looking at theirs and are saying, ‘Why can’t we even lead something like that in Cameroon?’” Last month, the president’s 27-year-old daughter, Brenda Biya, told young people on social media, “Don’t vote for my dad,” accusing him of making “too many people suffer.” She has since walked back her statement and apologized. “The average Cameroonian sits between the ages of around 17 to almost 40,” Mr. Ngala said. “The president has been in power for 40-plus years. So there’s a generational disconnect between the president and the young people.” “You could feel that, for the first time, change of government is possible through the ballots,” Mr. Kinkoh said, “because there is a whole new generation of voters who are more critical and are not swayed by party affiliations.” What’s at stake? Roughly one in every four Cameroonians is at risk of slipping into extreme poverty in the next 15 months, according to the World Bank. In several parts of the country, attacks by separatists and insurgents are frequent. Cameroon has two official languages, French and English, but the English-speaking western regions along the border with Nigeria have been trapped in a decade-old separatist conflict. When Mr. Bakary held a campaign rally in the town of Bamenda in Cameroon’s northwest region, he promised to release separatist fighters if elected. In the far north, where Mr. Biya had his only political rally during the campaign, violence has also ramped up as Boko Haram, a jihadist group with origins in Nigeria, kills and kidnaps civilians. Election details Polls will open at 8 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 12, and close at 6 p.m. It can take up to 15 days to declare a winner.

The paramilitary group, called the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., has for months tightened its siege of El Fasher, a city in the western region of Darfur that has become one of the worst battlegrounds of a two-year civil war between the R.S.F. and Sudan’s military. About 260,000 civilians are trapped in an ever-smaller space within the city, struggling with hunger, disease and mass displacement. In addition to the dozens killed at the shelter, around 43 were wounded, according to Suleman, a senior doctor at the nearby Al Saudi hospital, who asked to be identified by one name to protect his family from reprisals. He visited the site of the attack early on Saturday. Footage from the scene of the shelter, collected by locals and shared by Suleman, showed bloodied bodies, rubble and buildings with caved-in roofs. The shelter, called the Dar al-Arqam displacement center, is on the grounds of a university campus. It was struck as people were asleep in classrooms that had been converted into temporary shelters, while others were in underground bunkers, Suleman said.

Thank you, Trump!” the crowds filling the Tel Aviv plaza known as Hostages Square chanted in English as Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy, spoke from the podium, flanked by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s daughter and son-in-law. Mr. Witkoff spoke emotionally about the families of the hostages, saying their courage had affected him in ways he had never been before. “I dreamed of this night,” he said, alluding to the cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that he and Mr. Kushner helped negotiate , and that provides for the release of the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners by Monday. “I only wish the president was here,” Mr. Witkoff added in his address, which was broadcast live on Israeli television. “He would love this.” Israelis have rallied in the thousands on Saturday nights for most of the past two years, demanding that all the captives still held in Gaza be brought back “Now!” Those filling the square and the surrounding streets on Saturday night were hoping that this rally might be the last. Under the terms of the cease-fire deal , which came into effect at noon Friday , all living hostages in Gaza should be returned to Israel within 72 hours. Israel believes that 20 of the hostages held by Hamas are still alive. “Our struggle is not over and will not end until the last hostage returns home!” said the Hostages Families Forum, an organization that has advocated for a hostage deal throughout the war and represents many of their families. “The entire nation holds its breath in anticipation” of the hostages’ return, the group added. Rallies were also taking place at other locations around Israel, including in a square in Jerusalem near the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In contrast to the enthusiasm and gratitude shown to Mr. Trump and his aides, however, the crowd in Tel Aviv greeted Mr. Witkoff’s attempts to thank Mr. Netanyahu for his role in the cease-fire effort with loud boos. Just weeks ago, Mr. Netanyahu criticized protesters who called for an end of the war and a deal to release the hostages, accusing them of “hardening Hamas’s stance” and pushing off the captives’ return. Critics of the prime minister have accused him, in turn, of prolonging the war to appease his far-right political allies on whose support he relies to stay in power. As part of the deal, the remains of hostages who died in captivity in Gaza would also be released. But it will most likely take longer for all the deceased hostages to be located and returned to Israel, according to the Israeli authorities. The government has said that the remains of 26 hostages are believed to still be in Gaza, while the condition of two other people has not been confirmed. They are among the roughly 250 who were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and ignited the war. In the months preceding the cease-fire deal, many Israelis said they were despondent and doubtful about whether the weekly rallies were having any effect on the government. But many showed up nevertheless, saying that, if nothing else, they wanted to keep the hostages on the public agenda and support the captives’ families — assuring them that they were not alone. “We understood that there wasn’t enough discourse about the hostages, we understood that we have to stand by the families,” said Yael Elraz Shapira, 57, an organizational psychologist who has attended most of the rallies. “The least we could do was to show solidarity,” she said on Saturday as she was on her way to the square. Ms. Elraz Shapira added that seeing other people each week who also felt it was important to be there had given her hope and a feeling that the long-polarized country could “begin to heal.” The rallies did not go unnoticed by Mr. Trump, who in September announced a proposal to end the war that led to the cease-fire agreement. He appeared flattered by the appeals of demonstrators, who increasingly focused on him and his leadership as their only hope to get their loved ones home, with many holding banners that called for his personal intervention. Standing alongside Mr. Netanyahu at the White House late last month, presenting the outline of the propos al, Mr. Trump referred to the rallies. “They have my name up. They like me,” he said. He added, “They say two things, please get the hostages back and please end the war. They’ve had it.” The main rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday also featured speeches by former hostages who were released during the last brief cease-fire, and the relatives of those still in Gaza, as well as performances by some of Israel’s top musicians, including the singer Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the October 2023 attack.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-square-rally.html,World,BBC,By Isabel Kershner,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-israel-rally-gwzb/11int-israel-rally-gwzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T14:30:25+00:00,492f72dffd40c6a2241789e059e7514aa734afa3
4b790e21f4b3,‘Over the Clouds’: Families of Palestinian Prisoners Await Their Release,"amnesties commutations and pardons, israel gaza war, palestinians, prison, terrorism, kidnapping and hostages, peace process, hamas, gaza strip, west bank, israel","Fuad Kamamji described the moment he saw his son’s name on a list of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel as one of “rare happiness.” “We have been accepting God’s fate in the worst conditions,” Mr. Kamamji said. “We were content with all the difficult things that came our way. But now, we are feeling a joy we haven’t known in a long time.” His son, Eham Kamamji, 39, was arrested in 2006 and has been serving a life sentence since his conviction for the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli settler, Eliyahu Asheri. He has been in solitary confinement since 2021, when he was among six Palestinians who temporarily escaped from Israel’s Gilboa Prison in what Israeli officials said was the largest Palestinian jailbreak in more than two decades . On Friday, Israel released a list of prisoners to be freed as part of the cease-fire deal that it reached with Hamas. Under the agreement, the Palestinian militant group will free the remaining 48 hostages it holds, of which Israel believes 20 are still alive. Israel will release about 250 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom are serving life sentences, and 1,700 Gazans who were detained during the war and were not involved in the attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, according to a government resolution released on Friday. Most of those who are serving life sentences did not deny the accusations when they were convicted, and said they were acting as resistance fighters. While Eham Kamamji was on the list of prisoners set to be freed, it indicated that he would be sent into exile, rather than being permitted to return home to Jenin, in the West Bank. Fuad Kamamji said he was holding off from celebrating because his son had been mentioned in prior swap deals that never materialized. “But what I’m feeling now is a strong sense of relief and peace,” he said. “I believe my son will be out, whether among us or in exile. The important thing is that he’ll be free.” Across the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians with imprisoned relatives have been absorbing the news of who would be released, who would be exiled, and who would remain behind bars — namely, prisoners whose release Israel sees as intolerable. One of those Israel has refused to free is Hassan Salama, 54, a senior Hamas figure. He was sentenced to more than 40 life terms in prison for orchestrating suicide bombings in 1996 that killed dozens of Israelis and wounded hundreds, after Israel’s assassination of the militant group’s well-known bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash. Ghufran Zamel, 42, became engaged to Mr. Salama 16 years ago, when he was already behind bars. Last year, she emigrated to Turkey. Ms. Zamel said she feared that Hamas’s release of all the Israeli hostages, ending any leverage it holds, “would mean a death sentence” to any Palestinian prisoner not on Israel’s release list. For many of the families of the Israeli victims of the attacks, however, the news that the perpetrators would be freed stirred complicated emotions. Renana Meir, whose mother, Dafna, was stabbed to death outside her home in the West Bank settlement of Otniel in 2016, wrote in an Israeli newspaper on Friday that the imminent release of her mother’s killer would pose a threat to Israelis everywhere. Still, she believed that her mother would have been in favor of their release in exchange for the return of Israeli hostages. “I know you would have done this without thinking twice, if it were up to you,” she wrote. More than half of the prisoners to be released by Israel are to be sent into exile, according to the list, but it was unclear where they would be sent. That includes Basem Khandaqji, a Palestinian writer who was sentenced to three life terms for his involvement in the Carmel Market suicide bombing in 2004, which killed three Israelis and wounded dozens more. While in prison, Mr. Khandaqji has published poetry collections and several novels, including the acclaimed “ A Mask, the Color of the Sky,” which won the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2024 . His sister, Amani Khandaqji, said she felt “over the clouds” about his possible release. “He could be deported,” she said, “but at least he will be free.” Sara Salem, a resident of Jericho, in the West Bank, was waiting for the release of her husband, Ahmad Kaabnah, a veteran Fatah member, who has been behind bars for 28 of his 54 years, after being convicted of killing two Israeli settlers. She said she had barely slept since the deal was announced. “I couldn’t even open the TV to see if the cease-fire had come into effect or not because it was all eating me up inside,” she said. Ms. Salem was pregnant with their second child when Mr. Kaabnah was arrested. They had a third later through in vitro fertilization, with sperm smuggled out of prison. Today, Mr. Kaabnah has five grandchildren, with a sixth on the way. He has not been allowed to meet with anyone, including his family, since before the war in Gaza, Ms. Salem said. She said she hoped Mr. Kaabnah “would return to us,” but he, too, is slated for exile once he is freed. Still, his potential release has her racked with tension, Ms. Salem said. “We are sitting like on fire,” she said, “and waiting for the news to tell us our Ahmad will be free.” Johnatan Reiss contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/palestinian-prisoners-release-families.html,World,BBC,By Fatima AbdulKarim,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/world/11int-palestinian-prisoners-01-afif/11int-palestinian-prisoners-01-afif-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T12:30:36+00:00,8d53f7d78cf5171550bc72e0fa72884631d1cb1f
023991cce0b0,"A Memo in a Bunker, Intercepted Communications and Hamas’s Oct. 7 Plans","israel gaza war, terrorism, war crimes;genocide;crimes against humanity, military, spying and intelligence agencies, palestinians, hamas, yehya sinwar, gaza strip, israel","After assassinating a top Hamas commander, Muhammed Sinwar, in May 2025, the Israeli military sent a special unit into an underground complex he had used. There, they found a computer unconnected to a network — and much harder to access by Israeli operations spying on Hamas communications. The computer held an image of a six-page memo, handwritten in Arabic, that the Israeli intelligence community believes was by his brother Yahya Sinwar, who as the powerful leader of Hamas in Gaza helped plot the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Dated Aug. 24, 2022, it appears to be a directive from Mr. Sinwar with instructions for the assault, according to seven Israeli officials. The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, calls for fighters to target soldiers and civilian communities — as well as to broadcast the violent acts so as to evoke fear in Israelis and destabilize the country. Commanders then issued similar instructions on Oct. 7, according to hours of previously unreported communications between commanders and subordinates intercepted by Israel during the assault and shared with The Times. The Israeli officials say the memo shows that Mr. Sinwar wanted his fighters to target civilians from the outset, contradicting what the group’s leadership has publicly claimed. Although the memo does not explicitly mention plans to kidnap or kill civilians, it lays out orders for fighters to enter residential neighborhoods and set them on fire “with gasoline or diesel from a tanker.” “Two or three operations, in which an entire neighborhood, kibbutz, or something similar will be burned, must be prepared,” the memo said. In an echo to the memo, just before 10 a.m. on Oct. 7, a commander from a Gaza City battalion referred to as Abu Muhammed told subordinates: “Start setting homes on fire.” “Burn, burn,” he said, according to the intercepts. “I want the whole kibbutz to be in flames.” “Set fire to anything,” a commander in the northern Gaza city of Jabaliya referred to as Abu al-Abed said around the same time. The memo and the intercepts broaden the understanding of Hamas’s planning and execution of the Oct. 7 attack, much of which is based on other documents and recordings collected by Israel during the war. Israel and Hamas have now agreed to a cease-fire, with the militant group’s future in Gaza uncertain. Sima Ankona, who formerly served as a document examination expert in the Israeli police, said the handwriting in the memo matches other examples from Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024. Ms. Ankona, at the request of The Times, compared the document with samples that Israeli authorities had collected, including those captured by the military in Gaza, a note Mr. Sinwar wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018, and his signature on a statement to the Israeli police in 1989. (He was convicted later that year of killing four Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.) The Times translated the memo. Several words and phrases in it appear in other Hamas documents previously reviewed by The Times. Izzat al-Rishq, the Qatar-based director of Hamas’s media office, did not respond to a list of detailed questions, including whether Hamas’s leadership outside Gaza was aware of the memo and the orders that commanders gave militants on Oct. 7. Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian analyst close to Hamas, cast doubt on the authenticity of the memo, asserting that most of the acts described in the document did not occur in the Oct. 7 assault, such as the burning of entire neighborhoods. (Many homes were set on fire in the course of the attacks.) He added that the memo did not represent the culture of Hamas’s military wing. The intercepts were collected on the day of the attack by 8200, the Israeli military’s signals intelligence unit, according to three Israeli security officials, who shared them with The Times. The Times reviewed and translated hours of the intercepted recordings, which included communications in Arabic among commanders and eight groups of fighters. The memo and the intercepts, said several Israeli officials, have been studied by Israel to deepen their understanding of Hamas’s attack. The Gazit Institute, a think tank affiliated with the Israeli military intelligence directorate, prepared a confidential report on the materials, saying that the “Hamas leadership planned and carried out an attack that featured acts of ‘extraordinary brutality.’” “Its aim was to cause great turmoil in the country and the military,” said the report, which was reviewed by The Times. The security lapses revealed in the Oct. 7 attack, including Israel’s failure to find such documents ahead of time and its disregard of other warnings, have prompted a broad examination by the Israeli intelligence community. The attack, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, shattered Israeli’s sense of security. The Israeli officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. During the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas and its allies killed some 1,200 people and abducted about 250 others to Gaza. Israel, in response, unleashed its full military might in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of its residents, and reduced cities to rubble. Israel has been condemned internationally for its conduct in the war and faced accusations of war crimes from human rights groups. It has been accused by a United Nations commission of committing genocide, which the Israeli government has denied. In May 2024, Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, accused Yahya Sinwar and two other senior Hamas officials of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including “extermination” and “murder.” The crimes were committed as a part of “a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Israel by Hamas and other armed groups,” Mr. Khan said when he announced the charges. Under international law, armies and armed groups must not deliberately target civilians or inflict disproportionate harm on them to achieve military goals. In particular, killing and taking as hostages those who are uninvolved in hostilities are serious violations of the Geneva Conventions. The handwritten memo and intercepts offer a more granular look at the group’s thinking and its actions in real time. The memo outlined a plan for a surprise attack on Israel, calling for bulldozers to make openings in the fence separating Gaza and Israel, and multiple waves of attackers. It expressed hope that the acts would have high shock value. “Stomp on the heads of soldiers,” it said. It listed “opening fire on soldiers at point-blank range, slaughtering some of them with knives, blowing up tanks.” Commanders echoed similar instructions on the day of the attack, according to the intercepts. “Slit their throats,” a commander from a battalion in northern Gaza told his team. “Slit them as you are trained.” Roughly 300 soldiers were killed in the Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli authorities. The intercepts captured Hamas combatants broadly calling for violence and taking captives. When a militant asked if he should confront people on the road, a commander from a Jabaliya battalion referred to as Abu Muath responded in the affirmative: “Kill everyone on the road,” he said. “Kill everyone you encounter.” “Now we are at the beginning of the kibbutz,” said one combatant. “We have wiped out those in it. There are settlers whom we killed.” “Guys, take a lot of hostages,” said the commander, Abu Muath, according to the intercepts. “Take a lot of hostages.” The group’s actions, the memo said, should be broadcast to the Arab world to mobilize people outside Gaza to join the fight. The plan envisioned that Palestinians in the West Bank, Arabs in Israel and “our nation” — either a reference to Arabs or Muslims or both — would “respond positively to calls for them to join the revolution.” “It needs to be affirmed to the unit commanders to undertake these actions intentionally, film them and broadcast images of them as fast as possible,” the memo said. The minutes of Hamas’s secret meetings in the run-up to the Oct. 7 attack also show how Mr. Sinwar was determined to persuade Hamas’s allies, Iran and Hezbollah, to join in the assault, or commit to a broader fight with Israel. In the Oct. 7 intercepts, Hamas commanders can be heard urging combatants to film their actions to likewise encourage others to join the fight. “Document the scenes of horror, now, and broadcast them on TV channels to the whole world,” a commander from Gaza City called Abu al-Baraa told operatives in the area of Kibbutz Sa’ad. “Slaughter them. End the children of Israel.” Abu Muath, the commander, said, “It is essential that you bring the drone in so it films for the entire Islamic world.” Hamas officials also made public statements on the day of the attack, encouraging people outside Gaza to participate in the battle, though they ultimately failed to incite a popular uprising. The Israeli military “won’t be able to attend to confrontations on other fronts,” Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of Hamas’s political office said in a recorded message broadcast on Al Jazeera on Oct 7. “After today, no one can hold back his rifle, bullet, pistol, knife, car, or Molotov cocktail.” Israel assassinated Mr. al-Arouri in January 2024.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-plans.html,World,BBC,By Ronen Bergman and Adam Rasgon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/09int-sinwar-doc-1-phtb/08int-sinwar-doc-1-phtb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T11:27:08+00:00,ce31256284441793ca9c511d2755cbe6c2205044
2882642a3f2e,"A New Book Asks, What Is Canada?","canada, books, us foreign policy, writer, elamin abdelmahmoud, margaret atwood","Prime Minister Mark Carney’s White House visit and the Toronto Blue Jays’ playoff victory over the New York Yankees dominated the news this week. But it’s the subtext that I’ll focus on today, using a book coming out next week as a springboard. Since moving to Canada last year, I have been captivated by the intense debate about the nation’s identity, and how it is shaped by Canada’s relationship to the United States. I was born and raised in Greece, where identity is heavily defined by reverence for a glorious past. So one of the things that have struck me about Canada’s identity conversation in the era of President Trump’s “51st state” talk is how much it is focused on the future. “Elbows Up! Canadian Voices of Resilience and Resistance” (McClelland & Stewart, out Oct. 14), tackles the newly urgent question, What is Canada? The book also explores how the country can reassert its independence and step out of the leaden shadow of American cultural hegemony. A collection of 30 essays edited by Elamin Abdelmahmoud, an author and critic who hosts the CBC program “Commotion,” the book includes powerful Indigenous and immigrant Canadian voices, Québécois authors, and sports and culture experts. “What emerges,” Mr. Abdelmahmoud writes in the introduction, “is not a declarative nationalism but something quieter: a steady belief in the sturdiness of an unfinished project.” The book draws inspiration, and a couple of essays, from the 1968 collection “The New Romans: Candid Canadian Opinions of the U.S.” It does not cover the perspective of people who believe that Canada should acquiesce to the United States — or that it would be better off doing so. Nor does it get into the politics of the phrase “Elbows up” as a Liberal rallying cry. I asked Mr. Abdelmahmoud if the book could be read as partisan. “It’s really worth emphasizing that ‘Elbows up’ was not invented by Mark Carney,” he said. “I think there was a deliberate political intelligence to the ways Mark Carney used the slogan, but it became a catchall phrase on the threats to Canadian sovereignty a few weeks before that,” he added. Too many passages from different essays stood out for me, but here are three I highlighted while reading an advance copy. Margaret Atwood, Canada’s foremost living author, writes: “In 1963, when I was working for a market research company, the majority of Canadians in one of our surveys answered ‘No’ to the question ‘Is there a difference between Canada and the United States?’ Though they also answered ‘No’ when asked if Canada should join the United States. It seems they knew there was a difference, but they didn’t know what it was.” Carol Off, a prominent Canadian journalist, offers an in-depth treatise on the impoverishment of Canadian cultural output, partly because of the overwhelming gravitational pull — and money — of the American alternative. “Do we have the courage, or even the desire, to resist assimilation?” she asks. She goes on to make a strong case that Canadians should find both, pronto. The Vancouver-based author Jen Sookfong Lee lays down a scathing critique of the country, while simultaneously expressing faith in it. “So what are we fighting for now? Am I fighting for the idea of Gold Mountain, the idealized version of Canada that prompted my grandfather to leave his village at the age of seventeen?” she writes. “I am choosing to believe that Canada can be the country my grandfather once dreamed of,” she continues, “but that I can also be the Canada that I would wish for my children and grandchildren.” Mr. Abdelmahmoud told me that, ultimately, “it’s a book that says we can’t ignore the reality of our vulnerability, so how should we think about it?” If you’re looking for more Canadian political writing, the Writers’ Trust of Canada recently celebrated exceptional samples of the genre from the past year. At the trust’s Politics and the Pen event in Ottawa last month, judges awarded the 2025 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing to Raymond B. Blake, a University of Regina history professor, for his “Canada’s Prime Ministers and the Shaping of a National Identity.” Finalists included “The Prince,” a political biography of Justin Trudeau by Stephen Maher; Tanya Talaga’s searing examination of residential schools, “The Knowing”; “Health for All: A Doctor’s Prescription for a Healthier Canada,” by Jane Philpott, a former health minister; and “The Adaptable Country: How Canada Can Survive The Twenty-First Century,” by Alasdair Roberts, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts. Looking ahead, a punchy, urgent book, “Breaking Point: The New Big Shifts Putting Canada at Risk,” by Darrell Bricker, a pollster and political analyst, and John Ibbitson, a journalist, will be published by Signal/McClelland & Stewart on Oct. 28.

2187cc310c9f,"Thousands Return to Northern Gaza, Hopeful, but Faced With Devastation","israel gaza war, peace process, palestinians, humanitarian aid, us foreign policy, un, gaza city, gaza strip, israel, hamas, donald trump","Thousands of people traveled by foot toward Gaza City on Saturday as a cease-fire held overnight, but early accounts described devastation across the area. “The scale of destruction is really staggering,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokeswoman for the United Nations’ humanitarian office, who visited the city this week. “We have a lot of people moving north to Gaza City and arriving to find the ruins where their homes used to be, so there is a lot of conflicted emotion.” Mediators hope the cease-fire, which began at noon Friday, will lead to the end of two years of war as the first phase of a 20-point peace plan presented in September by President Trump. A summit in support of the peace proposal will be held on Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, and chaired by Mr. Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, according to a statement from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain will also attend the summit, according to statements from their respective governments. Mr. Trump was also expected to visit Israel’s Parliament in Jerusalem on Monday, according to a spokesman for the chamber. In Gaza, joy at the pause in fighting has been tempered by the scale of destruction that many face as they return to the north. Hundreds of thousands of people fled Gaza City last month as Israel began a ground offensive there. “We’re back in our city, but it doesn’t feel like it,” said Manal Muftah, 33. “We lost everything.” She said she was a baker before the war and hoped to rebuild her business if the cease-fire turned into lasting peace. But the day when things would return to how they were before the conflict “still feels far away,” she said. “Maybe our grandchildren will see Gaza rebuilt,” Ms. Muftah said. “Whoever lives long enough will see it — the Gaza we remember.” Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defense emergency rescue service, said on Saturday that 63 bodies had been recovered in the streets of Gaza City since the cease-fire began. He said he believed dozens more were probably under the rubble. The director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said the health care system would face “severe shortages” and “immense” challenges as people returned to the city. “We’ve finished one war and entered another,” he said. Gaza is in a deep humanitarian crisis, with widespread hunger, vast destruction of property and most of its two million people displaced repeatedly in two years of war. The territory was impoverished before the war, and food supplies and other aid have been sharply curtailed since the conflict began, making circumstances much worse. The agreement reached on Thursday between Israel and Hamas contains stipulations for an increase of aid into the enclave. Israel will allow the United Nations to deliver larger amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza starting on Sunday, according to a senior U.N. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. The United Nations has said about 170,000 metric tons of food, medicine and other supplies are staged and ready to be transported. The truce reached this week describes an exchange of hostages and prisoners, and says Israeli troops would partly withdraw to new deployment lines inside the territory. But it does not address some of the key stipulations in the plan presented by Mr. Trump in September, including whether Hamas will agree to disarm. Mr. Trump nevertheless told reporters on Friday that he believed there was “consensus on most” of the plan and that the hostages would be released on Monday. “They’re getting them now,” he said. “They’re in some pretty rough places. Only a few people know where they are in some cases.” On Saturday, the Israeli military said its chief of staff had taken U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and former adviser on the region, on a field tour of Gaza. For many of those walking the coastal road from southern to northern Gaza, the pause in fighting offered a chance to return home and to learn what remained of their lives there. For some, the experience was sobering. “Today I feel nothing,” said Maisoun Wadi, 36, as she sat on the side of the road among a heap of bags, household items and a scrap of tarp. “Not sadness, not joy — just emptiness.” She was shocked to see how much the city had changed since she and her family fled weeks ago. “It was already destroyed, but what I see now is worse,” she said. “We have no house. I’ll tie this tarp to any standing wall and hang a blanket for a roof.” The most pressing question for her was how to survive. “I don’t care what’s agreed on in Egypt,” she said. “I care about a tent, about water.” Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/return-gaza-city-ceasefire.html,World,BBC,"By Liam Stack, Bilal Shbair and Saher Alghorra",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-gaza-return-promo-ptvh/11int-gaza-return-promo-ptvh-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:43:55+00:00,b6f3b60f22d5d71ff606042c3a576d82850e416e

Being depicted as the author of a piece in People’s Daily, the voice of the ruling party, is no small matter; it suggested that Mr. James was endorsing Beijing’s message at a time of deep tensions with Washington. For Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., that crossed a line. “Taking words somebody said and then making it seem as a first-person Op-Ed,” Mr. Silver told The New York Times, in his first comments about the incident, “would not be appropriate .” The backlash in America to what people thought was an opinion piece was swift. Conservative commentators said Mr. James was letting Beijing use his fame to whitewash the image of the authoritarian government. One website said the N.B.A. was “groveling to the communists.” The incident was only the latest reminder of the potential political minefield the league faces as it resumes play in China after a six-year absence. The Brooklyn Nets will play the Phoenix Suns in Macau on Sunday night, the second of two preseason games. The games are the result of a yearslong effort by the league — and by Patrick Dumont, a casino mogul turned team owner — to regain its footing in China, a hugely important market. China has its own reasons for welcoming back the N.B.A. The Chinese government has been struggling to breathe life into an economy where people have been holding back on spending. Beijing wants to use sports and international events to “boost overall consumption,” said Crystal Wang, an expert on Chinese sports with the consultancy Deloitte in Shanghai. “That is from the top.” According to state media, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping has a soft spot for basketball, having played pickup games while working as a local official in Hebei Province. Beijing hopes the league can showcase China as open and welcoming. The government has turned to athletes, scholars and influencers to promote “people to people” ties aimed at countering hostility from both sides of the political aisle in the United States. Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, for instance, cited what he described as Mr. James’s Op-Ed for People’s Daily, saying on X : “It’s heartening to see sports are bringing our people closer.” Basketball is wildly popular in China. That is what makes N.B.A. stars so valuable there — but it also forces the players to walk a razor-thin line between sports and politics. It is a line the league has stumbled over before. In 2019, Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests. That and the league’s refusal to punish Mr. Morey shut the N.B.A. out of China for years, costing the league more than $300 million in revenue. But N.B.A. athletes who have traveled to China after the incident have found a lucrative market. The Los Angeles Clippers star James Harden, who has criticized Mr. Morey, praised China and even hinted at moving there, has been rewarded by Chinese fans. In 2023, he sold 10,000 bottles of wine from his personal label on a Chinese livestream in seconds. When Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors toured western China in August, he was greeted by an enormous drone show, sponsored by a local tourism board, that depicted him high-fiving a panda. Players know to steer clear of politics, said Terry Rhoads, a Shanghai-based sports consultant who helped build a market for the N.B.A. in China while working for Nike. “Every single N.B.A. player that comes out to China is being briefed on, ‘Hey, we’re out there to have fun. We’re out there to get the kids loving basketball.’” Mr. Silver said that China put no conditions on speech ahead of the N.B.A. resuming play. But the stakes of offending China are clear. And they cut both ways: Players also face criticism in the United States if they seem too cozy with Beijing — as the LeBron James episode with People’s Daily showed. Adam Mendelsohn, an adviser to Mr. James, sought to downplay that incident, saying that the media had “incorrectly characterized” the piece as an Op-Ed that he had written. But People’s Daily had described the player as the author of the essay, and promoted it on its official social media account with a post titled: “LeBron James Writes in People’s Daily.” Mr. James had also been accused of pandering to China in 2019 when he criticized Mr. Morey over the tweet. “So many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually,” he said at the time. “Yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.” Joy Dong contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/asia/china-nba-lebron.html,World,BBC,By Mara Hvistendahl and Tania Ganguli,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/00int-china-nba-risks-02-kgqj/00int-china-nba-risks-02-kgqj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:01:41+00:00,b8697503b9456d1d223d5d96d060cda36218ed7f
451456983214,How a Las Vegas Casino Mogul Helped Bring N.B.A. Games Back to China,"basketball, gambling, casino, freedom of speech, nba, xi jinping, daryl morey, lebron james, adam silver, las vegas sands","In 2021, the casino mogul Patrick Dumont approached the N.B.A. commissioner with a brazen idea: Bring American professional basketball back to China. The N.B.A.’s relationship with Beijing had been in tatters for two years, after a team executive’s tweet in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The resulting controversy cost the league hundreds of millions of dollars. Partners pulled their sponsorships. China’s state broadcaster CCTV stopped airing games. Western companies that clash so publicly with Beijing rarely get second chances. But Mr. Dumont, an executive with one of the world’s most profitable casino operators, believed that the National Basketball Association could get back into China through Macau, the semiautonomous city where his company ran several highly lucrative casinos. Mr. Dumont and his family had billions at stake. Las Vegas Sands, which is owned by his mother-in-law, Miriam Adelson, and other family members, was selling its Nevada properties to focus on Asia. The Covid-19 pandemic had devastated profits. And Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, was tightening control of Macau and insisting that casinos diversify beyond gambling. That last demand meant that Sands needed to spend big on outside entertainment or risk its license. The league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, was intrigued by a Sands partnership. What followed was years of diplomacy by Sands, whose owner, Ms. Adelson, is among President Trump’s top donors. Sands executives met repeatedly with Chinese and Macau officials and hosted events celebrating “one country two systems,” Beijing’s term for its governance of Hong Kong and Macau. The Adelson family, with Mr. Dumont at the helm, even bought a majority stake in an N.B.A. team, the Dallas Mavericks. (He said that the purchase had no connection to his efforts to bring the N.B.A. to Macau.) All of it culminates in Macau this weekend in two preseason games between the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns at the Venetian Arena , a Sands property. The games are part of a five-year agreement for the N.B.A. to return to China. “It’s certainly a belief of ours that the two world’s largest economies should have continued dialogue,” said Ron Reese, a Sands spokesman. “It’s in everybody’s best interest.” The story of how the deal came together is an example of how casino profits, connections and quiet diplomacy healed a political wound. It is a win for the N.B.A., which lost more than $300 million in its rift with Beijing. It is also a win for Chinese leaders, who have sought to burnish China’s global image through influencers, sports figures and other celebrities. “Sports exchanges between China and the United States reflect public sentiment and serve both sides’ interests,” the Chinese Embassy in Washington said. The N.B.A. never abandoned its Chinese ambitions. It kept its China offices open. Teams hired experts to put content on Chinese social media. Executives from the Brooklyn Nets, which is owned by Joe Tsai, the chairman of the Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group, met with Chinese officials and diplomats. The league donated to China during the pandemic and installed the son of a former CCTV executive at the helm of N.B.A. China. Mr. Silver said that the league made no promises to China to curtail speech, and that the N.B.A. would defend the rights of players and team officials to speak freely. But league and team officials said they were keenly aware of the consequences of another controversy. “In our job, we have to talk about what’s the most important thing, which is to speak through the game,” Jordi Fernández, the Nets coach, said in Macau this past week. Things have changed since the 2019 controversy. Many players are muting or eliminating their activism, and the N.B.A., like other leagues, now mostly avoids taking political positions. And while human rights groups and politicians criticized the N.B.A. for not taking a tougher stance against Beijing back then, the return to China has sparked little uproar. “We’re not looking to go over and poke anyone in the eye,” Mr. Silver said. “We’re not setting out to create a diplomatic incident.” Chaos in a Crucial Market The October 2019 preseason trip to Shanghai and Shenzhen should have been an easy moneymaker. The N.B.A. sent its marquee franchise, the Los Angeles Lakers, to play the Brooklyn Nets. Two of the stars, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, were to face off in a country that loved American basketball. At peak viewership, more people watched the N.B.A. finals in China than in the United States, according to estimates in the Chinese news media. The trip came amid pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Millions of people were taking to the streets, some of them clashing with the police, in a high-profile challenge to Mr. Xi’s power over the city. Days before the games, Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted an image on Twitter that said, “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” Derek Chang, then the chief executive of N.B.A. China, recalled what happened next: “Everything started to explode.” With Chinese officials irate, the N.B.A. released two statements — the Chinese version much more contrite than the English. That angered just about everyone. Mr. Silver gave interviews defending Mr. Morey’s right to free speech. The broadcaster CCTV announced it would cease airing N.B.A. games. The Lakers and Nets watched from their Shanghai hotel as workers removed ads for the game, peeling their faces off the building across the street. Mr. James, in an interview with The New York Times last year, remembered wondering, “How fast can we get out of here?” Mr. Chang said he spent the next few months “trying to look for the avenue back” to China. He did not see one. A Big Bet on Basketball Macau is the world’s casino capital, with gambling returns dwarfing those of Las Vegas. In 2021, when Mr. Dumont broached the idea of N.B.A. games, Macau accounted for nearly 70 percent of his company’s revenue. A former Portuguese colony, Macau was reclaimed by China a quarter-century ago and declared a special administrative zone. Like Hong Kong, it faces increasing pressure from Beijing as Mr. Xi strips away some of its independence. One pressure point was gambling. Foreign casinos need licenses, called concessions, to operate. And as it negotiated the 2022 renewals, the Macau government was demanding: higher taxes, the right to cancel concessions in the name of national security and, crucially, more spending on events unrelated to gambling. Like sports. High rollers had long used casino junkets to evade China’s restrictions on moving cash internationally. The city had a reputation as a haven for bribery. Las Vegas Sands even paid an S.E.C. fine in 2016 to settle accusations of foreign corruption (the company admitted no wrongdoing). Mr. Xi was cracking down on junkets and corruption. Leaders wanted to rebrand Macau as family friendly — with casinos footing the bill. “It’s like the government of France going to every restaurant in France and saying, ‘We want to be less reliant on the cuisine industry,’” said Andrew W. Scott, the chief executive of Inside Asian Gaming, an industry publication based in Macau. For Sands and the other foreign casino operators, remaining in Macau was essential. “They didn’t have a lot of leverage,” Mr. Scott said. “You never resist the government.” Sands suddenly needed to spend billions on outside entertainment to guarantee its license. The arena at the Venetian had hosted mostly concerts and would need to be modernized. But a big-ticket event like the N.B.A. could help publicize the Venetian on the mainland, where casinos are banned from advertising. “We started thinking about our next phase of investment, which is part of our concession renewal. How can we invest more and innovate in both tourism and hospitality?” Mr. Dumont said. “We felt like the N.B.A. would be a good way to do that. We had the arena. We had the obviously very strong fan base in China.” When other sports leagues have repaired rifts with China, they have done so on Beijing’s terms. The English Premier League team Arsenal distanced itself from one of its players in 2020 after he criticized China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, who have faced human rights abuses . And the Women’s Tennis Association suspended play in China in 2021 and demanded an investigation into a Chinese player’s accusations of sexual assault by a government official. Two years later , the association returned to China, acknowledging it did not expect its demands to be met. Mr. Silver is adamant that the N.B.A. made no concessions. Tiptoeing Toward Reconciliation There were signs that Beijing was open to reconciliation. In February 2020, the N.B.A. sent $2.65 million in medical supplies to Hubei Province, the center of the Covid-19 outbreak, earning it accolades in the Chinese state press. That year, the league named Michael Ma, the son of a well-regarded former CCTV executive, as the new head of its China operations. The network aired two N.B.A. finals games that year and resumed broadcasting a regular slate of N.B.A. games in 2022. That “sent a signal to the rest of the community, other current business partners or potential business partners, that we were no longer being punished,” Mr. Silver said. The following year, Mr. Dumont and his family bought the Mavericks. The N.B.A. had no qualms about being in business with a casino operator. The league hosts a tournament each summer in Las Vegas, where Tilman Fertitta, the Rockets owner, owns the Golden Nugget. Mr. Silver has long supported legalized sports betting. The China deal was not a factor in the N.B.A. approving the Mavericks sale, Mr. Silver said. But it had advantages. As an owner, Mr. Dumont would have a stake in the league’s success in China. Additionally, the Venetian Arena was controlled by a private company, rather than the state. “It reduces the number of variables that could go wrong,” Mr. Silver said. Sands, like other casino companies in Macau, has hosted events in recent years celebrating China’s rubber-stamp legislature and its policy on Macau and Hong Kong. Sands executives also marked Beijing’s National Security Education Day, an annual day of activities to inculcate people with a duty to the state and an awareness of foreign spies. And Sands executives cultivated relationships with officials, a review of Chinese government meetings shows. The Adelson family has long played informal diplomatic roles. In the 2024 election, Ms. Adelson was the third-largest donor to Mr. Trump. She and her husband, Sheldon Adelson , repeatedly spoke with Mr. Trump about foreign policy, including, in Mr. Adelson’s case, trade policy toward China . Just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration this year, Sands’s chief executive met with a Chinese vice minister to discuss trade and “the company’s growth in China,” according to Xinhua, China’s state news agency. Mr. Dumont did not say when the N.B.A. came up in discussions. But he said his pitch to the government focused on making Macau a broader tourism destination, just as Mr. Xi wants. “When we explain the context about using the N.B.A. to come to Macau and have it be a very prominent feature of tourism for the city, everyone was really excited,” he said. Mr. Dumont said that Mr. Tsai, the Nets owner and Alibaba chairman, was “very supportive, and he’s been super helpful.” Nets executives also met with Chinese officials in recent years. The Nets declined to comment, but Sunshine Rogers, the Nets’ vice president of global partnerships, told a Chinese news outlet in May that it was the N.B.A. team that “prioritizes the Chinese market the most.” In December, three years after Mr. Dumont raised the idea, the league announced a deal to play preseason games in Macau. Mr. Silver returned to China in March for the first time since 2019. He said the N.B.A. and the Chinese government would need to be flexible in their renewed relationship. “If this is about ideological purity on either side,” he said in an interview, “it will never be achieved.” Joy Dong contributed reporting from Hong Kong and Macau, Kevin Draper from Lawrence, Kan., and Tariq Panja from London.

79c41649471e,"In This Pageant, the Ugliest Face Wins","contests and prizes, face, england","Adrian Zivelonghi crossed his eyes, stretched his lower lip over the tip of his nose and revealed his twisted face to a panel of judges, who meticulously scrutinized each contortion. Then came his clincher: The 58-year-old odd-jobs man popped out his dentures and wiggled them in his mouth, triggering a roar of approval from the audience. The facial gymnastics — known as “gurning” — are the focus of the World Gurning Championships, a reverse beauty pageant of sorts and an ancient tradition in the town of Egremont, in northern England’s Lake District. The rules are simple, if odd. Competitors must make their face through a horse collar, known locally as a “baffin.” They are not allowed to use their hands, artificial aids or excessive makeup. They may, however, heighten the dramatic effect of their gurning “by thrashing around onstage and making wild, animal-like noises,” according to the official rules. Here’s what it looks like: Contestants are judged on “the grotesqueness of the grimace and on the extent to which their facial features change,” according to the rules. The best gurners, competitor say, are creative people, with flexible face muscles and a lack of self-consciousness. The championships, which were held on Sept. 20 this year, take place every fall at the Egremont Crab Fair, which was established in 1267 by King Henry III. According to local lore, gurning dates to the Middle Ages, rooted in the faces people make as they bite into the sour crab apples for which the festival is named. Here are some of the competition’s best gurns, and the stories behind them. The Defending Champion Claire Lister, who works in waste operations at a nuclear site, has been competing since she was a child. But like many local competitors, she took a break during her teen years to avoid looking uncool. “Being a female, it gets to a point where — it’s not quite embarrassing — but as you grow older you don’t want to start competing in a sport like that,” she said. Ms. Lister, now 38, returned to the competition in 2013 after her sister entered her as a joke. She won the women’s event, and has placed first nine times since then, including last year. “I never, ever prepare,” she said. “We have fun, and that’s what we say it’s all about.” The Veteran Mr. Zivelonghi, from Coventry, England, got into gurning more than 20 years ago in an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records. It wasn’t his first choice for a world title; he initially wanted to compete for the world’s longest ear hair . “But when you look at the man who has got the longest ear hair, it’s like, ‘Forget it, I’m not going to walk around like that,’” he said. “So yeah, I went to gurning instead.” Having some teeth missing, as Mr. Zivelonghi does, can be a bonus, he said, by enabling more extreme gurns. Stephanie Nguedia moved to the Lake District two years ago from France and was dragged to this year’s competition by her husband, Barry Morgan. At first, she had no idea what was going on. “I didn’t understand, it was ridiculous for me,” she said. But the 36-year-old health care worker was soon drawn in by the welcoming atmosphere. “The whole thing was fantastic,” she said, breathless and smiling after getting offstage. “I love it. I’m happy.” The Wunderkind Kendall Lister, 11, Ms. Lister’s daughter, is a champion in her own right. She took the top spot in this year’s junior event, adding to several past prizes. The worst part? “It can be scary,” she said. “What if I mess up?” And the best? “Winning,” she said. The Last-Minute Entrant As with many competitors, Robbie Carr’s participation began with a few drinks. “It was quite a spontaneous thing really,” he said. Before getting onstage, the 30-year-old electrical worker from Egremont jokingly asked his wife, “If I get in the top three, is that an ‘ick’?’” Her response? “Just you entering is an ‘ick.’” He said his gurn was inspired by his little sister, who used to make a face when teasing him. Ryan Barton, a junior champion in the late 1990s, got his uncle into gurning. “One night when he was drunk, I said, ‘Go on, do it,’” Mr. Barton said. “And he’d done it, and he won it, and he loved it.” His uncle, Peter Jackman, would become a gurning legend, winning the championship multiple times. Mr. Barton, 42, gave up gurning after he went into the British Army and his uncle died. But he brought his two daughters — Sadie, 7, and Aimee, 9, — to the competition this year. They pushed him to compete, just as he had with his uncle. Mr. Barton took first place among the men, and brought his daughters up onstage with him to pose for photos. “Two happy girls, that’s what it’s about,” he said after winning. “My uncle would love listening to that.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/in-this-pageant-the-ugliest-face-wins.html,World,BBC,By Jonathan Wolfe and Tom Jamieson,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/00xp-gurning-promo-wflj/00xp-gurning-promo-wflj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:58+00:00,2bb85fe284afd80e8f6d54be7e637ddcb4ff2704
5a29f1a190c1,She Studies the Russian ‘Red Man’ Whose Bloody War Evokes Soviet Tyranny,"svetlana alexievich, russian invasion of ukraine (2022), books, writer, swedish academy, belarus, soviet union, berlin","While writing the book that helped propel her to the Nobel Prize in Literature, the writer Svetlana Alexievich was certain she was chronicling the swan song of the violent, authoritarian ideologues at the heart of the Soviet system. Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, only two years after her native Belarus, still a Kremlin satellite, brutally crushed its democracy movement. The mind-set she believed was headed toward extinction had been revived, she said in a recent interview in her apartment in Berlin, where she has lived in exile since 2020. “I want to understand how that happened.” Her last book before the Nobel, “Secondhand Time,” was her fifth work about the unraveling of the utopian Communist experiment. Told in the voices of ordinary men and women narrating their experiences, the books address landmark events including the invasion of Afghanistan and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster . Ms. Alexievich used an intensive interviewing technique to write each one and, after “Secondhand Time,” intended to turn to other topics, like love and aging. But after the protests in Belarus and the Ukraine invasion, she shelved those plans. She is now writing a sixth book on the enduring existence of what she calls the “Red man,” who, she said, is stoking a bloody war in the heart of Europe. Examining his motivations, she said, is one way to try to douse the flames. “I don’t know where to find the right words to describe these things, yet we have to find the right words,” she told a news conference in late September at the United Nations in Geneva focused on growing repression in Russia. The global drift toward right-wing populism must also be confronted, she said, otherwise “the world itself and people will become even more terrifying, even more monstrous.” “The people who hold power today are trying to shut us up,” she added. In awarding Ms. Alexievich the literature prize in 2015, the Nobel Committee took the rare step of honoring an author of nonfiction, citing “her polyphonic work — a monument to suffering and courage in our time.” Sara Danius, the Swedish Academy permanent secretary at the time, described her books as “a history of emotions — a history of the soul, if you wish.” Ms. Alexievich, 77, grew up in the Soviet Union, born in western Ukraine but raised in a village in Belarus. Both of her parents were schoolteachers. As a child, she said, she listened spellbound to stories traded among the village women, often widows, about World War II and Stalin’s concentration camps. The overall Soviet death toll from the war and later is estimated at 27 million people. “They spoke about harsh things, very scary things, which of course were never written about in books,” Ms. Alexievich said. She studied journalism at Minsk University, eventually becoming a cultural correspondent for a Belarus newspaper. But the voices of those women never left her. She completed her first book, “The Unwomanly Face of War,” in 1983, after interviewing hundreds of female World War II veterans — pilots and snipers and cooks. The book languished for several years because the government censor said anyone who read it would never volunteer to fight. An unexpurgated English translation emerged in 2017. The author said that when she was first introduced to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, by then the former leader of the Soviet Union, he exclaimed, “You are so small and yet you wrote such a big book!” Ms. Alexievich said she responded, “Well, you are no giant yourself, but you toppled an empire.” The quest for empire feeds the desire of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to seize Ukraine, she said in the interview. He has promulgated a mythic Russian Empire that never really existed, the writer said, but that mythology resonates in Russia, especially outside Moscow and St. Petersburg. Ideology alone is not fueling the war, she said. She described the experience of a journalist friend who was interviewing a woman about her dead son. The woman suddenly clammed up, fearing being denied the death benefits she needed to buy her daughter an apartment. “Putin bought Russia,” Ms. Alexievich said, and has committed a “moral crime” by trying to depict the invasion as a continuation of the fight against Nazi Germany. Ms. Alexievich’s books take up to five years to write. She interviews her subjects repeatedly, using fragments of conversations like a jigsaw puzzle to construct a portrait of events. The repetition from one witness to the next forms a dense, compelling narrative. She lives for the revealing, human detail, she said. She elaborated on her technique in her Nobel lecture , saying that listening to people talk is her greatest passion. “I would say that I am a human ear,” she said. “When I walk down the street and catch words, phrases and exclamations, I always think — how many novels disappear without a trace!” “Voices From Chernobyl,” which recounted the harrowing experiences of those caught up in the nuclear meltdown in 1986, provided the basis for a haunting HBO series . In examining extreme human behavior, Ms. Alexievich said, she has long turned to Dostoyevsky for inspiration about its inexplicable nature. She rarely inserts herself in her books, and offers little information about her subjects beyond what they say. Some critics find the lack of background material disorienting. Her writing also provokes debate about whether it is literature, although she rejects calling it journalism. Given her emphasis on the violence thrumming through Russian society, her books are considered highly relevant amid the current war. “The Soviet soldier is the cheapest soldier there is,” said a prescient combat medic in “Boys in Zinc,” her Afghan war book . “Unequipped and unprotected. Expendable. The same way it was in 1941.” He added, “It’ll still be the same in 50 years.” After the publication of that book, Ms. Alexievich was accused in court of defaming the Soviet Army. She was acquitted, but in 2000, she moved to Europe and lived there for over a decade. In 2020, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the autocrat who has run Belarus since 1994, won another term in an election widely considered fraudulent. Scores of protesters were tortured, and hundreds of opposition activists given lengthy prison terms. Ms. Alexievich was the only member of the Coordination Council, a group created to unite the actions of the opposition, not to be arrested. She was interrogated, though, and after that, European diplomats and human rights activists camped in her apartment to safeguard her. But she decided to leave the country. Her home in a pre-World War II building on a leafy Berlin side street has a bohemian, somewhat temporary air. Nothing hangs on the pale yellow living room walls, the flowery ceiling molding overhead providing the only décor. A companion served Turkish coffee from a long-handled pot. Ms. Alexievich has one adult daughter, adopted from her late sister, and a granddaughter. She sometimes feels guilty that she joined the millions who have left Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Still, a striking number of prominent Russian cultural figures now inhabit Berlin, she noted, much like the intelligentsia who decamped after the 1917 revolution. They can help to preserve Russian culture, she said. During the September news conference in Geneva, she quoted the late, Soviet-born artist Ilya Kabakov: “When communism existed as an ideology, as a country, we knew what to do, we liked ourselves, we looked great in that struggle, and then we won. At the cost of huge losses, we defeated this monster and when we looked back, several years on, we found ourselves living among rats. How do you fight rats?” That is the essence of the current struggle, Ms. Alexievich said. Democracy is in retreat partly because individuals have convinced themselves that they are too small to effect change, to confront evil. “I think that we have to convince ourselves of the contrary,” she said. “Each of us has to find this strength, this ability to resist. ”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/russia-svetlana-alexievich.html,World,BBC,By Neil MacFarquhar and Milana Mazaeva,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09russia-profile-alexievich-01-gklt/09russia-profile-alexievich-01-gklt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T09:00:55+00:00,a1701550cb6e2cd65487ce4335aceb427e4b74cd
1d25d54c51dc,"What Things Left Behind Say About a Home’s Past, and the Times We Live In","pennsylvania, archaeology;anthropology, buildings, waste management, ceramics and pottery, plastic","We live in an old log house with big square beams, twisted staircases and a double stone fireplace. The floor boards creak, dust falls through the ceilings and the house is drafty, despite having been built at the bottom of three hills out of the wind. It sits on a county road, now abandoned, and, since 1941, has been occupied by only two families. It is a type of house few live in anymore, built by hardworking women and men who came to this western Pennsylvania outpost in much harder times, many years before we arrived here in 1988. I am grateful they did. But who built this house, and when? We’ve assumed it’s from roughly 1860. But we’ve never been sure, and finding out has not been easy. Our county recorder of deeds got me as far back as 1913. A 1964 tax assessment read, “old, remodeled house.” I’ve spoken to a log house expert, a local historian, and dated our apple trees to the mid-19th century, but still I’ve come up short. Then I found my answer by means I didn’t expect. I invited two archaeologists, Tom and Pat Baker, a husband and wife team, to the barn one night to help me identify the random objects I’ve found scattered across the fields and forests over 37 years: pottery shards, bits of glass, iron tools, farm equipment, shotgun shells, oyster shells, animal bones. And, of course, plastic. I gathered up these artifacts to clean up the land, but also to give me clues about those who came before us: how they lived and farmed, what they ate and drank, the utensils they used, the area’s industrial past. Mine is a commonplace collection; despite living in a town on the Pennsylvania frontier where the French and Indian War was fought, I’ve never found a musket ball or an arrowhead. And while I may use a fancy word and call these items artifacts, the truth is, much of what I have found was probably trash. Settlers in rural America had no garbage collection, so they threw rubbish into pits outside summer kitchens. Or into privies or bottle dumps. They burned trash or tossed it into a pigsty. “People put waste products into a manure spreader and spread it over the fields,” Tom said. Out in the field, I’ve picked up a ceramic smoking pipe, quite likely from 1895, the mangled wood and metal heel of a shoe, and, turning the compost pile, I found a white, opaque piece of milk glass. “I rarely see that,” Pat said. It turned out that a couple of towns over, a manufacturer of milk glass, the Westmoreland Glass Company, was founded in 1889. Last year on a hike, I found a pitted, brown rock in the middle of a path. I thought it might be a meteorite. It turned out to be a piece of slag. Had an iron furnace been on the property, Tom asked? Iron furnaces are abundant in this valley, but not here, at least to my knowledge. I know from an 1876 map that a tannery and a blacksmith shop were close by, but the slag, according to Pat, wouldn’t have originated in either of those places. “That piece of slag is indicative of iron smelting and would have come from nearby coke ovens or an iron furnace,” she said. Nondescript pieces of glass suddenly come alive when archaeologists look at them. A clear shard with raised numbers and letters turned out to be a bottle embossed with a drugstore’s name and address. A seam running along the neck of a pale blue bottle indicated it was handblown into a mold in the mid-to-late 1800s. A piece of brown glass was part of an old Clorox bottle from the 1930s. Brown glass, I learned, kept light from altering the chemicals and indicated that the contents were poisonous. I found an abundance of redware and stoneware, the everyday pottery used in this old house. Most of the stoneware was glazed brown and white, but one piece had a blue sponge pattern, probably from the early 1900s. A fragment of flow-blue refined earthenware, from about 1840 to 1900, had split into three from being burned. Pat put the plate back together like a puzzle. And then came the revelation: Pat was able to date this property according to the pottery we didn’t have. “Your collection is completely missing delftware, creamware and pearlware,” she said, listing pottery types that were common in North America from colonial times until the middle of the 1800s. “This tells me that your property was not occupied until the mid-1850s.” I still don’t know who built the house, but that is the closest I’ve come to accurately dating the place. Wire nails backed up her assertion. I’ve found a lot of metal: half a set of tongs for grabbing hay bales or ice, a double bit ax, what might be an ox shoe, a vise and assorted hooks, screws, nuts, bolts and wire nails. Wire nails were not manufactured until 1857, so that also suggested the house had not been lived in until then. Not all the items I collected were trash, however. Some were lost, misplaced or dropped. “They didn’t see it fall off a saddle if they were on horseback,” Tom said. We, too, are guilty of inadvertently leaving items out in the environment. I’ve dropped plant tags, terra cotta shards and rubber bands. Tools fall off our ATV or out of our pockets. Machinery breaks in the field. I’ve come home from hikes with electric fence insulators, lawn mower wheels, chain from a manure spreader and bungee cords. Sometimes, I get lucky and it’s exactly the piece we were looking for and machinery can be fixed or a horseshoe put back on. But we don’t purposely toss trash into the woods. “Today, people find a ravine and dump it,” Tom said, which is exactly what someone is doing at a deserted corner of the farm. They’re throwing garbage from their car over a guardrail into a ravine. Not only common household trash, but hundreds of beer cans stuffed into red, plastic bags. One now hangs from a maple sapling like a giant red Christmas ornament. Our county has no plastic bag ban and convenience stores, gas stations and grocery stores hand them out for free. I seldom drive that road, but noticed the garbage when biking there, seven miles up steep hills with hairpin turns in the Allegheny Mountains, then down onto the flat by fields of cut hay and a sheep farm, where I often see a leucistic hawk. My ride borders woods where I pick morels and black raspberries and an enormous snapping turtle suns itself by a pond. One day, I collected about a hundred items of trash, including soda, water and liquor bottles, French fry boxes, supersize cups, lottery tickets, straws, plastic tubs, power drink cans and two containers of hypodermic needles. I saw a diaper down a different ravine, but couldn’t reach it. I try to be understanding because this small township still has no municipal trash collection. It costs money to collect garbage. But I feel less kindly toward the appearance of the synthetic innards of an entire couch, packaging from morning-after pills, and, halfway down the ravine, an air purifier. All this, despite dumping being illegal, with hefty fines and possible community service. But why pay someone to haul it away if there are no consequences. I shudder to think of black bears, opossums, raccoons and coyotes drinking from a stream riddled with broken glass and walking steep hillsides covered in rusty, jagged metal. Of birds picking through fast food wrappers and chipmunks nibbling on plastic containers. How the trash contaminates the air, water and soil, and affects the growth of native plants. And all the plastic running downstream. And I can’t help but wonder: Is this the archaeology of the future, the things we are leaving the next generation to study? What will those artifacts tell them about us? About us all?

965f33312862,Wave of Criticism Greets Macron’s Repeat Pick for Prime Minister: ‘Bad Joke’,"sébastien lecornu, emmanuel macron, france, politics, jordan bardella, marine le pen, budget, legislature, national rally;national front, internal-open-access-from-nl","Having led a government that lasted 836 minutes, Sébastien Lecornu has now become prime minister of France for the second time in a week, without it being clear why his chances of success might be greater this time. After delaying the appointment until deep into the evening on Friday, President Emmanuel Macron again asked Mr. Lecornu, a close centrist ally, to form a government, in what appeared to be an admission that he had run out of options. “One has the impression that the more he is alone, the more rigid he grows in his initial position,” Marine Tondelier, the leader of the Green Party, said after she attended a meeting on Friday between Mr. Macron and the leaders of several parties. France, a nuclear power and one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, has a certain idea of itself. It is not that of a country whose last government survived for less than a day. The descent of the nation into tragicomic turmoil has caused widespread alarm and allowed Mr. Macron’s chief rival, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, to deplore a “desperate, pathetic spectacle.” She wasn’t alone in her censure, as a torrent of criticism met Mr. Macron’s choice. Mr. Lecornu will restart his efforts to form a government in a country in a state of severe institutional crisis, tethered to a president who after more than eight years in power has never been so isolated or scorned. “Lecornu II is a bad joke, a democratic ignominy and a humiliation for the French people,” said Jordan Bardella, the popular president of Ms. Le Pen’s anti-immigrant National Rally party. She wants Mr. Macron to dissolve a deadlocked Parliament and call legislative elections in which her party could well gain enough seats to form a government. Mr. Macron’s conduct this year in selecting, from a weak position, three prime ministers from his own centrist or center-right camp — the third of them for a second time on Friday — has appeared increasingly incomprehensible, culminating in calls from exasperated former allies for him to explain his stubbornness or resign. Worried that his economic reforms, including raising the retirement age or cutting the corporate tax rate, might be reversed, Mr. Macron has refused to reach out to the center left, despite the fact that a now frayed alliance of left and far-left parties won more seats than any other group in the 2024 legislative elections. Rather, with fewer votes he has attempted to exercise more power. This stance has been widely viewed as showing contempt for the people’s will, never a comfortable position in France. When Gabriel Attal, once Mr. Macron’s protégé and his choice for prime minister in early 2024 , declared this week, “I no longer understand the decisions of the president,” and said that these choices betrayed a “kind of furious pursuit of the maintenance of his power,” he expressed the dismay of many French people. “We are clinging on perilously between a political crisis and a crisis of the regime, where either we have a government so fragile it could fall any day, or parliamentary elections that will certainly hand victory to Ms. Le Pen,” said Alain Duhamel, a prominent author and political analyst. As president, Mr. Macron has certain powers, including those of selecting a prime minister and dissolving Parliament to call a legislative election. But he does not have a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house. He no longer has a loyal centrist party of his own. His ideology, known as Macronism, a mélange of shifting ideas once intended to overcome a left-right cleavage, has collapsed. A poll by Elabe, published this week in the business daily Les Echos, showed his support collapsing to 14 percent of the electorate, the most unpopular he has been and one of the lowest approval ratings ever for a French president. Yet Mr. Macron’s decisions have offered no concessions or readiness to change methods, as was further illustrated in his decision to reappoint Mr. Lecornu. With the far-right National Rally and far-left France Unbowed parties implacably opposed to him, and the center-left Socialists and conservative Republicans also unhappy with Mr. Macron’s choice, it was unclear how any second Lecornu government could last long. Mr. Macron “needs a parliamentary majority to support him,” Denis Baranger and Olivier Beaud, two professors of public law, wrote on Friday in the daily Le Monde. “Because he has not understood this reality, Mr. Macron is now totally isolated and has thrown the country into an unprecedented institutional impasse.” It appeared to be Mr. Macron’s insistence that Bruno Le Maire, a former finance minister now being blamed for the rise in French debt to $4 trillion, become the defense minister in the ephemeral first government of Sébastien Lecornu that caused it to blow apart in less than a day this week. Mr. Le Maire is close to the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, a relationship that Mr. Macron viewed as important given the need to integrate European military power at a time of war on the continent. But the surprise choice proved intolerable to Bruno Retailleau, the right-wing interior minister, who had been blindsided and promptly sounded the death knell of a government Mr. Lecornu had spent almost a month assembling. It was another example of the repetitive fiascos now afflicting France. These have followed Mr. Macron’s still unexplained decision to call parliamentary elections in June 2024. He was under no obligation to do so. Since then, the National Assembly has been split three ways among the nationalist far right, the left and the far left, and an enfeebled center whose loyalty to Mr. Macron is fading. This Parliament is dysfunctional; that much is proven. But France needs a budget to confront its mounting deficit and debt. In theory, Mr. Lecornu must present the budget next week if it is to be approved by the end of the year. With the current parliamentary configuration, it is difficult to see how he will get the budget passed — or, if he somehow does, how his government will survive much beyond that. Yet Mr. Macron does not want to dissolve Parliament and perhaps finish his presidency with Mr. Bardella as his prime minister. For 80 years, since the end of World War II, France has prided itself on keeping the far right from power after the shame and humiliation of the Vichy Government that collaborated with the Nazis. “This is not going to end well,” Ms. Tondelier, the Green Party leader, said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/europe/france-macron-lecornu-prime-minister.html,World,BBC,By Roger Cohen,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-France-Macron-Analysis-wlbg/11int-France-Macron-Analysis-wlbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T08:49:09+00:00,e75af7a1c2d9d8c3a7c1ffa420854a8c2dd0d224
440c35fa6423,China Flexed. Trump Hit Back. So Much for the Thaw.,"international relations, us foreign policy, international trade, tariff, us economy, global times, stimson center, hu xijin, donald trump, xi jinping, china, us, internal-open-access-from-nl","As the trade war between the United States and China kicked back into high gear after a period of tentative détente, it was clear just how vast the gulf of misunderstanding between the two superpowers had become. President Trump said that he had been blindsided by China’s new controls on rare earth metals and products made from them, announced earlier in the week , amid what he had called a “very good” relationship in recent months. Chinese commentators insisted that Beijing was only responding to new attacks from the United States, and that Washington was the provocateur, because it had ramped up technological restrictions on China while professing good will. Both sides also seemed convinced that they had the advantage and that the other side had overplayed its hand. The blame game continued on Saturday, as China woke up to Mr. Trump’s announcement that he would impose new 100 percent tariffs on Chinese imports from Nov. 1. The Chinese government on Sunday accused the United States of double standards, saying its rare earth export controls were normal, and that it was America that had long abused such controls and adopted discriminatory practices against China in the name of national security. On the threat of more tariffs, the Commerce Ministry said the two sides should resolve issues through talks, but China would take measures in response if the United States “insists on its own course.” “China’s position on a tariff war is consistent: We do not want one, but we are not afraid of one either,” the ministry said in a statement. President Trump’s tariff threat highlighted the huge stakes involved in having control over the raw materials and technologies, such as rare earth metals and batteries, that will power the next generation of industry. But if neither side backs down, the new hostilities seem all but certain to spill beyond trade. They could also affect other areas that the two countries had been hoping to make headway on in their relationship, such as military-to-military communication and the governance of artificial intelligence. “The situation is quite surprising, considering that there have already been four rounds of China-U.S. trade negotiations,” Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University, said in an interview, referring to meetings between officials since May that had taken place in Geneva, London, Stockholm and Madrid. President Trump said last month that he had also expected to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in person in South Korea this month. But on Friday he said , “Now there seems to be no reason to do so.” “This is a very stark reminder that the fragility in China-U.S. relations is deepening,” Professor Zhu said. The new trade tensions showed that the United States and China defined the rivalry between them in fundamentally different ways. To Mr. Trump, issues such as trade and technology could be addressed separately — that is, the United States expects to be able to continue to escalate its technology restrictions on China while simultaneously seeking a big trade deal between the countries. But to China, trade and technology are part of what Beijing perceives as an all-around effort by the United States to suppress China. “If the trade talks fail, I’m deeply concerned that the all-fronts confrontation between the two sides will escalate,” Professor Zhu said. While Mr. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, accused China of introducing its rare earths controls “out of nowhere,” Chinese commentators maintained that the escalation was Washington’s fault. “What is Trump feeling wronged about?” Hu Xijin, the influential former editor of Global Times, a Communist Party-controlled newspaper, wrote on Weibo, a social media platform. “What is he angry about? He should first understand what the U.S. has done to China!” Mr. Hu suggested that China’s rare earth controls were merely a response to new measures from the United States targeting China, including expanding the list of Chinese companies to which it restricts exports. He said the country had grown more confident in its ability to endure intense pressure tactics from Washington. “Chinese society is really not afraid of the United States now, and high U.S. tariffs and other levers have lost their deterrent effect on China,” he said by text message. Still, the sweep of China’s new rare earths controls struck many observers as a dramatic escalation. They prohibit any shipments of critical materials to producers of military equipment in Europe and the United States and bar the transfer out of China of equipment or information that would help other countries establish their own production. China’s boldness may have stemmed from an assessment that Mr. Trump is in a weak position. Mr. Trump’s trade negotiators proved willing earlier this summer to strike compromises on tariffs, and the president has expressed eagerness to visit China. China’s boycott of soybean purchases from the United States has badly hurt American farmers. American domestic politics are in turmoil, with the government shut down. And despite promises by the United States to wean itself off its reliance on China for rare earth metals, that prospect remains distant . China, on the other hand, is riding high from a large-scale military parade last month, at which it showcased advanced new weaponry and reaffirmed its ties with Russia and North Korea. “China certainly knew Trump would react strongly, and it didn’t underestimate him,” said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “But there are several areas where China has the upper hand.” China may be hoping to use its leverage to push Mr. Trump toward a bigger agreement on other issues in the U.S.-China relationship, beyond just trade, he said. Beijing also wants the Trump administration to make concessions on its support for Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory, as well as on the controls it has imposed on advanced semiconductor chips, which China needs for the development of artificial intelligence, among other ambitions. China’s tough measures may also be a signal to the domestic audience to have confidence, despite the country’s economic slowdown and the housing market crash. And it may be a message to other countries and regions, including the European Union, that have come under pressure from Washington to choose sides between the two superpowers that they should not underestimate China. “This tells you that China is very confident and powerful,” Professor Wang said. “Don’t be afraid. Don’t sacrifice China to curry favor with the United States.” But some experts warned that Beijing had overplayed its hand and that officials had miscalculated how aggressively Mr. Trump would respond. Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington, said Beijing had cultivated a “dangerous new habit” of underestimating the American willingness and capability to retaliate. China may have assumed that a summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi was locked in and that the U.S. was eager for a deal. The Trump administration backed down after first imposing additional tariffs in April of as much as 145 percent, leaving an extra tariff of 30 percent while China has retained an extra tariff of 10 percent on American goods. “Where the U.S. was showing good will, China saw a manifestation of American weaknesses,” Dr. Sun wrote in an email. Professor Zhu, of Nanjing University, acknowledged that even as China moved to defend its interests, it should be cautious about Mr. Trump’s unpredictability. “If the trade war escalates further, that is definitely not in China’s interests,” he said. Indeed, should Mr. Trump’s additional 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods take effect, they could batter the economy even more. Exports to the United States — either directly or through countries like Vietnam and Mexico — have helped keep the economy afloat.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/asia/china-trump-tariff-threat.html,World,BBC,By Vivian Wang and Keith Bradsher,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11china-us-analysis-01-tchg/11china-us-analysis-01-tchg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T08:04:53+00:00,66bfb033f05562768801b57bd465fec9702c6ac0
99ab7fda4bdc,North Korea Flaunts New Missiles ​in Parade With Chinese and Russian Officials,"international relations, parade, nuclear weapon, workers' party of korea, kim jong-un, donald trump, li qiang, dmitri a medvedev, to lam","Columns of goose-stepping soldiers and a procession of powerful nuclear missiles rolled through the rain-soaked capital​ of North Korea on Friday evening, as senior officials from China and Russia joined the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for a show of solidarity against the American-led global order. Mr. Kim organized the enormous military parade at the main square of the capital, Pyongyang, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of his ruling Workers’ Party. He used the spectacle to show off his country’s growing geopolitical value as a partner to China and Russia in pushing back against the United States. Joining Mr. Kim on the viewing platform were Premier Li Qiang​, China’s second-highest-ranking official; Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin; and To Lam, Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, according to images carried by North Korean state media on Saturday. The parade was also an opportunity for Mr. Kim to ​highlight the deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers who fought for Russia ​in its war against Ukraine joined the parade on Friday, carrying the flags of both nations. North Korea has provided ​Russia with 15,000 troops, according to South Korean officials, and large shipments of artillery shells, rockets and missiles.​ ​The North Koreans will continue to “fulfill their responsibilities in the joint struggle of the progressive mankind for opposing injustice and hegemony and defending justice and peace,” Mr. Kim said in a speech ​before the military parade, a veiled show of defiance against the American-led West. North Korea has long used military parades for domestic propaganda. They have become more frequent and bigger under Mr. Kim, who has also used them as a venue for brandishing ​new weapons to gain leverage against his enemies, like the United States. The weapons shown off on Friday included military drones, tanks with modern electronic warfare equipment and ​various missiles, including hypersonic ballistic missiles and Hwasong-20s, North Korea’s newest intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Hwasong-20, which has not been test-launched yet, is the latest in a series of I.C.B.M.s that North Korea has developed under Mr. Kim . President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea​ said last month that North Korea was getting close to building I.C.B.M.s capable of targeting the mainland United States with nuclear warheads. ​Washington has long campaigned for the “complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling” of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. But North Korea insists on being accepted as a nuclear weapons state. Last month, Mr. Kim said ​his country was willing to restart dialogue with Washington only if it stopped trying to deprive ​North Korea of its nuclear arsenal. The ​scene of senior Chinese and Russian officials watching the march of nuclear missiles in Pyongyang reinforced a shift in policy in Beijing and Moscow over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. In recent months, Russian officials have indicated that they would no longer insist on ​North Korea’s denuclearization​, calling it a “closed” matter . China also no longer mentioned “denuclearization” in official statements following high-level meetings with North Korea. “When the same formulaic term vanishes from multiple official documents within weeks, it signals intentional policy shift, not bureaucratic oversight,” said Seong-Hyon Lee, a senior fellow at the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations. The ​parade in Pyongyang came less than three weeks before international leaders were expected to ​meet in Gyeongju, South Korea​, for meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. President Trump had earlier said he planned to meet with President Xi Jinping of China at the APEC gathering​. But in a Truth Social post on Friday, he indicated that he might cancel the meeting , criticizing Beijing’s export control​ on rare-earth minerals. ​As the strategic competition between China and the United States intensifies and as Russia’s war against Ukraine rages, Mr. Kim has seen his geopolitical value to Beijing and Moscow rising. Russia resurrected a Cold War-era alliance treaty with North Korea last year, as Mr. Kim supplied it with badly needed weapons and troops. And as evidence of the North Korean leader’s growing leverage, China invited Mr. Kim to Beijing last month to flank Mr. Xi along with Mr. Putin while watching a military parade similar to the one on Friday. The seniority of the Chinese delegation to Pyongyang this week represented another nod to Mr. Kim’s elevated standing​ in the anti-West partnership. Mr. Li was the first Chinese premier to visit North Korea since 2009. ​To Russia and China, the parade in Pyongyang “showcases advanced military hardware as a shared asset in a collective challenge to Western strategic dominance, repositioning North Korea from client state to indispensable partner,” said Mr. Lee, the analyst. “To the United States, the message is that the established playbook for North Korea is obsolete, with Kim flanked by top Chinese and Russian officials while displaying formidable weapons including potential multi-warhead I.C.B.M.s.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/asia/north-korea-military-parade-china-russia.html,World,BBC,By Choe Sang-Hun,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/11/multimedia/11int-nkorea-parade-gtbp/11int-nkorea-parade-gtbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-11T06:44:04+00:00,d4ccbecf24ec43c950bcfd9cf9e035e7f900feb7

The authorities linked the rain to Post-Tropical Cyclone Priscilla , formerly a hurricane, and to Tropical Storm Raymond , both off western Mexico in the Pacific Ocean. Forecasters expect the rain to continue this weekend. By Saturday, the rainfall and landslides had killed at least 41 people across four states, Mexico’s civil protection agency said in a statement . Sixteen of the deaths were in the state of Hidalgo, north of Mexico City; nine were in the state of Puebla, east of Mexico City; 15 were in the state of Veracruz and one was in Querétaro, the statement said. The authorities were searching for another 27 missing people, it added. Between Monday and Thursday, intense rainfall was recorded across the states, with the highest being recorded in Veracruz, which received over 21 inches, the statement said. President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said on social media that the government was working to “support the population, open roads and restore electricity.” More than 320,000 users were affected by power outages caused by the heavy rains and winds, the Mexican government said. The torrential rains have damaged at least two bridges and affected more than 600 miles of federal highways across five states, Ms. Sheinbaum said. Thousands of soldiers were carrying out rescues and clearing roads on Friday. The Navy, which deployed 3,300 troops, said that it had carried out more than 900 evacuations. The Mexican authorities said that they had activated more than 5,400 troops from the Army, Air Force and National Guard. The Mexican government said in an earlier statement that the greatest impacts had been reported in the states of Veracruz, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Puebla and Hidalgo. It added that municipalities in Veracruz had been hit particularly hard, with 16,000 homes damaged, landslides on roads and flooded streams. Julio Menchaca, the governor of Hidalgo, said on social media on Thursday that all classes had been suspended because of the heavy rains. Mr. Reyna, the state’s interior secretary, said that at least 1,000 homes, 308 schools and 59 hospitals had been damaged. The storm in Hidalgo also cut off power to 17 municipalities and left 90 communities without communication. Hidalgo’s infrastructure officials posted photos of landslides covering roads and workers trying to clear rocks and branches that had fallen. The same storms were expected to bring the risk of heavy rain and flash flooding across desert areas of the American Southwest this weekend.

Meeting on the United States,"international relations, us foreign policy, us military, targeted killings, smuggling, drug cartel, drug abuse, un security council, nicolas maduro, donald trump, venezuela, us","The United Nations Security Council convened a rare meeting focused on the United States on Friday to discuss the Trump administration’s recent military strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, and the risks these actions posed to regional stability. Though the meeting itself was noteworthy — the council seldom holds meetings on the conduct of the United States, a permanent member — the 15 members of the council were hardly unanimous in support for Venezuela’s government or in open condemnation of the United States. Tensions between the United States and Venezuela have escalated in recent months. The Trump administration has conducted at least four strikes on boats off the waters of Venezuela, killing at least 21 people, alleging that they were smuggling drugs. President Trump recently told Congress that his administration had determined the United States is in a war with drug cartels and that, therefore, people crewing boats suspected of drug smuggling are “unlawful combatants.” That idea that has been sharply contested by a range of legal specialists in laws governing the use of military force. Russia and China sharply criticized the United States on Friday, saying its actions violated international law and violated the sovereignty of Venezuela. Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the U.N., said the military actions and killing of civilians without trial reflected a U.S. “cowboy principle of shoot first.” He said the attacks were an example of “American exceptionalism” in which, he said, Washington does what it wants and expects other countries to fall in line.

Firing shots into the ceiling and shouting in English, “The party starts!,” an ex-convict named Jan-Erik Olsson seized three bank employees, all women, as hostages. The police swarmed in and the media descended, broadcasting the standoff live. Mr. Olsson hadn’t come just to rob the bank; he was demanding that a former cellmate of his, Clark Olofsson, be sprung from prison and brought to join him. Sweden’s minister of justice went along. Even more unexpected, over six days of captivity, the hostages — the women were joined by a man found hiding in the bank’s vault — began defending their captors and turning hostile toward their would-be police rescuers. One hostage, Kristin Enmark, 23, speaking by phone to Sweden’s prime minister, Olof Palme , begged to be allowed to leave the bank in a getaway car with her abductors. “I fully trust Clark and the robber,” she told Mr. Palme. “They haven’t done a thing to us.” She added, “Believe it or not, but we’ve had a really nice time here.” The police finally broke through the roof and subdued the robbers with tear gas. At trial, the hostages refused to testify against their captors. Their ordeal gave rise to a new term in pop psychology, Stockholm syndrome, to explain how victims supposedly identify and empathize with their captors rather than the authorities trying to help them. Mr. Olofsson, who in Swedish media and in popular culture was portrayed as a charismatic figure, and whose lifetime of escapades on the wrong side of the law made him one of his country’s most famous criminals, died on June 24 at 78. His death, at a hospital in Arvika, Sweden, west of Stockholm, was not widely reported at the time. The Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC reported that Mr. Olofsson’s family confirmed the death without specifying the cause, saying only that he had been treated for “a long illness.” He had spent more than half his life behind bars for robberies, prison breaks and drug smuggling. He was set free for the final time in 2018. Whether Stockholm syndrome is a veritable psychological phenomenon has been debated since its namesake drama, which took place at Kreditbanken in Stockholm’s Norrmalmstorg Square in August 1973. (It was first called Norrmalmstorg syndrome.) The term was coined by a Swedish police psychologist, Nils Bejerot , after he was asked to assess the hostages’ curious behavior during the robbery. But Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the handbook of mental illness in the United States. Some psychologists have explained the behavior as a coping mechanism, seen in victims of kidnappings and among hostages seized by Middle East terrorists, and in victims of domestic abuse. The captives, psychologists say, find a way to self-preservation by siding with their all-powerful captors. The term gained popular currency after the kidnapping of the heiress Patty Hearst by radical leftists in 1974, when Ms. Hearst, after months in captivity, denounced her rich family and participated in a bank robbery with her abductors, self-styled revolutionaries calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army. (A year later, the phenomenon was highlighted in Sidney Lumet’s movie “Dog Day Afternoon,” starring Al Pacino, in which hostages during a bank holdup develop a bond with their captors — an event inspired by a real-life attempted heist in Brooklyn.) Ms. Enmark, the Stockholm hostage, spent years denying that she had ever empathized with Mr. Olsson and Mr. Olofsson. She accused the police who laid siege to the bank of incompetency. She called Stockholm syndrome a myth, saying she had done what was necessary to stay alive. “It’s a way of blaming the victim,” she told a BBC podcast in 2021. “I did what I could to survive.” Clark Oderth Olofsson was born on Feb. 1, 1947, in Trollhattan, Sweden. His parents had a chaotic relationship, and he was placed in foster care at 8 years old, according to accounts in the Swedish media . He grew up to become a repeat offender. At the time of the 1973 hostage drama, he was serving a sentence on robbery and weapons charges. Convicted for his role in the botched robbery of Kreditbanken, Mr. Olofsson was handed another sentence of six and a half years, but the conviction was overturned on appeal: Mr. Olofsson had argued that he had acted to protect the hostages. In 1975, while serving out his prior sentence, he escaped from prison in Norrkoping, Sweden. During a year on the lam, he sailed the Mediterranean Sea, met a teenager on a train whom he would later marry, and robbed a bank in Gothenburg, Sweden, before being caught the same day. The 930,000 kronor (about $230,000) reportedly stolen was never recovered, and it set off a treasure hunt by both the police and civilians. Sentenced to nine years for that robbery, Mr. Olofsson studied journalism behind bars and was released in 1983. The next year, he was convicted on drug charges and sent back to prison until 1991. He cycled in and out of prisons in Sweden and Denmark on drug smuggling convictions for decades, with many of his cases covered in the tabloid media. He married the young woman he had met on the train, Marijke Demuynck, in 1976 and had three sons with her. Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Olofsson’s history of bank robberies, prison escapes and shootouts with the authorities was fodder for a 2003 Swedish television film, “Norrmalmstorg,” and a 2022 Netflix series, “Clark,” with Mr. Oloffson played by Bill Skarsgard. Although mental health experts have theorized about Stockholm syndrome for half a century, almost none thought to speak to Ms. Enmark, the bank employee central to the drama and the diagnosis. One psychologist who did was Allan Wade, a Canadian therapist specializing in interpersonal violence, who, after meeting Ms. Enmark, called Stockholm syndrome a made-up concept meant to shift focus from the stumbles of the Swedish police. “The whole notion was an accusation,” he told the BBC in 2021. “It was a way to dismiss what an incredibly heroic woman had been doing for six and a half days to resist, preserve her dignity and look after the other hostages.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/europe/clark-olofsson-dead.html,World,BBC,By Trip Gabriel,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Olofsson--fctj/10Olofsson--fctj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T23:11:42+00:00,dc55ab413285ddd7db626228875297fb7e870ac0
2c75b48bbb3f,Macron Reappoints Lecornu as France’s Prime Minister,"france, emmanuel macron, sébastien lecornu, appointments and executive changes, politics, legislature","President Emmanuel Macron of France reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as the country’s prime minister on Friday, less than a week after Mr. Lecornu resigned — a risky, whiplash-inducing move that could backfire as Mr. Macron tries to steady a roiling political crisis . The president’s office said in a statement that Mr. Lecornu, a centrist and a close ally of Mr. Macron, had been tasked with forming a government, just days after his previous cabinet of centrists and conservatives imploded . A new government formed by Mr. Lecornu would be France’s fourth in less than a year, a degree of governmental instability not seen since the founding of the country’s Fifth Republic in 1958. And it was far from clear that Mr. Lecornu’s reappointment would do much to help the situation. Political opponents — outraged that Mr. Macron had once again appointed an ally — were already vowing on Friday to topple Mr. Lecornu with a no-confidence motion in the lower house of Parliament, known as the National Assembly. Several left-wing parties and a far-right party declared immediately after the appointment was announced that they would support such a motion, bringing Mr. Lecornu dangerously close to the number of votes required to oust him. Even some of the president’s allies had said that reverting back to Mr. Lecornu was a mistake that did not address the French people’s intense frustration with Mr. Macron, whose approval rating has reached new lows . France has endured months of partisan gridlock in the National Assembly, leaving the country without stable governance, rattling financial markets, unsettling consumers and businesses, and jeopardizing the country’s ability to pass a budget by the end of the year, even as it faces a looming financial crisis . “I accept — out of a sense of duty — the mission entrusted to me by the President of the Republic to do everything possible to give France a budget by the end of the year and to respond to the everyday problems faced by our fellow citizens,” Mr. Lecornu said on X . He added: “We must put an end to this political crisis, which is exasperating the French people, and to this instability, which is damaging to France’s image and interests.” Legally, nothing prevents Mr. Macron from reappointing Mr. Lecornu, who has been a member of every government since Mr. Macron was first elected in 2017. Politically, however, the decision infuriated many of Mr. Macron’s opponents, who blame him for repeatedly refusing to appoint an opposition prime minister, even though his centrist alliance lost badly in snap elections over a year ago. Since those elections, the National Assembly has been deadlocked among three main political blocs, none of which has a majority: a collection of left-wing parties; a mix of conservatives and centrists; and a nationalist, anti-immigrant far right led by the National Rally party. Mr. Macron, who met with party leaders on Friday, has relied on a succession of unstable center-right minority governments, not heeding calls from left-wing parties who say they should have their chance at governing. Jordan Bardella, the head of the far-right National Rally party, said on X that Mr. Macron was “more isolated and disconnected than ever.” “The National Rally will, of course, immediately censure this futile alliance, whose sole raison d’être is fear of dissolution, i.e., of the people,” he added, referring to Mr. Macron’s ability to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections. Mr. Lecornu’s departure, on Monday, had immediately increased the pressure on Mr. Macron. Some of his opponents argued that the only way to break the deadlock was to call new parliamentary elections — or even for Mr. Macron to resign. But Mr. Macron quickly ruled out those options. Mr. Lecornu, after holding last-ditch talks with political parties at the president’s request, said on Wednesday that a majority of parties in the lower house did not want new elections and wanted to pass a budget before year’s end. Mr. Macron appeared to be gambling that most parties, even those who said Mr. Lecornu’s appointment was a provocation, would compromise on a budget bill because they were too afraid of new elections, which polls predict would be dominated by the far right. But that is a risky bet, and there remain major budget disagreements on what spending to cut and what taxes to raise. Mr. Macron’s 2023 pension overhaul, which raised the legal age of retirement to 64 from 62 and is still widely unpopular, is one of the biggest sticking points. Left-wing parties were hoping that Mr. Macron would be open to suspending the measure, despite his extreme reluctance to see any part of his pro-business agenda rolled back. But the parties said after their meeting with Mr. Macron that he had suggested only that the overhaul’s full implementation could be delayed until after 2027, when France’s next presidential election will be held. Mr. Lecornu said on Friday that “all the issues raised during the consultations held in recent days will be open to parliamentary debate,” although he did not specifically mention the pension overhaul.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/europe/france-prime-minister-lecornu-macron.html,World,BBC,By Aurelien Breeden,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10int-france-prime-minister-jphg/10int-france-prime-minister-jphg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T20:16:08+00:00,4b60c61b09527ea160ba2dce1b930a16a6a8ef42

A conservative former member of the national assembly, Ms. Machado has been a driving force in opposing a quarter century of socialist rule that has grown increasingly repressive under President Nicolás Maduro. She has been living in hiding since last year, when Mr. Maduro cracked down on the opposition after claiming victory in an election that was widely seen by independent analysts as fraudulent. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Ms. Machado for her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Ms. Machado has largely avoided commenting on whether Mr. Maduro’s removal should involve U.S. military intervention in Venezuela. But she has been a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, where American forces have destroyed several suspected drug boats in international waters, killing at least 21 people. “I totally support the international deployment and coalition that’s working in the Caribbean to stop the flow of illegal drug income to the regime,” Ms. Machado told the BBC last week. The Norwegian Nobel Institute was able to reach Ms. Machado by telephone a few moments before the prize was announced to tell her she had been selected. “Oh my God,” she said in a video posted by the committee on social media. “Well, I have no words.” In her campaigns opposing the Venezuelan government, she has spent more than two decades building relationships in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans alike. In 2005, she was received in the White House by President George W. Bush, and she has been praised extensively by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and former Florida senator. She argues, like Mr. Trump, that Mr. Maduro poses an enormous security threat to the region. “This is about saving lives,” she told Fox News last month, “not only Venezuelan lives, but also lives of American people, because as you have said, and we have heard, Maduro is the head of a narco-terrorist structure of cooperation.” Yet the announcement of Ms. Machado’s selection for the peace prize seemed to have been greeted with disappointment by the White House, after President Trump talked openly for months about his desire for the prize himself. The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, said the Nobel committee had “proved they place politics over peace.” At an Oval Office news conference on Friday evening, Mr. Trump said: “The person who actually got the Nobel Prize actually called today, called me and said ‘I’m accepting this in honor of you because you really deserved it.’ A very nice thing to do. I didn’t say ‘Then give it to me’ though. I think she might have. She was very nice. I’ve been helping her along the way.” A mother of three adult children, all of whom live abroad, Ms. Machado, 58, hails from a wealthy and staunchly Catholic family. She attended an elite Catholic girls’ school in Caracas and a boarding school in Wellesley, Mass. She studied engineering at Andrés Bello Catholic University, and then took a position in her family’s steel business, Sivensa, parts of which were expropriated in 2010 by President Hugo Chávez, who sent soldiers to take over seven of the company’s plants as part of his socialist nationalization program. Ms. Machado had already become a political activist by then, running a voter rights group, Súmate, that led a failed effort to recall Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. An emblematic moment came in 2012, when Ms. Machado was a legislator and she clashed with Mr. Chávez in a televised debate, accusing him of robbing everyday Venezuelans through expropriation. Mr. Chávez mocked her as being beneath his concern. “Eagles don’t hunt flies,” he told her. Venezuela’s opposition struggled through years of repression and division under Mr. Chávez and then his ally and successor, Mr. Maduro, when the government crushed protests and arrested dissidents, and the economy collapsed, all contributing to an enormous exodus from the country. But last year, Ms. Machado corralled the fractious opposition, playing a galvanizing role in the campaign for the July presidential election. After a court ruled in January 2024 that she was barred from the ballot, she campaigned behind a little-known diplomat named Edmundo González . With rosaries swinging from her neck, Ms. Machado was greeted by adoring crowds as she traveled across the country, visiting small towns and slums that had once provided the core of support for the country’s socialist takeover. In the city of Guanare, in western Venezuela, one voter said she believed that this time around “the fly is going to trap the eagle.” Ms. Machado has championed free markets and vowed to “bury socialism forever.” And she has said that the politician she most admired was Margaret Thatcher. But on the campaign trail last year, she mostly tempered partisan economic talk and focused on what united most Venezuelans: the pain of family separations and the loss of political freedoms. Ms. Machado and her allies sought to show the election had been fraudulent by gathering a physical printout of the voting tally from the majority of voting machines after the polls closed. By the opposition’s count, Mr. González defeated Mr. Maduro by more than 2 to 1 . Unable to celebrate her Nobel win openly, Ms. Machado’s supporters greeted her winning the peace prize with private joy and hope on Friday. A brutal crackdown instituted by Mr. Maduro last year to remain in power forced many in the opposition into hiding. Hundreds of her supporters remain in jail. Top Trump administration officials have in recent weeks stepped up efforts to remove Mr. Maduro from power, with officials discussing a broad campaign that would escalate military pressure to try to force him out. The efforts are being led by Mr. Rubio , who in addition to his role as secretary of state is national security adviser. Mr. Rubio has argued that Mr. Maduro is an illegitimate leader who oversees the export of drugs to the United States, which he says poses an “ imminent threat .” An adviser to Ms. Machado told The New York Times last month that leaders of the Venezuela opposition have been speaking to the Trump administration about how to counter Mr. Maduro. Pedro Urruchurtu, the adviser, said that the opposition had developed a plan for the first 100 hours after Mr. Maduro’s ouster that would involve a transfer of power to Mr. González. “What we’re talking about is an operation to dismantle a criminal structure,” Mr. Urruchurtu said. Along with diplomatic, financial and other tools, he said, “it has to be done with the use of force, because otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to defeat a regime like the one we’re facing.” Reporting was contributed by Anatoly Kurmanaev, Edward Wong and Erin Mendell.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize.html,World,BBC,"By Julie Turkewitz, Jonathan Wolfe and Thomas Fuller",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10nobel-leadall-cwjq/10nobel-leadall-cwjq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T20:05:31+00:00,51d73281cb647059d8e161bc2c66efcf79b8ad80
c7dc5cfd6eb4,Nobel Organizers Look Into Surge of Bets for Winner Ahead of Announcement,"maria corina machado, donald trump, us, polymarket, norwegian nobel committee, nobel prize","The committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize was looking into online bets that suggested advance knowledge that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado had won — and perhaps efforts to profit off the information. The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Ms. Machado had won at about 10 a.m. local time on Friday. But starting late Thursday, wagers that she was the winner began appearing on Polymarket , the popular online prediction market. The bets pushed up the odds on Ms. Machado to more than 73 percent shortly after midnight. Then they fell for about 45 minutes as the odds of a win by Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, rose somewhat, but increased again after 3 a.m. and stayed elevated until the award was officially announced. “Espionage directed against the Norwegian Nobel Committee is unfortunately well known — both politically and economically motivated,” Erik Aasheim, a spokesman for the Norwegian Nobel Institute, said in a statement, adding, “Ahead of this year’s announcement, we have noticed that some have made significant financial gains by placing bets on this year’s prize. We will investigate whether this indicates that someone has unlawfully obtained information from us.” Prediction markets like Polymarket shot to prominence during the United States presidential campaign last year, particularly after bets on the election’s outcome appeared to correctly forecast President Trump’s victory. Proponents of such platforms say that the collective wisdom of speculators who back their predictions with money — and their ability to quickly incorporate a vast array of information — makes the predictions highly accurate. Polymarket drew extra attention after one pseudonymous trader , based in France, was identified as having bet heavily on a Trump victory, though the company said that the wagers did not appear to be an attempt to manipulate its market. A representative for Polymarket was not immediately available.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/nobel-prize-bets-machado-investigation.html,World,BBC,By Michael J. de la Merced,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10Nobel-vwpk/10Nobel-vwpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T18:16:10+00:00,8e8ec5ee356cfdd8f910460dab79a35da50ca890

b056c9bc3801,"Holding Back Tears, Prince William Shows a New Side of a Future King","william, prince of wales, eugene levy, king charles iii, britain, london, apple tv","At a time when the British royal family has been convulsed by drama, infighting and a tendency by some royals to over-share, Prince William has remained largely aloof — loath to reveal the kinds of details found in “Spare,” the memoir by his estranged brother, Prince Harry. Yet William, too, has lifted the veil in recent weeks, in his own carefully managed way. Appearing with the Canadian comic actor Eugene Levy on an episode of his travel series, and later with a woman who lost her husband to suicide, William has shown a more personal side, speaking about his desire to change the monarchy after he becomes king and tearing up over another family’s tragedy. The two glimpses of William, 43, have hardly remade the public image of the eldest son of King Charles III. But they have filled in some blanks in the portrait of a man who has carefully cultivated the profile of a middle-aged husband and father, determined to shield himself and his family from undue scrutiny. The exercise in image making has taken on more urgency since his father was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. While Buckingham Palace insists that Charles, 76, is on the mend, the prospect of William having to step up to the throne no longer seems so distant. “He’s on fast forward,” said Tina Brown, the British American journalist who has written two books about the royal family. “His father had 50 years to tell the world who he was before becoming king. It’s essential for William to show the human side of himself before his image gets set in stone as the stoic foil to Harry.” In a video released Friday to coincide with World Mental Health Day, William met with Rhian Mannings, who lost a baby to illness and her husband to suicide. As the two sat at Ms. Mannings’s kitchen table in Cardiff, Wales, William asked her what she would say to her husband, if she could. “I would just like to sit him down like this and say, ‘Why didn’t you come to me?’” she replied. “Because he’s missed out on just so much joy.” William looked away, his eyes brimming with tears. “Are you OK?” Ms. Mannings asked. Struggling to compose himself, William said, “I’m sorry; it’s hard to ask you the questions.” It was a startling display of emotion — not least in contrast to the stiff-upper-lip stoicism of older-generation royals like Queen Elizabeth II — though it recalled the emotional encounters his mother, Princess Diana, had with people with AIDS in the 1990s. William’s focus on suicide prevention echoed his mother’s desire to destigmatize AIDS. In the appearance with Mr. Levy on his Apple TV+ series, “The Reluctant Traveler,” William offered a tour of Windsor Castle and offered some intriguing hints about how he might shake up the monarchy. “It’s safe to say that change is on my agenda,” William said to Mr. Levy, as the two sat over pints at a pub in Windsor. “Not overly radical change,” he added, “but changes that I think need to happen.” William arrived for the meeting on a motorized scooter. He hopped off and greeted Mr. Levy by telling him he loved “ American Pie,” the 1999 sex comedy in which Mr. Levy played a befuddled dad. That drew an obliging laugh from Mr. Levy, an actor whose deadpan delivery has spiced up movies like “Best in Show” and the TV series “Schitt’s Creek.” He told the prince that spending a day with him was a “bucket list” item, as the two set off on a walk around Windsor’s sprawling grounds. “Was getting drunk with Prince William on your bucket list?” the prince said with a mischievous smile (the two appeared to nurse their drinks — a Guinness for Mr. Levy, a cider for William). For Britain’s royals-obsessed press, William’s encounter with Mr. Levy was both tantalizing and threatening. By working with an American streaming service, William served notice that he could shape his narrative while bypassing the tabloids, which have long wielded power in shaping the image of the royals. When William’s wife, Catherine, announced that she had completed her chemotherapy in September 2024, she did so in a gauzy, three-minute video made by Will Warr, a London videographer who specializes in wedding videos. She and William have also posted videos of themselves with their three children on Instagram. The London papers noted, somewhat sniffily, that Mr. Levy did not broach a sensitive issue: William’s feud with Harry. Mr. Levy said he was not instructed by the prince’s staff to avoid it. But he told ITV News, “I had no interest in asking him about that, because it was, you know, a very delicate issue and certainly not up to me to get into it.” Pub visits aside, William left no doubt that he intended to preserve a zone of privacy around his family. “Those who overstep it, I’ll fight against,” he said to Mr. Levy. “It’s about knowing where the line is.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.

87ebeb23d31e,María Corina Machado of Venezuela Is Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,,"María Corina Machado, the winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has emerged as a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, arguing, like Mr. Trump, that Venezuela’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, poses an enormous security threat to the region. Ms. Machado, in statements to the press in recent weeks, has said that, should Mr. Maduro fall, her movement was prepared to take territorial and administrative control of Venezuela, and that they have a plan for the first 100 hours and the first 100 days of a transition. She has also touted an economic plan to American and other investors, saying that a democratic Venezuela under her movement's control has the potential to generate $1.7 trillion in wealth in 15 years. Since September, the Trump administration has been targeting what it calls drug boats in the Caribbean. But the size of the military buildup in the region, and Mr. Trump’s increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro, have led many people in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal — possibly by force. Ms. Machado has largely avoided commenting on whether Mr. Maduro’s removal should involve U.S. military intervention inside Venezuela. In an interview last month, her adviser for international affairs, Pedro Urruchurtu, said that her team was communicating with the Trump administration about plans for Mr. Maduro’s removal. The opposition’s strategy, he said, includes persuading other governments, including the United States, to take diplomatic, financial, intelligence and law enforcement actions against Mr. Maduro. But, he added: “It has to be done with the use of force, because otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to defeat a regime like the one we’re facing.” Ms. Machado’s party, Vente Venezuela, has been sharing online the threats made by Trump officials against alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers. “If you’re in the Caribbean, if you’re north of Venezuela,” the party wrote on X, echoing a statement from the U.S. Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, “and you’re trying to traffic drugs to the US, you’re a legitimate target for the US.” Over the last decade, as Venezuela’s economy crumbled, Mr. Maduro’s security forces hunted political enemies and the opposition weakened. Many in the country lost hope for any kind of political change. Then came Ms. Machado, who managed to unite voters around the common goals of restoring democracy and reuniting families torn apart by migration. A conservative former lawmaker who had been a political foil to the socialist ruling party, on the campaign trail Ms. Machado mostly tempered any partisan economic talk and focused on what united most Venezuelans: the pain of family separations and the loss of political freedoms. When the government banned her from running in the July 2024 election, she managed got a surrogate, Edmundo González , on the ballot. Despite constant harassment on the campaign trail, and the detention of many supporters, Ms. Machado crisscrossed her nation and inspired millions to come out on Election Day. Then, after Mr. Maduro declared victory, her movement collected and counted thousands of paper vote tallies from polling stations, uploading them online. Her movement said the tallies showed the opposition had won overwhelmingly. An independent vote monitor, the Carter Center, found that count to be accurate . It was the most resounding rejection of the regime created by Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, in its 25-year existence. But Ms. Machado had no way to enforce the results. The military stood by Mr. Maduro. Thousands of her supporters took to the streets. A government crackdown led to at least two dozen deaths and the capture of more than 2,000 political prisoners, ending the protests quickly. Ms. Machado went into hiding in Venezuela, and Mr. González fled to Spain. The election of Mr. Trump, who had tried to oust Mr. Maduro in his first term, was a turning point. As soon as his win was announced last year, Ms. Machado began trying to convince his allies that the U.S. president could successfully remove Mr. Maduro this time around. In a series of interviews with The New York Times late last year, Ms. Machado said that for Mr. Trump, Venezuela offered “an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.” Mr. Maduro was very weak, she claimed, and through a pressure campaign, Mr. Trump could force him to recognize the result of the 2024 Venezuelan vote — and leave. Ms. Machado has ties in Washington that go back more than 20 years. The U.S. government provided financial aid to a voters’ rights group she founded in the early 2000s, and she met President George W. Bush at the White House in 2005. She has known Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, for more than a decade, she said. But for a time, it was unclear if Mr. Trump would pay attention to Venezuela, or Ms. Machado’s call for help. In the early months of his administration, it seemed the United States was headed toward a semi-normalization of the relationship with Mr. Maduro’s government. A special envoy appointed by Mr. Trump, Richard Grenell, made an uncommon visit to Caracas, shaking hands with the autocrat, and began to negotiate economic and diplomatic deals. But something changed in August. The Trump administration began sending warships into the Caribbean, declared Mr. Maduro the head of terrorist organization flooding the United States with drugs — though only about 8 percent of the cocaine reaching the United States, and virtually none of the fentanyl, passes through Venezuela. Mr. Trump ordered the attacks on boats in the Caribbean, and directed Mr. Grenell to cut off diplomatic talks with Venezuela. On Fox News just after the U.S. began bombing boats near Venezuela, Ms. Machado said that Mr. Maduro “is understanding finally that the time of impunity is over and it is in his best interest to accept the will of the people that voted against him. It’s time to go .”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/10/world/nobel-peace-prize,World,BBC,By Pranav Baskar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/blogs/10NobelPromo/mosaic-2022-06-23t135435z2066240319rc2pxu9m2s1wrtrmadp3advertising-cannes02-787-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:25:03+00:00,e99d68ea8d106d5ede13521e82baa68e3a672e34
a45652b36219,Mount Everest Just Recorded Some of Its Most Intense Snowfall Ever,"weather, snow snowstorms, cold spells;polar vortex, mountain, himalayas, mount everest","The storm that came spinning out of the Bay of Bengal in the north of the Indian Ocean last weekend was already notable. It pounded the Himalayas — the tallest mountains in the world — and unleashed a torrent of snow that closed roads, buried tents and stranded hundreds of people on Mount Everest. Now, data from a weather station at an Everest base camp suggests that the rate at which the snow fell during part of the storm may have broken records or, at the very least, was one of the most significant ever recorded. Baker Perry, an expert in high mountain extremes and a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, called one measurement of the snow that fell “off the charts.” “No wonder tents were collapsing,” he said. The Record at Stake It wasn’t that long ago that a team of ambitious meteorologists trekked to Mount Everest, not to summit the mountain but to install weather stations at the highest points on Earth. They wanted to better understand the atmosphere and how it affects the water that is stored in the world’s highest mountain chains. The weather stations transmit real-time information about temperature, humidity and precipitation from five locations around the mountain. Three of the stations transmit information in real time . Two others are offline, including one — the highest weather station in the world — near Everest’s summit. The other, down the mountain at a place called South Col, has data about last weekend’s snowstorm that Dr. Perry is eager to collect in person. Based on what he had seen so far, though, Dr. Perry called last weekend’s storm “far and away the biggest” he had observed since he helped install the stations in 2019. It all has to do with what meteorologists call “water equivalent precipitation,” or the amount of water that is left when a pile of snow is melted. Water equivalent measurements are especially useful in comparing places that experience intense periods of precipitation, as with lake-effect snow around the Great Lakes or atmospheric rivers in the Pacific Northwest. It’s a scientific way to answer the question of how much rain or snow actually fell, and is often measured in 12-hour and 24-hour increments. One of the highest water equivalent measurements ever recorded occurred in 1921 during a snowstorm in Silver Lake, Colo., when 142 millimeters, or about 5.6 inches, of precipitation fell as snow over 27 and a half hours. That amount has stood as the U.S. record and, though it is disputed, is considered by some to be a world record for snowfall. On Everest, the highest measurements recorded before this storm were 38 millimeters in a 24-hour period in July 2021 and just over 26 millimeters in a 12-hour period in October that same year. On Saturday, Dr. Perry said, the Everest base camp reported 122 millimeters in 24 hours, 92 millimeters of which came in just 12 hours. Both are more than three times as high as the totals from the 2021 storms. This week, Dr. Perry has been feverishly checking with other scientists across the world to compare data. For now, he said, “I am certainly not comfortable claiming that this is a world record, but I can say that the 12-hour and 24-hour liquid equivalent totals are amongst the highest ever recorded.” The Scientific Debate As the storm swept into the region, it brought along with it water vapor from the Bay of Bengal, said Jay Cordeira, an assistant director for precipitation science at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. He compared it to what happened last year when Hurricane Helene’s circulation passed from the Gulf of Mexico through the Southern Appalachians: The mountains caused the clouds to be squeezed and wrung dry, creating flooding as all that rain fell to the ground. Because of the higher elevation of the Himalayas, the precipitation fell as snow. There’s disagreement over how significant the snowfall was. Dinkar Kayastha, with the Nepal Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, said it was “part of the regular monsoon process and not considered unusual or extreme.” The region’s annual monsoon season is caused by the changing of winds and frequently features heavy rainfall. But Arbindra Khadka, an expert in meteorology at Tribhuvan University in Nepal, said the “large-scale continuous precipitation and snowfall” set this storm apart, as did the amount of snow that fell over such a short period of time on Everest. He called it “a rare event in October,” the kind of snowstorm that happens only every 25 to 50 years. This is where the water equivalent becomes more important than the snow depth. Snow depth, which is how most records are kept in the United States, is not an apples-to-apples comparison, Dr. Baker said, because the air can change the density of snow. So, scientifically, the only way to compare snow amounts is to melt it down and get the water equivalent. Several factors can influence a record, including the fact that someone from Dr. Perry’s team has to get back to base camp to retrieve the physical log of the data and calibrate it. That involves accounting for powerful wind speeds that can make it difficult for snow to fall into the bucket that collects the measurement. These wind readings can allow scientists to make adjustments that can add up to an accurate water equivalent reading. Dr. Baker noted that accurate readings of precipitation from extreme locations like Everest have become possible only in recent years and that there are many remote places where very little data has been collected. “These types of events may be more common under the right circumstances, especially in high mountain Asia, than we know,” he said. “We just happen to have these gauges at Everest base camp, and we’re seeing this.” Just as snow in the Sierra Nevada in the United States is beneficial for the water supply in California, the snow in this region is valuable for Nepal and India. As the planet heats up, the mountains in the region have grown warmer in recent years. That can be a problem, as more of the precipitation that once fell as snow falls instead as rain. Dr. Perry said the change could have “huge hydrological implications” and could cause more of the moisture to run off at once, potentially setting off floods as the landscape is unable to absorb so much moisture at one time.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/weather/mount-everest-record-snow.html,World,BBC,By Judson Jones,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06int-china-everest-vjzb/06int-china-everest-vjzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T16:20:27+00:00,e5b7d01b0da8d5d9c215b8c27a26b3ca63827259
7c4efe71a4c1,"In Retaliatory Move, Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on Chinese Goods","us politics, us foreign policy, international trade, tariff, rare earths, regulation and deregulation, donald trump, xi jinping, china","President Trump on Friday said he would impose a 100 percent tariff on all products from China in response to curbs Beijing announced this week on rare-earth minerals, a rapid escalation of tensions between the world's largest economies. On Truth Social, Mr. Trump wrote that the tariffs would take effect on Nov. 1 and be imposed “over and above” other tariffs on Chinese exports, which are already 30 percent and in some cases much higher. The United States would also put export controls on critical software, he said. In an earlier post on Friday, the president threatened to retaliate and cancel a planned meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump called the curbs that China put out this week on its exports of rare-earth minerals “sinister and hostile” and said they would “make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World.” He added that he had planned to meet Mr. Xi in two weeks at an international economic conference in South Korea, “but now there seems to be no reason to do so.” “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” he wrote. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” Markets shuddered at the developments — the S&P 500 index sliding more than 2 percent on Friday. Speaking Friday evening, the president suggested that the tariffs could be walked back before the Nov. 1 deadline and that he would not necessarily cancel his planned meeting with Mr. Xi. “We’ll see what happens,” Mr. Trump said. He called China’s move “very, very bad.” Rare-earth minerals, which are vital for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets, have been at the center of tensions between the United States and China this year. Mr. Trump has also placed extreme tariffs on Chinese exports before, only to walk them back after they restricted trade and hurt companies in both countries. In April, the Chinese government responded to the stiff tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese goods by clamping down on mineral exports destined for U.S. automakers and defense manufacturers. The Trump administration tried to encourage China to back down by imposing its own restrictions on exports of chip design software, airplane engines and other products. U.S. tariffs on Chinese products rose to a minimum of 145 percent, bringing much trade between the countries to a halt and raising concerns about empty American store shelves. China’s mineral curbs threatened to close U.S. factories and forced the United States, which depends on Chinese supplies, to pull back . Ultimately, officials from both countries reached a fragile truce in meetings this spring that led to Mr. Trump’s reducing his tariffs and Beijing’s approving more mineral exports. On Thursday, Beijing again escalated its controls , asserting broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology. The Chinese government said it would require companies anywhere in the world to obtain licenses if they are exporting products containing even a minimal amount of Chinese-produced rare earths, including for chip manufacturing. Those exports would also be controlled if the minerals were produced using Chinese mining, processing or magnet-making technologies. Companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries would be denied those licenses, it said. The Chinese government also put new controls on equipment needed to manufacture batteries for electric cars. The global nature of the Chinese restrictions mirror those that the United States has put on semiconductors, which dictate that any company using American chip technology anywhere in the world must follow United States guidelines. China has responded to those restrictions by developing its own framework to regulate industries that it dominates. China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths and performs the chemical processing for roughly 90 percent of the global supply of the minerals. The new restrictions have caused significant anxiety among U.S. companies. Analysts said the new limits could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple. Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent. On Friday, China also announced an antimonopoly investigation into the American chipmaker Qualcomm and new fees for U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports. Analysts had speculated that China’s mineral restrictions could be an effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. If so, it could backfire. In addition to the president’s calls for retaliation, other critics of China said the measures highlighted the need for the United States to reduce its exposure to the Chinese economy. The Chinese government has set out ambitious plans in recent decades to dominate various industries, including steel, shipbuilding, robotics, rare earths and biomedicine. John Moolenaar, the Republican chairman of the House Select Committee on China, called Beijing’s action “an economic declaration of war against the United States and a slap in the face to President Trump amid his efforts to fight for a level playing field.” Mr. Moolenaar said the United States should immediately pass legislation to end preferential trade treatment for China, build the U.S. supply of minerals and “strangle China’s technology sector with export controls instead of selling it advanced chips.” Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the think tank Asia Society Policy Institute, said the president’s statements showed “how fragile the emerging détente between the two countries really is.” “Beijing has become increasingly assertive, believing it has the upper hand in the bilateral relationship,” she said. But Mr. Trump’s counter threats showed that “two can play this game.” With the planned summit between the leaders in just over two weeks, it was unclear whether the two sides would be willing to de-escalate to hold the meeting, Ms. Cutler added. In his social media post, Mr. Trump said that China’s policies “came out of nowhere.” The United States’ relationship with China over the past six months had been a very good one, he said. The president said that although China had a monopoly on rare-earth minerals, the United States had other monopolies that were “stronger and more far reaching.” He added, “I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW!” The White House has been planning for President Trump to travel to Asia later this month, where he would meet Mr. Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea. The plans had generated speculation about whether the meeting could lead to an economic deal between the countries, potentially including Chinese purchases of American products or Chinese investment in the United States. Beijing has also been interested in having the United States roll back the global controls it has put on China’s access to advanced A.I. chips. American farmers have asked the administration to push China to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybean exports that have had a crippling impact this year . Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky soybean farmer who is the president of the American Soybean Association, said that his group was “extremely disappointed” that the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would be canceled. “Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis,” Mr. Ragland said.

d085faca8d0d,Peace Prize Winner Has Supported Trump’s Military Actions in the Caribbean,"maria corina machado, nicolas maduro, donald trump, us foreign policy, vente venezuela, venezuela, us, caribbean","María Corina Machado, the winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has emerged as a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, arguing, like Mr. Trump, that Venezuela’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, poses an enormous security threat to the region. “This is about saving lives,” she told Fox News last month after the United States began bombing suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, “not only Venezuelan lives, but also lives of American people, because as you have said, and we have heard, Maduro is the head of a narco-terrorist structure of cooperation.” Ms. Machado, in statements to the press in recent weeks, has said that, should Mr. Maduro fall, her movement was prepared to take territorial and administrative control of Venezuela, and that they have a plan for the first 100 hours and the first 100 days of a transition. She has also touted an economic plan to American and other investors, saying that a democratic Venezuela under her movement's control has the potential to generate $1.7 trillion in wealth in 15 years. Since September, the Trump administration has been targeting what it calls drug boats in the Caribbean. But the size of the military buildup in the region, and Mr. Trump’s increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro, have led many people in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal — possibly by force. Ms. Machado has largely avoided commenting on whether Mr. Maduro’s removal should involve U.S. military intervention inside Venezuela. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

247db6628f89,Machado’s Peace Prize Is Latest Nobel for Female Democracy Campaigners,"nobel prize, nobel foundation, aung san suu kyi, narges mohammadi, venezuela, democracy, ellen johnson sirleaf","The Norwegian Nobel Committee’s decision to award the Peace Prize to María Corina Machado is the latest honor given to a female democracy campaigner in recent years. In 2023, Narges Mohammadi of Iran was recognized for her crusade for women’s rights , which the committee said “made her a symbol of freedom and standard-bearer in the struggle against the Iranian theocracy.” In 1991, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar was awarded the prize for “her nonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights.” Ms. Mohammadi, 53, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 80, were in prison when they were honored by the Nobel committee — and they are in prison today. Both are reported to be in ill health. Ms. Mohammadi was a leader at the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an organization that promotes democracy and women’s rights. A founder of the organization, Shirin Ebadi , a human rights lawyer and mentor to Ms. Mohammadi, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. Ms. Mohammadi’s campaigning began at a young age. The Iranian morality police arrested her when she was 19 for having dared to wear an orange coat, according to the speech she wrote to accept the Peace Prize. (As with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, her children accepted the honor in her stead.) After that incident, Ms. Mohammadi was arrested on more than a dozen occasions, and she is now serving a 10-year sentence for “spreading anti-state propaganda.” When she was briefly released from prison to recover from surgery last year, she was recorded on video chanting a slogan that animated a female-led uprising against the Islamic Republic: “Women, life, freedom!” She was not, as required under Iranian law, wearing a hijab. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father was considered modern Myanmar’s founding father, was thrust into the political spotlight in 1988 when the ruling junta brutally suppressed pro-democracy rallies. She became the leader of the National League for Democracy party, which won elections in 1990 that the top brass ignored. She spent most of the next two decades under house arrest before being released in 2010. When a new clutch of generals began to loosen the political reins, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was elected a member of Parliament and later became the nation’s de facto leader. But after her party won another landslide election in 2020, the military staged a coup. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned again, along with hundreds of other pro-democracy politicians. Myanmar is now engulfed by civil war. Other women who have been awarded the Peace Prize for their campaigns for democracy and women’s rights include Tawakkol Karman of Yemen and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia, who were joint honorees in 2011.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/nobel-peace-prize-women-democracy.html,World,BBC,By Hannah Beech,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/multimedia/10nobel-dissidents-hjvt/10nobel-dissidents-hjvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T12:04:16.509000+00:00,3b377af51e5ae3f9bdb28ccaf80c1ac0af114214

President Emmanuel Macron of France has shown he is one of Europe’s most decisive and vibrant leaders, but his inability to find a government that can deal with spiraling debt and political division is undercutting his credibility as an international actor of consequence. Mr. Macron, deeply unpopular at home, is seeking to form a sixth government in the past 21 months, still hoping to find a prime minister who can cobble together support in a Parliament split at least three ways, with no faction able to command a stable majority. After a long day of negotiations on Friday with party leaders, Mr. Macron announced that he had asked Sébastian Lecornu , who had resigned on Monday, to try yet again. “Domestic instability undermines credibility even if foreign-policy competence lies with the president,” said Daniela Schwarzer, an expert in Franco-German relations and a member of the executive board of the Bertelsmann Foundation, a nonprofit institute. “Because as soon as it’s about money, it depends on the Parliament and on the budget,” over which Mr. Macron has no direct control, she said. A paralyzed Paris erodes Europe’s strategic weight and ability to make decisions, especially on rearmament. Mr. Macron may promise more money for the military in any new French budget, as he did this summer, but it is France’s Parliament that controls the funds, making his efforts to respond to a newly aggressive Russia seem hollow.

A conservative former lawmaker, Ms. Machado has long been a foil to Venezuela’s socialist ruling party. She has been in hiding since the summer of 2024, when President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory in a vote that was widely seen as rigged . The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize, said that it chose Ms. Machado primarily for her efforts to advance democracy “in the face of ever-expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela.” In its statement , the committee praised Ms. Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Ms. Machado supports President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, which he says is meant to stop drug smuggling to the United States from Latin America. In a series of interviews with The New York Times late last year, Ms. Machado said that, for Mr. Trump, Venezuela offered “an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.” Here’s what to know about Ms. Machado, the movement she leads and what this honor means for Venezuela. Who is María Corina Machado? Ms. Machado, 58, is the eldest daughter of a prominent family in Caracas. She attended an elite Catholic girls’ school in Caracas and a boarding school in Wellesley, Mass. She studied engineering and finance and later worked for the family company, Sivensa, a large steel producer. Parts of the company were expropriated in 2010 by President Hugo Chávez, the founder of the country’s modern socialist movement, who took control of dozens of privately owned companies as part of his nationalization program. In the early 2000s, she became a political activist and a founder of Súmate, a voter rights group that led a failed effort to recall Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. Mr. Maduro has held power since. Ms. Machado joined the National Assembly in 2010, winning a record number of votes. She leads the Vente Venezuela opposition party, and in 2023 she announced a bid for the presidency. But she was blocked from running in the 2024 election over what the government said were financial irregularities when she was a national legislator. She called this a politically motivated maneuver meant to keep her from power and backed a surrogate, a little-known former diplomat named Edmundo González . Mr. González ran against Mr. Maduro, who claimed victory in the election. The opposition, however, collected evidence that it said showed Mr. González won by a wide margin and alleged that Mr. Maduro had stolen the vote. The Carter Center, an independent vote monitoring organization, has called the opposition’s count accurate . Why was she awarded the Nobel Peace Prize? Jorgen Watne Frydnes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told reporters after the announcement that the judges weighed the security implications of giving the prize to Ms. Machado. “This is the discussion we have every year for all candidates, particularly when the person who receives the prize is, in fact, in hiding because of serious threats to her life,” he said, adding that the committee believed the award would support her cause. Mr. Frydnes said he hoped that she would be able to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in December, but that it would depend on the security situation. The Nobel committee, in giving the prize to Ms. Machado, warned of pressure on democracy across the globe. “Democracy is also in retreat internationally,” the committee wrote. “Democracy — understood as the right to freely express one’s opinion, to cast one’s vote and to be represented in elective government — is the foundation of peace both within countries and between countries.” What does she think about Mr. Trump’s moves toward Venezuela? Ms. Machado has emerged as a strong supporter of President Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, arguing, like Mr. Trump, that Mr. Maduro poses a national security threat to the region. After the United States began bombing suspected drug boats in the Caribbean last month, she said in an interview to Fox News : “This is about saving lives, not only Venezuelan lives, but also lives of American people, because as you have said, and we have heard, Maduro is the head of a narco-terrorist structure of cooperation.” Ms. Machado, in statements to the press in recent weeks, has said that, should Mr. Maduro fall, her movement was prepared to take territorial and administrative control of Venezuela. She has also promoted an economic plan to U.S. and other investors, saying that a democratic Venezuela under her movement’s control has the potential to generate $1.7 trillion in wealth in 15 years, in part by privatizing the oil industry. Since September, the Trump administration has been targeting what it calls drug boats in the Caribbean.

34f39e0684ad,"Gaza Cease-Fire Begins, Israel Says, as Thousands Return to the North","israel gaza war, palestinians, peace process, us foreign policy, gaza city, gaza strip, israel, hamas, donald trump","Thousands of people began the long walk from the south to the north of the Gaza Strip on Friday after the Israeli military announced a cease-fire that mediators hoped would lead to the end of the two-year war. Men carried bags, women carried young children, and older children held hands as they made their way up the dusty seaside road toward the ruins of Gaza City, which they were ordered to flee weeks ago. Some said they were heading north for the first time since the war began. Though the surroundings were bleak, the mood was jubilant. “The crowds are unbelievable,” said Shamekh al-Dibs, who fled south with his family last month. “People are so happy, even if what they’re going back to is destruction.” Israel agreed early Friday morning to a cease-fire deal with Hamas, which the military said came into effect at noon. As part of the agreement, Hamas would release the remaining hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, while Israeli troops would partially withdraw. The deal was based on a proposal presented by President Trump last week. On Friday, a spokesman for Israel’s Parliament said Mr. Trump was expected to visit the chamber in Jerusalem on Monday. Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Mideast envoy, said the U.S. military had verified that Israeli troops had withdrawn to the agreed-upon line inside Gaza. That, he said on social media, opened a 72-hour window in which Hamas must hand over the remaining hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a recorded statement on Friday that the cease-fire deal would allow the country to bring back the remaining hostages while maintaining its forces in Gaza. Israel would not compromise on the rest of its demands, he added, including that Hamas lay down its weapons and that Gaza be demilitarized. But Hamas regards disarmament as tantamount to surrender and views armed struggle as a legitimate form of resistance against Israeli control over Palestinian lands. “If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better. If not, it will be done the hard way,” Mr. Netanyahu said. On the coastal road in Gaza, Mousa Rajab, 22, a nursing student, said he and his cousin had decided to start walking to Gaza City as soon as they heard about the cease-fire. Around them, thousands of pedestrians shared the asphalt with trucks, vans and horse-drawn carts packed with people and piled high with blankets, water tanks and mattresses. “We just want to see if our homes are still standing,” Mr. Rajab said. “We heard ours was partly damaged, but we have to see it with our own eyes.” Though previous cease-fires in Gaza have collapsed into renewed fighting, Mr. Rajab was optimistic the war might actually be over this time. “Everything still feels uncertain,” he said. “Will they tell us to leave again? I hope not. I just want this to be the last time we walk this road.” Mohammed Zaki al-Kabariti, 43, was walking north with his nephew, clutching a jerry can of water in one hand and several bags of blankets in the other. When he heard his neighbors were heading back to Gaza City, he made a snap decision to join them. He was eager to see how his neighborhood, al-Rimal, had fared during the Israeli ground assault that began last month. “I’m tired and broke,” he said. “But it feels like I’m going home, back to my street, my neighbors, my life.” Avichay Adraee, a military spokesman, said on Friday that the Israeli military would allow Palestinians in southern Gaza to travel along major roads to the north. But he warned people not to approach several areas across Gaza where Israeli troops would remain active, saying those places were “extremely dangerous.” On Thursday night, the Israeli military said it had struck a site in northern Gaza, which it said was being used by Hamas fighters who “posed an immediate threat” to Israeli troops. Gaza’s Civil Defense emergency rescue service said the site was a residential building that dozens of people were believed to be in at the time of the strike. According to a government resolution Mr. Netanyahu’s office released on Friday, the Israeli military would have to move to new deployment lines inside Gaza by early Saturday. Hamas would then have 72 hours to return all of the hostages, including the bodies of those who have died. The text also said ⁠⁠Israel had authorized the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners, mostly serving life sentences, and 1,722 Gazans detained during the war who were not involved in the attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, including 22 people who were under the age of 18. On Friday, the Israeli government issued a list of the prisoners who would be released, including many who were convicted of staging attacks against Israelis. It did not include several high-profile prisoners whose release analysts had expected Hamas would try to secure. A Hamas office that handles prisoners’ affairs said on Friday that the list was not yet agreed on or finalized.

e6ca81562cac,Venezuela’s Maduro Offered the U.S. His Nation’s Riches to Avoid Conflict,"us foreign policy, embargoes sanctions, oil and gasoline, energy industry, chevron, conocophillips, shell, state department, maria corina machado, marco rubio, donald trump, venezuela, us, international relations","Venezuelan officials, hoping to end their country’s clash with the United States, offered the Trump administration a dominant stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in discussions that lasted for months, according to multiple people close to the talks. The far-reaching offer remained on the table as the Trump administration called the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela a “narco-terror cartel,” amassed warships in the Caribbean and began blowing up boats that American officials say were carrying drugs from Venezuela. Under a deal discussed between a senior U.S. official and Mr. Maduro’s top aides, the Venezuelan strongman offered to open up all existing and future oil and gold projects to American companies, give preferential contracts to American businesses, reverse the flow of Venezuelan oil exports from China to the United States, and slash his country’s energy and mining contracts with Chinese, Iranian and Russian firms. The Trump administration ended up rebuffing Mr. Maduro’s economic concessions and cut off diplomacy with Venezuela last week. The move effectively killed the deal, at least for now, the people close to the discussion said. Though the United States has been targeting what it calls drug boats, the cutoff of diplomacy, the military buildup near Venezuela and the increasingly strident threats against Mr. Maduro by Trump administration officials have led many in both countries to think that the Trump administration’s real objective is Mr. Maduro’s removal . Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state and national security adviser, has been the leading voice in the administration’s push to oust Mr. Maduro. He has called Mr. Maduro an illegitimate leader who is a “fugitive from American justice” and has been skeptical of the diplomatic approach conducted by a special U.S. envoy, Richard Grenell. Proponents of diplomacy acknowledge that Mr. Rubio’s hard line approach has prevailed for now. But they believe their efforts could eventually bear fruit, pointing to Mr. Trump’s sudden reversals on other major foreign policy issues, such as the war in Ukraine , trade with China or Iran’s nuclear program . This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen American and Venezuelan representatives of disparate factions calling for diplomacy with Mr. Maduro. They described their discussions on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Publicly, the Venezuelan government has responded to Mr. Trump’s military escalation with defiance and vows to defend what it calls a socialist revolution started in the 1990s by Mr. Maduro’s late predecessor and mentor Hugo Chávez. At the same time, Mr. Maduro has said he remains open to negotiations and his government continues accepting deportation flights from the United States. Behind the scenes, however, Venezuela’s senior officials, with Mr. Maduro’s blessing, have offered Washington far-reaching concessions that would essentially eliminate the vestiges of resource nationalism at the core of Mr. Chávez’s movement. While Mr. Grenell and Venezuelan officials made progress on economic issues, they failed to agree on Mr. Maduro’s political future, according to the people close to the negotiations. Venezuela’s foreign minister, Yván Gil, said in an interview last month that Mr. Maduro would not negotiate his exit. Mr. Maduro has repeatedly repressed democratic challenges to his rule after assuming the presidency in 2013. He held on to power last year after losing a presidential election by rigging the results and brutally suppressing protests . Mr. Grenell declined to comment for this article. The State Department, the White House and Venezuela’s government did not respond to requests for comment. In Washington, American officials offer differing assessments of the talks. One U.S. official said the reports of negotiations over the lifting of sanctions and access to the Venezuelan market was “not an accurate assessment of what took place.” But other American officials said U.S. and Venezuelan officials held repeated talks over what economic normalization would look like, including access to Venezuelan energy markets by American companies and a lifting of U.S. sanctions. As Mr. Grenell and Mr. Maduro’s envoys negotiated a deal, the leader of Venezuela’s main opposition movement, María Corina Machado, pitched her own economic proposal in New York. She argued that even greater economic wealth — $1.7 trillion in 15 years — awaited U.S. companies in Venezuela if her movement launched a political transition. (Ms. Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for what the Norwegian Nobel Committee described as “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.”) Ms. Machado’s economic adviser, Sary Levy, said the investment deals offered by Mr. Maduro would never materialize without democracy, rule of law and individual freedoms. “What Maduro offers investors is not stability, it's control — control maintained through terror,” said Ms. Levy. “The Trump Administration has shown a clear intention to not fall for these offers of easy solutions.” Venezuela currently produces about one million barrels of oil a day, down from about three million when Mr. Chávez took power. The bulk of Venezuela’s oil exports go to China, except for about 100,000 barrels per day that the U.S. energy giant Chevron sells to the United States. Most experts agree that Venezuela could quickly ramp up oil output with a major injection of foreign capital, though they differ on whether this is achievable under the current government. “Our message to the oil companies is: We want you here, certainly,” Ms. Machado told American corporate representatives in June. “We want you here not producing crumbs of a couple hundred thousand barrels a day. We want you here producing millions of barrels a day.” Ms. Machado declined to comment for this article. In the past, the United States framed its support for a new government in Venezuela as a human rights imperative. In contrast, the economic points discussed by Mr. Maduro’s envoys with Mr. Grenell echoed a mercantilist worldview that Mr. Trump has promoted elsewhere. Mr. Trump has demanded access to Ukrainian minerals as payment for U.S. support for Kyiv’s war effort. He has frequently lamented that the United States did not get Iraqi oil after the 2003 invasion. He agreed to keep U.S. troops in Syria in 2019 on the condition that America would “keep the oil.” The deal discussed between Mr. Grenell and Venezuelan officials was especially sweeping, representing arguably the most ambitious attempt at resource diplomacy during the president’s second term. Normalizing trade and allowing American companies back into Venezuela could be tempting to some U.S. officials because of the country’s oil reserves, the world’s largest, as well as significant deposits of natural gas, gold, iron, bauxite and coltan, a mineral mix used in electric batteries. Mr. Maduro’s economic outreach to the United States has also extended to the private sector, in an attempt to strengthen his hand in Washington. Venezuela’s state oil company has given Chevron, the largest American company working in Venezuela, full control of their joint oil projects and the two entities have discussed giving Chevron a stake in another major oil field. Venezuelan officials have worked to repair relations with another U.S. oil giant, ConocoPhillips, which left Venezuela in 2007 after the government seized its operations. Mr. Maduro’s government and Conoco have been negotiating an oil trading deal as recently as this year, according to two people familiar with the talks. Chevron said its business dealings in Venezuela comply with all applicable Venezuelan and U.S. laws. Conoco did not respond to a request for comment. The outreach by Venezuelan officials and business leaders came closest to achieving a diplomatic breakthrough in May, according to the people briefed on the talks. As a sign of good will, Mr. Grenell that month orchestrated the return of a Venezuelan toddler stranded in the United States after her parents were deported , giving Mr. Maduro a domestic political win. Venezuela’s government reciprocated shortly afterward by releasing a U.S. Air Force veteran jailed in the country and delivering him to Mr. Grenell . Mr. Maduro came to support most of the economic terms in the proposal discussed with Mr. Grenell. A person familiar with the negotiations said Mr. Maduro initially wavered on the American demand to limit Venezuela’s economic ties with China, Russia and Iran. But he eventually saw that loosening those alliances was an inevitable price for avoiding American military intervention, the person said. To maximize income in the face of U.S. pressure, Venezuela has also stopped sending oil to Cuba, worsening acute electricity shortages in the allied nation. Mr. Grenell’s economic negotiations with Mr. Maduro’s envoys faced strong opposition from Mr. Rubio, a Cuban American and former senator who has long viewed Mr. Maduro’s downfall as a crucial step to ending the Communist dictatorship on the island. The proponents of economic engagement with Mr. Maduro have managed to score minor victories. Chevron got its U.S. Treasury license to operate in Venezuela reinstated in July, according to the Venezuelan government . The company succeeded in overturning the ban imposed by Mr. Trump months earlier after a concerted lobbying push in Washington, according to people familiar with the deal. The Treasury Department on Wednesday issued another license that in effect allows Shell, Europe’s largest energy company, to restart work in Venezuela. Under a new permit, Shell could begin producing gas from a massive offshore Venezuelan field as soon as next year, according to a person familiar with the deal. The gas from the field, known as Dragon, will be processed and sold from neighboring Trinidad. Shell directed questions to the license holder, the government of Trinidad & Tobago, whose officials did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Rubio said last month that the United States would ensure that the Dragon project would “not provide significant benefit to the Maduro regime.” Mr. Maduro has signed off on a stipulation that would have Shell invest in social projects in Venezuela instead of paying his government. For the Maduro government, the key benefit is showing that Venezuela remains open for business.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-us-oil.html,World,BBC,"By Anatoly Kurmanaev, Julian E.

d6772e6b48c6,Aid Groups Preparing to Provide Quick Relief to Gaza Under Cease-Fire,"live-detached, food aid, israel gaza war, humanitarian aid, peace process, refugees;internally displaced people, palestinians, un, united nations relief and works agency, gaza strip, israel","Gaza is in the grip of a deep humanitarian crisis with widespread hunger, vast destruction of property and most of its two million people displaced repeatedly in the past two years of war. The territory was impoverished before the war began, and food supplies and other aid have been sharply curtailed since the conflict began, making things much worse. “Our teams are ready,” said Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. “We just need the green light to drive those trucks and get them in so our staff can deliver aid directly to people in need.” Ms. Touma said the agency had enough food, medicine and shelter materials in its warehouses to fill 6,000 trucks. The top U.N. humanitarian official, Tom Fletcher, said on Thursday that the United Nations had a plan to scale up delivery of aid over the first 60 days of a cease-fire. He said that almost the entire population of Gaza needed some form of food aid, including 500,000 people who needed treatment to address the effects of famine. Mr. Fletcher said the United Nations would aim to send hundreds of trucks into Gaza every day to provide food for Gazans. The United Nations would support bakeries, community kitchens, fishermen and herders. It would also give cash to 200,000 families to cover basic food needs, Mr. Fletcher said. Supplies of dense, high-energy food items would be given to vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, children and adolescents, he added. The United Nations will also greatly increase efforts to provide shelter, giving priority to the displaced. Beyond delivering food and essential aid, the U.N.’s plan envisions restoring Gaza’s devastated health system, Mr. Fletcher said. The plan would help establish more health care sites and dispatch emergency medical teams to Gaza. Most of Gaza has been reduced to rubble and basic municipal services like clean water, functioning sewage systems and garbage pickups are in shambles. Mr. Fletcher said the United Nations would help repair and restore these services. Educational spaces would also be opened for about 700,000 children in Gaza, he added. In addition to Israeli restrictions that have hampered aid delivery throughout the war, the fighting in Gaza has also made it difficult for aid workers to operate. Fuel shortages have been another obstacle. Some of those impediments may be eased. Movement on the main roads from southern to northern Gaza will likely not be restricted or require coordination with the Israeli military, according to four officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details in the cease-fire agreement. About 600 trucks of humanitarian aid and other commercial goods are planned to enter Gaza daily, according to the four officials. Those trucks will include food, medical equipment, temporary shelters and fuel. They said the staff at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt will include personnel from the Palestinian Authority and European Union. The officials also said that the agreement allows for the entry into Gaza of essential materials and tools to repair water and sewage infrastructure. They added that restrictions remained on some equipment and building materials needed to fully rehabilitate the enclave, such as cement and bulldozers. In New York, the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said that addressing Gaza’s dire needs would require “full, safe and sustained access for humanitarian workers; the removal of red tape and impediments; and the rebuilding of shattered infrastructure.” “We can scale up food, water, medical and shelter assistance at once,” he said. “But to turn this cease-fire into real progress, we need more than the silencing of the guns.” Humanitarian aid has been one of the most bitter flash points of the war in Gaza. Last month, a U.N. commission said Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians, and the month before that a U.N.-backed panel of food experts said parts of Gaza were officially under famine . Israel rejected both findings and took issue with the methodology used in the famine study. Israeli officials have said they allowed enough food into the territory, but argue that much of it had been stolen by Hamas after it entered Gaza or aid agencies struggled to distribute it. But since the start of the war, aid groups have accused Israel of imposing onerous rules and restrictions on what items can enter Gaza. The food shortages in Gaza worsened with the introduction in May of a new Israeli-backed and American-run system to distribute aid to the territory. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation operated only four distribution hubs in all of the enclave; the U.N.-run system that it largely replaced had hundreds of distribution points. The United Nations said hundreds of Palestinians had been killed near the distribution sites set up under the new system. Witnesses have said that some of them were killed by Israeli soldiers stationed around the periphery of the aid hubs. Israel said on some of those occasions that it had opened fire to control crowds.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/middleeast/aid-groups-gaza-cease-fire.html,World,BBC,"By Liam Stack, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad, Farnaz Fassihi and Natan Odenheimer",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09israel-hamas-cease-fire-aid-01-cwmj/09israel-hamas-cease-fire-aid-01-cwmj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:02:52+00:00,9ccf53f9af1396a9f9ab500406ecc4495ef1906b
2a9e95a0a16c,"Every Artist Has a Favorite Subject. For Some, That’s Math.","mathematics, sculpture, art, design academy eindhoven, henry segerman, eindhoven netherlands","It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that the Dutch sculptor Rinus Roelofs organizes his life around the annual Bridges conference, an international event celebrating synergies between math and art. In July, the conference drew more than 400 artistically minded mathematicians and mathematically minded artists to the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Dr. Roelofs’s main contribution to the program was a half-ton, eight-foot-tall metal sculpture called “Dancing Cubes.” “I do not call my art ‘mathematical art,’” Dr. Roelofs said in a video interview about a week later. “It’s art about mathematics. Every artist has a favorite subject, things you want to talk about. For me, that’s math.” “Dancing Cubes” is a riff on the geometric notion of duality: a relationship by which one form emerges, or can be constructed, from another. “If you have one object, you can make another object, the dual of the first object, and if you put the two together you have a new construction,” Dr. Roelofs said. Duality played a part in Dr. Roelofs’s dual Ph.D. in architecture and mathematics, which he obtained in 2020 at age 66. His artistic practice had always been research-driven, and in 2012, while creating a sculpture with equilateral triangles, he made a number of mathematical discoveries. For instance, he found a new series of uniform polyhedra based on helical rods. “ They look like spiky, twisted cylinders ,” said Doris Schattschneider, a mathematician and professor emerita at Moravian University who was on Dr. Roelofs’s thesis committee. Dr. Schattschneider, an expert on math-art intersections, noted that an elegant example of duality involves the cube and the regular octahedron, a three-dimensional geometric solid with eight faces, each an equilateral triangle. These two polyhedra, she said, “are called geometric duals because both have 12 edges, but the cube has six faces and eight vertexes while the octahedron has eight faces and six vertexes.” “Rinus doesn’t just do this classic display of duality, growing one construction inside the other,” Dr. Schattschneider said. “He rounds the edges and sometimes does a twist, so the end result is an intriguing sculpture.” For “Dancing Cubes,” Dr. Roelofs used a technique of his own devising — called an extrusion transformation — to extend his creation from classical geometry to innovative art. The sculpture is composed of only two elements: a right-angled triangle (30 copies) and a rounded triangular variation (12 copies). “One needs the other to exist,” Dr. Roelofs said. “If you take away one, the sculpture will fall apart.” The artwork earned its name because when it is assembled small cubes emerge along the central axis. “It’s a little surprise,” Dr. Roelofs said. A larger art exhibition of similar wonders is the centerpiece of every Bridges conference. This year, the exhibition drew 184 submissions. “This is the biggest and best Bridges ever,” Dr. Schattschneider said in an email from Eindhoven. Here is a sampling of a few of the other pieces from the exhibition: “Gradient of Grain” was created by Edmund Harriss, a mathematician and artist at the University of Arkansas, using a computer-controlled router. The radial carvings run along the so-called gradient, perpendicular to the tree’s growth rings. The growth rings serve as inputs that direct the carving algorithm. “When using digital manufacturing to render geometry, the mathematics is often imposed on the material,” Dr. Harriss noted in his artist’s statement. “As a material, however, wood talks back, revealing patterning of grain, whatever the geometry does.” Kanata Warisaya, a doctoral student in architecture and engineering at the University of Tokyo, said in an interview that “the fun of geometry” motivated him to create “ Spherical Hinged Tessellation feat. TMK122 .” Nevertheless, he envisioned this squeezable sphere as a stress toy: “I find it relaxing.” He made it in an art-science class led by Tomohiro Tachi, a professor of computational origami at the University of Tokyo, and Asao Tokolo, an artist. “Scissor Tessellation” is by Seri Nishimoto, also a doctoral student at the University of Tokyo. The piece is constructed from a repeating pattern of 48 scissorlike units (four rows by 12 columns), each scissor with an arm-to-length ratio of four centimeters to seven centimeters. “The repetition of the same unit creates an interesting, nontrivial transformation into a curved surface,” Ms. Nishimoto said. Jill Borcherds, a retired secondary school math teacher in Stevenage, England, created a colorful “Fabric Hexaflexagon.” A flexagon is a flat, folded geometric structure; when flexed along the folds, its various faces emerge. “I tried to bring out the connections between art and maths as a way of engaging students,” Ms. Borcherds said. “Those who struggled were motivated when careful measuring, calculating and constructing produced a beautiful design or 3-D object. So often I have witnessed the sense of wonder appearing when the third face of a hexaflexagon appears.” And then the fourth, fifth and sixth. “Doo-dah” is a digital creature discovered by John Winston Garth, a computer scientist in Athens, Ala. His artist’s statement explains: “The term ‘computerrarium’ describes it well. Conway’s Game of Life is just that — an environment with rules that mimic life’s, boiled down to their simplest form: birth, death and survival. This discovery, ‘Doo-dah,’ is an example of a precise combination of cells generated by software tailored for the job. Hidden creatures exist in this environment, finding a balance within the typical randomness.” This video shows two copies of the same gizmo, one white and one green, made by Henry Segerman, a mathematician at Oklahoma State University. Called “Expanding (3, 4, 5) Triangle,” the mechanisms are constructed from expanding racks , a system of circular gears (pinions) meshing with linear gears (racks). The white version is fully-contracted, and the green version is fully expanded. “When any part of the triangle is pulled or pushed, the entire structure gets bigger or smaller,” Dr. Segerman said. Generally, the ultimate dream with expanding mechanisms is to have a solid block of material when the racks are contracted, and then, when the racks are expanded, for all the material to be optimally deployed in a strong and stable structure. David Reimann, a mathematician and computer scientist at Albion College in Michigan, described “Square Root of Two” as a sort of algorithmic topiary. The digits of the square root of two are outlined — in the root system’s negative space — along the diagonal of a square, conveying the relationship between a unit square and the length of its diagonal.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/science/mathematics-art-roelofs.html,World,BBC,By Siobhan Roberts,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/00SCI-MATH-ART1-01-bhcz/00SCI-MATH-ART1-01-bhcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:01:22+00:00,9b524136384cec4df851f96d8c0eca81bfe3d625
465b8dfe4801,Mexico’s President Is Popular. So Is Her Professional Lookalike.,"claudia sheinbaum, tamara henaine, impersonators;impressionists, politics, social media, mexico, mexico city, actor, personal profile;people story","People craned their necks or did double-takes, shocked at the woman walking by. Some asked for selfies, others for government help. One woman offered a blessing, one man burst into song. Everyone had the same question. “Are you the president?” asked Manuel H. Garza, 66, a Mexican retiree, amazed to see her strolling around the streets of Mexico City. It was not President Claudia Sheinbaum , as many thought, but an actress who has tied her fortunes to the country’s first female head of state and who has vaulted into national fame by dint of their uncanny resemblance . Ms. Sheinbaum and the actress, Tamara Henaine, are the same height. They have similarly dark eyes and hair. Even their smiles look alike. (Granted, Ms. Henaine has been practicing.) In Ms. Henaine’s mind, she was born for this role. “I swear it feels like it,” she said, adding, “I believe in destiny.” For now, through Ms. Sheinbaum’s first year in office, destiny has been good for Ms. Henaine’s career. As the real president has delicately managed threats from President Trump and crises at home , Ms. Sheinbaum’s recent approval ratings reached as high as 79 percent . Ms. Henaine, 33, has seen her popularity explode, too. She is frequently mistaken on the street for the president. Millions have watched her social media videos impersonating Ms. Sheinbaum, and she recently launched a theatrical comedy about the president and Mr. Trump. Ms. Henaine calls her character Claudita, or Little Claudia. Describing herself an independent actress, she said she is not trying to provide a political boost to the president, though she said she admires her composure, intelligence and other attributes. Nor has Ms. Sheinbaum’s team or party ever paid her, she said, adding that she has also turned down requests to hawk products or brands as Claudita. Sometimes, people confusing her for the president lodge their civic complaints with Ms. Henaine, airing grievances about broken sidewalks or government funding. To differentiate herself from Ms. Sheinbaum in her private life, Ms. Henaine sometimes dyes her hair a little blond. Ms. Henaine also worries that, after so many years playing one person, she will be pigeonholed as an actress. Even though she was confident in her skills, she has been studying psychology as a backup career. “Also it’s part of the process of playing such a powerful, strong character, people blend you into the character,” she said. Ms. Henaine is much younger than Ms. Sheinbaum, 63, and the two aren’t related. But she looks so much like the president that she has teased her own mother about it. “I’m going to take a DNA test,” she said, “or I’m going to send Claudia my adoption letter.” Ms. Henaine’s career has progressed alongside that of Ms. Sheinbaum, who was a climate scientist before entering politics. Ms. Sheinbaum’s initial stint in government was as the environment minister of Mexico City, a role she was named to after her mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, became mayor in 2000. When he became president in 2018, she ran for election as Mexico City’s mayor and won. Ms. Henaine had long dreamed of becoming an actress. She attended the acting school of the Mexican television giant Televisa, and mostly performed in telenovelas, melodramas and theater. Until Ms. Sheinbaum’s mayoral campaign. It was then that producers of a well-known TV show, a political satire, spotted her and cast her as the rising politician. Ms. Henaine said it was the first time anyone had told her she bore a resemblance to Ms. Sheinbaum. Back then, Ms. Sheinbaum had curly hair, so Ms. Henaine wore a wig on the show, said Dulce López, one of the producers who tapped Ms. Henaine for the part. But in recent years, Ms. Sheinbaum has worn her hair straight, creating an “identical” resemblance, Ms. López said. Ms. Henaine played Ms. Sheinbaum for two years before the show ended, and it was then she started studying psychology. But the role came calling again in 2024, when Ms. Sheinbaum was running for president and Ms. Henaine was cast in a theater show spoofing the presidential debates. “I have something pending with this character,” she said. “I wanted to humanize her and the character that I created is that side of Claudia that maybe people don’t see.” To promote the show, Ms. Henaine posted comedic videos of herself meeting voters on a mock campaign trail , riding Mexico City’s public transportation and hanging out with an impersonator of Ms. Sheinbaum’s main competitor. Some videos garnered several million views. To sharpen her performance, Ms. Henaine studied countless videos of Ms. Sheinbaum. She said that Ms. Sheinbaum was more relaxed when she spoke as mayor but became more formal as a presidential candidate. She has met Ms. Sheinbaum three times, including during a real campaign event in which the two recited a campaign slogan, smiled and hugged. Video of that encounter has over 24 million views combined between TikTok and Instagram. Other prominent officials have met Ms. Henaine, too, including Mexico’s security minister and the head of Ms. Sheinbaum’s political party, Morena.. Both were surprised by the resemblance and recorded short videos with Claudita for her social media accounts. A spokesman for Ms. Sheinbaum did not respond to requests for comment about her professional look-alike. After Ms. Sheinbaum won the 2024 presidential election and a six-year term in a landslide, Ms. Henaine said she saw years’ ahead of work. Her new show is a riff on the president’s daily morning news conference — it’s called “The Morning Laughter” — and her relationship with Mr. Trump. Ms Henaine said her act is less about taking comedic jabs at Ms. Sheinbaum than an effort to laugh about politics more generally. “She’s the first woman to reach the presidency, and it’s a historic moment,” Ms. Henaine said. “There are going to be failures, there are going to be successes, and the system is what is criticized.” Ms. Sheinbaum has been invited to the show but has not attended. A few federal lawmakers from her political party have. But recently, with a few lines of makeup, her hair in a ponytail and wearing a traditional Mexican blouse, Ms. Henaine looked enough like Ms. Sheinbaum to confuse many during Mexico’s Independence Day celebrations. The main ceremony last month, attended by an announced 280,000 people, was the first led by a woman president in 215 years of Mexican history. Even when Ms. Henaine told people she was not the president, many snapped a photo with her anyway. Diana Puente, 32, had made a six-hour journey from her home state, San Luis Potosí, with her godmother and a friend to see Ms. Sheinbaum that night. She could not manage a photo with Ms. Sheinbaum, who presided over the event from the balcony of the national palace, so Ms. Henaine would have to do for now. “It’s the time for women,” Ms. Puente said. Mostly, Ms. Henaine said, she received positive reactions from Mexicans — a benefit of Ms. Sheinbaum’s popularity, especially when people mistake her identity. Hours before the Independence Day event, a man walked up to Ms. Henaine in the city’s main square and started an impassioned address to her. He lamented the verbal attacks she had received from her political opponents. He urged her to continue standing strong. And before he walked away, he added, “I’ll watch you later.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/mexico-president-sheinbaum-impersonator.html,World,BBC,By James Wagner and Luis Antonio Rojas,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/world/XXint-mexico-claudita-promo/XXint-mexico-claudita-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:00:38+00:00,ad698b9035a524572cd0afa1b2f3b1cdb41d37a9
f7c0434aad3e,Iran Lures Transgender Foreigners for Surgery but Forces Operations on Locals,"transgender, gay and lesbian;lgbt;lgbtq;gay;lesbian, surgery, gender, disesases;health;illness;medicine, islam, ruhollah khomeini, iran, tehran","For 40 years Iran has performed more gender transition surgeries than many other nations, largely a result of pressuring gay and gender-nonconforming citizens to undergo unwanted operations or risk the death penalty. Now, faced with an economy crippled by war and sanctions, the Islamic republic is promoting its expertise to a global audience, hoping to attract transgender foreigners with the promise of inexpensive surgeries packaged with luxury hotel stays and sightseeing tours. Desperate for foreign investment, Iran’s theocratic government has set a goal of generating more than $7 billion from medical tourism annually, according to Iranian state news media , about seven times as much as it earned last year. That objective has resulted in the proliferation of medical tourism companies, marketing not just nose jobs and hair transplants, but vaginoplasties, mastectomies and penis constructions through glossy English-language websites. “We handle everything from start to finish, providing the best medical services to ensure a stress-free experience,” said Farideh Najafi, the manager of two medical tourism companies, MabnaTrip and MedPalTrip. “This includes booking hotels, hospitals, transportation and more,” she said. Iran is one of the few places in the Muslim world that allows transgender people to seek gender-affirming care, and even subsidizes it. For many foreigners traveling to Iran for transition surgery, and indeed for many transgender Iranians, these operations can feel lifesaving. But the country’s reputation as a pioneer in the field belies the abusive history of the operations and the grim reality for most L.G.B.T.Q. people there. In Iran, gay men and lesbians can be punished by public flogging and the death penalty . As a result, the United Nations Human Rights Council found, many gay and lesbian Iranians who are not trans are “pressured into undergoing gender reassignment surgery without their free consent.” Still, the country’s cut-rate prices are drawing transgender individuals from as far away as Australia, the United States, Britain and Europe, according to medical tour operators and surgeons. Many more patients, they say, come from neighboring countries, like Iraq, where such treatments are strictly forbidden. “In the United States, the cost of surgery is around $45,000, and in Thailand, it’s approximately $30,000,” according to the website of one operator, IranMedTour. “However, the cost of gender confirmation surgery in Iran is lower, with prices less than $12,000.” Other companies advertise procedures at government hospitals for as low as $4,500. Sam, 32, a trans man from Orange County, Calif., is currently in Tehran to pursue a hysterectomy and metoidioplasty, a kind of penis-construction surgery. Requesting anonymity to discuss a sensitive medical procedure, he said he was drawn to Iran because he believed the doctors there were “more confident” than those in the United States. “The goal of these medical tours is probably to portray Iran as a paradise for trans people, which it isn’t,” said Saman Arastu, a transgender Iranian man and actor who chose to undergo so-called top and bottom surgeries. “In my opinion, these are nothing but a show. The situation for trans people is dire.” While precise figures are unknown, a report by the Home Office of Britain from 2022 found that roughly 4,000 people underwent transition surgery each year in Iran, a figure higher than the combined annual totals in Britain and France. Experts say a vast majority of patients come from inside Iran. Iran’s experience with transition surgery stems from a fatwa issued in the 1980s by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding supreme leader of the Islamic republic, who declared that transgender individuals could gain legal recognition of the gender with which they identified, but only on the condition that they underwent transition surgery. On the surface that policy inverts what many in the West expect from Iran, where gender norms are so strictly enforced that until recently women were punished for not wearing hijabs in public. But transgender Iranians and experts say the government’s embrace of surgery in no way correlates to advocacy for trans people. Iranians who do not adhere to traditional norms of masculinity and femininity — including trans people who do not want surgery — are subject to violence, extortion or are pressured into operations. “For the Islamic republic, being trans means you have to go through this surgery — from male to female, female to male,” said Zara Saeidzadeh of Orebro University in Sweden, a gender scholar who has spent a decade researching trans identity, with a focus on Iran. “If you identify as trans but don’t want to do any form of body modification, then you’re breaking the rules and you are going to be stigmatized and your life is threatened.” Raha Ajoudani, a 20-year-old trans woman and activist, made the opposite journey that many foreign tourists are making. She fled to Germany from Iran in 2024 to avoid a forced transition surgery and to escape state persecution for her activism. Ms. Ajoudani said that she was detained twice by the authorities in 2022, after an ex-boyfriend collaborated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, to facilitate her arrest. Her family, she added, is routinely hounded to get her to stop her activism. “I never wanted to undergo gender reassignment surgery,” Ms. Ajoudani said. “I’ve defined myself outside of this binary. I didn’t want to live according to the governmental definition of cultural expectations of being a woman or a man, nor did I submit to Khomeini’s fatwa.” Surgery is not a guarantee of acceptance or safety. Transgender people in Iran face murder and other forms of violence and harassment. The tour companies include language to assuage foreigners of those fears in their advertising materials. Amid glossy before-and-after photo illustrations of idealized pectorals and breasts, and copy that promises “budget-friendly” procedures, rapid visa approvals and help achieving “ a strong feeling of happiness and relief ,” the tour companies are also selling patients on what one calls Iran’s “ relatively progressive stance on transgender rights .” Ms. Najafi, the tour manager, conceded that some foreigners feared running afoul of the authorities or the locals, but said that patients traveling with her company had “never had any security issues.” Transition surgeries are complex operations with a questionable record of safety in Iran. Some activists have likened the country’s gender clinics to “ butcher ” shops. Saghi Ghahraman, who led the Iranian Queer Organization, said that while they believed treatment standards had improved, the change had come at a cost, as many gay people felt forced into operations that were like “experiments.” A U.N. report on transition surgeries in Iran from 2015 described botched procedures that led to complications like “severe bleeding, severe infection, scarring, chronic pain and abnormally shaped or located sexual organs.” Adding to the risks are some tour companies’ promises of rapid procedures, which experts said should involve months of planning. Some market stay timelines as short as one week. Dr. Shahryar Cohanzad, a urologist in Tehran who has performed around 300 transition surgeries, said the companies’ aim to perform as many procedures as quickly as possible was unsafe. “From what I know after 35 years of performing surgeries, it’s critical for the surgeon to spend as much time as possible with the patient,” he said. Eric, a 45-year-old trans man living in Canada who requested anonymity to protect himself and his family from reprisals, said he had sought treatment in Iran because it was cheap. But he acknowledged the tension in seeking treatment in a place where others have it forced on them. “I have heard a lot, especially among trans women, that because they are gay, and they cannot be gay in Iran, they try to do the surgery,” said Eric. “I’m really sad that gays and lesbians are not recognized in Iran, but on the other hand I’m happy for trans people because they can do what they’re willing to do.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/middleeast/iran-transgender-surgery.html,World,BBC,By Pranav Baskar and Leily Nikounazar,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/world/00int-iran-transgender-surgery-05/00int-iran-transgender-surgery-05-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-10T09:00:27+00:00,9803fafa5061572f93640d5e2a3b93c2c08d3ebd
45eb42ddc97d,The Best Cat Water Fountains,"shopping, animals, buying guides, animal behavior, smart home, cats, pets","Compare Our Picks Others We Tested Courtesy of Petkik Petkit Eversweet Max for $90 : This techy automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered (lasting up to 83 days), and the drinking bowl is made of stainless steel, but the reservoir is plastic. Because of the shape of the basin with the chunky battery and reservoir bowl, it’s a little awkward to clean. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed. The app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you last added water. However, it doesn’t monitor or show you how much water is left in the basin; you have to check manually. The design also made it a bit difficult to clean and refill easily. Enabot Rola Smart Pet Water Fountain for $50 : This automatic fountain is cordless and runs on a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 60 days (although it can stay plugged in too). It has a wireless pump that uses magnetic induction—this pump was one of the easiest and most hassle-free to clean of all I tested. The fountain has a stainless steel top that holds a decent amount of water even when not running. Although the tank is plastic, and I’m wary of plastic now because of its propensity to harbor bacteria (plus it doesn't keep water as cold). The app gives reminders of when the water’s low, the fountain needs cleaning, or the filter needs replacing, plus it automatically stops dispensing water and sends you a reminder to refill via app. It also logs the number of times your pet drank and for how long, monitoring hydration patterns over time and comparing the stats to average time used. A complaint I had is that this fountain wouldn’t stay on Continuous stream mode, even when plugged in, instead automatically switching to the Sensing stream. Homerunpet Wireless Pet Fountain for $60 : This cordless fountain can be used as a traditional fountain plugged in on its base, or can be detached and moved around the house with 30 days of battery life. I don't love that this fountain is all plastic, but it's easy to see water levels from the outside, the top and filter layers are super easy to remove, clean, and replace, and the wireless (basically silent) pump makes it a whole lot easier to clean. Plastic doesn't keep the water as cold or clean as stainless steel, so you'll have to clean it a lot more often. The fountain only begins bubbling when a cat (or human) approaches to save battery power, and there's no option to control the flow (and no connected app). I like the wireless pump, but I'm really over plastic at this point. Photograph: Kat Merck Wonder Creature Cat Fountain for $20 : My two cats have cycled through several water fountains over the past few years, but this no-nonsense version has been a stalwart. The inside is lit by a blue LED (bright enough to glow in the dark), and a clear viewing window on the side makes it easy to monitor the water level from afar. I also like the dishwasher-safe metal bowl and the fact you can remove parts of the yellow and white “flower” to create a fountain configuration your cat likes (waterfall, low bubble-up, tall bubble-up). The only major downsides are the fact it requires very frequent cleaning and filter changes due to the plastic body, and that there is no reservoir to hold water in case of power outage or pump malfunction. When I go on vacation I have to swap it out for an old-school gravity dispenser . — Kat Merck Happy & Polly Gothic Cat Drinking Fountain for $60 : If you prefer gothic decor to neutral blandness, this ghostly ceramic cat fountain from Happy & Polly may tempt you to bite. The water bubbles up out of the top of the ghost and pools on the ceramic top. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets loud when the water is running low, and I worry about the motor burning out, as the 1.5-liter capacity can run dry fast. While the ceramic finish is easy to clean, it is fiddly to take apart. You will want to clean it once a week to prevent it from becoming slimy, and you must change the filter once a month. — Simon Hill Petkit Eversweet Solo 2 for $45 : I love three key features of this fountain: The bowl sits on top of a wireless charging base, so you don’t have to fiddle with cables, it is super easy to clean, and it's very quiet at around 25 decibels. A flashing light warns you when the water is running low, and you can check when the filter needs to be changed in the app. There’s an optional smart mode that pumps intermittently and a night mode to turn the light off. Pleasingly, all three of our cats drink from this fountain, though that does mean I have to refill it often, as it only holds 2 liters. — Simon Hill Photograph: Simon Hill Oneisall Stainless Steel Pet Fountain for $50 : This drinking fountain is about as simple as they come. As it's designed for cats or small dogs, it has a large bowl, but some cats will prefer that. I love the mostly stainless steel construction, as it's easy to keep clean and less prone to dirt and bacteria buildup. You can even stick parts into the dishwasher to clean. This fountain can also hold up to 7 liters of water, so you don’t have to refill as often. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets louder when the water is running low (a red light warns you when it needs a refill). You should clean once a week and rinse the filter. The filter packs are relatively affordable at $15 for a pack of eight, and you need to swap them once a month. — Simon Hill Petlipo Cordless Cat Water Fountain for $57 : This all-plastic pet fountain sits on dock for easier tank cleaning and is rechargeable for up to 60 days of cordless power, has a wire-free pump, a large 2.6 liter capacity, and three customizable water flow modes (induction, timer, and continuous flow). The heavy duty filter is encased in a plastic cage and only needs to be replaced every 4 to 5 weeks. I had no issues while using this fountain, but at nearly $60, thats egregiously expensive for being made out of cheap (and bacteria-harboring) plastic. Although it's a solid fountain, I'd spend less and grab one of stainless steel picks. Not Recommended Photograph: Molly Higgins Petcube Ceramic Pet Water Fountain for $90 : I really wanted to love this fountain; although its basin is plastic, it had a ceramic top, which is more hygienic than plastic (and I had never tested a ceramic model before), and the brand makes some of my favorite pet cameras . However, setup was a bit confusing, it took a long time to get the base charged to power the fountain's water flow, and the sensor to begin water flow is only triggered from one side, making placement awkward. After a few days, it would only run while plugged in, soon its stream was barely strong enough to reach the top, and after just over a week it stopped working altogether. Also, it's egregiously expensive for a pet fountain. Photograph: Molly Higgins Cat Mate 3-Level Pet Fountain for $28 : This tall automatic Cat Mate fountain sets itself apart with three tiers for cats who like to drink at every level. Cleaning the motor requires disassembly using tools and extended soaking. Because of the long distance the water has to travel, evaporation caused the water to need to be refilled about every other day. Plastic also harbors bacteria, and previous plastic models I’ve owned have had mold issues. The basin is quite large and sits flat. Because of this, some debris would sit in the bottom and front of the large basin rather than moving back to the filter system behind. The plastic material and lack of ergonomic gravity design caused this fountain to be dirtier than others. Whisker City Free Fall Cat Fountain for $30 : This huge fountain is better suited for dogs—with a large 150-fluid-ounce bowl and a waterfall design. Although the basin has a small splash pad to help offset the waterfall noise, this was one of the loudest fountains I tested. The evaporation from the waterfall-like system also caused me to refill it every other day. Because of the structure of the fountain, my cats had to bend their head at an awkward angle. They tended to avoid drinking from the basin because of that, and their heads got slightly wet from the splatter of the waterfall. The basin is also not angled so crumbs and debris sit at the bottom of the bowl. Petkit EverSweet Solo SE for $26 : This very simple, straightforward fountain has a square-shaped body, is translucent to easily see water levels from he outside, and has a nearly silent 25-decibel cordless pump to circulate water from the basin to the top level, where 60 milliliters of water is always available for drinking, even in case of power failure. The basin sits on a base and all parts easily detach, making it easier to clean. This fountain doesn’t have multiple modes or an associated app—you’ll have to check water levels manually. I noticed this fountain wasn’t as cold as some of the others, and because of the design of the top, debris often pooled in the dipped areas, which made me clean it often. AccordionItemContainerButton I used each of these for a week as my cats’ main source of water. As mentioned, I noted the ease of setting up, evaluated parts and filters, and generally compared the various types of water fountains—spigot, bubbling, or waterfall. Some flows were continuous and some were intermittent (my cats didn’t prefer intermittent). Cats may also be intrigued and want to play with the machine rather than drink, so be sure to give them time and keep another water source around until they are fully adjusted to the new gadget. AccordionItemContainerButton Cats sometimes struggle to consume enough water, which can lead to potentially lethal UTIs and blockages in male cats especially. This is one of the reasons vets are moving more toward encouraging owners to give their cat at least a partially wet food diet, as this helps them consume more moisture, especially since cats don’t naturally consume as much water as dogs. Unlike dogs, cats are generally quite particular in their likes and dislikes, and cats can see stagnant water as potentially harmful. (If the cat was in the wild, stagnant water has more potential for harmful bacteria). Cats are more drawn to moving water in nature, and these fountains help encourage them to drink more by emulating what they’re naturally drawn to. While automatic water fountains are better for your cats' overall water consumption, they do require a bit more work and money. Rather than refilling a bowl, these take a little more elbow grease—but it’s worth it for your cat’s health. Along with routine refilling and cleaning, you’ll need to disassemble the fountain to clean all parts, including using a brush for the bowl and tubes. You may also have to disassemble the motor to deep-clean because of mineral buildup. These also have different types of filtration cartridges in specific shapes for the brand’s fountains, which require you to buy and change out filters, usually monthly but sometimes more often. AccordionItemContainerButton Let’s be honest, a lot of these fountains are pretty much the same. I looked especially for the overall design—I am a fiend for stainless steel because of the potential of porous plastic harboring harmful bacteria . I also favor a wide reservoir without high sides to help reduce the chance for whisker fatigue . I prefer fountains that have a small basin reservoir of water available at all times, in case of low water levels or power failure. I took into account ease of setting up, refilling, and cleaning, as well as overall design. And of course, there were some that my cats took to straight away, and some they didn’t seem to favor as much. After prolonged testing, I now look for these three things and encourage you too as well: a cordless pump for easier (and safer) cleaning, constructed from stainless steel so it's more hygienic, and a window to monitor water levels (especially if it's not connected to an app).

Instead of juggling a bunch of files on a server and learning the ins and outs of networking, website builders do exactly what's written on the tin. Piece by piece, using a drag-and-drop interface, you can design your website the way you want with immediate feedback, rather than spending time buried in code and hoping it comes out on the other end. There are dozens of website builders, and most of them range from decent to straight-up bad. Any web host with a bit of ambition has a website builder floating around, even if it's slow, clunky, and lacking features. I focused on finding the best tools for building your website that go beyond just an add-on, and these are my favorites. If you're after something simpler than a full-blown website, check out our list of the Best Portfolio Websites . Table of Contents AccordionItemContainerButton Best Website Builder for Most Squarespace via Jacob Roach You’ve heard of Squarespace over and over again, I’m sure, and that’s not an accident. It’s an inviting website builder that made a name for itself with bold, striking templates. Beneath the veneer of attractive, but seemingly simple, websites, you’ll find one of the most capable website builders on the market. That balance of power and usability is what sets Squarespace apart. It feels like a creative tool. Where other website builders lag and stutter to get a new element on your page, Squarespace feels fluid. Your dashboard gives you quick access to edit your site, and around every corner, Squarespace feels designed so you never have to look up a tutorial. I started a simple photography website, and within an hour, I had a custom course page set up, an appointment schedule with automated confirmation emails, and services (with pricing and the ability to accept payments) configured. Squarespace isn’t cheap, but it also doesn’t meddle in restrictive, low-cost plans. Even on the Basic plan, you have access to ecommerce tools and space for multiple contributors. Squarespace Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best Cheap Website Builder Hostinger via Jacob Roach Hostinger is better known as a web hosting provider, but it has a surprisingly robust website builder that you can use on its own or for free as part of a hosting package. You don’t get the same world-class template design and dense feature-set of a more expensive builder like Squarespace, but that’s OK. Hostinger’s website builder will run you just a few bucks a month, and based on my testing, it feels heavily angled toward newcomers. You sacrifice some power for convenience, but there’s an awful lot you can accomplish with Hostinger. Integrations with PayPal, Stripe, and Square allow you to quickly set up e-commerce. Add-ons with WhatsApp give you live chat capabilities, and Printful support means you can sell print-on-demand merchandise. And, if you outgrow the website builder, Hostinger allows you to export your website’s content to WordPress. Where Hostinger wins for me is through its AI tools. Just about every website builder these days has AI integrated in some way, but it’s around every corner at Hostinger. You need to pay extra for some of these AI features—the logo generator, for example, requires credits—but they give you a great starting point for mocking up the look, feel, and tone of your website. Hostinger Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best for Small Businesses Wix is undoubtedly the biggest competitor to Squarespace, and I had a hard time putting one above the other.

eaf9b8cdd2a0,"The Best Laptops for Work and Play, Wherever You Are","laptops, computers, buying guides, shopping, windows, macbook, chromebooks, windows pcs","How Much Should You Spend on a Laptop? AccordionItemContainerButton If you're shopping for a laptop, you probably have an idea of how much you want to spend. But some context might help put things in perspective. The cheapest laptops cost around $200, but they can range up to $5,000. Meanwhile, the average amount people spend, according to the best data we have , is around $750. That lands decidedly in the midrange, spitting between the more expensive devices that are over $1,000 and the budget-tier machines you find below $700. When we talk about pricing, it's often the “starting” price of the laptop, meaning the lowest-priced configuration. This is really important to consider, as you want to compare devices apples-to-apples as much as possible. For example, a cheaper laptop might start at $750 with 256 GB of storage, while a more premium laptop might start at this same price but come with 512 GB or even 1 TB of storage. Increasingly, you can find some really decent laptops around this price, some of which we’ve listed below. If your budget needs to be under $750, though, there are still good options. Laptops below this price tend to compromise in one area or another. Most commonly, it's the quality of the display and touchpad that suffers, as these are things you can't see from a spec sheet or reference photo. Chromebooks often give you the best bang for your buck, especially if you're trying to spend $500 or less. So, why spend more? Well, there are two primary reasons. First, you might want a more premium design, perhaps one that has a more daring aesthetic or high-end components. Take the MacBook Pro, for example. It starts at $600 more than the MacBook Air but comes with a brighter Mini-LED display, significantly better speakers, and more ports. The second primary reason to spend more than $750 or so is to get more performance. Whether for gaming or for content creation, laptops with discrete GPUs are more expensive, which is why it's hard to find a worthwhile gaming laptop under $1,000. If you're buying a gaming laptop , plan to spend at least $1,500. What Are the Best Laptop Brands? AccordionItemContainerButton Unlike the smartphone world, the biggest laptop brands have been around in the tech industry for over 40 years by now. Taking Apple out of the picture, four laptop brands stand above the rest, following the latest trends and technology, while backing that up with reliable support and services. Lenovo is the biggest PC brand in the world, at least in terms of global shipments . It's perhaps most well-known for its familiar sub-brands like ThinkPad and Yoga, but it also isn't afraid to take risks with more experimental designs and advanced technology. Lenovo has also made a name for itself in the gaming space too with its Legion laptops, known for balancing performance and features at the most competitive prices. Asus has quickly become a favorite, notable for its sheer number of laptops available in the consumer market. The company takes a similar approach to Lenovo, and that's led Asus to quickly innovate on new technology and designs , while also launching premium clamshell laptops at more affordable prices than its competitors. Gaming laptops in particular are a space that Asus has come to dominate in, with the ROG Zephyrus, Strix, and TUF brands leading the way. Dell and HP are a bit more conservative, though they aren't without their notable designs as well. Interestingly, the companies have both gone through a significant laptop rebrand in the past year. HP has introduced “Omnibook” as a replacement to the Spectre and Envy sub-brands in 2024, while Dell started 2025 by removing its well-known sub-brands entirely, including Inspiron and XPS. Other laptop makers in the mix include Microsoft Surface, Samsung, Acer, LG, and MSI, though none of them have as big a footprint globally as the top four. How Do I Choose the Right Laptop? AccordionItemContainerButton If none of these laptops quite rings your bell, that's OK! There are far more laptops than we have time to test. To help you make smart choices, we put together a complete laptop buying guide . We also have the details about all the CPUs and GPUs you need to know about for 2025 . We recommend sticking to these guidelines: RAM: In most cases, make sure you get 16 GB of RAM. That's become the new standard, in even more affordable laptops. Upgrading to 32 GB is even better and means you never have to worry about running out of memory, especially if you're a gamer or video editor. CPU: In the world of Windows laptops, you have three CPU brands to choose from: Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm. Intel’s Core Ultra Series 2 launched in late 2024, providing a huge increase in battery life. It also has the best integrated graphics of the three. AMD chips are primarily reserved for gaming laptops, as they’ve struggled to take much ground from Intel. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips, however, have challenged Intel in a serious way over the past year with its ARM-based chips, offering some of the best battery life we've ever seen on Windows machines. Discrete graphics: Want to play AAA PC games or edit video on your laptop? You’ll likely want a standalone graphics processor, and at this point, Nvidia is the primary option. The RTX 5090 launched this year as the most powerful new GPU available, but the 40-series still remains a good option. Integrated graphics have improved significantly over the years though too, especially with Apple's M4 line. Screen: The display depends on the size of the laptop. A 1200-pixel resolution (HD+) screen on a 13- or 14-inch laptop looks sharp enough, but you’ll want more pixels on larger displays. While IPS screens will be good enough for most people, OLED or Mini-LED are becoming more common, which provide better color accuracy, contrast, and even decent HDR performance. Connectivity : Ports are important, though everyone needs something different. For most people, though, we suggest at least two USB-C ports and at least one USB-A and HDMI for those legacy devices. (Remember that nearly all laptops today use one of those USB-C ports for the power adapter.) Thankfully, most laptops still have headphone jacks, but always check, because a few daring machines have dropped it. Lastly, make sure there's Wi-Fi 6E support or newer. Even if you don't have a Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 router yet, it's a good bet you will in the future (see our Best Routers or Best Mesh Systems guides if you need a new one). Battery life: Battery life is extremely competitive these days, with Apple, Qualcomm, and Intel all making highly ambitious battery life claims. Most laptops with the latest chips (and without discrete graphics) will get you over 10 hours of battery life, or many more if your workload is lighter. Intel vs. AMD vs. Qualcomm AccordionItemContainerButton In the world of Windows laptops, there are three primary options for CPUs: Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. All three companies have good options but it really depends on the type of laptop. For premium laptops, you'll want something like the Intel Core Ultra 258V or Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite. Meanwhile, for budget laptops, Snapdragon X is the best option. And for gaming laptops, I'd recommend something from AMD like the Ryzen AI 9 365. Intel and AMD are the eternal rivals in the game, while Qualcomm is the new competitor in the ring. Qualcomm made a huge entrance in 2024 with its Snapdragon X chips. These Arm-based chips, like Apple's M-series chips, emphasize efficiency, which drastically improves battery life. This has been a game-changer for Windows laptops across a wide range of price points. The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite is the highest end option in terms of performance, but the Snapdragon X Plus and base Snapdragon X still equally strong battery life, despite showing up in much cheaper laptops. (Qualcomm recently unveiled the Snapdragon X2 platform .) But Intel and AMD haven't been sitting on their hands either. Despite all of Intel's financial woes, the company put out a surprisingly strong release with its Core Ultra Series 2. The V-series chips, also known as Lunar Lake, came out in late 2024 and provided comparably good battery life to Qualcomm and Apple. They also have the most powerful integrated graphics you'll find on basic consumer Windows laptops. Unfortunately, Intel's lineup of chips is convoluted and an horribly confusing, with three different generations of CPU architecture released in the past year. In addition to Lunar Lake, we also have Arrow Lake Core Ultra H chips and 14th-gen Raptor Lake Refresh for its highest-powered Core Ultra HX chips. Those HX chips even still use the old “Core i7” nomenclature, to make things even more confusing. (Intel recently announced its next-gen Panther Lake chips .) Over on Team Red, AMD has grown into a competitive player in the gaming laptop space in particular. Its latest gaming chips are the most powerful gaming hardware you'll find on a laptop, including the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D. Unfortunately, it's still hard to find many laptops supporting these killer chips. The company also has its Ryzen AI 300 H and HX chips, which are bit more commonly found across gaming laptops. AMD does have its mainstream chips as well, as part of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, but they haven't made their way into as many laptops at this point and don't have as long of battery life as Intel and Qualcomm's latest options. AccordionItemContainerButton I have been reviewing laptops for a decade, and WIRED contributor Chris Null has been testing these machines for 25 years. We test each laptop we review in a variety of situations, including both synthetic benchmark tests, real-world use cases, and comparisons against similar equipment. We don’t consider hardware in a vacuum: Our reviews aim to match laptops with the users that will benefit from them the most, taking performance, usability, portability, and price all into account. We put every laptop through a gauntlet of tests before writing a review and assigning them a rating. Hands-on use: Here's we evaluate the exterior of the device. We compare how thin and light it is against other laptops. We repeatedly open and close the lid to test the quality and ease of use of the hinge. We push on weak points like the keyboard and lid to test build quality. We furiously type on the keyboard and swipe around on the touchpad to ensure it's comfortable and precise. These are all things you can't see just by looking at a device's landing page on Amazon. We use the laptop itself for many days (and sometimes weeks) to report on any quirks that might pop up, such as oddly placed ports, a surfeit of preloaded shovelware, or unexpected problems that make using the laptop difficult. Sights and sounds: Once we boot up a device itself, it's all about the sights and sounds of the laptop. The screen is paramount, as its the world through which you experience the entirety of the device. There's a lot you can tell about the brightness, colors, and contrast of a display just by looking at it. Beyond just subjective testing, we also use a Spyder colorimeter to measure the brightness, contrast, color space, and color accuracy of a display. If it's an HDR-capable screen, we also test the peak brightness of the display in HDR content. We also test the webcam and speakers of a laptop to see if they are worthy of your video calls and music streaming sessions. Performance testing: Finally, we test performance. There's a lot of ways to go about this, but we always evaluate a laptop's performance based on what it's intended for. We don't expect a $500 budget laptop to performance like a powerhouse gaming laptop, nor we expect a gaming laptop to get 18 hours of battery life. Our testbed includes more than 20 synthetic benchmarks, though this is constantly evolving and is dependent on the unit’s CPU and operating system, as macOS and Snapdragon-based laptops have fewer benchmarks available. Those benchmarks include various tests within the latest versions of Geekbench, PCMark, 3DMark, Procyon, GFXBench, Pugetbench, Superposition, Cinebench, and various gaming-related tests such as 3DMark and Cyberpunk 2077 . Note that WIRED does not, in general, report raw benchmark scores. We don't only pay attention to the scores these benchmarks produce, but also the volume and speed of the fans, the surface temperature of the laptop, and the affect it has on battery life. It's a lot, I know. But we're thorough because we want to stand by our recommendations, and ensure that the laptops we rate highly are worth the money. Compare Top 15 Laptops Other Good Laptops We’ve Tested Photograph: Luke Larsen Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable for $3,299 : Don't you dare write this one off as a gimmick. Yes, it's fun as just a pure spectacle, but Lenovo took this far more seriously than I thought it would. In case you haven't heard, it's a laptop that can extend its screen vertically from 14 inches to 16.7 inches at the press of a key, giving you quick access to more screen whenever you need it. As it turns out, it's also a great ergonomic solution, too. The only problem with the ThinkBook Plus Rollable (7/10, WIRED Recommends) ? It's been sold out for the past month, so you can't buy it yet. Hopefully, it'll be back in stock soon. Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 for $1,950 : If you're looking for a proper Windows alternative to the powerful MacBook Pro, this is the best one I've tested so far. The Yoga Pro 9i 16 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has two important features: a discrete RTX 5050 or 5060 GPU and a killer OLED display. Combine that with an excellent keyboard and touchpad, and even great speakers, and you have the whole package. I wish the battery life were better, but that's an area where it'll never quite compete with the MacBook Pro. Dell 14 Premium for $1,250 : It might be one of the prettiest laptops ever made, but it's also one of the most controversial designs in recent years. The Dell 14 Premium (6/10, WIRED Review) is the renamed successor to the Dell XPS 14, sporting the same divisive function row keys, invisible haptic trackpad, and limited ports. I'd have been happy to overlook those design elements (as they make for an ultra-modern aesthetic) if only Dell had been able to upgrade this from the RTX 4050 to the RTX 5050 series graphics cards. Without that GPU performance upgrade, my excitement has dulled for what this could be. Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 16 2-in-1 for $698 : As I've said multiple times in this guide, Windows laptops at around $650 to $700 are really hard to pull off. There will almost always be some compromises. There's no getting around that. The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 just barely walks the tightrope without tipping over. Like many of these devices, it has a crummy screen, a tiresome keyboard, and an imprecise-feeling touchpad. The battery life was decent, however, and I liked that the display is touchscreen and glossy. For the price, the specs aren't half bad. If you like larger laptop displays, this is the cheapest one you should buy. Surface Pro 12 Photograph: Luke Larsen Microsoft Surface Pro 12 for $900 : While it’s a tablet, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review) is designed to be a true laptop replacement as well, which is why it's on this list. Its price would be excellent for a fanless machine running on the Snapdragon X chip, but it doesn't come bundled with a keyboard. Once you add that in, this becomes more of a premium laptop. Still, for the right person, it's a killer travel device for taking your work on the road with you. ROG Flow Z13 Photograph: Luke Larsen Asus ROG Flow Z13 for $2,100 : It's too expensive for most people to take a chance on, but I found a lot to like about the ROG Flow Z13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) . This gaming 2-in-1, a design no one asked for, works surprisingly well. The performance isn't full throttle, but the Z13's use of surprisingly powerful AMD integrated graphics makes it far more powerful than you might assume, all while keeping the heat away from your hands. Asus Zenbook A14 for $580 : This is one of the lightest laptops we've ever tested, thanks to Asus' Ceraluminum material. The Zenbook A14 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is also the first A-series laptop from the company, and it employs Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X chipset, which is the weakest and supposedly the most affordable of the Snapdragon X series. While this laptop excels in build quality, portability, and sports excellent battery life, the chipset is lackluster, only suitable for average web browsing tasks. This one occasionally drops in price by a couple of hundred bucks, so try to avoid the $1,000 MSRP if you can. Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus for $482 : This was one of the first “Chromebook Plus” devices we tested, and it's still among the best. While the newer Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is a higher-quality device, the Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, which makes it attractive, especially for a Chromebook. You'll still get 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, too. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition (Copilot+ PC) for $1,300 : The first Intel-based Copilot+ PC we tested, the Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition (7/10, WIRED Review) is a winner on all fronts, boasting outstanding AI and graphics performance and some of the best battery life we’ve ever seen on Intel hardware. With its slightly oddball 15.3-inch screen, it hits its high points without breaking the bank, though the fan is loud and the system may weigh you down more than you’d like. Acer Chromebook Plus 515 for $365 : This 15-inch Chromebook Plus 515 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has the same internal components as the Lenovo we recommend above. The battery life for this one is a solid 8.5 hours of full-screen video playback time. The Acer offers an HDMI 1.4 output jack in place of the Lenovo's microSD card slot, making this one a better choice if you frequently need to give presentations or otherwise use the HDMI port. There's also the smaller Chromebook Plus 514 that's equally great . Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x Copilot+ PC for $1,300 : Lenovo's svelte Slim 7x (7/10, WIRED Review) isn't exciting, but it offers the best price-to-performance ratio of the many Copilot+ PCs we've tested. Battery life and performance are standouts, though the fan does tend to run loud. What Kinds of Laptops to Avoid Amazon is filled with laptops you shouldn't buy. Just type in “best laptop” into the Amazon search box, and you'll find plenty of cheap laptops that no one should buy. That includes most of the Windows laptops under $500, which all use CPUs from three or four generations ago. It gets worse when you search for “gaming laptops” on Amazon , which presents some cheap laptops that don't even have discrete graphics. Regardless of what companies or retailers try to say, you shouldn't expect a laptop without a discrete GPU to be able to play modern games. Some of these include laptops from knockoff brands you've never heard of, like this one . There's just no reason to buy something from an unknown brand. When it comes to gaming laptops in general, I wouldn't recommend buying anything RTX 30-series or older in terms of graphics. You should still be able to find some decent RTX 40-series laptops that are a better bang-for-your-buck than the new RTX 50-series laptops. Lastly, there's the topic of refurbished laptops. Online retailers are full of older laptops that are marked as refurbished or “renewed.” These can be good options, especially if they come heavily discounted, such as this M1 MacBook Air . But there's always some risk with buying refurbished. Make sure you read the retailer's return policy. With models that are only a year or two older, however, pay careful attention to the specs, especially when it comes to RAM capacity. For example, some older M3 MacBook Air models will show up with only 8 GB of RAM, not reflecting the increased base memory in the price. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

3c9e0cbdb827,Review: Specialized S-Works Levo 4 Electric Mountain Bike,"shopping, bicycles, outdoors, reviews, review, electric bikes","The next ride was on singletrack from my house to Spirit Mountain , Duluth’s downhill lift-accessed park with 24 trails ranging from easy to expert. Lacking a full-face helmet and the landing skills to tackle double-black runs like the one called Calculated Risk, I instead rode Candyland. The machine-built flow trail has some nice high, snaky berms where the bike’s chunky tires kept me upright and stable. I had so much fun tooling around in the bike park, riding up steep inclines like The Puker to get one last flowy downhill ride in, that I had to hurry home for dinner in the dusk. On the way home, I chickened out while riding a chunky, steep, and extended rock bridge in Trail mode and experienced the only moment of fear in my entire 50-plus miles of testing thus far—I had already committed to forward momentum but chickened out at the last second, so the bike surged forward while I bailed sideways into the bushes. It was more user lack of confidence than bike glitch, but also a good reminder of two things: how powerful the bike is and how it’s only as competent as its rider. At home, I checked the Specialized app and found that I had climbed 3,451 feet over 22 miles in about two hours, primarily in the bike’s Auto mode. I still had 44 percent battery power and energy in my legs. Smart Ride Photograph: Stephanie Pearson After subsequent rides, what stands out the most about the Turbo Levo 4 is how intuitive it is. The bike's high-performance torque sensors can instantly “feel” the rider's output and amplify it, while maintaining control, traction, and precision at higher speeds. This is especially evident in Auto mode, which is the most natural feeling of the four Eco, Auto, Trail, and Turbo modes, all of which are easy to read on the bike's Master Mind computer on the top tube. I was a little on the fence about the Turbo Levo’s ability to jump from a Class I to a Class III electric mountain bike. On US versions of the bike, riders can tweak the speed limit by toggling through Master Mind and upping the Class I limit of 20 mph to the Class III 28 mph limit. It’s an easy process designed for mountain bikers who ride along city streets to the trails. But it also raises a question: What ripper is going to want to toggle back down to a Class I bike—the max limit on most trails throughout the US—unless the speed police are in hot pursuit? By allowing this work-around into a higher speed-limit category, Specialized puts the onus on the rider to follow the rules, which opens a Pandora’s box—especially on trails inhabited by mostly nonmotorized mountain bikers where safety is a greater concern. Other than the ethical conundrum, my one small beef with the S-Works Turbo Levo 4 is that it’s so much fun that it suspends time. I’m so in the flow that I forget to go home and make dinner.",https://www.wired.com/review/specialized-s-works-levo-4,Technology,BBC,Stephanie Pearson,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e9bae68983e0899b9e6c4b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20Specialized%20S-Works%20Levo%204%20Electric%20Mountain%20Bike.png",2025-10-12T08:00:00-04:00,d02fdbe44faefaea413e8f8dbf71c6933404b3b6
03be66d081fa,A New Algorithm Makes It Faster to Find the Shortest Paths,"quanta magazine, science, computer science, algorithms","The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine . If you want to solve a tricky problem, it often helps to get organized. You might, for example, break the problem into pieces and tackle the easiest pieces first. But this kind of sorting has a cost. You may end up spending too much time putting the pieces in order. This dilemma is especially relevant to one of the most iconic problems in computer science: finding the shortest path from a specific starting point in a network to every other point. It’s like a souped-up version of a problem you need to solve each time you move: learning the best route from your new home to work, the gym, and the supermarket. “Shortest paths is a beautiful problem that anyone in the world can relate to,” said Mikkel Thorup , a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen. Intuitively, it should be easiest to find the shortest path to nearby destinations. So if you want to design the fastest possible algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, it seems reasonable to start by finding the closest point, then the next-closest, and so on. But to do that, you need to repeatedly figure out which point is closest. You’ll sort the points by distance as you go. There’s a fundamental speed limit for any algorithm that follows this approach: You can’t go any faster than the time it takes to sort. Forty years ago, researchers designing shortest-paths algorithms ran up against this “sorting barrier.” Now, a team of researchers has devised a new algorithm that breaks it . It doesn’t sort, and it runs faster than any algorithm that does. “The authors were audacious in thinking they could break this barrier,” said Robert Tarjan , a computer scientist at Princeton University. “It’s an amazing result.” The Frontier of Knowledge To analyze the shortest-paths problem mathematically, researchers use the language of graphs—networks of points, or nodes, connected by lines. Each link between nodes is labeled with a number called its weight, which can represent the length of that segment or the time needed to traverse it. There are usually many routes between any two nodes, and the shortest is the one whose weights add up to the smallest number. Given a graph and a specific “source” node, an algorithm’s goal is to find the shortest path to every other node. The most famous shortest-paths algorithm , devised by the pioneering computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, starts at the source and works outward step by step. It’s an effective approach, because knowing the shortest path to nearby nodes can help you find the shortest paths to more distant ones. But because the end result is a sorted list of shortest paths, the sorting barrier sets a fundamental limit on how fast the algorithm can run.",https://www.wired.com/story/new-method-is-the-fastest-way-to-find-the-best-routes,Technology,BBC,Ben Brubaker,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e4e925d48737d73f99218c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Fastest%20Shortest%20Paths%20cr-DVDP-Default.jpg",2025-10-12T11:00:00+00:00,4daa42de1f5963117c925bab3702ee7742f13051
1ae4d0c4e04a,Should You Cancel Xbox Game Pass? Everything to Know on the Price Hikes and New Features,"video games, pc games, console games, gaming culture, xbox, microsoft, subscriptions","Like it or loathe it, we live in a subscription economy. Music, movies, meal boxes, and more are no longer things you buy once. They’re a constant draw on your wallet. Gaming is no exception , and while every major player in the sector has some form of sub for players—from PlayStation Plus and Nintendo Switch Online for consoles to Apple Arcade on phones—none of them offered quite as much for a modest monthly fee as Xbox Game Pass. Depending on the subscription tier, the service gave players access to a significant library of titles and was available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via cloud gaming. While most of its competitors focused on back-catalog titles for their gaming subscriptions, Game Pass stood apart by including major first-party titles on their day of release for subscribers to its Ultimate tier. Microsoft long claimed it was “the best deal in gaming,” and with new releases costing upwards of $70 per title versus a $19.99 monthly price tag on Game Pass Ultimate, it was hard to argue. Recent changes to the service, however—including some hefty price rises—have upset users in a big way, sending so many people rushing to cancel their subscriptions that the membership site crashed . What’s Happened? On October 1, Microsoft revamped the entire structure of Game Pass . Previously, and following an earlier rejig in September 2024 , players had essentially four options—Game Pass for PC, Game Pass Core, Game Pass Standard, and Game Pass Ultimate. Going forward, Core is replaced with Essential, and Standard is replaced with Premium, while Ultimate retains its name. All tiers are now accessible on PC, although a dedicated PC-only plan remains available. It’s not the rebrand that’s had people canceling, though—it’s the hefty price hikes that have come with the upper tiers. While Essential keeps the almost totemic $9.99-per-month pricing of Core, Premium jumps to $14.99 from Standard’s $11.99 (a 25 percent increase), and the PC-only offering goes from $11.99 to $16.49 (a 38 percent increase). It’s Game Pass Ultimate that’s proven the most contentious, leaping from $19.99 to $29.99. Price increases on subscription services routinely boil the frog and creep up in price slowly—just look at what you used to pay for Netflix—but a massive 50 percent spike overnight, the equivalent of $120 more a year, has caught many off guard. It doesn't help that it follows two price hikes on Xbox consoles themselves in the span of less than a year, at least in the US. In May 2025, the 512-GB Xbox Series S went from $299.99 to $379.99, the 1-TB Xbox Series X from $499.99 to $599.99, and the 2-TB Series X from $599.99 to $729.99. These prices rose globally, with prices reflected in each territory. But then, in September, prices rose again for buyers in America, taking those same models to $399.99, $649.99, and $799.99, respectively. Microsoft cited the increases being “due to changes in the macroeconomic environment”—read: tariffs —but the combined effect on pricing across the whole Xbox ecosystem really challenges that “best deal in gaming” idea.",https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-cancel-xbox-game-pass-everything-to-know-on-the-price-hikes-and-new-features,Technology,BBC,Matt Kamen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e94ff269566abd2b9c6cca/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1836054547.jpg",2025-10-12T10:00:00+00:00,53c64ccc67ec80a03a2ec11ec1b528ba1f9b540f
7d061389ac99,The Best Carpet Cleaners to Resurrect Your Rugs,"shopping, buying guides, cleaning, how we clean, vacuums, home","Compare Our Picks Others Tested Photograph: Simon Hill Hoover HF4 Hydro for £199 : For UK folks in flats or small houses with a mix of carpet and hard floor, this cordless, space-saving vacuum and mop from Hoover could be a smart pick. You get a standard cordless stick vac with around half an hour of battery life, but you can switch the head to mop. It’s excellent for cleaning hard floors, with a shape that gets right into corners and two rotating pads to lift stains. But the water tank, contained within the head, is tiny, the vacuum is only moderately powerful at lifting, and battery life drops to just 15 minutes in turbo mode. Hoover SmartWash Automatic Carpet Cleaner for $250 : It's bulky, but it has automatic cleaning and drying cycles—pushing it forward releases the solution and pulling it back starts the drying process. After you've gone over the whole area, you can turn just the drying mode on for an extra pass if the carpet needs it. The handle comes out with the click of a button, and you can use its separate tank with a cleaning solution to spot-treat before vacuuming. A hose and separate antimicrobial pet tool can clean stairs or any other hard-to-reach areas that need extra elbow grease. Some customer reviews say it worked well for a few months but then shorted out. We'll keep trying it to see if we run into that issue. — Medea Giordano Bissell Little Green Portable Carpet Cleaner for $79 : If you've landed on the cleaning side of TikTok , you've probably seen people cleaning their carpets and furniture with this Little Green machine. This opens up the world of upholstery cleaning too, not just carpets. It worked well and it's easier to store and tote around your house than our top pick. But use the included hose-cleaning tool frequently. These hoses can get nasty. — Brenda Stolyar Cleaners We Like for Hard Floors Photograph: Simon Hill Dreame H14 Pro for $380 : The Dreame H14 Pro is quite large, but I found it easy to maneuver, and it can lie flat to get under furniture. A handy LED headlight helps you see what you are cleaning clearly. A full charge proved enough to do all my hard floors twice over, and the result was super shiny. What I love about this vac is that it effectively cleans up dry or wet spills, so whether you are cleaning cat litter or a spilled bowl of cereal, it performs. It’s best for cleaning recent spills but can shift stubborn stains with repeated passes on Ultra mode. When you finish, you can return it to the charging cradle and trigger the self-cleaning mode to sterilize the soft roller and dry it (though it gets loud and takes a long time). No one wants to install an app or create an account just to use a vacuum, but it enables you to choose modes and schedule the self-cleaning, which could be handy if you want it to wait until you go out. — Simon Hill Shark S5003D Genius Steam Mop for $100 : This steam mop is great for cleaning hardwood, tiles, or laminate flooring (not carpets). Simply fill the water tank, plug it in, and attach one of the mop pads. It has three heat levels, and you press down to release a jet of steam for stubborn stains. There’s no need for any detergent, it’s light and maneuverable, and it doesn’t require much space. The clever pad design enables you to flip it over when one side is soiled, and the mechanism makes it easy to attach, with a button to detach the dirty pad, which is machine washable. (You get two pads in the box.) I regularly use this mop to clean laminate, composite, and tile floors, but you must be careful using steam, especially on wood or vinyl flooring. Test it on the lowest heat setting before going over the whole floor. There are no special attachments or extras here, and it’s only suitable for use on hard floors. You also need to empty any remaining water if you don’t plan on using it for a while, or the tank can go nasty. — Simon Hill Karcher SC 3 for $164 : If your budget can stretch, this option is better if you want attachments and the option to steam-clean harder-to-reach surfaces and your hard floors. It’s good for complete kitchen or bathroom cleaning without the need for any detergent or other products. It's effective for cleaning glass and mirrors too. It only comes with one microfiber cover, and it’s not recommended for use on fabrics or carpets. — Simon Hill Not Recommended Eufy E28 HydroJet Robot Vacuum with Carpet Cleaner for $1,400 : I generally love Eufy’s attractive, smart, multipurpose robot vacuums, and since I have two dogs and two kids, I was expecting to love a robot vacuum that could also mop hardwood floors and has a detachable carpet cleaner. Unfortunately, the water injection system is wonky. It has to be perfectly positioned to get water from the portable carpet cleaner tank (I often had to tap it into place), and every time I mopped, it leaked constantly all over my kitchen floor. At least the carpet cleaner was effective. — Adrienne So Things to Consider When Shopping for a Carpet Cleaner AccordionItemContainerButton There is a lot to think about when shopping for or using a carpet cleaner, such as how much space you'll need for storage and whether you should rent or buy. Here are some tips to keep in mind. Carpet cleaners are heavy and bulky , especially when filled with water. They can be harder to maneuver than regular upright vacuums. They will also need quite a bit of storage space. Tackle stain-causing spills immediately . Most households only need to wash carpets once every six months to a year, but spot cleaners are ideal for treating immediate spills, plus they're easier to store and use. You likely won't use a carpet cleaner often , so it's OK to consider hiring professionals to do your whole home, especially if you have limited storage space. (It also can depend on how dirty and stained your carpets are.) Look at options for renting a machine from local businesses or retail stores like Home Depot. You'll be able to get the benefits of a commercial-grade cleaner without paying a fortune. Clean your carpet before you use a carpet cleaner . This may seem counterintuitive, but you don’t want dirt and hair to form wet clumps that block the cleaner. And if you haven’t washed your carpets in a while (or ever), be prepared for an embarrassing amount of hairy clogs to fill the dirty water tank. The carpet shampoo or detergent you use is important . Manufacturers often insist you use their brand, and while other types may work fine, you might void your warranty (although I have no idea how they'd know). Most carpet cleaners come with some detergent. Try, try, and try again. It can be disappointing to fire up a carpet cleaner and find that it’s incapable of removing that old red wine stain or ground-in toothpaste. Don’t lose heart. Multiple cleaning sessions can sometimes chip away at established stains, and at least reduce, if not remove, them. Drying your carpets can take a long time . Most carpet cleaners have different settings, and they will suck up some of the water, but they all leave carpets a bit damp. The deeper cleans tend to leave carpets wet, so think about how you might speed drying time. Use fans, fire up the heating, or do your carpet cleaning in the spring and summer months when you can leave windows open. Protect your hearing. Of all the ways you can damage your hearing, a carpet cleaner is perhaps the least fun, so protect your ears. Some of these get very loud, so wear earplugs while you work.

16e7946c9800,Review: Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro,"shopping, review, reviews, outdoors, fitness trackers, wearables, fitness","Offline routing is supposed to be one of the banner features of this watch. You should be able to just pick a point in the Maps app on the watch, then choose Straight-Line Navigation or Route Navigation. Unless you’re in a wide-open field, Straight-Line won’t help you much, but Route Navigation should parse the watch's ability to read roads and trails to get you where you're going. Then you choose between Outdoor Running, Walking, or Outdoor Cycling. Why isn’t hiking included? Who knows, but it doesn’t really matter because 90 percent of the time I tried it, the watch would just say, “Route Creation Failed. Try Again.” I only managed to get it to work a couple of times, and only for extremely short distances, and one of those times it advised me to run on Interstate 405, which is one of the largest, busiest highways in the country. I would not rely on this feature. There’s just a general sense of unfinishedness to the whole thing. Questionable translations abound. It missed waves while I was surfing. It still doesn't recognize the types of strength training that you're doing, which is a feature that was promised earlier this year and is readily available on all other sports watches at this point. Finish the Job Photograph: Brent Rose It's not all bad news. I love that this watch has an LED flashlight, which is a feature that I think every sports watch should have because it's so useful. The speaker and microphone aren't great quality, but they're also nice to have. The watch does a pretty good job of displaying notifications from your smartphone, and if you’re an Android user you can even quickly reply to incoming texts, or initiate texts through Zepp Flow, even though it doesn't draw distinctions between types of notifications and it will just start buzzing incessantly while you're driving.",https://www.wired.com/review/amazfit-t-rex-3-pro,Technology,BBC,Brent Rose,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e99cf09d25ef2d2c8e8f80/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Amazfit_TRex3Pro.jpg",2025-10-11T10:00:00-04:00,dd3eb67cf04a60f0cf1330692166a5a6a59d287f
977abd36f35e,Review: Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16,"laptops, reviews, review, shopping, computers, windows, windows pcs","We shouldn’t expect any Windows laptop with a powerful discrete GPU to truly replicate what the MacBook Pro does. Yes, there are more powerful systems out there, but efficiency is just not what those systems are about. Even with the improvements Nvidia has made in Advanced Optimus (automatic switching between discrete GPU when needed), the battery life suffers, especially while running heavier applications. On a local video playback test, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 lasted for around 12 hours. Despite using the same 84-watt-hour battery, this appears to be a slight improvement over last year's model, though it's hard to get an apples-to-apples comparison. I do know that its battery life diminishes quickly under heavy load, as it died in just 45 minutes while running a benchmark. You'll want to be plugged in if you're doing anything too serious. Regardless of the task, you'll get over twice the battery life on an M4 Max MacBook Pro. Not until we get ARM-based systems with powerful integrated graphics that rival the M4 Pro and M4 Max will there be competition for Apple. The closest thing we’ve seen so far is AMD’s unique Ryzen AI Max+ processor, which showed up on the Asus ROG Flow Z13 and used a massive integrated graphics chip to challenge traditional discrete graphics. But we’ve still got a long way to go. The only other Windows laptop that could be better is the Asus ProArt P16 , which I've yet to test. It now even comes with an RTX 5070 or 5090 option, which could make it significantly more powerful than the Yoga Pro 9i. However, it's also a much more expensive laptop, configured with a 4K OLED screen and only higher-end GPUs. The Yoga Pro 9i is also hundreds of dollars cheaper than the Dell 16 Premium when similarly configured. The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 gets a lot of things right—plenty enough to make it worth a recommendation as a valid MacBook Pro competitor. Ultimately, it’s the performance, display, and premium quality that make it a worthy content creation machine, and the Yoga Pro 9i succeeds on all those fronts, perhaps better than any other Windows machine I’ve tested.",https://www.wired.com/review/lenovo-yoga-pro-9i-16,Technology,BBC,Luke Larsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e96bf77c192a1493f91916/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/IMG_1898.JPG",2025-10-11T08:00:00-04:00,5251cf49e0547d88cbb38ee6f1f3491df97edd28
1f3424e77ff8,The 26 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now,"tv, streaming, amazon, culture guides","While Netflix is busy pumping out more series than any one person could watch (probably), some of the best shows are on Amazon Prime Video. Trouble is, navigating the service’s labyrinthine menus can make finding the right series a pain. We’re here to help. Below are our favorite Amazon series—all included with your Prime subscription. For more viewing picks, read WIRED’s guide to the best movies on Amazon Prime , the best movies on HBO’s Max , and the best movies on Netflix . If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more . The Girlfriend When working class Cherry Laine (Olivia Cooke) meets wealthy Danny Sanderson (Laurie Davidson), sparks fly—until she meets his mother Laura (Robin Wright). Overbearing and with an unhealthy level of control over her son’s life, Laura is set on destroying anyone who comes between them. Or maybe ... Laura is a caring mother, alert to Cherry’s suspicious behavior, and desperate to save her son from a con artist—or worse. In this twisty psychological thriller, based on a novel by Michelle Frances, you can never quite tell who to trust, which is almost the best part, second only to the sensational chemistry between Wright and Cooke as they alternately try to charm, outwit, or destroy each other. Exploring themes of class, power, and control, The Girlfriend is six episodes of brilliantly tense drama. Butterfly Years ago, David Jung (Daniel Dae Kim) and Juno Lund (Piper Perabo) formed the private intelligence organization Caddis, reshaping global security from the shadows. Then, Lund ripped the operation out from under Jung—and took his daughter Rebecca (Reina Hardesty) with it, raising her to become an unstoppable assassin. Reunited in the aftermath of a hit on a Russian ambassador in Seoul, David and Rebecca find themselves on the run across South Korea, unsure if they can even trust each other, and with Caddis hot on their heels. A blend of next-level action choreography and family drama exploring themes of abandonment, Butterfly is an explosive twist on bring-your-kid-to-work day. Ballard A spin-off from Bosch, one of Prime’s biggest hits, Ballard is another creation of crime author Michael Connelly, seeing detective Renée Ballard (Maggie Q, Designated Survivor ) stepping up as head of a newly formed cold-case unit. Left with no budget and no official support, Ballard hastily assembles a team of volunteers that includes her retired former partner Thomas Laffont (John Carroll Lynch) and disillusioned former cop Zamira Parker (Courtney Taylor). They soon find that diving into forgotten cases can mean unearthing secrets powerful people want to keep buried. A blend of crime-of-the-week cases and season-long mysteries make Ballard both a cozy procedural and a riveting longer-form drama, buoyed by a fantastic cast—including Titus Welliver reprising his role as Connellyverse staple Harry Bosch. The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy If about 300 seasons of Grey's Anatomy hasn't scratched your medical drama itch, then a visit to The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy might be just the treatment you need. Riffing on the hospital procedural genre and giving it a sci-fi twist, the show follows alien medics Dr. Sleech (Stephanie Hsu) and Dr. Klak (Keke Palmer) as they tackle the wildest diseases and injuries the universe can throw at them—from an anxiety-eating brain worm to a shape-shifting STI—all while navigating messy relationships and personal drama. See, just like Grey’s . Created by Russian Doll writer Cirocco Dunlap—bringing that show’s Natasha Lyonne along as the voice of occasionally invisible Nurse Tup—this Saharan-dry adult animated comedy will cure what ails you. Overcompensating Benny is so deep in the closet, he's found Narnia. And rather than using his freshman year of college as a chance to find himself, he's maintaining the illusion of heterosexuality by throwing himself into a campus life of partying, drinking, and chasing girls. The consequences, for Benny and his new best friend Carmen (Wally Beram), will be severe … but hilarious. Created by comedian Benito Skinner, who also stars as Benny, Overcompensating is a foul-mouthed and ferociously funny college comedy that's almost painfully authentic in its depiction of the fine line between self-exploration and weapons-grade cringe. Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX Prime Video doesn't tend to pick up as much anime as rival Netflix does, but when it does, it's often something big . Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX (it's pronounced “gee-kwux,” before you ask), takes things back to the very beginning of the iconic mecha franchise and asks a simple question: What if the bad guys, the “space Nazis” of the Principality of Zeon, won a crucial war? Don't worry if you can't tell a beam saber from a core fighter though—this alternate reality focuses on brand new character Amate Yuzuriha, a high school student thrust into a world of mounting military tensions after an experimental Gundam crashes into the space colony where she lives. GQuuuuuux also marks a creative high for Gundam , with Evangelion studio Khara bringing its dynamic style of animation to the series, but beyond the phenomenally flashy visuals, this has some real emotional depth, using a science fiction lens to explore how people can find hope and fight for freedom, even in the darkest of timelines. Weekly episodes drop on Tuesdays. The Wheel of Time The Wheel of Time has been a bit of a slow burn, but now this fantasy series is a raging fire. The first season introduced magic weaver Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) and her quest to uncover which of five unassuming young people is destined to save or destroy the world, then the second upped the stakes—returning ancient evils while scattering the only people able to stop them. The newly dropped third season pays it off in spades, though, opening with a ferocious battle between brutal woman warriors—a genre rarity—while setting the stage for Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski) to seize that dangerous destiny, one way or the other. Based on Robert Jordan’s sprawling novel series—one so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise—this visually stunning series has cemented itself as the finest fantasy show around. Reacher Amazon has a way with action thrillers focused on military tough guys who answer to “Jack R.” First there was Jack Ryan , who also makes an appearance in this guide. Then there was Reacher , the sharp adaptation of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher novels, now in its third season. Alan Ritchson ( Titans , Fast X ) stars as the physically imposing Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one found him accused of a murder he didn't commit, before season two drew him into a vast conspiracy. The newly arrived third—based on the seventh novel, Persuader —sees him up against his biggest threat yet: Paulie, an even bigger hulk of muscle (played by 7′2″ Olivier Richters). Sure, Reacher is also working undercover for the DEA and tracking down an old enemy, but three seasons in, the show is confident enough to play to its pulpy strengths, with top-tier fight choreography and surprisingly sharp dialog helping it punch above its weight. Invincible Mark Grayson inherited the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man—only to learn dear old dad wasn't a paragon of justice but the vanguard for an alien invasion. The newly dropped third season of Invincible finds Mark not only still struggling to escape his father's shadow, guiding his younger brother to use his own burgeoning powers responsibly, but also drowning in a world of murky politics, pushed toward darker, tougher choices to keep Earth safe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible ’s more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel and DC characters rarely do: grow up. The Man in the High Castle This adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick’s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon’s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done—a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible—but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers. The Rig Back for its second season, sci-fi thriller The Rig finds the surviving crew of isolated North Sea oil rig Kinloch Bravo forcibly relocated to The Stac, an even more remote facility in the Arctic. While most are desperate for answers and a way home, the team’s loyalties are tested as the sinister Pictor corporation seeks to use them to unearth something ancient and powerful from the sea floor. While The Rig doesn’t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to its ecological metaphors (one character even says, “If you keep punching holes in the Earth, eventually the Earth’s going to punch back”), it’s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic settings and the terrifying expanses and underwater pressures of the ocean. With the material elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, including Iain Glen and Rochenda Sandall—and bolstered further by the addition of the always-watchable Alice Krige in season 2— The Rig is far more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be. Cross Aldis Hodge steps into the shoes of Washington, DC homicide detective Alex Cross in Prime's new series based on James Patterson's long-running series of crime novels. However, unlike the streamer's other thrillers Bosch and Reacher , Cross doesn't directly adapt any of Patterson's books—a risky move, but one that largely pays off, allowing this eight-episode first season to chart an unpredictable journey as Cross faces off against a twisted murderer who models each of his kills on another serial killer. Already renewed for a second season, Cross is a strong addition to Prime's roster of crime dramas. Citadel: Diana Amazon tried to make a splash with its $300 million spy thriller Citadel in 2023, but only half-succeeded. The Richard Madden- and Priyanka Chopra-starring action series was entertaining enough—and rode high on Prime Video’s most-watched lists—but didn’t exactly set the world alight. However, it did establish a sprawling shared universe, with rival organizations Citadel and Manticore engaged in a globe-spanning cold war setting the stage for international spin-offs. Citadel: Diana is the first, an Italian outing focusing on Diana (Matilda De Angelis), a woman out for revenge after her parents are killed, and drawn into the spy-fi underworld with violent results. Gorgeous location shoots, bone-crunching fight choreography, and, most importantly, a tighter focus help Diana improve on its parent series. The Legend of Vox Machina Bawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina follows the eponymous adventurers' guild—consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard—as they grow from a motley crew of usually-drunk mercenaries into unexpected heroes for the realm of Exandria. The newly arrived third season continues the team's battle against the Chroma Conclave, a horrifyingly powerful collective of dragons. It's a quest that sends them on a small diversion to Hell itself. Adapting the hit Critical Role —the livestreamed Dungeons & Dragons sessions of some of the biggest voice actors in animation and gaming—this exquisitely animated fantasy takes things in unexpected directions that keep things fresh for new or returning viewers alike. A love letter to D&D that's also unafraid to poke fun at the classic RPG, it's one of the most original adult animated shows on Prime. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Tapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien’s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien’s Second Age. While the first season was a slow burn, dwelling on the fractious politics of the era, the second ratchets up the pace considerably. From Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) trying to prevent the ascension of Dark Lord Sauron (Charlie Vickers) to the long-awaited introduction of fan-favorite character Tom Bombadil (Rory Kinnear), the new season feels far richer and deeper than before. It remains a feast for the eyes too, with the stratospheric budget apparent in every frame, from quiet moments in luxuriant shires to cinematic battles between armies of Orcs and Elves. For sheer high fantasy spectacle, there’s little else to rival this streaming right now. Batman: Caped Crusader The first new solo Batman animated series in a decade, Caped Crusader harkens back to Batman: The Animated Series from the 1990s, with showrunner Bruce Timm returning to the Dark Knight and Hamish Linklater voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman in an ode to the late, great Kevin Conroy. Unlike rival ‘90s revival X-Men ’97, though, this isn't a continuation but rather a wholly distinct take allowing for fresh interpretations of the iconic hero’s rogues’ gallery and allies—look out for drastically different takes on the Penguin and Harley Quinn in particular. Leaning heavily into a 1930s aesthetic that evokes Batman’s earliest comic book origins, this manages to be nostalgic and provocative at once—a fantastic outing that takes DC's original urban vigilante back to his gritty pulp noir roots. The Boys Superheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism—the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys , adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they’re a reflection of humanity’s worst—greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching “Supes” who’ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher’s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon’s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag. Fallout Maybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation—between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn’t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio—naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell—to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is. Three-Body No, you're not on the Netflix list—Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem . This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase ""Physics doesn't exist"" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story—notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution—a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world. Mr. and Mrs. Smith You likely know the concept from the name alone—a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of “John” and “Jane” Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible –style action, of course, but it’s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, “Brangelina who?” Gen V Spinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys , Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair ( Chilling Adventures of Sabrina ) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure—the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright. Jack Ryan There's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative—and beyond—over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies—season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there—its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing. I'm a Virgo A surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley ( Sorry to Bother You ), I’m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public’s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie’s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video’s “Explore” tab, for Riley’s insight into each episode. Tales From the Loop Despite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag , the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by “the Loop,” an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors—including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it’s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of Stålenhag’s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable. The Underground Railroad Based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It’s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad—the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South—and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel What is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers’ career. With four seasons and a host of awards and nominations to its name, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon’s sharpest comedies.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-shows-amazon-prime,Technology,BBC,Matt Kamen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e926c7737745a89b1d76da/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/girlfriend-amazonprime.jpg",2023-01-16T12:00:00+00:00,abcb82c3406a58ae2193298662ae69210e97c448
4a757e8cd7c6,Australia’s March Toward 100 Percent Clean Energy,"climate desk, science, environment, energy, renewable energy, australia","“[The clutch] is like 1950s technology—it’s really boring,” Westerman said (“boring,” for grid operators, is the highest form of praise). ​“The marginal cost of putting this in is like nothing compared to the cost of the plant.” A company called SSS has built these clutches for decades. One is nearly operational in the state of Queensland at the Townsville gas-fired plant, which Siemens Energy is converting into what it calls a ​“hybrid rotating grid stabilizer.” Siemens says this project is the world’s first such conversion of a gas turbine of this size. That particular retrofit took about 18 months and involved some relocating of auxiliary components at Townsville to make room for the new clutch . So it’s not instantaneous, but far easier than building a new synchronous condenser from scratch, and about half the cost, per Siemens. Some novel long-duration storage techniques also provide their own spinning mass. Canadian startup Hydrostor expects to break ground early next year on a fully permitted and contracted project in Broken Hill, a city deep in the Outback of New South Wales. Broken Hill lent its name to BHP, which started there as a silver mine in 1885 and has grown to one of the largest global mining companies. More recently, the desert landscape played host to the postapocalyptic car chases of Mad Max 2. Now, roughly 18,000 people live there, at the end of one long line connecting to the broader grid. Hydrostor will shore up local power by excavating an underground cavity and compressing air into it; releasing the compressed air turns a turbine to regenerate up to 200 megawatts for up to eight hours, serving the community if the grid connection goes down and otherwise shipping clean power to the broader grid. But unlike batteries, Hydrostor’s technology uses old-school generators, and its compressors contribute additional spinning metal. “We have a clutch spec’d in for New South Wales, because they need the inertia,” Hydrostor CEO Jon Norman said. ​“It’s so simple; it’s like the same clutches on your standard car.” Transmission grid operator Transgrid ran a competitive process to determine the best way to provide system security to Broken Hill in the event it had to operate apart from the grid, Norman said. That analysis chose Hydrostor’s bid to simply insert a clutch when it installs its machinery. The project still needs to get built, but if up-and-coming clean storage technologies could step in to provide that grid security, it wouldn’t all have to come from ghostly gas plants lingering on the system. “It’s a different feeling [in Australia]—there’s a can do, go get ​’em, ​‘put me in coach’ attitude,” said Audrey Zibelman, the American grid expert who ran AEMO before Westerman. ​“When you’re determined to say how best to go about this, as opposed to why it’s hard or why it doesn’t work, the solutions appear.”",https://www.wired.com/story/as-coal-fades-australia-looks-to-realize-dream-of-100-renewable-energy,Technology,BBC,Julian Spector,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e935c1fcb832a931e1319f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2202209773.jpg",2025-10-11T11:00:00+00:00,e3b8cc9bb9bc187bc97f168a2674800c355cc24f
dad847c59346,Security News This Week:Happy GilmoreProducer Buys Spyware Maker NSO Group,"security roundup, hacking, cybersecurity, security, immigration, department of homeland security","Research published this week indicates that North Korean scammers are trying to trick US companies into hiring them for architectural design work , using fake profiles, résumés, and Social Security numbers to pose as legitimate workers. The hustle fits into longstanding campaigns by the hermit kingdom to steal billions of dollars from organizations around the world using careful planning and coordination to pose as professionals in all different fields. Under pressure from the Department of Justice, Apple removed a series of apps from its iOS App Store this month related to monitoring US Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and archiving content related to ICE's actions. As more apps are removed, multiple developers told WIRED this week that they aren't giving up on fighting Apple over the decisions—and many are still distributing their apps on other platforms in the meantime. WIRED examined increasing warnings from software supply chain security researchers that the proliferation of AI-generated software in codebases will create an even more extreme version of the code transparency and accountability issues that have come up with widespread integration of open source software components. And Apple announced expansions of its bug bounty program this week, including a maximum $2 million payout for certain exploit chains that could be abused to distribute spyware, and additional bonuses for exploits found in Apple's Lockdown Mode or in beta versions of new software. But wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t report in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. The notorious spyware vendor NSO Group, known for developing the Pegasus malware, has faced financial issues since losing a long legal battle against the secure messaging platform WhatsApp as well as a lawsuit filed by Apple. Now, the company, which has long had Israeli ownership, has been purchased by a group of US-based investors led by movie producer Robert Simonds, who helped finance Happy Gilmore , Billy Madison , The Pink Panther , Hustlers , and Ferrari , among many other films. The deal is reportedly worth “several tens of millions of dollars” and is close to completion. Israel’s Defense Export Control Agency (DECA) within the Ministry of Defense will need to approve the sale. Use of mercenary spyware has increased within some US federal government agencies since the beginning of the Trump administration. Hundreds of national security and cybersecurity specialists who work in the US Department of Homeland Security have faced mandatory reassignment in recent weeks to roles related to President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Bloomberg reports that affected workers are largely senior staffers who are not union eligible. Workers who refuse to move roles will reportedly be dismissed. Members of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) who have faced reassignment reportedly worked on “issuing alerts about threats against US agencies and critical infrastructure.” For example, CISA’s Capacity Building team has faced a number of reassignments, which could hinder access to emergency recommendations and directives for high-value federal government assets. Workers have been moved to agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Protective Service. A recent breach of a third-party customer service provider used by the communication platform Discord included a trove of data from more than 70,000 Discord users that contained identification documents as well as selfies, email addresses, phone numbers, some home location information, and more. The data was collected as part of age verification checks, a mechanism that has long been criticized for centralizing users’ sensitive information. 404 Media reports that the breach was perpetrated by attackers who are attempting to extort Discord. “This is about to get really ugly,” the hackers wrote in a Telegram channel on Wednesday while posting the stolen data. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement inked a $825,000 contract in May with TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), a Maryland-based company that manufactures equipment and vehicles for law enforcement. The company provides products including rogue cellphone towers that are used for phone surveillance and sometimes called “stingrays” or “cell-site simulators.” Public records reviewed by TechCrunch show that the agreement describes how the company “provides Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program” and is a modification for “additional CSS Vehicles.” TOSV also began a similar $818,000 contract with ICE in September 2024, prior to the start of the Trump administration. In an email to TechCrunch, TOSV president Jon Brianas declined to share details about the contracts but confirmed that the company does provide cell-site simulators. The company does not manufacture them itself, he said.",https://www.wired.com/story/happy-gilmore-producer-buys-spyware-maker-nso-group,Technology,BBC,Lily Hay Newman,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e97463badb1063e7a47cfb/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/sec-roundup-nso-1734166570.jpg",2025-10-11T10:30:00+00:00,0e5e2c3ec48d4964758c7330cd5f5792f03a74f1
727b09e7e78e,"Gear News of the Week: Intel’s New Chips Arrive, and Apple May Debut iPads and MacBooks This Month","shopping, gear roundup, apple, meta, sony, playstation, google, logitech, intel","Intel's future has never seemed so uncertain. But most of the company's roller-coaster ride of a year has been a lead-up to its next-gen CPU launch, announced this week. The chips will be known as Intel Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, and they're being manufactured in its new Arizona-based fabrication plant . Intel claims the first configurations will ship before the end of the year and then more broadly starting in January 2026. We don't have a complete lineup yet, but Panther Lake will include up to 16-core CPUs with a ""more than 50 percent faster CPU"" performance over the previous generation. Intel claims that the new integrated GPU with have up to 12 GPU cores that are also 50 percent faster than the prior generation, boosted by a new architecture. Intel is fighting back against the stiff competition. Qualcomm dramatically entered the Windows laptop race in 2024 with its Arm-based, highly-efficient Snapdragon X chips, doubling the battery life of current Intel-powered laptops in some cases. While Intel was able to respond to the battery-life competition with its Core Ultra Series 2 V-series chips in late 2024, performance took a hit on these laptops, and the efficiency only applied to flagship, thin, and light laptops. Budget-level and high-performance laptops used a different architecture and therefore didn't get that same bump in efficiency. That made shopping for a laptop in 2025 even more head-scratching than normal. These next chips will attempt to fix this problem, with the company promising “Lunar Lake–level power efficiency” and “Arrow Lake–class performance.” Intel really needs to achieve that promise, because with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 Elite having just been previewed and the Apple M5 on the way, the stakes keep rising. — Luke Larsen Apple’s Next Hardware Launch Is Coming Soon Tim Cook on stage during the Apple Keynote on September 9, 2025. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu If you're thinking, didn't Apple just have an event? Yes, the company debuted new iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods just last month. But rumors are heating up that the company will announce more products this month, focused on iPads and MacBooks . That's not unusual, as the company has held October events for the past few years, usually for the tablet and Mac lineups. It's unclear whether this will be an actual event or a silent launch via press release. The company has done both in the past. So what can you expect? The marquee announcement will revolve around the anticipated M5 chipset, which may debut inside a new MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. The flagship tablet likely won't look or feel too different from the prior M4 version . MacBooks are a little more up in the air on launch timing; it could be at this event or early in 2026. If they are announced, it'll be a new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chip. Apple has also reportedly been gearing up for a budget MacBook launch powered by an iPhone processor, but this may arrive early in 2026 instead. Other hardware that may debut at this October event includes a new Vision Pro powered by an M4 or M5 chip with a comfier head strap, though it's otherwise the same as the original headset . There may be a new Apple TV with a faster chipset, the new version of Siri (though this won't come until 2026), and Wi-Fi 7 support. And we may finally see a second-gen AirTag , with a longer range.

0939fcf4990f,Review: Corvette E-Ray,"cars, evs and hybrids, automotive, reviews, general motors","A 1.9-kWh lithium-ion battery has been packaged within the car’s already beefy central tunnel, and additional cooling has been added to manage battery temperature. There’s also new software to harmonize all the components. The hybrid adds 160 bhp for a total system power output of 645 bhp, which is almost identical to the amount produced by the thunderous ZO6. On top of that, the more overtly aero-oriented comp-inspired car also donates its wide-body look, the previously optional carbon-ceramic brakes are standard, and the tires epically chunky: 275/30ZR-20s at the front, 345/25ZR-21s at the rear. (Specially developed all-season Michelin Pilot Sports are available.) Riotous Design We’re not sure the car’s visuals are quite equal to the ambition being exercised elsewhere, though. The Corvette’s design trajectory since its 1953 launch is instructive of American automotive design overall, the ’60s C2 Sting Ray and ’80s C4 iterations culturally relative high-points. The latest car is an incoherent riot of competing angles and edges, undeniably dramatic and a crowd-pleaser to judge by the reaction it generates during WIRED's drive. But still no oil painting. It’s unrepentantly expressive inside, too. It’s easy to get in and out of, the doors opening wide, the seats more luxurious in feel and amply cushioned compared to its more minimalist rivals. The steering wheel is one of those fashionably square items, its spars oddly downcast. But the driving position is good, the view ahead helped by fairly slender A pillars. A rear-view camera mirror helps ease reversing anxiety, usually a tricky thing in a mid-engined car. Multi-configurable instrument dials lie straight ahead, there’s a crisp Head-Up Display, and an angled touchscreen handles the infotainment. Then there’s that swooping central tunnel, the leading edge of which houses the switchgear that operates the climate control and various other functions. Fearing total ergonomic catastrophe, it’s a surprise to discover that it all actually works well in practice. Electric Stealth Given that the Corvette’s V-8 is totemic, the E-Ray’s principal hybrid party trick is its “stealth” mode, which does what it says: enables the car to exit your street under near-silent electric-only propulsion. Its range in this mode is barely a few miles, but still, this is briefly an electric, front-drive Corvette. What a novelty.

4f0c3cbc605a,WIRED Roundup: Are We In an AI Bubble?,"uncanny valley podcast, politics, news, artificial intelligence, chatbots","Zoë Schiffer: Our first story this week is about Mark Bray. He is a professor at Rutgers University and he wrote a book almost a decade ago about antifa, and he's currently trying to flee the United States for Europe. This comes after an online campaign against him led by far-right influencers eventually escalated into death threats. On Sunday, this professor informed his students that he would be moving to Europe with his partner and his young children. OK, Leah, you've obviously been following this really, really closely. What happened next? Leah Feiger: Well, Mark and his family got to the airport, they scanned their passports, they got their boarding passes, checked in their bags, went through security, did everything. Got to their gate and United Airlines told them that between checking in, checking their bags, doing all of this, and getting to their gate, someone had actually canceled their reservation. Zoë Schiffer: Oh, my gosh. Leah Feiger: It's not clear what happened. Mark is of the belief that there is something nefarious at foot. He's currently trying to get out. We reached out to United Airlines for comment, they don't have anything for us. The Trump administration hasn't commented. DHS claims that Customs and Border Patrol and TSA are not across this. But this is understandably a really, really scary moment for anyone that is even perceived to be speaking out against the Trump administration. Zoë Schiffer: OK, I feel like we need to back up here because obviously, the Trump administration in his second term is very focused on antifa. But can you give me a little back story on why this has escalated so sharply just recently? Leah Feiger: Yeah, absolutely. This has been growing for quite some time. How many unfortunate rambling speeches have we heard from President Donald J. Trump about how antifa and leftist political violence was going to destroy the country? To be clear, that's not factual. Antifa isn't actually some organized group, this is an ideology of antifascist activists around the country. The very essence of being antifascist is not organized in this way. This all really kicked off on September 22nd when Trump issued his antifa executive order where he designated anyone involved in this and affiliated and supporting basically is a domestic terrorist. DHS has repeated this widely as well. And we're now in a situation where far-right influencers, Fox News every single day is like, ""antifa did this, antifa did this, antifa did this."" Listeners are probably familiar with antifa following the George Floyd 2020 protests when a lot if right-wingers claimed that antifa was taking over Portland and they were the reasons for all this. But it's been a couple of years since it's been super back on the main stage, so it's really just been the last few weeks.",https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-wired-roundup-are-we-in-an-ai-bubble,Technology,BBC,Zoë Schiffer,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e81570a68ae1e7a129fd64/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/openai-value-biz-2181653413.jpg",2025-10-10T19:50:22.811000+00:00,efa903df2d651af8574a5018c9e91f1cac43dd38
79e7c002f045,Save Almost $75 on Our Favorite Gaming Earbuds,"deals, shopping, video games, playstation, xbox, wireless earbuds","Looking for a great discount on a unique gaming headset? I've been using the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds (9/10, WIRED Recommends) for months for both gaming and everyday use, and they're currently marked down at Amazon to just $128, in both a black Xbox version , and a white Playstation version . Photograph: Eric Ravenscraft SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds While most gamers opt for over-ear headsets , there are actually quite a few advantages to using earbuds instead. For starters, they're much more portable, which is particularly important if you play on your phone or a gaming handheld. My favorite Switch 2 carrying case has a convenient storage pocket inside that these slip right into, so I don't have to go hunting for them in the overhead compartment once I'm already buckled in for a long flight. They also have great compatibility, with the discounted versions supporting either Xbox or PlayStation, and both styles playing well with Switch, PC, and smartphones without any additional software or drivers. The compact USB-C dongle fits right into the case, and has a horizontal layout that lets it sit cleanly on top of consoles or phones, providing low-latency 2.4GHz audio, as well as BLuetooth for just listening to tunes. Battery life is right up there with other wireless earbuds, managing around 10 hours in just the buds, and pushing 40 total with the charging case. I also really appreciate the SteelSeries mobile app. In addition to the normal settings you'd expect for active noise-canceling, there's a huge library of equalizer settings for popular games. You'd be surprised at how much of a difference these make, letting you switch between ideal setups for different games without having to set up any profiles or remember frequencies. They're really comfortable too, so much so that they've become my go-to earbuds for walking the dog or working out. They have a great fit and sound isolation, and even though it's personal preference, but the use of actual buttons instead of capacitive touch for controls makes bumping pause less likely. If gaming earbuds don't sound like your speed, make sure to check out our roundup of other great gaming headsets . You might be surprised by how well modern earbuds can work for both gaming and regular life though, so don't be afraid to give these a shot, particularly at the discounted price.",https://www.wired.com/story/steelseries-arctis-gamebuds-deal-1025,Technology,BBC,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e9443e62893a7833fc3ea5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Save%20Almost%20$75%20on%20Our%20Favorite%20Gaming%20Earbuds.png",2025-10-10T18:04:04.405000+00:00,307cc920f00acc805c00efd6924aee8bbb295d62
fc4553550bee,The Shutdown Is Pushing Air Safety Workers to the Limit,"aviation, airlines, air travel, airports, government, politics, republicans, democrats","“We will never compromise on safety. When staffing constraints arise, the FAA will slow down air traffic at impacted airports to ensure operations remain safe,” FAA spokesperson Hannah Walden tells WIRED, adding that Transportation secretary Sean Duffy “ said that air traffic controllers who report to work will be paid. Regarding reductions in force (RIFs), DOT has been clear for months: safety critical positions—including air traffic controllers—have and will continue to be exempt from any RIFs.” In a written statement, a spokesperson for the TSA said of employees working without pay: “It’s unfortunate they have been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.” On Thursday, Duffy suggested on Fox Business News that controllers and other workers who don’t come to work during the shutdown would be fired. “If we have a continual small subset of controllers that don’t show up to work, and they’re the problem children ... if we have some on our staff that aren’t dedicated like we need, we’re going to let them go,” said Duffy. One air traffic controller described this week’s working conditions as “pretty much the same” but with “an undercurrent of fear that the dipshits in charge will use this as an excuse to decertify our union and take away all bargaining rights.” Air traffic workers know that accusations of coordinated activity and sick-outs, or informal labor actions that could violate long-standing bargaining agreements with the government, are especially perilous right now, as federal officials threaten the status of public sector unions. The Trump administration suddenly ended TSA workers’ collective bargaining agreement in March, before a court preliminarily halted the move in June. Workers worry that taking an absence, even when it's needed, could have long-term consequences for their union—and therefore, their working conditions. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. But a pop-up on the public union’s website notes that it “does not endorse, support, or condone any federal employees participating in or endorsing a coordinated activity that negatively affects the capacity” of the National Airspace System. Jones, the TSA agent and union leader, says his group won’t organize sick-outs. But employees may have to call out if the lack of pay means “they don’t have the means to commute into work,” he says. “We are sick and tired of being political pawns for Washington,” adds Jones.",https://www.wired.com/story/shutdown-pushing-air-safety-workers,Technology,BBC,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e7ef0430f916543ceda2d5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2169077956.jpg",2025-10-10T16:45:26.597000+00:00,7c3a95e6cbfebe7f9943a5f6f9a0d7185d428ab9
b30124872a6a,Which Google Pixel Phone Should You Buy?,"shopping, buying guides, phones, pixel, android, google, smartphones","There are some minor multitasking improvements—it's easy to put two apps side by side in split-screen, and you can move the slider in between them to resize the apps, even stow one far to the side for easy access. But you still can't use three apps simultaneously (I miss the OnePlus Open's implementation of this.) If you want a folding phone, I suggest looking at the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 , which is thinner, lighter, and easier to use. However, if you prefer Google's software experience and camera quality, there's a good chance you'll really enjoy using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold—if you can stomach the price. Last Year's Pixels Photograph: Julian Chokkattu You don't need to buy the latest and greatest! Buying last year's flagship phone is a great way to save some cash. However, make sure you're spending far less than the MSRP—otherwise, you may as well buy one of the latest Pixel 10 phones. The previous Pixel generation from 2024 includes the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL (9/10, WIRED Recommends) , and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (6/10, WIRED Review) . The Tensor G4 chipset in these phones is perfectly capable, the displays still get very bright, and the cameras aren't vastly different. The Pixel 9 lacks the extra 5X optical zoom camera, and none of these devices have Qi2 support, so no magnetic fun. While Google hasn't confirmed what features from the Pixel 10 series will arrive on the Pixel 9 series, there's a good chance many of them will in a future Pixel Drop feature update. Before the launch of the Pixel 10, the Pixel 9 regularly dipped to $599, the Pixel 9 Pro dropped to $749, the Pixel 9 Pro XL was on sale for $899, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold hit $1,499. I wouldn't buy these devices unless they were at those prices again or lower. How Long Is Your Pixel Supported? AccordionItemContainerButton The Pixel 10 series, Pixel 9 series, Pixel 8 series, Pixel 9a, and Pixel 8a will get seven years of Android OS upgrades and security updates. The 2023 Pixel 7a will receive three years of Android OS upgrades and five years of security updates from the date of launch, the same as older Pixels. Google has a page you can check to see exactly what month your Pixel phone will stop receiving updates. Security updates reduce the risk of malware, keep your phone bug-free, and make it more secure. Android version updates introduce new features—cosmetic and functional—that improve the OS as a whole. Pixel phones also happen to be the first to receive any kind of Android update, so as soon as Google releases a new version, like Android 16 , you can download it immediately by heading to Settings > System > System Update > Check for Update . You can also test beta versions of Android, but you'll need to enroll your device . (Make sure to back up your phone first!) Pixels are also privy to the feature drops Google issues every few months, which include features from newer Pixels coming to older models and brand-new features for the latest devices. AccordionItemContainerButton Qi2 is the next-gen wireless charging standard , following the Qi wireless protocol. It uses magnets baked into the back of smartphones to perfectly align them with magnets in Qi2 wireless chargers, ensuring a faster and more efficient charge with less heat. It's practically the same as Apple's MagSafe technology (Apple helped develop the Qi2 standard), and all MagSafe iPhones now support Qi2, starting from the iPhone 12. However, not all phones that claim Qi2 functionality are actually Qi2 phones. Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is notably Qi2 Ready , meaning they don't have magnets inside, and the only way they can achieve the charging speeds and efficiency of Qi2 is with a magnetic case. You don't have to worry about that with the Pixel 10 phones. They're all proper Qi2 devices with magnets inside. Google calls it “Pixelsnap” and that's also the name its using for its suite of accessories. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the only one of the lot that supports the even newer Qi2.2 25W standard, which bumps the charging speed from 15 watts to 25. That means it'll wireless charge the fastest, provided you use a compatible charger . If you have an older Qi wireless charger lying around, there's a chance it won't work all that well with the new phones. Qi2 is backward compatible, but we've run into issues with older chargers just not recharging devices consistently. You'll probably need to upgrade to a Qi2 charger. If you get a case ( read our guide !), make sure it's a Pixelsnap or Qi2 case with magnets inside. Without magnets, a case will weaken the magnets in the phone, and they won't stick well to Qi2 or other magnetic accessories. What About Older Pixel Phones? AccordionItemContainerButton There are a few other Pixel phones worth considering if you don't want any of the above choices. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ) are available through official channels and third-party retailers (until supplies last). The key is to not pay more than $500 or $600 for either of them; otherwise, you may as well put that money toward the Pixel 9 or Pixel 10 series. I do not recommend you buy any older Pixel devices. Several Pixel A-series phones have been put under a battery performance program to mitigate the risk of overheating or swollen batteries. These software updates have crippled the battery life on those phones, and Google has provided customers with battery replacement options or Google Store credit for a new Pixel phone. These potential issues mean it's just not worth the risk of buying a Pixel 7a or Pixel 6a . I also don't think the Pixel 8a is worthwhile anymore as the price hasn't come down much; you're better off buying the Pixel 9a. Pixel A-Series Battery Issues AccordionItemContainerButton In 2025, some Google Pixel 4a and Pixel 6a owners have received mandatory updates that purposefully degrade the performance of the battery to prevent overheating. Your phone may have been working fine before, but Google issued these updates as a preventative measure, and not every device was affected. Similarly, some Pixel 7a devices may encounter battery swelling issues. If your phone has been affected, you have two options. You can get a free battery replacement—Google has a registration page for the Pixel 4a , Pixel 6a , and Pixel 7a . If that isn't going to work for you, you can get Google Store credit for the Pixel 4a and Pixel 6a to put toward a new Pixel phone. These issues seem to have only affected some batteries in the A-series phones, suggesting it's likely a supplier issue. What about the newer Pixel 9a? Here's a statement a Google spokesperson provided to WIRED: “Google continuously improves Pixel testing based on user feedback and thoroughly investigates reported incidents for all components, including batteries. With Pixel 9a, we delivered the largest and longest-lasting battery of any A-series yet. We’ve been encouraged by its reception so far and are confident in the phone’s longevity and durability.” Ideally, this battery issue has been rectified in the latest model, but we'll be monitoring it over the next few years. What Does Pixel Care+ Include? AccordionItemContainerButton When you purchase a Pixel from Google, you'll see the option to add Pixel Care+ for protection . It's only available in the US through the Google Store and Google Fi. The monthly option can run for up to 60 months, whereas the fixed pricing is for a 2-year term. Here's what you get. Pixel Care+ starts at $9 per month or $179 and includes unlimited accidental damage protection, $0 screen and battery repairs, replacements that ship in a day, and priority support from Pixel experts. That pricing is for the Pixel 10, and it goes up for the pricier devices. For example, the Pixel 10 Pro will cost $13 per month, or $239 for the 2-year term. There's no Pixel Care+ option for the Pixel 9a. Pixel Care+ with Loss and Theft starts at $10 per month or $199 and includes the same protections as mentioned above but includes two claims of loss and theft every 12 months. Weirdly, Loss and Theft coverage is not available in New York state. You Can DeGoogle Your Pixel Phone AccordionItemContainerButton Love Pixel phones but want to get away from using Google services ? It's a little odd, but you can actually use a different operating system with the Pixel instead of the built-in Android. We've tested and really like /e/OS, a privacy-first operating system that's based on the Android Open Source Project. While you can install it yourself, it requires a bit of technical know-how, you can buy a refurbished Pixel from Murena with /e/OS installed already. If you're interested, we have more details about /e/OS here . The Best Pixel Cases and Accessories I've written a broader guide on the Best Pixel 10 Cases and Best Pixel 9 (and 9a) Cases , but here are a few selections for your perusal. We've highlighted cases for the current Pixel lineup, but you can easily find the same versions for prior models if you peruse the case maker's catalog. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixelsnap Phone Case for Pixel 10 Series These official cases from Google for the Pixel 10 series are Qi2-certified with Pixelsnap magnets baked in, allowing you to attach the phone to magnetic accessories without any loss in strength or wireless charging capabilities (if you use a case without magnets, it will weaken the strength and disrupt the feature). The soft silicone is pleasant to the touch, and you can color-match it with your Pixel 10 phone to highlight the phone's color. I also like Google's official Pixel 9a case ($30) , which is similar, but it doesn't have the magnets inside, as it's not a Qi2 phone. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Mous Limitless Case (Pixelsnap) Mous cases are Made for Google certified, and that's especially important with the Pixel 10 series, as it ensures the best compatibility with Pixelsnap. The Limitless is a great all-rounder, with raised edges over the display, clicky buttons, reliable magnets for Qi2, and several design aesthetics you can choose from, including a walnut back or speckled fabric (pictured). Photograph: Julian Chokkattu dbrand Grip Case (Pixelsnap) Dbrand's Grip case lives up to its name. It has clicky buttons and incredibly grippy edges. It feels robust yet fairly slim, and you can choose a snazzy design. Just know that you have to apply this “skin” to the back of the case. There's a lot of room for error here, so be careful, and watch Dbrand's installation video for tips . There's Pixelsnap support so you can use your Pixel with Qi2 and even MagSafe accessories , and it worked exceptionally well in my testing. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Bellroy Leather Case (Pixelsnap) Bellroy has been making Pixel cases for a long time, and it worked in collaboration with Google for the Pixel 10 cases, ensuring the perfect fit. It's Pixelsnap-certified (the Pixel 9a case doesn't have magnets), so it'll work with magnetic accessories. The leather comes from sustainable sources, and it exudes class. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Peak Design Everyday Case for Pixel 10 (Magnetic) This is hands-down the best case if you frequently attach your Pixel to the handlebars of a bike or an electric scooter. Peak Design's mounting system lets you magnetically affix the phone to its Universal Bike Mount ($50) , and it stays put. After more than a year of testing, I've yet to have a phone fall off my ride using this mounting system. The company also has several other magnetic accessories , like a car vent mount . The case itself is nice; I just wish the edges were raised more for better screen protection. You can choose to have it with the loop, which acts as a grip, or without it. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu dbrand Ghost Case 2.0 (Pixelsnap) This is the best clear case for the Pixel 10 series. Dbrand promises that the Ghost 2.0 won't yellow over time, so much so that if it actually does, the company will replace it for free. It's thin, has stronger magnets than most other Pixelsnap cases, and has grippy edges. And you get to see your Pixel's color shine through. The company technically doesn't make it for the Pixel 10, just the Pro models, but because the dimensions are the same, the 10 Pro case fits perfectly on the Pixel 10. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixelsnap Ring Stand Google's Ring Stand is a surprisingly sturdy and great kickstand. There's good tension in the metal ring, and you can adjust your phone at varying heights. You can also twist it to put the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. Make sure you take it off before placing the phone on a wireless charger; you're not supposed to attach magnetic accessories or chargers to the Ring Stand itself. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixelsnap Charger With Stand You don't need to spend this much for a decent Qi2 charger, but these are what Google is officially selling, and they're great (if overpriced). The stand version is actually the same Pixelsnap charger, just with a robust stand to keep it propped up. The stand is stable, doesn't shift around, and you can charge the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu dbrand Prism 2.0 Screen Protector Dbrand gives you two screen protectors in this package, and it comes with a super-easy application tool. Wipe down your phone with the included alcohol wipe, dry it with the microfiber, and then place the tool over your phone and pull the pull tab. Press down on the line, wait 30 seconds, and then take the tool off. There's a squeegee to push out air bubbles. If you don't want to spend this much, Spigen's GlasTR tempered glass protectors are also easy to apply and cost $20 for a two-pack . Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter Google's latest Pixel 10 series supports 29W and 39W charging speeds, depending on the model. That makes this 65W a little overkill, but I still think it's a great all-around charging adapter to carry with you. It's incredibly slim and lightweight, has folding prongs, and includes two USB-C ports. When you have two devices plugged in, one port will dish out 45W and the other will deliver 20W. The former will let you hit the fastest charging speeds possible on any of your Pixel devices. The Pixel Ecosystem If you buy a Pixel phone, there's a good chance you're interested in Google's other Pixel hardware. Good news: They're pretty great. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are excellent earbuds, and the Pixel Watch 4 is the Android smartwatch to beat. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Denoted as the “Best Earbuds for Android” in our Best Wireless Earbuds guide , the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are wonderfully small and compact, with a fun, egg-shaped case that has a lovely matte texture. They pair well with Android devices, have wireless charging, and include excellent noise-cancelling. You can also tap and hold the buds to talk to the Gemini voice assistant, and a recent software update added Loud Noise Protection and Adaptive Audio, the latter of which dynamically reduces the volume of unwanted sounds like sirens. You can even nod to answer a call or shake to decline! If you don't want to spend as much, there's also the Pixel Buds 2a ($129) , which are even smaller and have many of the same features, though there's no wireless charging in the case. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Pixel Watch 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) works with all Android phones, and it's a natural fit with a Pixel phone. This smartwatch will relay any app notifications you want to see on your wrist, and you can even check your Nest security cameras via the Google Home app. You can raise your wrist to talk to the Gemini assistant, no hot word needed, and there's a robust suite of health and fitness tracking capabilities that go toe-to-toe with the Apple Watch . Battery life is solid too, lasting about a day and a half with the 45-mm model, and it recharges incredibly fast. You can opt for the cellular version if you want always-on connectivity even away from your phone, though you'll need to pay up for a separate watch data plan. Read our Best Smartwatches guide for other options. Our Favorite Pixel Software Features Pixels have many great software features, but some need to be toggled on. It can also be hard to remember that all these features exist, so here are most of the top ones. There are some key features on Pixels that you won't find on any other Android phone. Some of these are available only on select Pixels—the Tensor chip started with the Pixel 6, and currently, the Tensor G4 is in the Pixel 9 range. Here's a breakdown: Call Screen: When you get a call from an unknown number, Google Assistant will scan and flag it if it's suspected spam or a robocall. If it's simply a number you don't recognize, you can have Assistant take the call. You'll see a real-time transcription of what's happening, so you can end the call right away if it's a telemarketer or answer if it turns out to be a long-lost high school friend. If it's someone important, you can give Assistant responses to recite if you're unable to take the call—it offers up contextual replies now, too. Remember to turn it on by opening up the dialer app and heading to Settings (three dots on the top right) > Spam and Call Screen .",https://www.wired.com/story/best-google-pixel-phone,Technology,BBC,Julian Chokkattu,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68a7a913ababd253d6b1768f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Google%20Pixel%2010%20Series%20SOURCE%20Julian%20Chokkattu.jpg",2020-12-07T14:00:00+00:00,47acf7ff41b98d6946fdb0a152105b9ec335e29f
fb02e2a83fa8,UK Watchdog Targets Google Search in Competition Crackdown,"business, google, uk, competition, search engines, regulation","“The decision to formally designate Google with Strategic Market Status is an important step to improving competition in digital markets,” argues Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at UK consumer watchdog Which?. “Online search is evolving as gen AI tools become more widely used, but the CMA must still act to tackle the harmful dominance Google has now and to promote competition between gen AI search tools.” The CMA claims that Google Search accounts for more than 90 percent of all general search queries in the UK, and that over 200,000 firms in the UK collectively spent more than £10 billion ($13.3 billion) on Google search advertising in 2024. “Designating Google with SMS enables us to consider proportionate, targeted interventions to ensure that general search services are open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google can have confidence that they are treated fairly,” the CMA decision report reads. In a statement shared with WIRED in response to the CMA’s decision, Google’s senior director of competition Oliver Bethell said that many of the ideas for interventions raised in this process would “inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation.” It continued: “Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers.” This is not a surprising response, says Greg Dowell, senior competition knowledge lawyer at law firm Macfarlanes. “I think we can expect Google and all the other big tech firms that are being subjected to these new rules to try and defend their practices on the basis that they are pro-consumer,” says Dowell. “Ultimately it is natural that Google and other firms in this position don’t want to be constrained in what they can do when it comes to new product development.” The new regulation will also affect Google Search’s “News” tab and its “Top Stories” carousel, as well as Google Discover. Google News, the company’s stand-alone news product, and AI chatbot Gemini are not affected, the CMA says. Dowell claims that implementing this roadmap might take a number of months. “The CMA may go further than the EU has done with the [Digital Markets Act] , particularly with regards to restrictions relating to Google’s AI services and how they’re integrated into Google search,” he explains. “The CMA essentially has a huge degree of flexibility in the interventions that it can seek to impose, and so it can continually react to developments as they occur. So that’s one benefit of the UK digital markets regulation regime, particularly when you compare it to the situation in the EU, where these sorts of rules are fixed in the regulation itself.”",https://www.wired.com/story/uk-watchdog-targets-google-search-in-competition-crackdown,Technology,BBC,Natasha Bernal,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e8e5813a29a338be03a173/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2210074784.jpg",2025-10-10T14:16:09.281000+00:00,7056b61555c2bc6ee3a97196dbdeac552212ac35
005590338054,The Best Vacuums for Pet Hair,"shopping, household, vacuum, robot vacuum, smart home, buying guides, cleaning, pets, vacuums","Compare Our Picks Others Tested Photograph: Molly Higgins Tineco Go Pet Cordless Vacuum for $219 : As when I tested the Tineco Go Mini ($110) for my handheld vacuums guide, I was a bit underwhelmed by this vacuum specifically for pets. It has a slot for easy brush removal if hair gets stuck around the bars, which is a helpful thing to have when you’re dealing with pet (and human) hair. The lever and the angle of the lid for emptying are counterintuitive, and the first few times I emptied it, the debris went everywhere. It’s hard to distinguish between eco and power modes, and the vac blinked red and the brush stopped rotating when transitioning between surfaces. (It especially had a hard time on my thin runner rug.) It felt a bit heavier and clunkier than others as well. But, it does have handy lights to illuminate debris and comes with attachments to make handheld cleaning a breeze. Photograph: Molly Higgins Mova P50 Pro Ultra Robot Vacuum for $999 : This robot vacuum-mop combo has extendable side brush and mop pads to reach tight corners, a self-emptying dock station that empties dust and debris, and self-cleans and dries mop pads. It also uses an RGB camera and “intelligent dirt detection system” whose sensors identify messes to clean deeper and avoid objects on the ground. The robovac generates 3D maps of your home, and identifies things like furniture and even pets. Through the app, you can customize cleanings, and there’s also synced video and voice interaction to allow you to talk to your pets, schedule cleanings, and more, and it is compatible with smart home devices Alexa and Google Home. When first mapping my small apartment, the vac didn’t want to go past certain rooms, and it took several days to get it to create a complete cleaning map. It has a hard time going over small thresholds, eventually avoiding cleaning the rooms altogether, and has thrown itself off my stairs twice, causing the mop pads to pop off. Despite having intelligent object detection, it still often tried to suck up or roll over small objects on the ground, like shoes and pet toys. I love that this combo vac-mop self-cleans and empties, but for nearly $1,000, I wish the smart features were smarter and the mapping was more accurate. Dyson Car + Boat Handheld Vacuum for $280 : While the Humdinger is still my favorite handheld vacuum, it seems to be dwindling in availability and is being replaced with this new model. Former WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar liked this handheld vacuum, designed specifically for sucking up dirt and debris from your car and boat, plus bedding, furniture, and other awkward spaces. ( Read our full review here ). Hoover HL4 Pet Upright Vacuum Cleaner for £219 : While it is only available in the UK, Hoover’s HL4 successfully removed lots of cat hair from my home. I live with a trio of cats, two of them long-haired, so a powerful vacuum is essential. The HL4 is sadly corded (7.6 meters), but at around 240 air watts it was powerful enough to lift dust and hair that my lightweight cordless vac and robot vac had missed. The smart design easily converts into a portable vacuum, and it comes with a pet tool and crevice tool. The pet tool proved adept at lifting hair from the couch, stairs, and cat beds, though it didn’t quite have the grunt to remove every strand. There’s a handy vent to reduce suction for mats and blankets. The 1.2-liter bin is easy to remove and empty, though not without releasing a dust cloud, and the Anti-Twist floor head seems to collect considerably less tangled hair than other vacuums. — Simon Hill Not Recommended Photograph: Molly Higgins Eufy RoboVac 11S Max for $160 : Our esteemed competitors at places like The Strategist and Wirecutter loved this cheap robovac, so I bought one for myself before moving into my new apartment with two cats. And I have to say, I don't agree with them. Yes, this robovac is significantly cheaper than most others and has generally good ratings, but I have nothing nice to say about it besides that it is able to go under furniture and suck up pet hair I otherwise wouldn’t be able to. Its navigation system is random, it doesn't have an app (but it does come with a remote control to direct it to a specific spot or schedule cleanings), it’s loud, and it tends to be attracted to cords. It has extreme difficulty traversing even minor height differences, like the small panel of wood between the hallway and bathroom door. But most of all, it is needlessly hard to empty the bin, and nearly impossible to detangle all of the hair and fur from the bar or spinning brush beneath. There’s gross hair that will probably still be wrapped around the mechanism until the day I am put into the ground. This cursed thing will outlive us all, I fear. AccordionItemContainerButton I tested these pet hair vacuums for a week if not more (I’ve been using both the Dyson cordless and handheld for months now), and I’ve used them on nearly every surface in my house—including the cat trees and behind my two cats’ litter box . When testing began, I lived in a large house with three cats and a dog (more hair in a larger area), and for the latter half of testing, I lived with two cats in a small apartment (slightly less hair in a smaller area with less places for hair to hide). I also tested every attachment on problem areas like carpeted stairs, crevices of air vents, a high-pile rug, and hardwood floors. Not all pet hair vacuums are created alike, and they vary quite a bit in their effectiveness on different surfaces and with different attachments. I set these up, charged ’em, and vacuumed with them until they died, noting run time, power, effectiveness, and ease of emptying the bin and cleaning the filter. AccordionItemContainerButton It seems like a lot of brands will slap the words “pet hair” onto a product and market it as such without really specifying why or how it’s effective for pet hair. Of course, I tested those to see if they put their metaphorical vac mouths where their money was. On the flip side, I also tested some that were well rated for overall efficacy but not marketed toward pets—like the Roborock Saros 10R , a pricey robovac that uses AI mapping and can identify pets nearby and quiet its motor. Speaking of, vacuums and pets are inherently antithetical. Vacuums are a necessary evil to combat pet hair, but your pets will likely be scared of them. If my cat Basil had opposable thumbs, I know he’d be leaving hate comments on this article. Aside from the robovac picks (which for some reason my cats don’t mind), my cat Basil had a mild cardiac event each time I tested the other vacs on this list. So along with effectiveness and suction, I also took into consideration loudness, as well as how easy the product is to handle. Generally though, when shopping for a pet hair vacuum, look for suction power, bin capacity, attachments, and type of bristle or Motorbar—figure out what’s going to be doing the actual picking up of dust, dander, and pet hair. I found that conical bars like the ones on certain Dyson models work well to not get tangled, and dual brushes like on the Ryobi work together to effectively pick up more. Also read reviews from real people with real, furry pets, but know that no two pets are alike. Take into consideration what kind of shedder you live with, and what type of space needs cleaning; a robovac may not be best for a house with multiple flights of carpeted stairs.

1c287fa94924,The Best Folding Phones,"shopping, phones, smartphones, folding devices, android, buying guides","Other Folding Phones to Consider Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 for $1,100 : Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a close second to Motorola's Razr Ultra. I liked the camera quality from Motorola's flip phone this year more than Samsung's—a big win for the Razr—but the Flip7 captures nice photos and offers better video quality, if that's your thing. Samsung's latest Flip has a larger front screen, though you still have to jump through a few hoops to make it useful. For example, you need to install an app called Multistar to add any app of your choosing to the cover screen. The phone also has a lackluster battery life, struggling to last a full day; the Razr Ultra still only lasts a day, but I didn't feel like I had to plug in as much. And it also gets a little too warm for my tastes when it's under load. It's a good flip phone, but I prefer Motorola's flagship this year. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for $1,499 : The only reason to consider the Pixel 9 Pro Fold right now is if you see it on sale. Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the newer, better handset . The 9 Pro Fold isn't as slim as the Galaxy Z Fold7 nor as lightweight, but it's still a svelte device with a large front screen that feels like a normal phone. The 8-inch inner screen is excellent, and the triple-camera system delivers great results, though not as great as the Pixel 9 Pro series . Read our Best Pixel Phones guide for more. Razr 2025 series Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Motorola Razr+ (2025) for $1,000 : There is technically a third phone in Motorola's latest Razr lineup: the Razr+ 2025. However, it's nearly identical to last year's Razr+ 2024 , with fresh colors and the improved IP48 rating and titanium-reinforced hinge. It sits in an awkward middle ground, though. It's not as affordable as the standard Razr, which offers a pretty nice experience for the money. But it's also not as flagship as the Razr Ultra. It is also the only one of the lineup without the ultrawide camera. I usually love telephoto zoom lenses, but ultrawides are so handy on flip phones for group selfies. If you're considering this model, it's also worth considering the Razr+ from 2024 , as you'll see some nice discounts on it throughout the year; it just lacks the reinforced hinge and IP48 rating. Galaxy Z Fold6 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 for $1,900 : The Galaxy Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the sixth-generation folding phone from Samsung and came out in 2024. In this version, Samsung added a wider front screen that feels like a normal smartphone, though not as wide as the Galaxy Z Fold7. I don't find multitasking as easy as on phones like the OnePlus Open, and the aspect ratio still restricts some apps from showing a multi-pane view, like Gmail, unless you rotate the phone to landscape. It may not be as easy to find now that it has a successor, but if you find it on sale for under $1,400, it's worth considering, especially since Samsung offers long software support. Galaxy Z Flip6 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6 for $900 : Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) from 2024 might be a better buy than Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 FE —the new “budget” folding flip phone the company introduced alongside the flagship Flip7 and Fold7. That's because the Flip7 FE is a reskinned Flip6 with a Samsung Exynos processor instead of a Qualcomm chip. We haven't tested the FE yet, but you can probably find a decent deal on the Flip6 that might make it a better value than the Flip7 FE. Performance could even be a smidge better. Oppo Find N5 Flip for $1,264 : You can think of this as the spiritual successor to the OnePlus Open. (Both companies are owned by BBK Electronics.) Sadly, it isn't available in the US, UK, or Europe. It's the world's slimmest book-like foldable at just 3.6 millimeters thick when open. The displays are excellent, it has top-end specs like the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor at its heart, not to mention 80-watt wired charging for speedy top-ups. The cameras aren't as great, though, and Oppo's software is still clunky and buggy. Xiaomi Mix Flip for $899 : Xiaomi’s first flip phone has a lovely design with excellent displays inside and out, long battery life with fast charging, and flagship-level performance, which makes a nice change as flip phones often have middling specs. It also boasts a solid dual-lens camera, opting for telephoto instead of ultrawide alongside the capable main shooter, which is more useful for most folks. The software lets the party down a little; there’s no IP rating, and it is very pricey, but I had fun with this flip phone. — Simon Hill Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

245ce6886632,The Best Smartwatches,"buying guides, shopping, smartwatches, wearables, apple watch, watches, wear os, fitness trackers","Other Smartwatches to Consider The number of smartwatches on the market is staggering. Here are a few other options I like. Tag Heuer Calibre E5 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu TAG Heuer Connected Calibre E5 for $1,900 : I got a chance to try TAG Heuer's new luxury smartwatch for a few days , and it's slick. The Calibre E5 feels like nothing else, with premium materials like sapphire crystal and ceramic bezels; it has a nice heft to it. TAG has switched from Google's Wear OS to its own proprietary operating system (TAG Heuer OS), so you won't be able to access the usual apps on this smartwatch. However, it works with Android or iPhone, routes your notifications through, and can track basic fitness activities. A software update will also bring sleep tracking. We'll be putting it through its paces soon, but if you have other TAG or luxury watches in your collection, you might not mind having one that can also be a little more functional. Apple Watch Series 10 Photograph: Adrienne So Apple Watch Series 10 for $329 : Thanks to watchOS 26 , the 2024 Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has many of the same features as the new Series 11, like hypertension notifications and Sleep Score. It has a thinner and lighter design with a larger screen than prior models, and it even got blood oxygen sensing back via a software update in August 2025 . It's too bad this one still has the 18-hour battery life. Avoid paying anywhere close to MSRP for this watch. If you can find it for under $300, snag it. Google Pixel Watch 3. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixel Watch 3 for $230 : The Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is seeing some steep discounts now that the Pixel Watch 4 is here. It's a great smartwatch, with the caveat that it's not repairable. (The newer model addresses that.) It features loss-of-pulse detection —cleared by the FDA for use in the US—which can be critical in saving someone’s life. Google also focused its fitness updates on running , enabling users to create custom runs and follow AI-powered run recommendations while getting feedback on cardio load—how hard your heart is working and whether it's appropriate for your body. I strongly recommend you go with the 45-mm model, which doesn't even feel that big. It simply delivers better battery life—just about 24 hours with the always-on display or a little more if you have it turned off. Apple Watch Ultra 2. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $799 : The Watch Ultra 2 is still worth considering, just don't pay anywhere near MSRP; otherwise, you may as well buy the new Watch Ultra 3. It can last several days of use, and has many of the same great features as the latest model, including better mics to pick up your voice, an 86-decibel siren to alert your position to anyone nearby, and precise GPS to better track your hikes (plus help you find your way back with the Backtrack feature). The screen can display topographic maps, but you cannot view offline maps without an iPhone. Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 for $650 : The 47-mm Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the company's Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin competitor, and it's a solid first entry into the world of pricey, feature-rich, and powerful smartwatches designed for professional athletes. This is technically the 2025 model, which is identical to the 2024 version but comes with 64 GB of storage and in a new blue color . It lasts a little over two days on a charge because it's a big 47-mm watch and can pack a beefy battery. There's a titanium case and sapphire glass face, plus it's rated to 10 ATM and IP68, so you can submerge it up to 100 meters underwater. The heart rate tracker is remarkably consistent with the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and the dual-band GPS delivers accurate mapping. The software isn't as intuitive, and a few features are lacking when compared to other performance smartwatches, but this is a good start if you're in the world of Android. If you don't care for the blue or the extra storage, you can buy the 2024 model for hundreds less . Samsung Galaxy Watch7. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Watch7 44-mm for $190 : Samsung's Galaxy Watch7 from 2024 is a little plain. This model debuted Samsung's Energy Score and added updated sleep tracking capabilities. You also get FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, though this isn't a feature you'll turn on all the time—it takes two nights to track, and afterward, you'll get a note saying whether or not you show symptoms. This feature, along with the electrocardiogram and irregular heart rhythm notifications, is only available when paired with a Samsung phone . Otherwise, this watch functions well with any other Android . You can choose from two sizes, plus Bluetooth-only or LTE. I tested both sizes and found battery life frustrating compared to its predecessors. With the always-on display, I struggled to hit 24 hours with two tracked activities and sleep tracking overnight. With it turned off, things fared a little better, but I was still barely hitting a full day. You'll have to baby the battery and utilize the power-saving modes. If you don't care for the latest and greatest, you can save a lot of dough with the Watch7. GPR-H1000. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Casio G-Shock Master of G Rangeman GPR-H1000 for $500 : It's not for every event, but the Master of G-Land Rangeman ( GPRH1000RY1A ) looks great on my wrist, and I love that I only need to charge it about once a week. This is a G-Shock first and foremost. It has a durable, thick case and a comfortable strap. It's a big watch. It also has six sensors and a built-in GPS. Connect the watch to your smartphone via Casio's app, and you can get simple notification alerts, heart-rate tracking, activity tracking, and sleep tracking. That's without mentioning other features like blood oxygen monitoring, compass, world time, altimeter, and barometer. I've compared the results to an Apple Watch Series 10, and for the most part, core metrics like heart rate, step tracking, and sleep are similar. I have had some data not show up in the Casio app for a few days, and many of these functions are slow to load on the watch. This would not be my first choice if I wanted a fitness-focused wearable— get a Garmin instead —but I like the ability to look at and track some of these metrics whenever I want. More importantly, I like having a G-Shock around my wrist. Samsung Galaxy Watch FE for $240 : The Galaxy Watch FE is a fine budget Wear OS smartwatch. The 40-mm Galaxy Watch FE has a smaller screen that doesn't get as bright and sports a slower processor and a smaller battery compared to the Watch7 series. The health sensors are almost the same, and I got accurate results with heart rate and sleep tracking. The battery lasts just about a day, if not a little less. OnePlus Watch 2. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu OnePlus Watch 2 for $227 : This is last year's OnePlus smartwatch, but it's still available. It seems like a better value now that the OnePlus 3's price has been jacked up. The 46-mm OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) runs Wear OS and lasts roughly three days on a single charge, a little more if you enable some power-saving settings. The health capabilities are lacking—there's no fall detection or electrocardiogram—but there's sleep tracking, and it's pretty accurate. Some features, like heart-rate tracking, distance traveled, and steps, have mixed accuracy in my testing, which means you shouldn't buy this smartwatch if you're primarily using it for those functions. Also, consider the OnePlus Watch 2R , which you can snag for less cash. The differences are mostly around build quality. The screen doesn’t get as bright, it has an aluminum case instead of stainless steel, and there’s no sapphire crystal protecting the screen, so it’s less durable. However, this makes it lighter and more comfortable to wear. Withings ScanWatch 2. Courtesy of Withings Withings ScanWatch 2 for $370 : The ScanWatch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) can pass for an analog watch. Its health-tracking feature set is comprehensive—you get heart rate monitoring, an electrocardiogram, blood oxygen measurements, and sleep tracking. Battery life is stellar too, as it can last up to 30 days with light use. (Heavier usage will see roughly 22 days before needing a charge.) The main problem is the tiny display on this watch, which is too small to read some notifications. The GPS is also connected, meaning it requires your phone to be tethered and nearby. There's an optional Health+ subscription, but we'd advise against it, as it doesn't offer much utility. The ScanWatch 2 comes in a 42-mm or 38-mm case size and doesn't have the rich features and apps you'll find on the likes of an Apple Watch, but if you want to monitor your health data—and you don't want your watch to look too techy—this will do the job.

6f3abc9b235f,Review: Proton VPN,"reviews, review, vpn, privacy, shopping","On average, Proton dropped about 15 percent of my unprotected speed, but that number needs some context. In a location like Atlanta, Georgia, midday on a Thursday, I experienced a drop of only around 3 percent. In Columbus, Ohio, in the evening on a Friday, that grew to a 25 percent drop. This type of variation is normal. Providers like Surfshark and NordVPN see similar variations and have similar speed drops on average. The difference for Proton is that I’ve yet to stumble upon a real stinker of a server. I’m sure they exist—with some 15,000+ servers, you’re bound to find one at some point—but I haven’t seen them after weeks of use. Windscribe and ExpressVPN are competitive with Proton on average, but they also have some locations where I saw anywhere from a 40 to 60 percent drop in speed. Those results aren’t indicative of the speed overall (you just swap to a different server), but Proton gets you there faster. That edge is likely due to Proton’s VPN Accelerator. I’ll admit, it sounded like nonsense. In the Proton VPN app, you’ll find a toggle for VPN Accelerator, which boldly claims to increase speed by up to 400 percent; not likely. Despite the speedup, I don’t think VPN Accelerator will reach anywhere near that quoted number, at least in the vast majority of cases. Still, there are some advantages, most notably, BBR. Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time, or BBR, is a congestion control algorithm developed by Google that’s been deployed on YouTube and Google itself. Rather than limiting packet transfer when packets are lost, as most congestion control algorithms work, BBR models the network and estimates available bandwidth. It doesn’t need to see lost packets to kick in. Proton’s speeds aren’t entirely attributable to BBR, but I suspect it helps when connecting to servers over long distances. Connecting in the UK, for example, I saw an average speed loss of around 20 percent, which is much closer to my US results than it has any right to be.",https://www.wired.com/review/proton-vpn,Technology,BBC,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e812cf70ea786fe8dfa1c9/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/ProtonVPN-iPhone-2-Credit-Jacob-Roach.jpg",2025-10-10T07:30:00-04:00,6754444180a3c687de1d6c60e4f82de61dca4eb1
3786d09a89d2,Meta Tells Its Metaverse Workers to Use AI to ‘Go 5X Faster’,"meta, mark zuckerberg, artificial intelligence, machine learning, coding, silicon valley","A Meta executive in charge of building the company’s metaverse products told employees that they should be using AI to “go 5X faster” according to an internal message obtained by 404 Media. “Metaverse AI4P: Think 5X, not 5%,” the message, posted by Vishal Shah, Meta’s VP of Metaverse, said (AI4P is AI for Productivity). The idea is that programmers should be using AI to work five times more efficiently than they are currently working—not just using it to go 5 percent more efficiently. “Our goal is simple yet audacious: make Al a habit, not a novelty. This means prioritizing training and adoption for everyone, so that using Al becomes second nature—just like any other tool we rely on,” the message read. “It also means integrating Al into every major codebase and workflow.” Shah added that this doesn’t just apply to engineers. “I want to see PMs, designers, and [cross functional] partners rolling up their sleeves and building prototypes, fixing bugs, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible,” he wrote. “I want to see us go 5X faster by eliminating the frictions that slow us down. And 5X faster to get to how our products feel much more quickly. Imagine a world where anyone can rapidly prototype an idea, and feedback loops are measured in hours—not weeks. That's the future we're building.” Meta’s metaverse products, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg renamed the company to highlight, have been a colossal time sink and money pit , with the company spending tens of billions of dollars developing a product that relatively few people use. Zuckerberg has spoken extensively about how he expects AI agents to write most of Meta’s code within the next 12 to 18 months . The company also recently decided that job candidates would be allowed to use AI as part of their coding tests during job interviews . But Shah’s message highlights a fear that workers have had for quite some time: That bosses are not just expecting to replace workers with AI, they are expecting those who remain to use AI to become far more efficient. The implicit assumption is that the work that skilled humans do without AI simply isn’t good enough. At this point, most tech giants are pushing AI on their workforces. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in July that he expects AI to completely transform how the company works— and lead to job loss . ""In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,"" he said.",https://www.wired.com/story/meta-mark-zuckerberg-ai-push-metaverse,Technology,BBC,Jason Koebler,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e83d5303215037ef400a32/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2206406655.jpg",2025-10-10T11:00:00+00:00,6110b84e97a6a9e5ab99f38c09b27ca49d429ade
eca460110196,Men Are Betting on WNBA Players’ Menstrual Cycles,"sports, playbook, health, gambling, instagram","The “woosh” of a dildo flying past your face. Tribalistic chants . Men making bets on your bodily functions. This isn’t a cult—this is a day in the life of a modern-day WNBA player. That last indignity on the list? It’s a sports betting strategy that’s been getting increasing play over the course of this WNBA season, which is wrapping up as the Las Vegas Aces and Phoenix Mercury face off in the finals. Dozens of dedicated gamblers online are making bets on players’ potential performance based on their “predictions” (or, rather, assumptions) about their menstrual cycles. Some actually call it “ blood money ,” because … of course they do. One prominent figure making and predicting these wagers, who goes by FadeMeBets online, has garnered thousands of likes and shares on Instagram for his menstrual cycle betting strategy. He claims he’s been correct on 11 out of 16 of his period-related predictions, with about 68.75 percent accuracy. “What's kind of good, but also kind of bad, is it brings more people to watch the WNBA, but, on the downside of that, it's usually just all gamblers,” says FadeMeBets, who declined to be named, citing privacy concerns. This WNBA season has been a record-breaker—more fans in the stands, more eyes on the screen, more viral moments. The league announced that attendance passed a historic 2.5 million earlier this summer. Meanwhile, high-profile players like Angel Reese, Paige Bueckers, and Caitlin Clark have added a boost and become household names. The newfound interest in the league has more men watching the sport than women , and the overwhelming rise of sports gambling means some of them are betting on the games—and the players’ periods—which experts warn isn’t just pseudoscientific, but sexist, too. “Not every woman is the same. Yes, there's the traditional 28-day cycle, but everyone's is different, and it varies person to person, month by month,” says Amy West , a sports medicine physician. “Someone being able to predict that? Someone who's not very close to the menstruating person? It’s actually kind of silly.” Methods to the Madness FadeMeBets admits that predicting WNBA player performance based on menstrual cycle assumptions is more art than science. His typical menstrual cycle prediction videos all start with the vaguely menacing phrase: “We’ve got a victim, boys.” (By this, he says the victim is the betting line —the odds set out by sportsbooks that determine a person's payout—not the player herself.) He then shares predictions about whether a specific player is menstruating, ovulating, or in their late luteal phase, which occurs after ovulation and before the period comes. For instance, he said this summer of Clark : “She is on the end of her late luteal phase, meaning a decrease in cardio, decrease in strength, decrease in aerobic system, she’s going to be tired more often than in a normal game.” FadeMeBets told viewers to “bet the under” on Clark that game, projecting that she’d score lower than the number predicted by oddsmakers on sports betting apps, and, in this case, Clark did.",https://www.wired.com/story/men-are-betting-on-wnba-players-menstrual-cycles,Technology,BBC,Molly Longman,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e589da97aa1b12ac994b27/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/culture_wnba_mentrual_betting.jpg",2025-10-10T10:45:00+00:00,5c6429de24caff4b3a38f3ebbf64a666004dcf2b

dcd6471e12e4,Tron: AresWants to Gaslight You About the Future of AI,"movies, tron, sci-fi, music","Ares, named after the Greek god of war, was built to be an AI super-soldier. Then he found out about Frankenstein , started listening to Depeche Mode, and realized the tech bro who made him might be a hack. So he takes matters into his own hands on a quest for freedom from his suicide mission. I wish I were joking, but I’m not. That’s the premise of Tron: Ares . AI bots awakening to the realities of human messiness are a trope almost as old as movies themselves. Even Metropolis ’ metallic maschinenmensch questioned her creators, and that was 1927. In the decades since, most sci-fi involving AI has reinforced the idea that giving computers people-like intelligence ends poorly for people themselves. Skynet takes over . Scarlett Johansson’s disembodied voice never really loved you . I’m sorry, Dave . Tron: Ares’ take is hotter: What if AI-powered machines evolved into benevolent loners? (Be warned: There are spoilers ahead.) Tech CEO Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters), grandson of original Tron villain Ed Dillinger, has created artificially intelligent soldiers (and tanks and such) to secure military contracts. The soldiers are hard to kill, but, as he says, they’re “expendable.” He can just build more. Ares (Jared Leto) leads these bots but after a few days of taking orders from his petulant boss decides to go rogue. There’s just one problem: Dillinger’s droids aren’t perfect. All of his creations fall apart after 29 minutes. What he needs is a MacGuffin called the Permanence Code, which was (surprise!) actually developed by original Tron hero Kevin Flynn forever ago. When Eve Kim (Greta Lee), now the head of Flynn’s old company Encon, finds the code on an old floppy disk, Dillinger sends Ares to retrieve it. But when Ares finds her, all Ares really wants is to keep the code for himself so that he can be a normal dude, not destroy things, and maybe make a friend. Once more, for those unclear on Tron: Ares ’ message: The AI droid, made specifically to win on the battlefield, has gained sentience and gotten a little sentimental. Like all AI creations in sci-fi, Ares wants to be free. But unlike nearly all of them, Ares doesn’t want to end humanity to do it. Maybe he heard Mark Zuckerberg talking about AI filling the gaps in people’s social circles and found his calling. For years sci-fi has been warning that thinking machines will eventually turn on their makers. In 2025, we no longer have to imagine what that technology would look like. Almost anyone can have an AI chatbot in their pocket, and everyone who makes those chatbots is promising they’re going to improve life on Earth, despite the environmental, economic , and mental health issues they raise. But Tron: Ares ’ main takeaway seems to be that fears about AI are unfounded.

320dd080c55f,Trump Wants to Take Over Cities. Influencers Are Giving Him the Fuel to Do It,"department of homeland security, donald trump, social media, politics, influencers, government","The third right-wing influencer Trump was likely referencing as being on the receiving end of alleged antifa attacks was Andy Ngo, another Post Millennial blogger and right-wing influencer, who was also in attendance on Wednesday. Ngo has spent years attending protests across the country filming them and defining the right-wing narrative of antifa as a domestic terrorist threat. Ngo has spent years targeting Mark Bray, a Rutgers historian and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook . Following social media posts from a number of right-wing influencers, including Ngo, Bray is now trying to flee the US after receiving death threats. Samuel Woolley, a researcher who studies digital propaganda at the University of Pittsburgh, believes the blurring of lines between state messaging and influencer content serves a strategic purpose. “Politicians and government officials will use influencers as a means to legitimize either the information they’re spreading or the actions they’re taking,” he says. “Oftentimes, influencers are now used to create the illusion of popularity for particular ideas to manufacture consensus around those ideas.” The feedback loop created by these influencers and leveraged by the Trump administration is exemplified best by Johnson’s own X account. Johnson, a right-wing creator and former Turning Point USA contributor, shared clips of his Portland trip with Noem, including a video of the secretary praying at the start of a meeting and later interrogating someone who was purported to be an immigrant in the back of a government vehicle. From there, those clips are reposted and shared by other right-wing creators and sometimes plastered onto television news . In this case, Johnson was interviewed by Newsmax about his experience in Portland on Wednesday. “Kristi Noem had to walk the premises with body armor men standing beside her, because the left is so violent here. Every time we came or went, left-wing protesters had to be cleared out of the streets,” Johnson said on Newsmax. “They spat on the vehicles.They screamed at us.” These creators were some of the few media figures allowed to tour the Portland ICE facility. On Wednesday, The Oregonian reported that its reporters were denied access to the facility despite multiple conservative news outlets and creators being granted access. The paper first asked for access on September 25. Eight days later Fox News reporter Bill Melugin filmed a report on the facility’s roof. Reporters for the paper tried again on October 6, receiving no answer. Three days before, Daviscourt had toured the building. “They can be used as a conduit for pushing manufactured stories or pushing particular propaganda messaging,” Woolley says of these right-wing creators. “They're incredibly potent.” The Trump administration has created a seamless loop of content inspiring policy and policy inspiring new content as the government performs its own justification in real time. First comes the boots on the ground. Then comes the content.

3186fb5bde7a,Apple Announces $2 Million Bug Bounty Reward for the Most Dangerous Exploits,"apple, encryption, hacks, iphone, cybersecurity, security, bug bounty, ios","Since launching its bug bounty program nearly a decade ago, Apple has always touted notable maximum payouts— $200,000 in 2016 and $1 million in 2019. Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for spyware . The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its extra secure Lockdown Mode as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month. “We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there’s a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to make sure that for the hardest categories, the hardest problems, the things that most closely mirror the kinds of attacks that we see with mercenary spyware—that the researchers who have those skills and abilities and put in that effort and time can get a tremendous reward."" Apple says that there are more than 2.35 billion of its devices active around the world. The company's bug bounty was originally an invite-only program for prominent researchers, but since opening to the public in 2020, Apple says that it has awarded more than $35 million to more than 800 security researchers. Top-dollar payouts are very rare, but Krstić says that the company has made multiple $500,000 payouts in recent years. In addition to higher potential rewards, Apple is also expanding the bug bounty's categories to include certain types of one-click “WebKit” browser infrastructure exploits as well as wireless proximity exploits carried out with any type of radio. And there is even a new offering known as “Target Flags” that puts the concept of capture the flag hacking competitions into real-world testing of Apple's software to help researchers demonstrate the capabilities of their exploits quickly and definitively. Apple's bug bounty is just one of many long-term investments aimed at reducing the prevalence of dangerous vulnerabilities or blocking their exploitation. For example, after more than five years of work, the company announced a security protection last month in the new iPhone 17 lineup that aims to nullify the most frequently exploited class of iOS bugs . Known as Memory Integrity Enforcement, the feature is a big swing aimed at protecting a small minority of the most vulnerable and highly targeted groups around the world—including activists, journalists, and politicians—while also adding defense for all users of new devices. To that end, the company announced on Friday that it will donate a thousand iPhone 17s to rights groups that work with people at risk of facing targeted digital attacks. “You can say, well, that seems like a very large effort to protect only that very small number of users that are being targeted by mercenary spyware, but there is just this incontrovertible track record described by journalists, tech companies, and civil society organizations that these technologies are constantly being abused,” Krstić says. “And we feel a great moral obligation to defend those users. Despite the fact that the vast majority of our users will never be targeted by anything like this, this work that we did will end up increasing protection for everyone.”",https://www.wired.com/story/apple-announces-2-million-bug-bounty-reward,Technology,BBC,Lily Hay Newman,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e70d07ca904606cfb57896/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/sec-apple-bounty-2219281340.jpg",2025-10-10T09:15:00+00:00,eeabf67837279927548f5767008d22e86e117abd

Along with other DPRK researchers, who call themselves a “Misfit” alliance, Barnhart has seen this cluster of workers conducting architectural work and says similar other efforts have been detected. “They will do the CAD renderings, they’ll do the drawings,” he says. “It’s not like a hypothetical—those physical things do exist out there.” Barnhart—who previously found North Korean animators appearing to work on Amazon and Max shows —says that he has also seen potential front companies set up to help run the operations and provide a veneer of legitimacy. The findings raise questions about the quality of the structural work and concerns about safety, if structures are created in the physical world. “In some of our investigations, these plans and these products that they’re making for these remodels and renderings, they’re not getting good reviews,” Barnhart says. “We do have indications that also they’re being hired to do critical infrastructure.” One 24-minute long screen recording seen by WIRED shows how the freelance operation could work. In the video, a person signs up to a freelance work website and sets up a new profile where they write that they are a “licensed structural engineer/architect in the USA.” They pick a profile image from a folder of potentially downloaded files, translate text between English and Korean, and access a Social Security number generator website during the sign-up process. When their account is created, the video shows them start to message online requests for work, with one message saying: “I can provide you [sic] permit drawing plan set for your residential home design within a few days.” Other screen recordings show the workers having conversations with potential clients, and in at least one instance there is a recording of an online call discussing possible work. The Kela researcher, who asked not be named for security reasons, says it appeared some prospective customers returned to the scammers after likely having work completed. The researchers say some kinds of work appeared to be priced from a few hundred dollars up to around $1,000 per job. “This is an opportunistic nation,” DTEX’s Barnhart says. While many companies have started to figure out that North Korea’s IT workers are often applying for remote tech jobs, using false identities, deepfakes on video calls, and local workers to run their operations, they are consistently changing their approaches. Barnhart says it appears that architectural work has been successful for the alleged DPRK workers and that evidence shows the IT workers program can be more subtle than trying to get hired at companies. “They’re moving to places where we're not looking,” Barnhart says. “They're also doing things like call centers. They're doing HR and payroll and accounting. Things that are just remote roles and not necessarily remote hires.”",https://www.wired.com/story/north-korean-scammers-are-doing-architectural-design-now,Technology,BBC,Matt Burgess,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e0061f65075606322b04a6/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/north-korea-scam-architects-sec-2189336788.jpg",2025-10-10T09:00:00+00:00,3c040f787e13d32ff2d4a67e8156300bf34c52a6

Motorola is coming in clutch with a $300 markdown on the 2025 version of the Motorola Razer Ultra (8/10, WIRED Review) bringing the price down to a very reasonable $1,000 . Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) There's a lot to like about the Motorola Razr Ultra beyond its compact and unique design. This model Razr is available in a variety of colors, but at least on my end, the discount is available on the Pantone colors Scarab and Rio Red. They're both immediately striking and elegant, setting them apart from the deep blacks and space grays you're likely to find on other smartphones. Our reviewer Julian Chokkattu was quite happy with the performance improvements to this generation of Razr flip phones. The screen has also been improved from previous generations, with a smoother crease in the middle that's harder to spot, although you can still feel it during use. It's a big 7-inch AMOLED panel with a 165Hz refresh rate, which is great for both regular use and gaming. Of course, the big draw here is the exterior screen, and Motorola has been rolling out new widgets and compatible apps for the smaller display. You can quickly check the weather, control your music, or interact with a variety of functions, as well as taking selfies with the exterior camera. These features are all totally unique to smartphones that flip in the same way, most of which are a lot more expensive. The Razr does have a raft of new AI-enhanced features, whether you want them or not. The only one that really stood out to our reviewer was “Pay Attention” mode, which lets you record a conversation or interview in tent mode with real-time transcription and a summary afterwards. While we think this is the best Motorola smartphone you can currently buy , the less expensive Razr models are discounted as well. The base version is marked down by $100 to just $600 , although the Plus model is just $100 more than that, with a more significant $200 discount .

9f2b27991829,How China Is Hoping to Attract Tech Talent,"uncanny valley podcast, podcasts, china, tech biz","Lauren Goode: What's an example of that? Louise Matsakis: So, for example, there were some Chinese influencers who were spreading these conspiracy theories that Indians were plotting to use the visa to immigrate to China en masse. Lauren Goode: Interesting. You've both covered China's businesses and workforce for years. Was this backlash surprising to you? Zeyi Yang: I would say yes, but also no. The no is because I know China has never been an immigrant country, so the idea to introduce a lot of foreign talents to the country, giving them some kind of preferential treatment over others, it's definitely going to cause some kind of outrage from the population. That part I am sure. The thing is that I feel that after China has been trying to open up to the world for quite a few decades at this point, I was expecting there to be a little bit more patience from the Chinese people because China also wants to be an AI leader at this age. And right now, the only model they can look after is the United States, which has been building on a ton of immigrant talent to build the AI industry. So, I was thinking maybe that kind of policy orientation will push them over the xenophobic obstacles that we are seeing, but unfortunately, the situation that seems to have happened is that it cannot. Lauren Goode: So there are some cultural challenges to this. I mean, what do you think are some of the other challenges that China will face as it tries to roll out this K visa and attract foreign talent? Louise Matsakis: I mean, I think the main thing is just that China, like Zeyi said, is absolutely not a country of immigrants. In 2020, only about 0.1% of the mainland population was made up of foreigners, according to one estimate. And it's also worth noting that that estimate includes people from Taiwan, Macau, and Hong Kong. These are places that are very culturally similar to China. So, the number of people who come from Africa, or North America, or Europe is just astonishingly small compared to the population size of China. In the US, about 15% of the people who live in this country are immigrants. That's a huge difference. So, I think that it can be hard for new arrivals to adjust. It's a difficult language. There's an entirely different ecosystem of apps and programs that you have to use. I remember the first time I went on a business trip to China, I needed to get the receipt for my expenses, and I was like, ""Can you email me a PDF of my receipt?"" And the people at the hotel looked at me like I was crazy. And they were like, ""We're just going to send it over WeChat."" And I was like, ""Oh."" There are a lot of small things like that that are really different, whereas, because for the last few decades, American culture and American tech companies have been so ubiquitous in the rest of the world, someone who comes to the US from India or from Europe, they're probably going to be using the same email platforms, the same social media networks. And a lot of the business norms are similar, right? Of course, there's still cultural differences. And if those people get homesick, they can find an immigrant community wherever they are. They can find food that reminds them of home. That's not necessarily the case in China. And so, I think the idea of a city like Shanghai or Beijing becoming a truly cosmopolitan hub that is a mix of different cultures is something that I think is really far off from now. I think it could happen, and I think it's likely that it will happen as the shifts of global power tilt away from the US. I think in this era where we're not making a lot of good choices, and we're not really making a lot of friends around the world, it's certainly possible, but China is just starting from a really different place than a city like San Francisco.",https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-how-china-is-hoping-to-attract-tech-talent,Technology,BBC,Lauren Goode,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e439ec3af653221caab15e/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Uncanny-Valley-roundup-H1B-Visa-.jpg",2025-10-09T20:39:15.327000+00:00,75de0bfaf3e8f799cf7cedb9ae551524fedfa96c
971f4c01e8e4,The 65 Best Movies on Disney+ Right Now,"movies, disney, tv, movies, and music, marvel, culture guides","In the game known as the streaming wars, Disney+ came out swinging, bringing with it a massive library of movies and TV shows—with new ones being added all the time. Watched everything on Netflix ? Disney+ has a seemingly endless selection of Marvel movies and plenty of Star Wars and Pixar fare too. Problem is, there’s so much stuff that it’s hard to know where to begin. WIRED is here to help. Below are our picks for the best films on Disney+ right now.

Something Wicked This Way Comes When a traveling carnival comes to a small Midwestern town, two best friends—Will Halloway (Vidal Peterson) and Jim Nightshade (Shawn Carson)—suspect that something is not quite right. They soon discover that the carnival’s mysterious boss, Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce), has nefarious plans for the townspeople and enlist the help of Will’s dad (Jason Robards) to help them stop him. Rad Bradbury wrote the screenplay for Something Wicked This Way Comes , based on his own 1962 novel, and the film was a rare foray into dark themes for Disney at the time, but developed a rabid cult following over the years. It’s been incredibly difficult to find for decades, so its arrival on Disney+ has fans rejoicing. Thunderbolts* Though it failed to do Avengers numbers at the box office, leading many to label it a flop, ticket sales don’t always tell the full story—especially when it comes to the MCU. Florence Pugh reprises her role as Yelena Belova, a Black Widow–trained assassin who gets caught up in a sabotage plan concocted by corrupt CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When Yelena and her fellow killers-for-hire realize they’ve been duped into killing each other to clean up de Fontaine’s mess, they instead band together—with the help of Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Yelena’s dad/super soldier Red Guardian (David Harbour) to seek revenge. At this point it’s not really a spoiler to note that the asterisk in the title was meant to denote the placeholder title, as the group is rechristened the “New Avengers.” Sacramento In Sacramento , cowriter-director Michael Angarano stars as Rickey, an emotionally stunted man-child who is not ready to grow up, even as those around him have moved on to find careers, get married, and start families. Glenn (Michael Cera) is one of those old pals, who finds himself unwittingly agreeing to take a road trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento so that Rickey can scatter his recently deceased dad’s ashes. What follows is the stage of male friendship that happens somewhere between Superbad and Sideways , with both men learning something about each other—and themselves—whether they want to or not. Though the film was a hit with critics when it screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, it sadly flew largely under the radar in its brief theatrical run. Jaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story As the original “summer blockbuster,” one might imagine that there are few behind-the-scenes stories fans have yet to hear from Steven Spielberg and Co. about the making of Jaws . But this Nat Geo documentary proves that even the movie’s most diehard fans might still have a thing or two to learn about the film that scared millions of beachgoers away from the water. In celebration of the film’s 50th anniversary, this 90-minute doc features interviews with Spielberg—and many people who have been inspired by the movie over the years—to help you see it in a whole new light. Music by John Williams With all the hoopla surrounding the 50th anniversary of Jaws , now seems like the perfect time to show our appreciation for composer John Williams—without whom, that Steven Spielberg classic (and pretty much any Spielberg classic) would not feel the same. The second-most-nominated person in Oscar history (his 54 nominations are only bested by Walt Disney, who earned 59 nods), Williams has been producing memorable movie scores for nearly 70 years now and has quietly helped to turn movies into cinema. This original documentary gathers up some of the 93-year-old’s closest collaborators, including Spielberg and George Lucas—who swears that “ Star Wars would basically not be Star Wars without Johnny Williams’ music.” It’s a touching, and perhaps long overdue, tribute to a true Hollywood titan. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse In 2018, when Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hit theaters, it changed perceptions of what Spider-Man movies, and animated films, could be. No longer led by Peter Parker, a kid from Queens who gets bit by a radioactive spider, it was fronted by Miles Morales, a kid from Brooklyn who met a similar fate in another part of the multiverse. Across the Spider-Verse continues Miles’ story and his quest to save the multiverse, and his timeline, from a terrible fate. Fun, heartbreaking, and a thrill to watch, it’s one of the best Spider-Man movies ever. The Abyss In many ways, The Abyss is the ultimate James Cameron movie. The idea for it first came to the filmmaker as a teenager, and it features all the storytelling and visual hallmarks of Cameron’s more famous movies. In a way, it’s essentially an underwater version of Aliens : A US submarine has been ambushed and sunk to the bottom of the ocean in the Caribbean. A Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) and two petroleum engineers with a sticky romantic past (Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are sent on a rescue mission, but are racing against the clock as a storm is gathering above the water and Soviet ships attempt to the reach the sunken sub before their American counterparts arrive. As one might expect in a Cameron flick, all is not as straightforward as it seems, and the rescuers encounter what is deemed “non-terrestrial intelligence.” Though originally released in 1989, this new 4K restoration gives new life to Cameron’s underwater sci-fi classic. Elton John: Never Too Late Slowly but surely, filmmaker R. J. Cutler is becoming America's foremost chronicler of celebrity. After covering Billie Eilish , Martha Stewart, and James Belushi, the documentarian has now trained his lens on Elton John. Following the hitmaker as he prepares for his final North American show at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium in 2022, which livestreamed on Disney+, Elton John: Never Too Late jumps back and forth in time, using archival interviews and previously unseen footage to unearth a full picture of the musician's decades-long career. If nothing else, think of it as a companion piece to the 2019 biopic Rocketman . Deadpool & Wolverine The Deadpool movies have always stood out for being proudly anti–superhero movie and boldly R-rated. Even though Deadpool & Wolverine is the first film in the series that’s officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (it only took several years of production delays and one massive studio acquisition to make that happen), it's just as raunchy as the installments that came before. Six years after Ryan Reynolds last graced screens as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool has hit what might be his rock bottom. When he’s given the opportunity to regain the lives and loves he lost in another timeline, he must enlist the help of an extremely disinterested Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to make it happen. Reynolds and Jackman’s onscreen chemistry is electric, making this one (foul-mouthed) team-up you don’t want to miss. Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band Bruce Springsteen came out of the Covid-19 lockdowns revved up and ready to put on one hell of a show. For Road Diary, The Boss gave director Thom Zimny an all-access pass to the creation of the tour he and and the E Street Band have been on since 2024, including archival footage and interviews with the band and Springsteen himself. Zimny has been documenting the rocker’s life on the road for more than two decades now—and won two Emmy Awards for his efforts (for 2001’s Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City and 2018’s Springsteen on Broadway )—making this documentary essential viewing for any fan. Inside Out Don’t cry. But also cry. A lot. Inside Out is the perfect realization of what every Pixar film strives to achieve. On the surface, it’s a comedic look at human emotion, the complexity of a child growing up, and the delicate balance of family life. But by literally getting inside the head of 11-year-old Riley, the film finds a way to bring emotion to life in a way that is at once comedic, profound, and often ingenious. Inside Out 2 Though it’s been 10 years since the release of Pixar’s Oscar-winning Inside Out , this sequel picks up just two years after the original film's ending. Riley, now 13 years old, is officially a teenager—and not quite ready to contend with the various new emotions that come with that phase. Among them: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Fortunately for all of them, not to mention Riley’s parents, Joy (Amy Poehler) is still there to help balance these emotions out. Yet again, Pixar triumphs in making a movie with a message that is also fun for the whole family. The Beach Boys “There’s definitely been ups and downs,” says singer/songwriter Mike Love in The Beach Boys . “We’ve probably been counted out half a dozen times.” Yet more than 60 years after the band’s founding, these California Dreamers have managed to defy audience expectations just as many times—and redefine what pop music can be in the process. Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny codirect this insightful documentary, which features brand-new interviews with Love, the late Brian Wilson, and Al Jardine—not to mention the many artists they have inspired (Lindsey Buckingham, Janelle Monae, Don Was, and Ryan Tedder among them). Fantastic Mr. Fox Wes Anderson assembled an all-star cast and crew for this gorgeous stop-motion animation adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s novel. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) makes a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) that he’ll stop his farm-raiding ways when she reveals that she is pregnant. Years later, the crafty canine is feeling angsty and tempted to return to his criminal pastimes when temptation comes knocking right next door. But Mrs. Fox starts to suspect something is amiss when a bounty of fresh food starts finding its way into their home. Even worse, the local farmers are none too happy about being raided by a pesky fox—and band together to do something about it. Noah Baumbach cowrote the script with Anderson, and the cast includes many of Anderson’s most frequent collaborators, including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. Jim Henson: Idea Man Watching the trailer for Jim Henson: Idea Man , it strikes you: How has there not been an exhaustive documentary about Jim Henson before now? Muppets, The Dark Crystal , Sesame Street —the puppeteer had a hand in all of them. In this documentary, Ron Howard looks at Henson's (tireless) work, his incredible impact, and the legacy he left behind. Let It Be If Peter Jackson’s three-part 2021 docuseries Get Back (which is also on Disney+) left you wanting even more unfiltered access to the Beatles, we’ve got both good news and bad news: Let It Be is the 1970 documentary from which much of the footage seen within that series was taken. On the plus side, the original 16-mm print of the film—which has gone mostly unseen for the past 50 years—has undergone a painstaking restoration, courtesy of Jackson (yet again). While it lacks some of the emotional nuance of the series, as we see less of the sometimes-uncomfortable interactions of a band on the verge of their breaking point, it serves as a wonderful time capsule in which it was created. Feel free to pair the two together for one long binge (and throw in Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing for good measure). Summer of Soul Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson made his directorial debut with this feature documentary, which recounts the groundbreaking Harlem Cultural Festival—a six-week-long celebration of Black culture, including music, history, fashion, and beyond. The film features rarely-seen clips of performers such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Sly & the Family Stone. Why have you never heard of the event? Possibly because it was overshadowed by Woodstock, which took place during the same time in the summer of 1969. Ironically, when the film won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 2022 Academy Awards, it was overshadowed yet again: It’s the award that was being handed out when Will Smith infamously slapped Chris Rock on the stage. (Here’s your chance to rectify missing that acceptance speech.) Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) Were you one of the lucky ones who saw Taylor Swift 's Eras Tour in person? Did you see Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in theaters? Well guess what? You can now also watch it on Disney+! Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) is kind of like the one that played at AMC cinemas, but it's also got four new acoustic songs: “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” “I Can See You,” and “Maroon.” It also features the folklore track “Cardigan.” So, whether you saw the tour, the movie theater experience—or neither—there's now yet another way to take in Taylor. Are you ready for it? X-Men Any property as beloved as X-Men is bound to have more than a few detractors when it makes the leap from page to screen. But the first X-Men movie managed to impress skeptical comic book fans and newcomers to the mutant war with its compelling storyline and stellar cast, which included Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, and then-newcomer Hugh Jackman. The film kicked off the first in an ever-growing franchise of the battle between mutants and humans, which now totals 13 films and more than $6 billion in box office receipts. With X-Men now officially part of Marvel Studios, expect to see lots more of this expanded cast of characters (beginning with the aforementioned Deadpool & Wolverine and 2026’s highly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday ). Until then, though, go back and watch this 2000 classic, and prepare for the future. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny It may be impossible to reach the heights achieved by timeless classics like Temple of Doom or Raiders of the Lost Ark , but this latest installment in the Indiana. Jones franchise puts the whip back in Harrison Ford’s hands, letting him fight Nazis and finally get (maybe) some closure to his artifact-hunting life. The movie, directed by James Mangold, also gets some fantastic humor and verve from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who plays Helena, the daughter of an old ally of Indy’s who has perhaps less-than-pure interest in the Dial of Destiny, an ancient time-travel device that Dr. Jones, of course, thinks belongs in a museum. Spider-Man: Far From Home Far From Home , which stars Tom Holland as the Spandex-wearing superhero, is notable for being the first film in Phase Four of the MCU—and the first time we see an Avenger attempting to pick up the pieces following the events of Avengers: Endgame . For Peter Parker, that means taking a boring old class trip to Europe, which turns into anything but when Earth is attacked by a villainous group of Elementals, which Spidey can only fight with the help of the mysterious—and appropriately named—Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). Mrs. Doubtfire Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a lightly employed voice actor and devoted dad of three who has just been dumped by his wife and is only allowed to see his children one day per week. So he does what any rational person would do: asks his brother, who just happens to be a makeup artist, to dress him up as an older woman and applies to become a nanny working for his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field). That Miranda doesn’t realize the person she has entrusted her children with is the man she was married to for more than a decade might speak more about her character. Ignore the ridiculous setup and instead enjoy more than two hours of Robin Williams going full Robin Williams. Bon appétit! Big Teenager Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes on a Zoltar machine that he could grow up overnight—and comes to find his older self (Tom Hanks) staring him back in the mirror the next morning. In an effort to hide his fast-forwarded body, Baskin hides out in New York City, where he falls backward into his dream job at a toy company and meets the woman of his dreams (Elizabeth Perkins). Big is the movie that made Tom Hanks, well, Tom Hanks (it also marked his first Oscar nomination). But it’s Robert De Niro who was originally set to star; when he was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, Hanks stepped in. Finding Nemo Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a young clown fish with an imperfect fin and a dad (Albert Brooks) who worries endlessly about his son’s safety. Which is forgivable, given that Nemo’s mom—and all his siblings—were victims of a barracuda shortly before their eggs hatched. So when Nemo is captured while the duo are swimming in the Great Barrier Reef, it’s up to Marlin to find and save his only son. With an all-star cast of voice actors—led by the always-perfect Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful blue tang named Dory (who would go on to star in her own adventure)— Finding Nemo is part of the heyday of Pixar filmmaking where each film seemed to surpass the absolutely perfect one that preceded it. The Princess Bride Rob Reiner directs this adventure-comedy-fairytale, written by William Goldman (the legendary screenwriter who once famously said of Hollywood that “nobody knows anything”) from his own novel. The ever-quotable tale tells the story of a young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who is engaged to marry a prince (Chris Sarandon) but is really in love with former farmhand Westley (Carey Elwes), who she believes was killed in a pirate attack. When Buttercup is kidnapped just days ahead of her wedding, a chain of events proceed to possibly reunite the in-love couple, or spell death for one (or both) of them. Goldman was famously critical of his own work, but didn’t mind taking credit for two of his movies. The Princess Bride was one of them ( Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the other). The Little Mermaid Does the live-action version of The Little Mermaid improve upon the beloved 1989 animated classic? Of course not. But Disney is on a tear when it comes to reimagining the movies you loved as a kid, and this is one of the Mouse House’s better efforts. Oscar nominee Rob Marshall ( Chicago , Mary Poppins Returns , Into the Woods ) is behind the camera for this tale of a young mermaid who longs to be (sing it with us) “part of your world.” Yet it’s Halle Bailey, delivering a powerhouse performance as Ariel, who truly makes The Little Mermaid worth watching. The Nightmare Before Christmas Whether you think of Henry Selick’s imaginative stop-motion adventure as a Halloween film or a Christmas movie doesn’t really matter, as there’s never a bad time to add The Nightmare Before Christmas to your watch (or watch-again) list. When the mischief-makers in Halloweentown, including pumpkin king Jack Skellington, discover the magic of Christmas, they decide to kidnap Santa Claus and claim both holidays for themselves. Even in today’s CGI-soaked world, the artistry behind The Nightmare Before Christmas remains painfully impressive—and the macabre yet kid-friendly tone makes it a fun watch for the entire family. There’s also a sing-along version if you’re in the mood. Cinderella In case you don’t know the story: After Cinderella loses her beloved mother, her father marries a nasty woman with two equally nasty daughters. While they spend their days tormenting the kind-hearted Cinderella, Prince Charming, the most eligible bachelor in all the land, only has eyes for her. Seventy-five years after its original release, Cinderella remains a Disney classic for a reason. Now it’s back with an impressive 4K restoration that has been several years in the making. The Incredible Hulk To Marvel fans, Mark Ruffalo is the only Bruce Banner. But that’s only after Eric Bana tried on the supersized superhero’s tiny purple pants in 2003’s Hulk —and then passed them on to Edward Norton for this 2008 flick, which had the misfortune of hitting theaters just one month after Iron Man . The MCU has always had a messy timeline, but audiences shouldn’t be too quick to write this movie off, particularly those looking to kick back with a solid summer popcorn flick. Norton may lack Ruffalo’s effortless charm, but he’s got the Doc Green part of the character down. While the movie has been largely (and wrongly) forgotten, it did get a bump in February when Liv Tyler found her way into (the new) Bruce's arms when she reprised her roles as love interest Betty Ross in Captain America: Brave New World . The Skeleton Dance Fans of classic animation will love every second of the more than two dozen freshly restored old shorts that are part of the Disney+ library. One of the most exciting titles among them is The Skeleton Dance , which revolutionized cartoon culture in 1929. Walt Disney himself wrote, directed, and produced this macabre comedy in which a group of resurrected skeletons rise from their graves and, yep, dance. This is actually much funnier and/or more impressive than it sounds. Stan Lee Easily the most recognizable name in comics, Stan Lee has had an impact on the medium—and on pop culture broadly—that simply can’t be overstated. Director David Gelb’s documentary about “The Man” delves into not only his legacy, but also his history. Tracing the comics maestro’s life from his early years in New York City to his work cocreating iconic characters like Spider-Man and Black Panther to his time as everyone’s favorite Marvel movie cameo, Stan Lee is essential viewing for any fan. Spider-Man While Sam Raimi’s Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man movies predate the official MCU, the famed director really set the stage for what that future universe would look like, with its mix of solid storytelling, genuine laughs, and impressive visuals. Maguire is perfectly cast as the awkwardly charming Peter Parker, who—having just discovered his superhero powers—is learning to harness them. Venom Venom may not have been a hit with critics, but WIRED senior editor Angela Watercutter nailed exactly what the movie was when she called it “a bad movie with great cult-movie potential.” While it rivals Doctor Strange for its stacked cast of serious talent—Tom Hardy in the lead, with Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed costarring, plus Zombieland ’s Reuben Fleischer as director—the end result was, well, a bit of a jumbled mess. Nonetheless, it somehow manages to be compelling, even if you just turn it on to watch Hardy mumble, eat Tater Tots, and almost literally chew scenery for 112 minutes. The Original Star Wars Trilogy Naturally, Star Wars is one of the big attractions on Disney+. And it goes without saying, or at least it should, that the films that comprise the original trilogy are the best of the bunch—and the only Star Wars movies you should watch if you’re opting not to binge all dozen or so features. The caveat for pickier fans is that these are the versions that have been messed with by George Lucas post-release. Some things, like the improved visuals in and around Cloud City, are thoughtful additions, but others are more controversial. The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy More than 20 years after Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope (aka simply Star Wars ) helped to define the Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas returned to the space opera well with an all-new trilogy for an all-new generation of moviegoers. It went about as well as you’d expect. We won’t pretend that The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and/or Revenge of the Sith (2005) have even an ounce of the heart, humor, or heroism of the original films. But they’ve become essential pop culture viewing, and a rite of passage for sci-fi fans, if only to get what all the Jar Jar Binks hate is about. The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy When Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, it was essentially George Lucas handing over the keys to the Millennium Falcon. While fans were rightly skeptical about whether the Mouse House would be able—or even want—to recapture the slightly countercultural environment in which the series was originally created, one hopeful thought united them all: Whatever Disney concocted could not be worse than the Prequel Trilogy. And they were right. By giving the reins to J.J. Abrams ( The Force Awakens ), Rian Johnson ( The Last Jedi ), then Abrams once again ( The Rise of Skywalker ), the series became more of a love letter to the original films and the generations of filmmakers—and fans—they inspired. Happily, actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver proved worthy successors to the smugglers, scavengers, Jedi masters, and Sith Lords who preceded them. Turning Red Mei Lee is a 13-year-old with a problem: Whenever she’s overcome with any sort of overwhelming emotion, which is just about every emotion at that age, she transforms into a giant red panda. Eventually, Mei comes to learn that it’s an inherited family trait. And while there are people who would like to exploit her supernatural powers, she slowly learns that only she has the power to control them. Think of this as a spiritual sequel to 2015’s Inside Out , which explored the complex inner workings of an 11-year-old’s constantly changing emotions. Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing Abbey Road Studios is best known as the place where the Beatles recorded some of their most iconic albums, including 1969’s Abbey Road . But the hallowed halls of this legendary music studio have played a much bigger role in the music industry, as it has hosted the likes of everyone from Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Adele, Oasis, Kate Bush, and Frank Ocean. This documentary, which arrived on the heels of Peter Jackson’s docuseries The Beatles: Get Back (which is also streaming on Disney+ and is highly recommended), is directed by Mary McCartney—daughter of Sir Paul—who practically grew up in the studio and, as such, is able to treat her subject with the reverence it deserves. Avatar James Cameron’s Avatar was all anyone could talk about when it was released in theaters in 2009 and promptly went on to make more than $1 billion, becoming the cinematic iceberg that sank another Cameron epic, 1997’s Titanic , from its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time. For a movie that made so much bank, however, it never occupied a huge space in the cultural conversation about movies. Like so many of Cameron’s works, much of its innovation came from the technology that essentially had to be invented to make it possible. Avatar: The Way of Water One week before Avatar hit theaters (for the first time) in late 2009, James Cameron announced his intention to turn the movie into a full-on franchise. But the director took his sweet time in following through. Avatar: The Way of Water —which checks in on blue lovebirds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), now married with children—was released in late 2022, a full 13 years after the original made its debut. But Cameron smartly bought himself some time by setting the film 16 years after the events of Avatar. And while the critical reviews were mixed, it still ended up becoming the third-highest-grossing movie of all time, proving yet again that Cameron has some sort of Midas touch at the box office. We’ll see if that still holds true when the franchise’s third film, Avatar: Fire and Ash , arrives in December. Iron Man The MCU has released nearly three dozen films since 2008, yet the very first of them— Iron Man —remains one of the best. It’s almost impossible to believe how hard director Jon Favreau had to fight to get Robert Downey Jr. the leading role, as he’s arguably one of the MCU’s most beloved figures. Before there was a whole franchise plus a shared TV universe, Downey, as Tony Stark/Iron Man, was just allowed to do his thing. It was a gamble that paid off for all involved. Lady and the Tramp Sure, you can watch the live-action/CGI version that Disney+ released shortly after it launched, but why bother when the 1955 original is here too? Put aside the rather vulgar stereotypes that were common at the time (the movie now comes with a warning, though it was recently reworded ) and Lady and the Tramp remains one of the most iconic Disney animations, and a love story for the ages. When a spoiled cocker spaniel named Lady finds herself competing with a new baby for the attention of her parents, she ends up getting loose and befriending a mangy but charming mutt named Tramp. Ultimately, Lady needs to choose between the pampered life she’s always known with Jim Dear and Darling, or a life of spaghetti dinner discards with the hopelessly romantic Tramp—unless there’s another way. The Muppet Movie Between The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie , Jim Henson and the Muppets were everywhere in 1979. Their first big-screen outing serves as more of a prequel, as it follows Kermit the Frog’s journey from a swamp in Florida to Hollywood, where he’s headed to pursue his dreams of becoming a movie star. Along the way, we get to witness where and how he meets the fellow members of his felt-made crew, from Fozzie Bear to Miss Piggy. Hijinks ensue when a restaurateur named Doc Hopper doesn’t take too kindly to Kermit turning down his offer to serve as the official legs of his chain’s famous fried frog legs, and follows the frog in order to seek revenge. Luca Enrico Casarosa’s Luca earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature in 2022 for its sweet and soulful story about a young boy named Luca who is hiding a dark secret: He's a sea monster living in a town on the Italian Riviera that absolutely despises his kind. Ultimately, Luca is a moving coming-of-age film about friendship, family, and overcoming our own prejudices—and truly one of Pixar’s best features. Captain Marvel Marvel's biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioning Captain Marvel sooner. The film, set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The film, the first entry in the Marvel universe with a female lead, channels the spirit of the 1990s both in its setting and in style, with heaping spoonfuls of Samuel L. Jackson and all the plot and subtlety of a blockbuster action movie. Larson adds a healthy dose of sarcasm to undercut her character’s immense power, and Jackson is eerily brilliant, making for a super fun 123 minutes. Ant-Man Who doesn’t love a heist movie? Paul Rudd’s MCU debut acted as something of a palate cleanser after the heavy, literally Earth-shattering events of Age of Ultron . Rudd plays Scott Lang, a reformed criminal who teams up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lily) to keep Pym’s shrinking technology from falling into the wrong hands. The film’s depiction of quantum physics wouldn’t hold much water at CERN, but it’s terrific fun—thanks in part to Michael Peña’s star turn as Lang’s former cellmate Luis and, of course, Rudd’s legendary likability. If you want to make it a Rudd-athon, both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania are streaming, too. Avengers: Endgame There's a moment in the event-movie-to-endgame-all-event-movies when you realize that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have gone full Harry Potter and the Cursed Child all over the MCU. Once you get past the rather glum beginning, you can settle in for what you have come to expect from any Avengers movie: Tony Stark cracking wise; Doctor Strange doing weird things with his hands; Professor Hulk explaining the science of what’s going on; and Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass, both emotionally and physically. It's a messy but epic baton-pass in the form of an angsty portal-powered mega-battle. And we're not going to lie: We've watched those audience reaction videos, and they too are a thing of joy. Hamilton If you only know Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical from the obscenely high ticket prices and snippets of the soundtrack, here’s your chance to find out what all the fuss is about. A version of the production, recorded via a six-camera setup over two performances by the original Broadway cast, was put on Disney+ after plans to release it in cinemas were scrapped. Aside from a couple of censored swear words and the fact that it's directed (by Thomas Kail), it's essentially the same show—an energetic, empathetic, witty, quippy hip-hop musical about US founding father Alexander Hamilton. Moana One of the potential answers to “What, oh, what to put on after Frozen and Frozen 2 ?” Moana is in fact better than Frozen . By that we simply mean better soundtrack, better heroine, better visuals, and better side quests. There's also 100 percent more Dwayne Johnson as a tattooed demigod and Jemaine Clement as a giant crab doing a Bowie impression. Set thousands of years ago on the fictional, Polynesia-inspired island of Motunui, Moana's hero's journey is fairly classic, but the sumptuous animation and Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are top-tier Disney. (Sure, we'd love to see Taika Waititi's original script, but we can live without it.) Moana 2 , last year’s less well-received sequel, is now also streaming on Disney+ (as are sing-along versions for both films ). Free Solo If your friend told you they'd decided to solo-climb up the sheer 3,000-foot granite El Capitan wall in Yosemite, California, with no rope, you’d think they had gone mad. But that’s exactly what Alex Honnold set out to do back in 2017. Honnold’s quest to climb the vertical wall was documented by his two director friends, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, as he took on the ascent to become the world’s first person to free-climb El Capitan. But it’s not just about the ascent, it’s also about Honnold’s complicated life, his emotional issues, and all the things that have driven him to pursue one of the most dangerous missions ever attempted by any free climber. The cinematography in Free Solo is also dizzyingly beautiful, and the entire thing will have you gripping the arm of your chair in terror. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an experimental inventor who creates an electromagnetic shrinking machine. Naturally, he accidentally shrinks his own children (if you didn’t already guess that from the title), plus the kids from next door, then unwittingly throws them in the trash. To have any chance of becoming their normal size again, the teeny tots must navigate their way across the family's (now seemingly gigantic) yard and back to the house. It's something fraught with peril when you're half the size of an aspirin. Toy Story (All of Them) While it initially might have seemed as if Pixar could never make anything as good as the original 1995 Toy Story , each of the three subsequent films add depth to the franchise's canon. All of the movies are critically acclaimed—and they're all available on Disney+. When combined, the four films tell a story about growing up and how everything in life, inevitably, changes. Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang go from learning how to deal with new people to understanding loss. It's something that's also followed the cast: In Toy Story 4 , the voice of Mr. Potato Head was created through archive recordings after Don Rickles, as the man behind the voice, died ahead of the film's release. The Lion King Remember the terrifying wildebeest stampede in the 1994 version of The Lion King ? That was actually computer animated, because drawing them by hand would have taken a long, long time. Special attention was taken to blend it into the cel-shaded backgrounds, and this was all before Toy Story came out the following year. Which is all to say that not only is the '90s version a perfect movie that had absolutely zero need for a charm-deficient 2019 remake (which is also streaming on Disney+ in case you want to compare), it’s also the best Lion King to use CG animation. 10 Things I Hate About You Heath Ledger singing “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” on the bleachers. That’s the iconic scene in this top-caliber high school romcom. The plot is taken from The Taming of the Shrew , the cast—including Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt—are all adorable, and the late '90s nostalgia is potent. Offering some much-needed variety from the sci-fi and animation that dominates the Disney+ launch catalog, 10 Things I Hate About You is as good as comfort-food movies get. Tron & Tron: Legacy Tron and its modern sequel, Tron: Legacy , aren't your typical Disney films. The original sees a programmer (Jeff Bridges) become trapped inside a computer system where he meets and befriends programs, including the eponymous hero Tron, who are resisting the power of a growing artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program. It became a sci-fi cult classic, leading to the creation of a modern sequel that continues the story and features an epic score cowritten by Daft Punk. Both are watchable distractions, even if the sequel feels a little thin in places. Willow Another nostalgia fest, this time for fans of '80s fantasy. Willow is a family-friendly, mythic quest that’s best seen as George Lucas and Ron Howard’s fun, $35 million Tolkien fan fiction. The story of a farmer tasked with protecting a magic baby from an evil queen is not exactly the most original story in the world, but that hasn’t stopped this from becoming a classic, with Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood and Val Kilmer waving a sword around. Classic Sunday afternoon fare. Captain America: The Winter Soldier Winter Soldier is among the best Marvel movies. It makes time for quieter character moments, and the action, while still spectacular, feels a little more grounded and real than the CGI-fueled shock and awe of the mainline movies. In this outing, Captain America faces off against a rogue element of SHIELD led by Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. Thor: Ragnarok The first two Thor films were among the worst in the whole series—Chris Hemsworth’s thunder god was dour and charmless. But here, director Taika Waititi injected some much-needed color into the proceedings, borrowing heavily from the Planet Hulk storyline from the comics. Thor finds himself stranded on a bizarre planet, ruled over by Jeff Goldblum (who is pretty much playing himself). There, he crosses paths with Bruce Banner’s Hulk, who has been missing since the events of Civil War . It’s hugely funny, and arguably the best film of the series. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story The newer Star Wars one-off films attract strong opinions, and Rogue One is no different. But while it has its issues, it fills an important hole in the universe and features some of the best action sequences in the entire saga. Its main black mark is the rather iffy CGI recreation of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin, but it's still a fun romp that lacks the narrative baggage of the new trilogy. Black Panther Black Panther had a huge cultural impact. It was refreshingly unusual to see a blockbuster superhero film with such a diverse cast—and the Afrofuturist setting was unlike anything Marvel had ever done before. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, who returns to his father’s home to claim the throne from T’Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman). Black Panther: Wakanda Forever As WIRED senior writer Jason Parham wrote in his review of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever , this movie is haunted by the absence of Chadwick Boseman, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original King T’Challa who died following a battle with colon cancer in 2020. To that end, writer-director Ryan Coogler had to make a much different kind of superhero film, one that addressed the loss of its main character while also pushing Marvel's cinematic storyline forward into its next phase. “It's rare for MCU films to channel the turbulence of grief with such unflinching focus,” Parham wrote. “Coogler has equipped his sequel with a changed vocabulary: It speaks equally from a place of loss as it does triumph. Grief is its mother tongue.” To that end, the director uses the death of T'Challa to usher in a new Black Panther as well as new heroes (Ironheart) and adversaries-turned-allies (Namor). WALL·E Released in 2008, a time when, for many, the climate crisis felt like a distant, abstract threat, WALL·E is classic Pixar. It’s a love story—sort of—that focuses on two robots. But it’s also a story about survival, believing in yourself, and dancing through the vacuum of space propelled by a fire extinguisher. The animation, especially on the desolate, barren Earth, is a sight to behold. The opening scenes of the film are also basically a silent film, with the score and robotic sound effects doing a fantastic job bringing out the emotion and drama of what’s happening. Up Pixar's Up can claim one of the most moving opening scenes of any movie. Despite being released more than a decade ago, in 2009, the animation hasn't aged or lost any of its charm. In a little over 90 minutes, director Pete Docter takes us on the journey of Carl, an old widower who is seeking out Paradise Falls. Carl's trip in his flying house is made in memory of his wife, Ellie, who had always wanted to visit the falls. The film won two Oscars—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score—but was also nominated for three more. These included Best Picture, which at the time made it only the second animated film to have received the nomination (1991’s Beauty and the Beast —which is also streaming on Disney+, and most definitely worth a rewatch—was the first). The Jungle Book Whatever mood you're in, Disney+ has The Jungle Book to suit it. The streaming service has both the 1967 animated classic, with its catchy soundtrack and moments of humor, plus the live-action version released in 2016. The two films couldn't be more different. If you want to go for full family entertainment, pick the original, but if you're after something a little darker, the modern remake is where you should head. (Bonus fact: The entire live-action film was shot in a warehouse.) Guardians of the Galaxy The first volume of Guardians of the Galaxy didn't burst into the MCU until 2014, which is relatively late considering Phase One began with Iron Man in 2008. However, it's become a firm fan favorite, providing some of the Universe's most memorable (and important) characters. Quill, Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Nebula are all distinctive and in many ways more likable than other key MCU characters. Guardians is worth returning to if you want to remember a slightly simpler time before Thanos' Snap.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-movies-disney-plus,Technology,BBC,Jennifer M.

58cfaa9e796a,Apple Took Down These ICE-Tracking Apps. The Developers Aren't Giving Up,"apple, iphone, ios, google, apps, censorship, immigration, department of homeland security, donald trump, politics, crime, national security","Legal experts WIRED spoke with say that the ICE monitoring and documentation apps that Apple has removed from its App Store are clear examples of protected speech under the US Constitution’s First Amendment. “These apps are publishing constitutionally protected speech. They're publishing truthful information about matters of public interest that people obtained just by witnessing public events,” says David Greene, a civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation . This hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from attacking the developers behind these ICE-related apps. When ICEBlock first rose to a top spot in Apple’s App Store in April, the Trump administration responded by threatening to prosecute the developer. “We are looking at him,” Bondi said on Fox News of ICEBlock’s Aaron. “And he better watch out.” Neither the White House nor ICE immediately responded to requests for comment. Digital rights researchers say that the situation illustrates the dangers when key platforms and communication channels are centrally controlled—whether directly by governments or by other powerful entities like big tech companies. Regardless of what is officially available through the Google Play store, Android users can sideload apps of their choosing. But Apple’s ecosystem has always been a walled garden, an approach that the company has long touted for its security advantages, including the ability to screen more heavily for malicious apps. For years, a group of researchers and enthusiasts have tried to create “jailbreaks” for iPhones to essentially hack their own devices as a way around Apple’s closed ecosystem. Recently, though, jailbreaking has become less common. This is partly the result of advances in iPhone security , but partly related to the trend in recent years of attackers exploiting complex chains of vulnerabilities that could potentially be used for jailbreaking for malware instead, particularly mercenary spyware . ""The closed ecosystem motivation sort of dwindled as Apple added capabilities that previously required a jailbreak—like wallpapers, tethering, better notifications, and private mode in Safari,"" says longtime iOS security and jailbreak researcher Will Strafach. “But this situation with ICE apps highlights the issue with Apple being the arbiter and single point of failure.” Stanford’s Pfefferkorn warns that while US tech companies are not state-controlled, they have in her view become “happy handmaidens” when it comes to “repressing free speech and dissent.” “It’s especially disappointing,” Pfefferkorn says, “coming from the company that brought us the Think Different ad campaign, which invoked MLK, Gandhi, and Muhammad Ali—none of whom would likely be big fans of ICE today.”",https://www.wired.com/story/apple-took-down-ice-tracking-apps-their-developers-arent-giving-up,Technology,BBC,Reece Rogers,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e6dd3ce4334bbf90c07d6d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2238880030.jpg",2025-10-09T17:22:32.659000+00:00,8489399d1d74918d156a79f472420e3b440a5e4b
79cc8ce82f8c,You Can Still Shop These 136 Leftover Prime Day Deals,"shopping, deals, amazon prime day","Amazon Prime's Latest Prime Day sale has come and gone. If you are a Prime member who missed out, there's some good news—there are some leftover deals still going strong. We're still keeping you updated here with all the best markdowns on our favorite tech gear and gadgets that are still available, from Alexa-enabled speakers to robot vacs to laptops and tablets. The WIRED Reviews team tests products year-round, and at sales events like this, we only recommend deals on stuff we have actually used and approved. We sorted through thousands of deals by hand to make these picks. Updated October 9, 2025: We've removed deals that are no longer active and updated this list to show ongoing deals. WIRED Featured Deals The Best Fire Tablet Deals The Fire HD 10 is Amazon’s best tablet for most people . The current model dates from 2023, but the Octa Core processor is plenty fast enough for consuming Amazon Prime content, which is really the primary reason to buy a Fire tablet. The full HD (1080p) screen won't win any awards, but it's good enough for streaming movies. Fire tablets can do double duty as an Echo speaker, too. Turn on Show Mode (swipe down on the notification overlay and check the Show Mode box) and you can query Alexa to your heart's content. There are 32 GB and 64 GB models, with a microSD slot on both so you can add up to 1 TB of storage if you need more space. Whichever you choose, spend the $15 more for the version without “special offers,"" which is what we've linked to here. — Scott Gilbertson Best Wi-Fi Router Deal Looking for the best mesh Wi-Fi system ? Look no further. The Wi-Fi 7 Netgear Orbi 770 Series is my current pick for most households. This tri-band mesh (2.4-, 5-, and 6-GHz) is simple to set up and use, delivers stable and speedy internet connectivity, and boasts expansive coverage. The stylish tower design is fairly unobtrusive, while the internal antennas ensure every corner of your home can get online. You also get the key benefits of Wi-Fi 7 , including MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to enable Wi-Fi 7 devices to connect on multiple bands simultaneously. Basic security is built in, but you do have to subscribe for enhanced security and parental controls, if you want them. — Simon Hill Best Storage Deal Photograph: Western Digital Western Digital Elements Desktop Hard Drive (14 TB) This isn't the sexiest hard drive around, but for incremental backups, which we recommend , speed isn't a factor. That's why I recommend this Western Digital Elements hard drive. These drives are big and require external power, but they're some of the cheapest, most reliable drives I've used. I have been using a variation of the Elements desktop hard drive to make incremental backups of my data for more than a decade. Transfer speeds are not off the charts—the Elements drive I tested scored 120 megabytes per second (MB/s) for sequential writes on Windows—but again, you should ideally be running backups overnight anyway, and even at these speeds the average PC backup will be done by morning. These drives use USB-C with support for USB 3, and I've had no problem using them with Windows, macOS, and Linux. —Scott Gilbertson Other Great Storage Deals Best Amazon Echo Deal Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen) My favorite Echo Show device is on sale for Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days, and it’s one of the devices you can actually enjoy Alexa+ on (if you’ve gotten early access, that is). It’s a Goldilocks device: not too small to actually use the screen, but also not so large that it’s too hard to place on a kitchen counter or similar space around your home. It’s one of my all-time favorite Alexa speakers and smart displays for a reason. I use it for everything, from asking for recipe replacements while I cook to playing the K-Pop Demon Hunters soundtrack again for my son. There’s a new version coming later this month, but it certainly won’t be on sale for this cheap anytime soon. — Nena Farrell Echo Pop for $25 ($15 off) : This is Amazon’s cheapest speaker, and it’s certainly not bad for the price. You’ll get much better sound spending a little more on the Echo Dot, though, or a fun half-screen on the Echo Spot. Echo Dot (5th Gen) for $35 ($15 off) : This is my favorite budget smart speaker, and while on sale it’s a crazy good deal. It’s got impressive sound and Alexa support in a tiny form factor. Echo Spot (2nd Gen) for $45 ($35 off) : I love this little partial display. There’s no camera and you can customize the clockface, making it a fun bedside clock option. Best Charging Deal Belkin 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad Belkin’s latest wireless charger supporting the new Qi2 charging standard is already down to its lowest price ever. It dropped from $80 to just $40 for Prime Day. As the name lets on, this is a 2-in-1 charger that has a 15W Qi2 pad for your phone, alongside a smaller 5W zone for AirPods. My favorite addition is the spare USB-C port, though. You get a spare 5W port to plug in another device to charge, which is still necessary for most people—not all our favorite gadgets are pushing power through magnets just yet. — Jacob Roach Best Portable Power Station Deal The best portable power stations offer the freedom to go off-grid and keep your gadgets powered, and the Solix C1000 is my pick for happy campers. It has two molded handles for easy carrying, weighs just shy of 30 pounds, and sports a handy LED bar on the front with three brightness levels. It boasts a 1,056-watt-hour capacity, can fast charge smartphones, and has no trouble with small appliances. I used this power station to work on my PC when my house was being rewired recently, and a full charge got me through the workday. It can also serve as an uninterruptible power supply with a 20-millisecond delay. —Simon Hill More Portable Power Station Deals Best Streaming Gear Deal I love the Elgato Stream Deck Mini because it’s one of those products that is what you make of it. It’s an enabler. Instead of telling you what it does, a Stream Deck asks what you want it to do, and it does a damn good job of that . Use it to speed up creative workloads, or maybe to have media controls within arm’s reach. Bind complex Excel functions to a button or swap between apps without a second thought. There are massive Stream Decks available for productivity power users, but this Prime Day, you can pick up the six-button Stream Deck Mini for just $50. — Jacob Roach More Streaming Gear Deals The Best Camera Deal Photograph: Scott Gilbertson Photograph: Scott Gilbertson Photograph: Scott Gilbertson Photograph: Scott Gilbertson The Hero 13 Black is our favorite GoPro. The new interchangeable lens system offers many more shooting options than any other action camera we've tested. In addition to the standard wide-angle action camera lens, you can also invest in an Ultra Wide ($100) , Macro ($120) , and Anamorphic ($120) lens. All of these are automatically detected by the Hero 13 the minute you attach them. The camera will automatically adjust settings accordingly, which is a very slick feature that makes switching lenses on the fly simple and smooth. Read our full GoPro Hero 13 review for more details on how the lens system works and why we love it. — Scott Gilbertson GoPro Hero 13 Black Ultra Wide Edition for $330 ($150 off) : This bundle comes with both the standard and ultrawide lens mod, which ups the FOV to 177 degrees, capturing even more of the action. Panasonic LUMIX S5II Mirrorless Camera for $1,798 ($501 off) : Our favorite mirrorless video camera is on sale. The 24-megapixel sensor is great for stills, but the S5 II has a ton of video-focused features we love, including support for V-Log recording, Real Time LUTs, anamorphic 4K, video recording to SSD, and more. DJI Osmo Action 4 Combo for $229 ($70 off) : The Action 4 has been superseded by the Action 5, but if you're on a budget, this is an awesome camera, and it integrates well into the DJI ecosystem. Insta360 X5 360 Camera for $500 ($50 off) : This is the best 360 camera to use while you travel , but you’ll have to crop the 8K video for rectangular video formats if that’s your style. Best MacBook Deal Photograph: Brenda Stolyar Apple MacBook Air (M4, 2025) I’ve been recommending the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) all year, and I’m not about to stop. It’s simply the best laptop you can buy, especially for the price. Unlike MacBooks of the past, the MacBook Air is actually a great deal, especially now that it comes with 16 GB of RAM. It’s such an incredibly balanced laptop—both thin and surprisingly powerful, without any major compromises, whether that’s the display, the webcam, the speakers, or the keyboard. The MacBook Air has it all. Because of how powerful and long-lasting the MacBook Air is, most people simply don’t need anything like the MacBook Pro. —Luke Larsen More MacBook Deals Best Laptop Deal Photograph: Brenda Stolyar Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition, 2024) I test new laptops almost every week, but I keep coming back to the Surface Laptop 7th Edition . It’s a fantastic MacBook alternative in its own right, both sleek and designerly. Though it launched last year, it uses the Snapdragon X Elite chip, providing fantastic performance and battery life. But it’s the 120-Hz screen with its unique 3:2 aspect ratio panel that always draws me to it, which gives you more vertical height than the average laptop has. It will likely be many more months before Qualcomm’s next-gen Snapdragon X2 chips come out, so the Surface Laptop 7th Edition is still safe to buy. Just don’t confuse this with the newer, cheaper Surface Laptop 13 , which lacks many of the things I appreciate most about the larger, 13.8-inch model. — Luke Larsen Best Office Chair Deal Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Branch Ergonomic Chair Pro Branch’s Ergonomic Chair Pro is our top office chair recommendation for most people. It strikes the best balance between comfort, adjustability, design, and price. Seriously, I have tested dozens and dozens of chairs and have yet to come across an office chair under $500 that matches Branch’s quality. You can adjust the seat depth, lock the recline, and there’s even a seat tilt if you want a more active sitting position. The lumbar support is height-adjustable, and you can push it in or out. The standard version is a comfortable mesh fabric, but you can opt for vegan leather or real leather. — Julian Chokkattu Standing Desk Deals Best Keyboard & Mouse Deal Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Logitech MX Master 3S For Mac The MX Master 3S is one of the most iconic mice in the world—and for good reason. While it’s true that the long-awaited MX Master 4 has just come out, we still advise saving some cash on the MX Master 3S while you can, especially since there is a Mac-specific version if that floats your boat. The MX Master 3S is a do-it-all office mouse that manages to have great ergonomic support, performance, and features all in one. That also meant that it was historically quite expensive for a mouse, which is why picking it up on discount is such a good idea. The MX Master 4 looks flashier, but when it comes to bang for your buck, the MX Master 3S is still the gold standard. —Luke Larsen More Keyboard & Mice Deals Best Monitor Deal Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED Monitor (S3225QC) A Prime Day price of $680 feels ridiculous for how much monitor you’re getting with the Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED . It’s still one of the few OLED monitors that isn’t aimed at gamers, making it a fantastic option for video editors and content creators. It can shoot up to over 1,000 nits of peak brightness in HDR, which should help democratize HDR video editing. Thanks to its strong audio and excellent image quality, it’s just as good for gaming and entertainment, bringing scenes to life in glorious depth of color and contrast. There is, simply, nothing else like it out there right now. —Luke Larsen Best Android Phone Deals Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The best unlocked phone you can buy—one that manages to offer all the top features you need for a palatable price—is the Google Pixel 9a . This crazy $150 discount makes it an absolute must-have, either as your new smartphone, a device for your parents, or a second phone to have around. Performance is excellent thanks to the use of the flagship Tensor G4 chip, and the dual-camera system is very reliable. You get tons of smart software features , including some of the best call-screening technology in the business, along with wireless charging, an IP68 rating, and seven years of software support. — Julian Chokkattu Best Software Deal McAfee Total Protection Unlimited If you need a little extra protection for your devices, you can pick up McAfee Total Protection at a steep discount this Prime Day. How steep? Eighty-three percent off for a year, and with protection for unlimited devices. McAfee Total Protection includes the expected antivirus, of course, but more importantly, it comes with scam protection for your phone, a password manager , and even identity theft monitoring. — Jacob Roach More Software Deals Best Indoor Security Camera Deal Crisp video, local storage, and accurate AI to detect subjects: What more do you want in a security camera? The TP-Link Tapo C120 tops our best indoor security cameras guide for a host of reasons. The video resolution goes up to 2K, and this camera supports color night vision. It can tell the difference between people, pets, and vehicles. There’s also two-way audio support and a siren function for scaring intruders away. The C120 has a slot for up to 512-GB microSD cards, so there’s no need to subscribe or send video to the cloud. It’s a shame the frame rate maxes out at 20 and you need the Tapo Care subscription to get snapshots in your notifications, but even at its regular price, this camera is a bargain. —Simon Hill More Indoor Security Camera Deals Best Outdoor Security Camera Deal Snag the Arlo Pro 5S if you want top-notch video quality, the best notifications in the business, and wide smart-home support. This clever device is the best outdoor security camera on the market right now, and also offers color night vision, a spotlight and siren, and a slick app that’s swift to load the live feed. The AI detection can accurately determine when a person, animal, vehicle, or package is in frame, and alerts come through to your phone reliably wherever you are. There’s also clear and relatively lag-free two-way audio. The catch is that you need a subscription, starting at $5 per month for a single camera, to unlock all the best features. —Simon Hill More Outdoor Security Camera Deals Best Smart Lock Deal U-Tec Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro Ultraloq makes a ton of different smart locks, and the on-sale U-Bolt Pro is just one of many that we’ve tested . It can be a little confusing to navigate the lineup, and while we didn’t have great experiences with the Fingerprint with HomeKit and Matter models, the Pro (and regular Fingerprint) smart lock worked well in WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu’s home. This lock is easy to install, has built-in Wi-Fi and a fingerprint sensor, and uses four AA batteries that Julian found last about two months. There’s a hidden keyhole to use as a backup, plus a charging port (unfortunately a Micro USB port, rather than the more popular USB-C). The lock works with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT. — Nena Farrell Photograph: Medea Giordano Netvue Birdfy Plastic Smart Bird Feeder There is no shortage of smart feeders on the market, but this is our top pick in our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders for its reliability and easy-to-use app. It consistently captures 1080p photos and video—though only on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi—and the 1.5 L seed compartment is easy to fill. Note, however, that this price is for the version that does not come with a solar panel, so you will have to bring it inside to charge, nor does it come with a lifetime subscription, so the app will cost $4 a month if you want full functionality, such as AI identification. But your recipient will still be able to see birds without it. — Kat Merck More Smart Bird Feeder Deals Best Pet Feeder and Camera Deal Photograph: Molly Higgins Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder I’ve tested a dozen automatic pet feeders , and the Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder has remained my top pick after all this time. You can control it near or far via an app, where you adjust feeding schedules and feed on demand. It has a 1080p HD camera with night vision and two-way audio so you can watch, hear, and talk to your pet even when far away. The app is easy to use with extremely customizable feeding plans with meals that you label individually. For just over $100, this camera-feeder combo is well worth the money for the peace of mind it provides. — Molly Higgins Best Automatic Litter Box Deal I’m currently testing this automatic litter box ; it’s Petkit’s newest model, and so far, I’m impressed. It’s an improvement on older models, with an even bigger opening (great for my chonky cats), a camera tucked inside, and extra deodorizing sprays so things always stay fresh. The HD AI-powered camera has an extra wide 210 degree viewing angle to see everything inside the box, and IR night vision. The AI camera recognizes your cat and logs usage, has stool footage to review, and monitors changes over time, alerting if anything is amiss. With the connected app you can review footage and usage. Plus, this model has a semi-automatic bag sealing design, making emptying dirty litter easier than ever. At 30 percent off, it's the biggest discount on this brand new model we've seen this year. — Molly Higgins More Automatic Litter Box Deals Best Electric Transportation Deal Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Last year’s Apollo Go electric scooter triangulates a number of specs—it is not the lightest, nor the fastest, scooter you will ever try, but it combines decent speed with decent range at a weight that is not backbreaking to carry. Editor Julian Chokkattu really likes how you’re able to customize your gearing in the app, so if you only want to ever go 15 mph instead of maxing it out at 28 mph, you can just set it in the app and go. It also has a ton of nice commuter extras, like a bell, excellent turn signals, LED lighting for visibility, a headlight, and a dot display that is super visible in broad daylight. —Adrienne So More Electric Transportation Deals Segway Max G3 for $1,100 ($200 off) : The standout feature of the Max G3 is its amazing 3.5-hour charge time; if you have to get somewhere and forget to plug it in, you never have to worry about waiting for it to charge overnight to take off. Segway ZT3 for $850 ($150 off) : This off-road scooter has impressive suspension and big 11-inch tires to handle any pothole that you might find.Best TV and Streaming Deals The TCL QM8K is one of the best LED TVs we’ve tested all year, and it’s on a very hot sale for Prime Day. This TV starts things off with blazing (and we mean eye-blinding) brightness, matched by rich black levels with very little light bleed. That leads to incredible contrast, which makes its vivid yet natural colors all the more impressive. You’re also getting great gaming features like VRR at up to 165-Hz, a stylish design, and an intuitive Google TV interface to run the show. This is premium performance at about half the price of many competitors, making for a great way to raise your TV game on a budget. —Ryan Waniata More TV and Streaming Deals Best Soundbar and Speaker Deal Yamaha’s SR-C30A is the quintessential sub and soundbar combo. It’s easy to use and sounds great, and its svelte design easily fits below most TVs. It’s got multiple inputs, including HDMI eARC for seamless TV connection, and even an aux port for legacy devices like a turntable . You won’t get Wi-Fi in the package, but it supports Bluetooth for simplified streaming. The sound quality is a major improvement over virtually every TV we’ve tested , and the compact subwoofer provides some cinematic boom to go with clear effects and dialog up top. This system regularly sells for $300, making this a solid sale that’s worth grabbing for anyone looking to upgrade their TV audio with one of the best soundbars around. —Ryan Waniata More Soundbar and Speaker Deals Bluetooth Speaker Deals We have been big fans of JBL’s Bluetooth speaker models for many generations, but the JBL Flip 7 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite model yet. It is a truly life-proof speaker, with IP68 dust and water resistance and an excellent drop-tested case. We love the simple, tube-shaped design and the included loop that makes it very easy to pick up and take with you or hang from a pack. Sound wise, it is clear, punchy, and surprisingly full, with 14 hours of playback that can last all day. It also features Auracast, which allows it to pair up other new JBL models. —Parker Hall More Bluetooth Speaker Deals Earbud Deals Photograph: Julian Chokkattu If you want high-end earbuds but don’t want to pay full price, now is a great time to snag the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Reviews) . These adorable little headphones are perfect for smaller ears thanks to their button-like design, and they feature all the bells and whistles you’d associate with more expensive models like the Apple AirPods Pro 3. These integrate with Google’s Gemini AI and various other Google products (like Translate, which works extremely well for bi-lingual conversations), to provide some of the widest range of features I’ve seen in a pair of buds. Soundwise, they’re nice and clean, with the included noise canceling not quite keeping up with Apple’s brand new buds, but holding its own for nearly $100 cheaper. —Parker Hall More Earbud Deals Over-Ear Headphone Deals Looking for the best pair of over-ear headphones on sale this Prime Day? There is a good chance you’re looking for Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra (9/10, WIRED Reviews) . These headphones offer some of the finest noise cancelling we have ever heard, alongside clear and sensitive sound with a bold low end. We love the snazzy onboard controls and the extremely comfortable fit, which makes these the perfect pair to take with you on trips or when you have to go into the office. —Parker Hall More Over-Ear Headphone Deals This comes with the big caveat that this tracker is getting pretty long in the tooth. Google is integrating almost all of Fitbit’s health features into its Pixel Watch series , so I’m not sure if or when Fitbit’s flagship line will be updated. With that said, this is absolutely the price you should be paying for a basic fitness tracker that you just want to track your sleep and your steps, have a ton of useful Google integrations like navigation with Google Maps, and work with both iOS and Android. It’s attractive, durable, and you get to use Fitbit’s premium app and health features. Who knows what will happen next year, but for now, the Charge 6 is still a win. — Adrienne So More Fitness Tracker Deals Best Outdoor Deal LifeStraw Personal Water Filter Lifestraw's personal water filter is a long time favorite of WIRED readers. It's extremely small, cheap, and light, and it works. It earned a spot in our guide to the best backpacking water filters . The main problem with the Lifestraw is that you have to use the force of your sucking to get the water through the filter, which is not for everyone. You also can’t use it to filter water for cooking. If you need something more, check out the Lifestraw Go , which is also on sale. —Scott Gilbertson Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Photograph: Matthew Korfhage The Typhur Dome 2 looks like the future, and kinda cooks like it. For more than a decade, the best air fryers all looked pretty much the same: They looked like the first basket air fryer from Philips. This bulbous Typhur is built differently, to maximize cooking surface and air flow across a large cooking plate. The temperature and fan control are precise but variable. And it heats from both top and the bottom heating elements. The result? It’ll crisp two dozen wings in 14 minutes, or even bake a frozen pizza and get an actual crisp crust. A griddle function will legitimately brown meats. A self-clean function also means it won’t stink up your house if you use it for bacon. It’s usually listed at a price to match its performance—but currently it’s on sale for a hell of a deal. — Matthew Korfhage More Kitchen Appliance Deals Best Kitchen Gadget Deal Crock-Pot 7-Quart Oval Manual Slower Cooker Soup season is fast approaching. This buy-it-for-life Crock-Pot slow cooker has the perfect capacity for most families, with simple controls and the classic stay-warm technology that makes the whole house smell good (and makes cooking much easier). The lid and stoneware insert are both dishwasher-safe. — Louryn Strampe More Kitchen Gadget Deals Best Kitchen Pan Deal The deal on my favorite kitchen pan has expired, but you can get it in two sizes—plus two sizes of the Perfect Pot, two lids, four spatulas, and a steamer basket—for a discount right now. I'm still testing the Perfect Pot, but I like it so far. And the Always Pan is the best pan I've ever used. The mini size is great for breakfast sandwiches or reheating small amounts of leftovers, and the full-size version is great for literally everything else. If your pots and pans need an upgrade, this set is worth getting. And that's before I tell you about all the fun colors and optional accessories ! — Louryn Strampe Best Coffee, Espresso, and Grinder Deals Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier Series Espresso Machine Look, we didn’t expect a real espresso contender from Ninja on their first go. But this beginner-friendly semi-automatic machine—with a built-in conical burr grinder that grinds by weight—was the pleasant surprise of last year. The Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier impressed WIRED reviewer Tyler Shane not just for its value, but also for the shockingly good automatic milk steaming, the auto-tamping on the portafilter, and the built-in scale. It’s not perfect: The cold brew and drip coffee functions are merely “fine.” But this is the lowest price we’ve ever seen this machine. And it’s a great gift for the espresso beginner in your life, even if that’s you. —Matthew Korfhage More Coffee and Espresso Deals Coffee Grinder Deals Best Robot Vacuum Deal This robot vacuum from Dreame is one of our favorites for its range of features, but it's especially our best robot vacuum for pets. Why? It pings you to re-clean particularly dirty spots, like right in front of the litter box or in front of the dog's dog bed. The software is really impressive. It also has double roll brushes to reduce tangling, plus side arms to edge-clean more effectively, in addition to the usual large-capacity docking station with clean and dirty water tanks, self-emptying bag, and hot-water mop washing. — Adrienne So More Robot Vacuum Deals Eufy E20 3-in-1 Vacuum for $300 ($350 off) : This 3-in-1 vacuum (stick, handheld, and robot) is a compact, adorable cleaning solution for small spaces (the dustbin is half the size of other dustbins). Ecovacs Deebot X11 Omnicyclone for $1,260 ($240 off) : I just tested this vacuum, which launched at IFA 2025 ! The standout feature is a bagless, clogless disposal system which, as someone who has spent many a night unclogging a tube with a chopstick, I very much appreciated. Yeedi C12 Combination Robot Vacuum for $380 ($220 off) : Why limit yourself to a robot vac, stick vac, or hand vac when you could have all three in one handy station? You'd get your money's worth even at the original price, making this sale one you can't miss. Best Cordless Vacuum Deal The Dyson V15 Detect is our current favorite Dyson vacuum , and one of our favorite stick vacuums to boot. It's an all-around great stick vacuum with Dyson’s power, a range of attachments, and a trigger-style power button. The Plus version is on sale right now, which has a slightly different set of attachments and is otherwise the same vacuum. I like the trigger button for things like cleaning stairs, but it can be a little annoying to use in larger rooms. With the attachments you’ll get a crevice tool, a dusting brush, a hair screw tool, and two cleaner heads, which include the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that shoots out a green laser, making it easy to find all the debris hiding on hard surfaces. You’ll get all this for a pretty reasonable price usually, but we especially love to see this vacuum on sale, like it is right now. —Nena Farrell More Cordless Vacuum Deals Best Fan, Heater, and Air Conditioner Deal Dyson Purifier Hot + Cool HP10 Look, it’s a space heater! An air purifier! A fan! It’s Dyson’s Hot+Cool HP10, the most “sophisticated home atmospheric management tool” WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage tested for his guide to the Best Space Heaters . (Well, technically, that was the smart-version HP7 , but this is the same thing minus the app.) Featuring Dyson’s classic ellipse, this version is not smart, but it does have a remote that sticks magnetically to the body, as well as oscillation up to 350 degrees and a fully enclosed HEPA system. Keep in mind that even though the sale price is still a bit steep, it’s still less expensive than buying a separate heater, fan, and air purifier—and it’s easier to store. —Kat Merck Best Air Purifier Deal WIRED’s air quality expert, contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro, considers this True HEPA Coway to be the best bang for your buck when it comes to air purifiers , and I agree—I’ve had one in my kitchen for over three years now. I like the slim profile (less than 10 inches), which makes it easy to site, and the fact that it can effectively exchange the air in a 361-square-foot room (the size of a small bedroom or office) the recommended 4.8 times per hour. It’s already a fine deal at its MSRP of $240, but sales like Prime Day and Black Friday are typically the only times to snag one for under $200. —Kat Merck Best Sheets and Mattress Deals Brooklinen Luxe Sateen Core Sheet Set Brooklinen’s sateen sheets are already our favorite cotton sateen sheets you can find on Amazon , and those great sheets are on sale for Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days, along with the rest of Brooklinen’s Amazon storefront (clip the 20% off coupon). These sheets use long-staple cotton to add extra softness, and sateen’s three-over-one weave style is already loved for being a silky-soft bedsheet. These sheets are Oeko-Tex certified, too, meaning they’re free from harmful chemicals (but not fully organic). I also love that there are tags that say which side is long and short, which is a relief to find whenever I’m making the bed. —Nena Farrell Best White Noise Machine Deals Snooz Smart White Noise Sound Machine I've tested a lot of white noise machines, but Snooz remains one of the best in my book. The materials feel substantial and of high quality, and the simplicity of the design epitomizes the “set it and forget it” concept. Since an internal fan creates the noise, it is a gentler white noise than what I sometimes hear on other machines. — Julia Forbes More White Noise Machine Deals Best Grooming Deal Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Philips Norelco Multigroom 7000, MG7790 This Philips Norelco is already a champion of versatility matched with low cost—a Swiss army knife of beard, head, burns, and eyebrow guards with a nose trimmer to boot. The trimmer is high-rpm, but still quiet. The guardless blade shaves closer than most, and the shaving foil is even better. The battery lasts more than five hours. Its metal chassis offers comforting durability and heft. And unlike Philips’ 9000 series, it can trim while plugged into the wall. The only real drawback is all those guards are difficult to sort and keep track of. Anyway, it’s on a good sale from its already excellent price. —Matthew Korfhage Best Apparel Deal Champion Reverse Weave Sweatshirt The best hoodie you can buy on Amazon gets a steep price cut for Prime Day. Champion’s iconic reverse-weave hoodie is the father of the format, and still holds its own in a world where every brand makes its own version. The fabric is sturdy but stretchy and ages gracefully over many wash cycles. — Martin Cizmar Best Video Game Deal The Razer Huntsman Mini is an adorable 60-percent keyboard . It’s similar to a full-size keyboard, but it’s missing the arrow keys and number pad—so you’ll get only what you really need. If you’re on the hunt for a slightly smaller keyboard than full-size, this one is worth looking into. The keys are responsive and satisfyingly clicky, and the footprint will take up less space on your desk. Like all the best computer peripherals, you can customize the RGB lights and even add on Razer keycap kits . — Louryn Strampe Best Board Game Deal Tactile and tactical tile-based fun as you compete to craft patterns and match tiles to maximize your score at the end of each round. These ceramic tiles are inspired by the Alhambra palace in southern Spain, and the Portuguese king has employed you as a tile-laying artist to embellish the walls of his Royal Palace of Evora. One of the best family board games , Azul is beautiful, easy to grasp, and has wide appeal, but supports layers of strategy that boost the replay value. —Simon Hill Best Baby and Parenting Deal While I’m more of a radio-based baby monitor type of person, the Nanit Pro has easily remained my favorite Wi-Fi-based baby monitor. It’s got it all: easy setup! Lots of monitor base options (including a massive floor stand)! An intuitive app! The only thing it doesn’t have is its own parent unit, but instead, your phone becomes the parent unit, with options to get alerts from the app or even have your phone constantly stream the audio from your baby’s room to listen for waking up and rustling around. The Nanit Pro’s 1080p camera makes it easy to keep an eye on your baby whether you’re home or away, as long as you’ve got access to the app. The app also provides a ton of data, like which spot of the crib your baby slept in the most and how often there were wake-ups and visits from mom and dad. There are some subscription levels to get the best data, and even accessories you can add on to track breathing and your baby’s size, but you can still get the best of what Nanit has to offer—a super streamlined baby monitor experience—without the extras. Snag it on sale now, it’s worth it. —Nena Farrell Frequently Asked Prime Day Questions AccordionItemContainerButton Amazon Prime Day is a sale for members of the online retailer's shopping program—most people sign up to get free shipping, but you also get lots of other perks like Thursday Night NFL football (mostly divisional matchups though Vikings-Chargers in two weeks is interesting). Prime Day includes tens of thousands of deals only available to Prime members, not including $1.50 hot dogs (a Costco membership is required for that). Is Prime Big Deal Days Different? AccordionItemContainerButton Not really. Prime Day is in July and—following what we can only imagine are heated debates inside a Seattle conference room overlooking the Puget Sound, with the smell of fresh Starbucks percolating in the hall as master marketers respectfully exchange divergent philosophies—only in July.

11037fd59e26,Europe Pledges $600 Million for Clean Energy Projects in Africa,"science, environment, africa, energy, renewable energy, china, electricity","“From the outset, the Global Gateway has been described as the European Union’s attempt to rival the Belt and Road Initiative’s overseas infrastructure investment funds. At €300 billion through 2027, however, it is a David-versus-Goliath-style undertaking,” says Gabriele Rosana, an associate fellow at the Institute of International Affairs in Rome. China has already been investing heavily in clean energy in Africa, and with far fewer constraints. “The Union is operating in a system of precise rules, stakes, and constraints unknown to Chinese centralism,” Rosana says. According to a study from Griffith University in Australia, energy-related investments under the Belt and Road Initiative in the first half of 2025 were the highest they’ve been since 2013, when the initiative was launched—and it was Africa, with $39 billion, that had the highest-value contracts in this sector. A recent report from the energy think tank Ember revealed that China exported 15GW of solar panels to Africa in the year leading up to June 2025, a 60 percent year-on-year increase of such imports. It is not certain that all of these devices will be installed—some could be a trade triangulation to circumvent tariffs—but in any case, Beijing is positioning itself to take advantage of the continent’s green transition. Europe, though, is committed to grasping this opportunity as well. “Over the past two years, competitiveness has gradually, but with increasing conviction, become the key word on the European policy agenda, along with defense,” says Rosana. “International cooperation has also been reinvented with a view to strategic autonomy, and put at the service of the Union’s global projection, at a time when, with the massive reorganization of trade balances due to the America-China challenge, Europe must rapidly diversify its supply chains and trade.” The EU hasn’t been alone in feeling the need to respond to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Before President Donald Trump’s second term, the US had also felt compelled to act. In 2021, President Joe Biden’s administration announced an international infrastructure program, the Build Back Better World, which the following year was expanded to the G7 and renamed the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI). Among the PGI’s main areas of focus were energy and Africa: indeed, two solar power plants in Angola, a wind energy and storage system in Kenya, and a nickel processing plant for batteries in Tanzania appeared on the list of early US projects. But perhaps the most important infrastructure project the West is pursuing in Africa is the Lobito Corridor , a railway line that will connect Zambia’s copper deposits and the DRC’s cobalt mines to the Atlantic port of Lobito in Angola. Copper is the metal of electrification; lithium, a key ingredient in batteries—both are essential raw materials for the green transition, and China currently dominates the supply of both. The African continent, then, is now a battleground between superpowers interested, first and foremost, in its resources. But with a young and growing population—in the sub-Saharan region, the population will grow by an estimated 79 percent over the next three decades —and an energy system dominated by fossil fuels, Africa’s decarbonization will be essential to the success of net zero. “The choices Africa makes today,” said Von der Leyen during the September announcement, “are shaping the future of the entire world.” This story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.

Death Threats Are Driving Him Out of the US,"donald trump, politics, influencers, government, spain, homeland security","“We, the students of Rutgers University, are deeply concerned to learn that an outspoken, well-known antifa member, Dr. Mark Bray, is employed by the university,” Doyle wrote in the petition. “Dr. Mark Bray, whom we call Dr. Antifa, wrote the antifa handbook, which is a guideline to what he refers to as “militant anti-fascism.” Doyle also suggested that Bray’s public comments were similar to “the kind of rhetoric that resulted in Charlie Kirk being assassinated last month.” In an update three days after she first posted the petition, Doyle said: ""I do not endorse death threats, doxxing, or harassment and would not wish them on anyone, especially Mark Bray."" Two days after the petition launched, Fox News ran a story about it on their website and quoted Doyle. Bray says he refused to provide a comment to Fox News, claiming that at the time the petition had fewer than 100 signatures. At the time of publication the petition had amassed almost 1,000 signatures. “It seemed to me a bit odd to have a news story about a relatively small Change.org petition,” says Bray. “Fox News was trying to generate a story that would get clicks [and] when the Fox News story came out on Saturday, within a few hours I received another death threat and another threatening email that had my full address in it which very much disturbed me.” Doyle, TPUSA, and FOX News did not respond to a request for comment. At that point, Bray says, he and his family made the decision to leave the US and move to Spain. WIRED spoke to Bray on Monday as he was preparing to leave the US, and he said he had just received another death threat that morning, and his address was still getting posted online. Scores of Bray’s former students have jumped to his defense.

9e11a105f314,The City That Made the World Fall for a Monster,"made in china, china, toys, travel, viral, manufacturing, design","The following sentence might make a globalist cry out for joy: A toy that is manufactured by a Chinese company in Vietnamese factories, designed by a Dutch artist in Belgium, inspired by indie toy culture in Hong Kong, and made viral thanks to a Thai K-pop star, has turned into the biggest Gen-Z cultural trend of 2025. That abomination of a sentence is the story of Labubu, the creepy-cute stuffed monster that swept the world this summer. You must have seen the trend by now, but most people are still unaware of the global, decade-long story that led up to it. Last week, I published a feature story about my journey into the heart of Labubu, how this cultural mania moment was created, and where it may go from here. It’s an inherently international story, but it’s not the first time we’ve seen it. Think about how the world fell for Pokemon Go or Kpop bands like BTS and Blackpink. These are all examples of regional cultural powerhouse industries successfully finding global audiences for their work. What’s new about Labubu, however, is that it’s the first time a Chinese company was able to engineer this level of success and cultural impact. Sure, there are always coincidences at work for a success of this scale, but the more I reported on this story, the more I also realized the historical and economic reasons why Labubu, and the toy company behind it, Pop Mart, ended up in this place. In many ways, it resembles other Chinese tech companies that went from counterfeit producers to international name brands, moving up the value chain as they transformed manufacturing experience into valuable technological knowhow. The story of Labubu begins in Hong Kong in the 1970s and early ‘80s, when the city became a manufacturing hub for toys. From Mattel and Disney to Japan’s Bandai, almost every major toy company was outsourcing production to factories in Hong Kong, due to the low labor costs there. Howard Lee, the founder of a Hong Kong toy studio called How2Work, told me how that period of history shaped his childhood. “Many parents would go to factories and come home with outsourced gig work like hand painting toys at home,” he says. It was also easy for people to buy toys with cosmetic or functional imperfections from the factories directly, so a generation of children like Lee grew up with relatively easy access to flawed dolls and other toys, which made them yearn more for the better ones they couldn’t afford.",https://www.wired.com/story/made-in-china-why-labubus-come-from-hong-kong,Technology,BBC,Zeyi Yang,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e0303d11d60a588341d44a/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Made-In-China-Labubu-Business--2220405818.jpg",2025-10-09T15:40:38.914000+00:00,176b421ddd6a58261cff05eea0c1b09813acf723
e234fb8bb37e,Covid Shots Are About to Be Widely Available Again,"science, health, covid-19, vaccines, cdc, robert f. kennedy jr.","Covid-19 vaccines are about to become widely available again across the United States, following several weeks of confusion around who would be able to get them this fall. Uncertainty over federal vaccine policy had caused a temporary patchwork of access across the country, with shots being offered in some places and not others. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance around the use of Covid vaccines, dropping a broad recommendation for vaccination and instead leaving the choice up to individuals. While it marks a change in official CDC policy, the guidance allows shots to be rolled out to pharmacies, and for states to once again offer them to people of all ages. Prior to this fall, the CDC universally recommended the Covid vaccine for anyone 6 months or older. The agency’s new guidance, drafted by a panel of experts handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., says that individuals should consult with a health care provider before getting the shot, what the agency calls “individual-based decision-making.” The CDC’s definition of providers includes physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. “Informed consent is back,” said Jim O’Neill, acting CDC director and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy secretary, in an October 6 statement . “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual Covid-19 boosters deterred healthcare providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.” Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, first moved to restrict Covid vaccines in May, when he announced that the CDC would no longer recommend them to healthy children and pregnant women. Confusion mounted in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated Covid vaccines but only for adults ages 65 and older and younger people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe disease . Previously, Covid shots were indicated for anyone 6 months and older. Because of differing state laws that determine the scope of practice for pharmacists, the change triggered pharmacies in some states to require a prescription, while in others pharmacies stopped offering the shots entirely. Several states, however, took swift action to restore access.",https://www.wired.com/story/covid-shots-are-about-to-be-widely-available-again-vaccines-cdc,Technology,BBC,Emily Mullin,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e68f44251274c0216234de/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/sci-covid-vax-1234262574.jpg",2025-10-09T14:24:21.914000+00:00,4515538bce62999765a0596292a0a1bece098673
2a4a34a9dde2,Inside Intel's Hail Mary to Reclaim Chip Dominance,"intel, chips, manufacturing, semiconductors, donald trump, government","After four years of construction, Intel said on Thursday that its Fab 52 semiconductor plant in Chandler, Arizona, is now turning out its first chips. The company also shared more details about the long-awaited CPUs that it will be producing in the facility using Intel’s brand-new 18A process technology. The announcement comes just six weeks after the Trump administration acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Intel in exchange for $8.9 billion in stock. The fab opening, while long in the works, is the first major opportunity for the struggling US chipmaker to convince the broader tech industry that it can produce some of the world’s most advanced chips at scale—and that the White House’s investment might pay off. Late last month, Intel invited dozens of analysts and business partners, along with a handful of journalists, to tour Fab 52. The tour offered an extremely rare glimpse into the world of modern chipmaking , where robots perform most tasks, lithography machines the size of school buses print microscopic patterns on silicon wafers, and workers shuffle around in anti-contamination “bunny suits,” booties, goggles, and gloves. (Guests are required to wear the suits, too.) Intel says that the air within the fab is recycled every six seconds. All of this is to prevent contamination of the fragile silicon wafers that the entire computing industry runs on. If a single speck of anything lands on a wafer, it can be irreparably damaged. Make or Break Intel says that its Fab 52 has technically been operational since July, and the new generation of chips being made there, dubbed Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, have been in the works for years at this point. But Intel decided to show off its new fab at a critical moment for the company. The facility is designed to make chips using a new process, called 18A, that’s supposed to yield more powerful and efficient products. “Supposed to” is key: Intel’s near-term fate hangs on whether it can produce semiconductors that are impressive enough to not only serve its usual hardware and computer customers, but also attract AI companies with large sums of cash to spend on advanced chips and data centers. During the tour, Intel executives emphasized that Fab 52 is the most advanced chip manufacturing plant in the world. That may technically be true—the company's fabs, or foundries, “have been long known and respected in the industry for making the next node possible,” says Austin Lyons, an analyst at Creative Strategies and founder of Chipstrat, a semiconductor publication. In the early 2010s, for example, Intel made another significant node, or process advancement, when it introduced 32-nanometer chip technology. (Its latest chips are 2-nanometer.)",https://www.wired.com/story/intel-arizona-fabrication-chips-trump-manufacturing,Technology,BBC,Lauren Goode,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e5432d8f7f9fe2c489c3b3/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Intel-Hail-Mary-Business-JC0_8721.jpg",2025-10-09T13:00:00+00:00,022087e0587e4e048deacd60fae97af522ce0bc8

He says it took a few attempts to connect to Wi-Fi, but once connected it worked well with no Wi-Fi issues during the year he tested it. It has built-in Wi-Fi, uses four AA batteries that last around two months (less in super colder weather), and has a hidden mechanical keyhole as a backup in case the battery dies when you’re not home, and you get two spare keys. There’s a charging port underneath so you can give it some juice during emergencies if the lock is dead and you don’t have the key, but we wish it was USB-C instead of Micro USB. It's a good lock, but he prefers the Fingerprint models since it has a nicer build quality and it has eight batteries, so the lock lasts twice as long. Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch for $300 : I've been testing this lock for a few weeks in tandem with ADT's security system and Google Home. Unlike the other locks in this guide, I didn't install it—an ADT tech did, and installation can be included in an ADT security package like the one I've been testing. For the lock itself, it's worked well. It's a full dead-bolt replacement, and came with a single key, and has both a keypad and fingerprint reader for entry options. The fingerprint reader is speedy and efficient, and my husband says the keypad has been easy to use (you activate the keypad by touching the Yale button, but if your finger is registered to the app, that's also the fingerprint reader button). Instead of using the Yale app, I primarily control this app with the ADT+ app, but there are versions of this lock that don't use or require ADT's service. I do wish I could set it to lock after every 10 minutes, rather than three, but that's the longest option the ADT+ app gives me to set it. I can also partially control it in the Google Home app, but only to lock and unlock it, not to dive into detailed settings like passcodes and auto-lock times. Yale Assure Touchscreen Lever Lock for $240 : I’ve been testing this no-dead-bolt lever door handle with its sleek-looking keypad for four months on the door to my house from inside my garage. Unlike Yale's Approach Lock , it won’t sense you coming, but it awakens with even a light touch to the keypad. It’s easy to lock and unlock and view the activity log on the Yale Access app, or you can use a pin code to unlock. You can also create different codes for different people to know exactly who’s been coming and going and when. It works with Google Home, Apple Home, and Alexa, and has also got two physical keys for backup in case of battery failure. Setup wasn’t exactly a breeze, requiring the Bilt app to install and then the Yale app to configure, and online reviews are quite voluminous in their complaints of both battery life and the handle becoming loose over time. Neither of these issues has arisen during our test period; however, we will update this review with further observations as time goes on. —Kat Merck Avoid These Smart Locks We haven't loved every smart lock we've tried. These are the ones to skip. Defiant Smart Deadbolt Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Defiant Smart Deadbolt Powered by Hubspace for $100 : The shoddy build quality is a huge turn-off on this smart lock from Defiant. The buttons are mushy, it’s very loud, and what is the point of Wi-Fi connectivity if it never connects to Wi-Fi? I finally got it paired with the Hubspace app, but the lock never stayed connected to my Wi-Fi, so I had none of the benefits. — Julian Chokkattu Eufy FamiLock S3 Max for $400 : This lock is cool because it includes a camera, letting the device double as a digital peephole (convenient for smaller family members!) and has a super interesting biometric option that uses the veins in your palm for authentication.

e0f9aac1b026,The AI Slur ‘Clanker’ Has Become a Cover for Racist TikTok Skits,"social media, artificial intelligence, tiktok, content creators","In July, just after receiving an email pitch about the “perfect” AI girlfriend, content creator Harrison Stewart made a TikTok skit using the anti-AI slur “clanker.” Pretending to be a disapproving father, he confronted his daughter’s robot boyfriend in the year 2044. “What’s your name? No it’s not. It’s model number 626 S Series. That’s your name, you dirty clanker,” Stewart says in the video. As one of the original creators to make clanker-themed TikToks, Stewart, who goes by Chaise online, was dubbed the “clanker guy” by his fanbase after racking up millions of views. But in August, the 19-year-old content creator, who is Black, announced that he would no longer be publishing any more videos on the subject. The joke, he said, and responses to it, had become racist. “When I go into my comment section and people are starting to call me ‘cligger’ and ‘clanka’ or ‘ you’re a dirty clanker’—not voicing those slurs at AI and electronics, but at me—I don’t find that entertaining or funny at all,” Stewart explains in the video. The origins of clanker date back to late 1950s author William Tenn, who used the word to describe robots from science fiction films, but its adoption as a sort of slur came from the Star Wars franchise, where it was used as a derogatory term toward the antagonist droids and troopers. In recent months, it has become a protest of sorts against the rapid implementation of AI into virtually every aspect of society. Over the past three months, the term has garnered over 2 million Google searches and at least hundreds of thousands of social media posts. In an X post in July, Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona wrote, “Sick of yelling ‘REPRESENTATIVE’ into the phone 10 times just to talk to a human being? My new bill makes sure you don’t have to talk to a clanker if you don’t want to.” On TikTok and Instagram, however, the ongoing backlash against AI has taken on the form of short video skits, envisioning a future where robots have been fully incorporated into society. The term “clanker,” along with “tinskins,” “wirebacks,” and “oil bleeders” are used as pejoratives in these skits. But some of these skits appear to be using clankers as stand-ins for Black people, perpetuating racist tropes and scenarios that harken back to a pre–Civil Rights era.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-slur-clanker-has-become-a-cover-for-racist-tiktok-skits,Technology,BBC,Rana Alsoufi ,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e0386324bca0f477533aea/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/culture_robot_slur_clanker_925167526.jpg",2025-10-09T10:00:00+00:00,ff2761af5de8716fa919327b046141107e7c0b13
b19ddfdf1d1f,"Ferrari Reveals Its Electric Powerhouse, and What Could Finally Be Real EV Sound","electric vehicles, evs and hybrids, cars, ferrari","Palermo says the sound can be reduced when cruising, then amplified during more dynamic driving. Allegedly, it’s even possible to sense when a rear wheel breaks traction, since the rise in revs of that motor would be detected by the accelerometer. He also says how latency—the time between a change in motor revs and the sound reaching the driver’s ear—is “below the threshold of human perception… instantaneous.” The sound will also adjust depending on how the driver engages with the steering wheel paddles for regenerative braking and the Torque Shift Engagement system. But, for now, Ferrari refuses to comment on exactly how motor sound is broadcast in the cabin—be it through the car’s sound system, or some other means—and how external sound will be created. Underscoring Ferrari’s commitment to using an authentic drivetrain sound, Palermo adds: “It’s an instrument, not a ringtone.” Individually Controlled Wheels Remarkably, for a company whose cars are synonymous with theatrical histrionics, Ferrari says during normal driving “silence is preferred to maximize acoustic comfort.” To that end, it has worked hard to illuminate noise, vibration, and harshness (known in the industry as NVH), since there’s no longer a loud engine to drown it all out. The Elettrica’s suspension is an evolution of the active system used by Ferrari’s Purosangue SUV and F80 hypercar, which employs 48-volt motors to apply torque to each shock absorber, actively working to eliminate pitch and roll. As with other electric cars, a heavy battery pack in the floor helps to lower the center of gravity; in this case, by 80 mm compared to an equivalent non-EV. Although it can’t defy physics, Ferrari claims its suspension trickery and quad-motor setup makes the Elettrica handle as if it were almost 1,000 lbs lighter. The result is a car where each wheel has its own individually controlled power, braking, suspension, and steering—with the rear wheels even able to be steered independently of each other, by up to 2.15 degrees in either direction. Each of the four motors can also operate their own regenerative braking, with up to 0.68G of deceleration possible with the most aggressive level of regen. That’s more than half the braking force experienced during an emergency stop in a regular car.",https://www.wired.com/story/ferrari-reveals-its-electric-powerhouse-and-what-could-finally-be-real-ev-sound,Technology,BBC,Alistair Charlton,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e6c28c7f459712a65944ae/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Gear_Ferrari_H5A9253.jpg",2025-10-09T08:30:00+00:00,739fedc35d7503550b82ca48cf60c684e2d7c9a3

679d1d01d547,Why This $650 Laptop Is the Only Windows Device You Should Buy on Prime Day,"laptops, laptop, pcs, computers, dell, amazon prime day","The best laptop deal of this big week of deals can't be found on Amazon. Not on Best Buy or Walmart either. Instead, at Dell.com , you'll find the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) selling for just $650. For a Windows device, that price thoroughly categorizes it as a “budget laptop,” but the specs are anything but. It has 16 GB of RAM, a terabyte of storage, and a 2560 x 1600 resolution display. The average laptop of this price is worse is just about every way. In my own testing of this laptop, I found a lot to like about it. The processor used is the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V, which is a flagship chip used in some of the best laptops , some of which cost up to a thousand dollars more, including within Dell's own lineup. One of the great benefits of this chip is battery life, which I was happy to be surprised by. You'll easily get a full day of work away from the outlet. The performance is more than enough for most people, and it even has some impressive integrated graphics. The display, is also quite good. It's colorful, and there's even a 90 Hz refresh rate. I didn't love the matte display and plastic bezels, but the panel itself is surprisingly high quality. I wasn't as impressed by this when the price was $1,099, but for $650? It's heads and tails over the competition. Compare it to the Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed), for example, another “budget” laptop that I've recommended in the past. It only has a 1920 X 1200 resolution display with a 60 Hz refresh rate and really, poor color accuracy. It has a sickly green tone that's hard to get around. The one caveat is that when I reviewed the Dell 14 Plus, it came with 32 GB of RAM. There was no 16 GB option, which is now available. Even with that difference, though, this configuration of the Dell 14 Plus is the best Windows laptop deal I've seen in recent memory. So, yes, if you're shopping for a Windows laptop, this is clearly the one to buy. The only exception I'd give is if you're looking for something with a larger screen. If that's you, I'd point you to the Acer Swift 16 AI (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It has a lot of the same specs as the Dell 14 Plus, but comes with a larger (and higher-resolution screen)—and importantly—has a more expansive screen. It's $800 though , so you'll be paying $150 more for this 16-inch laptop.

6e992b082e66,This Thrilling Sony Surround System Is on Super Sale for Prime Day,"shopping, sony, home entertainment, deals, audio, amazon prime day","It's Prime Day times, and one of my favorite sonic surprises of 2025 is getting a sweet discount. The Sony Bravia Theater System 6 is one of the best soundbar setups I've tested this year, offering a unique mix of components that serve up some of the most thrilling and musical surround sound you can get for the money. There aren't a ton of fancy features here, but you'll get everything you need in one box to take your TV setup from boring to bodacious. For plenty more deals on all sorts of gear, make sure you peruse our massive Absolute Best Prime Day deals post and our Amazon Prime Day live blog for all the best stuff we've tested and curated. Sony Bravia Theater System 6 The Bravia Theater System 6 comes in a rather large box, with its hefty subwoofer taking up most of the real estate. The large cabinet serves as both the sonic foundation and the primary hub of the 5.1-channel system, offering all inputs and connecting to the slim soundbar via a small flat cable. Inputs include HDMI eARC for seamless TV connection, as well as digital optical and 3.5-mm analog input for legacy sources. A small amplifier box connects to the subwoofer wirelessly, while two more flat cables connect the tall surround speakers. It's a lot of wires for a single-box surround system in 2025, but the payoff is performance that gets refreshingly close to more complex multi-speaker setups. You'll get punch and verve in the bass, smooth musicality and poised dialog from the bar, and clear and fluid surround channels from the back speakers. While there aren't any upfiring speakers for 3D sound formats like Dolby Atmos, the System 6 does a commendable job virtualizing Atmos. One thing you won't get in the package is Wi-Fi support, which means you'll be confined to Bluetooth streaming, and any updates need to be done manually with a USB drive, yet another callback to older Home Theater in a Box (HTiB) systems. A bit of awkwardness in setup is worth it for the sheer cinematic performance the Bravia Theater System 6 serves up. It's worth the splurge for many at full price, but this discount makes it a much easier choice for anyone looking to take their basic TV setup to the next level. If you want to be fully immersed in your films and TV shows, this setup delivers. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

18cd5c5f02e1,The Best Baby Gear Deals During Prime Day,"amazon prime day, shopping, deals, household, parenting","Becoming a parent is an expensive experience, and with rising costs and tariffs, it certainly isn't getting cheaper. One way to help curb the insane amount of spending you're on the hook for? Finding great deals on the gear you need, and Amazon Prime Day is a perfect opportunity. There's plenty of baby gear you're going to want (cute shoes they'll never wear! custom knitted sweaters that are doomed for spit-up!), but there's plenty you need that can't be skipped, like the car seats and baby monitors. Those items aren't a cheap investment, but right now some of our favorites and go-to items are on sale. Check out our favorite baby gear we've tested with our own kids below. Best Baby Gear Deals This baby monitor packs an impressive amount of data about your baby's night of sleep, and if you get the breathing accessories (pajamas or a swaddle with a specific print on them), the camera can also track Baby's breathing. It's a great Wi-Fi-based monitor ( our favorite one, in fact! ) with a ton of mount options, and an easy-to-use app. Fridababy Electric NoseFrida I love this little nose sucker. It was one of my holy grail items for the first year of my son's life. It's electric, so there's none of the manual sucking that gives me the ick. It works great to get snot out of little noses, a frequent problem when your crawling baby starts picking up more and more germs on their journey around the floor. Maxi-Cosi Kani 4-in-1 Convertible Car Seat With some baby gear, you can wait to see if you need it. But not a car seat. You'll need one to leave the hospital, and while you might want to start with a portable infant car seat (which are great for loading up newborns indoors and carting them around while they sleep!), once your kid reaches a certain weight and height, they'll need a larger car seat. I'm loving this seat from Maxi-Cosi for my kid right now, which has plenty of adjustments for his tall, 3-year-old body and two removable drink holders. Cybex Libelle 2 Travel Stroller A great stroller is a game-changer, and once my kid started sitting facing forward, I became obsessed with travel strollers that are lightweight and fold down small. One of the smallest I've ever tried is the Cybex Libelle stroller. It's a great pick for parents who want something super small for their trunk that their kiddo will still be comfy in. It's got a unique handle style, but you get used to it. Willow Go Wearable Breast Pump I wish desperately I had invested in a wearable breast pump sooner. They often come with a handful of flange sizing options, rather than the single flange I got with my classic pump that turned out to be a poor fit (no wonder my pump results were mediocre), so it's easy to find a good fit and they're so much more comfortable to wear since you aren't battling cords sticking out of your body. Great for any pumping parent, whether you're on the go or at the office or just prefer to pump in general. If you're looking for a compact stroller but nothing as compact as the Cybex above, the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 is an impressive feat of design, featuring jogger-style wheels and a nearly flat fold in a single stroller. It was one of my favorites for a while, and is still an honorable mention in our Best Strollers guide. It's got attachments for car seats, but is really best for forward-facing kiddos.

Lobo, who also made a post using the #SwiftiesAgainstAI hashtag, doesn’t think Swift will comment on the backlash. She does think the pop star, whether she used AI or not, will be wary of doing so in the future out of fear of angering her fans. As a contrast to the promos, Lobo’s X post highlighted Swift’s 2017 lyric video for the song “Look What You Made Me Do,” which was designed by a motion design studio. Lots of fans responded to Lobo’s post noting they missed the artistry and attention to detail in some of Swift’s earlier lyric videos. “Back then, when she wasn’t even as big as she is now, she was careful enough to hire someone to make something so beautifully and carefully done,” Lobo says. “I have a job that is threatened by AI, and AI just completely disregards the art and turns it into a product.” While it’s unclear what AI models, if any, were used to generate the promo videos, Reality Defender’s Colman says there are some models trained on non-copyrighted data and others that tread into more unethical territory. But mainstream AI products offered by companies like OpenAI and Google are currently battling to make training their models on copyrighted work legal under fair use, to the dismay of artists who are losing paid work to AI . Colman says that current generative AI models and a “good prompt” could generate the kinds of images used in Swift’s promos in around two minutes. Many of these kinds of videos are made with diffusion AI models, which produce output comparable to Sora, OpenAI’s video app that has given users the ability to easily deepfake themselves. Google teased Swift’s scavenger hunt from its official Instagram account , although it’s unclear whether the promo videos that were part of the challenge were made with Google’s AI features. Earlier this year, Google started promoting a tool to convert photos into short, AI-generated videos. The latest iteration is called Veo 3. If the Swift teasers were supposed to entice her fans to use Google’s AI suite, the plan seems to have backfired. This demographic may actually be among the most vocal and least likely people to glom onto AI tools. Most of the people involved in the backlash are “huge fans,” Lobo says, they just “don’t want AI to infiltrate what we feel is a safe space.” As long as Swift stays silent, it will remain a question of whether it even did.",https://www.wired.com/story/taylor-swift-swifties-against-ai-viral,Technology,BBC,Kat Tenbarge,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e5828d8c3af7cdfe932788/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Taylor-Swift-AI-Promo-Culture-2239032475.jpg",2025-10-08T20:53:21.330000+00:00,27ef51838a84211da8bf5c56c69feeef02e7e899

An easy way to remedy this is by getting a pet water fountain . They require a bit more maintenance; you'll need to take it apart, clean regularly, and change filters monthly, but this is well worth it for the health benefits. The majority of cats are chronically dehydrated. This can lead to major problems like potentially lethal UTIs . Cats see stagnant water as potentially harmful, so they're more naturally drawn to moving water in nature. A fountain can help encourage them to drink more by emulating running water and working with their natural instincts. After testing two dozen of these, my cat Basil's favorite fountain has been the Petkit Eversweet Max . Your cat can be as happy and hydrated as Basil, and you can save some bones now that it's 25 percent off for Prime Day. For more Big Deal Days bargains, be sure to consult our guide to the Absolute Best Prime Day Deals for October 2025 and check in on our Prime Day liveblog , where we're tracking deals and trends all event long. Photograph: Molly Higgins This high-tech automatic fountain can be either plugged in or cordless battery-powered, so you have the freedom to move it around the house, and it lasts a whopping 83 days on the battery. The drinking bowl is made of stainless steel, which is a must-have with pet fountains, as it's more hygienic and reduces the chance of harboring harmful bacteria . You can monitor the fountain from your phone, with a connected app that logs every time your pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed. All of this data is helpful to have, as cats' hydration is so closely tied to their overall health and can be more easily flagged to the vet. The app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you last added water. However, it doesn’t monitor or show you how much water is left in the basin; you'll have to manually check. It's normally on the pricier end of the fountain market, but at only $67, it's a great deal for a reliable, techy fountain that will last.

The 82-year-old Democrat left office in January after he had dropped his bid for reelection six months earlier following a disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump amid concerns about Biden’s age, health and mental fitness.

The scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.

6de47bb76456,One Mass. health system is turning to AI to ease shortage of primary care doctors. Some don’t like it,"artificial intelligence, health tech, patients, physicians, stat+","Mass General Brigham has turned to artificial intelligence to address a critical shortage of primary care doctors , launching an AI app that questions patients, reviews medical records, and produces a list of potential diagnoses. Called “Care Connect,” the platform was launched on Sept. 9 for the 15,000 MGB patients without a primary care doctor . A chatbot that is available 24/7 interviews the patient, then sets up a telehealth appointment with a physician in as little as half an hour. MGB is among the first health care systems nationally to roll out the app. Several primary care doctors at MGB, however, described AI as a sideshow, a distraction from what they contend is the real solution to the shortage: providing the pay and working conditions that will attract more primary care physicians to the state’s largest health system and keep them from leaving.

But as of Saturday evening, the terminations appeared to have been rescinded. An HHS official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said workers who produce Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report may have mistakenly received reduction-in-force notices because of coding errors in their job classifications. Earlier on Saturday, almost the entire staff of MMWR, known as the “voice of the CDC,” had been laid off, former publication editor-in-chief Charlotte Kent told STAT in her first public interview since she left the agency in February.

15aad631d406,"CDC battered by government shutdown firings, while some are rescinded","cdc, public health, rfk jr., white house","WASHINGTON — The White House’s mass firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff on Friday has decimated offices related to injury prevention, respiratory disease surveillance, and chronic disease, according to four people familiar with the cuts. By Saturday evening, however, some of the terminations appeared to have been rescinded. An HHS official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that some people may have mistakenly received reduction-in-force notices because of coding errors in their job classifications. The people who should be brought back, the official said, include those who produce the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report publication, people working on the measles outbreak, people working on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and people in the Global Health Center and in the Epidemic Intelligence Service. All RIF notices have now been sent, by mail or email, the official said. Overall, the White House is expected to cut between 1,100 and 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, though it’s not yet clear how many will come from the CDC. HHS hasn’t released official numbers on the cuts, but most anecdotal reports related to health agency firings have centered around the CDC. The American Federation of Government Employees has challenged previous firings of federal workers and said Friday in a social media post that it was filing a lawsuit in response to overall government firings. AFGE did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The terminations came after President Trump made good on threats to axe federal workers as the government shutdown drags into a third week. Trump has blamed the shutdown on congressional Democrats and has pledged at the White House in the past few days that these firings, which are not typical for a government shutdown, would hit “Democrat” programs. One high-ranking CDC official who just lost their job disputed characterizations of the cuts as the natural consequence of a shutdown, instead calling it the weaponization of one. “The executive branch is using the shutdown as cover for an intentional and targeted dismantling of leadership across the agency. It’s designed to sow chaos, demoralize career staff, and cripple the federal scientific infrastructure that protects Americans’ health,” the official told STAT. “Calling this a budget issue is a lie. It’s an abuse of power — unethical, unlawful, and profoundly dangerous.” The official said it appears that major cuts were made to the leadership of multiple centers, removing the office of director from many of them. “It’s a massacre,” the official told STAT Saturday on condition of anonymity because of continuing connections to people at the CDC. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been largely silent on the firings that have come for his department. In a statement on Friday, department spokesperson Andrew Nixon blamed the firings on Democrats and said those who received notices were “non-essential.” According to people familiar with the cuts, the firings included all the personnel in the CDC’s Washington, D.C., office. Some employees were terminated from the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology; the Office of Human Resources; the office of the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; the Office of Science, including people responsible for gathering information on global health threats; the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; and the CDC’s library. Also let go on Friday were most second-year members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, the CDC’s rapid outbreak response training program, as well as their laboratory counterparts, members of the Laboratory Leadership Service. A few people in those two programs who are in the U.S. Public Health Service were spared from the layoffs. Both programs appeared to be on the chopping block in the first round of reduction-in-force layoffs that the Trump administration leveled in February, but the threatened layoff notices were not issued then to EIS officers. Members of the laboratory leadership program were let go, but were later reinstated. For the terminated CDC official, it’s personal. “I’ve dedicated over a decade to serving the public — through emergencies, pandemics, and everyday prevention work that saves lives quietly. To see the very system we’ve built being dismantled under false pretenses is devastating,” the official continued. “It’s not just the loss of a job or title; it’s the erasure of trust, of continuity, of purpose. I know what public health can do when it’s allowed to work. Watching it be taken apart like this feels like a betrayal of the American people we serve.” Another CDC employee who was “not among the illegally fired” said Saturday that witnessing the fate of others was “absolutely horrible.” “It’s as emotionally devastating as it is dangerous to the American public,” said the person, granted anonymity for fear of retribution. The now-fired senior official said the people who guided teams through the Covid-19 pandemic, opioid crisis response, and chronic disease prevention now feel betrayed that they’re being told their roles are non-essential. “It’s a calculated blow meant to break the will of a workforce that has already given more than most Americans will ever see,” the official said. The nation’s top health agency has weathered the ousting of Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC director, only weeks after a gunman fired 500 bullets at the agency’s Atlanta headquarters, killing a police officer and shaking staff members facing unprecedented policy changes as well as fears about the politicization of public health. Just days after the shooting, the government fired over 150 violence and injury prevention specialists at the CDC Center for Injury Prevention. And the firings on Friday affected the Office of Safety, Security and Asset Management, which is responsible for agency security. Newsletter Tuesdays & Thursdays Sign up for D.C. Diagnosis The latest updates in federal health agencies, research institutes, and U.S. policy The CDC has also been targeted by Trump administration cuts since the start of the year. In April, reductions in force as part of White House efforts to shrink the federal government saw the loss of 2,400 staff, or 18% of the agency. The battle is not over, argued the fired CDC official, calling on Congress to use its authority to rein in the executive branch. Meanwhile, the official saluted colleagues who are resisting. “This isn’t April 2025. People have learned. They’re organizing, sharing information, building networks across centers and regions. Federal scientists and staff understand what’s at stake, and they’re not going quietly,” the official said. “They’re fighting back — through lawful means, through solidarity, and through truthtelling. The era of silent dismantling is over.” This story has been updated to reflect that some CDC firings appeared to have been rescinded as of Saturday evening.",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-firings-government-shutdown-hhs,Health,BBC,"Elizabeth Cooney, Chelsea Cirruzzo, Helen Branswell",https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235727101-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-11T18:22:44+00:00,b4007717e4eccb3e10e13c76e84d059fc2fc1cc6

Torie Bosch: What do you do if a loved one refuses treatment for cancer? Or what if you’re an oncologist whose patient doesn’t want to be treated? Welcome to the “First Opinion Podcast.” I’m Torie Bosch, editor of First Opinion. First Opinion is STAT’s home for big, bold ideas from health care providers, researchers, patients, and others who have something to say about medicine’s most important and interesting topics. Today, I’m speaking with Samyukta Mullangi, an oncologist and senior medical director at Thyme Care, and Joy Lisi Rankin, a historian, author of “A People’s History of Computing in the United States,” and a breast cancer survivor. We discussed the very personal decisions that come with breast cancer and how patients and oncologists can better work together. Joy, I’d like to start with you. You recently wrote a really powerful essay for STAT about your mother, Carol, and her experience with breast cancer and your own experience. Before we get into that, can you tell me a little bit about Carol as a person? Rankin: My mom as a person was warm and creative, loving, a great mom. She loved writing, encouraged that in me and my younger brother. She was kind and warm. I miss her. Bosch: Tell me a little bit about her diagnosis with breast cancer. How old was she? Had she seemed ill? Were you surprised? Rankin: So this is a great question because it gets at the heart of something that I struggled with, which is I don’t know how old she was when she was diagnosed. I know how old she was when she shared her diagnosis with our family, which was in 2002. So she would have been in her mid- to late 50s at that point. However, our family later found out that she quite likely had learned about her diagnosis at some earlier point by months or years, but hadn’t shared it. But when she did share it with us, at that point, my brother and I both sort of stepped in to say, “Can we come to appointments with you? How can we support you? How would you like to proceed?” And that began my experience with the remaining five years or so of her life. Bosch: What happened after she was diagnosed or after she told you that she had been diagnosed? Rankin: She went to several different health care providers. Her primary care doctor, I think, but also most likely a surgeon, oncologist, radiologist. I’m not sure of the combination. I know she also sought second opinions as well. So probably multiples of those providers. But she was very reluctant to receive treatment. And my memory of that experience with her is that most of the doctors at this time — and this is again, the early 2000s — it didn’t feel like a conversation. It felt like, “We’re telling you what to do as a patient and either do what we tell you to do, or there aren’t other options.” And she decided circa 2002, 2003 that she didn’t want to pursue treatment. Again, she was very private about her health. So I don’t know why. I disagreed with her, but also felt like it was her decision to make and I should support her. And that was it. Bosch: Had she been sort of anti-medicine or anything like that growing up? Rankin: No, I mean, it was a surprise to me. Sort of both the diagnosis and her decision, because certainly she had taken my brother and me to the pediatrician growing up. We received vaccines and antibiotics, sort of all of the things. I don’t know about her own. I mean, she really was very private about her health. So I don’t know much about her history. She had mentioned that she had had a few previous breast cancer scares and not great experiences with those. Bosch: Sam, I want to bring you in here. So as an oncologist, how do you feel when you hear Carol’s experience? What does that bring up for you? Mullangi: You know, when I think of patients who refuse treatment, I don’t automatically assume they’re uninformed. I kind of assume that they’re just informed by different facts. Maybe I’m talking about it in the language of life extension, overall survival, and those sorts of things. And they’re responding to things like the fear of side effects, the frustrations that they’ve had previously with a very fragmented health system. In my practice in Nashville, a large part of it comes around lack of insurance clarity, concerns about what they’re going to pay out of pocket, difficulty navigating appointments. I’m a medical oncologist in the sense that I’m doing the drug therapy portion of things. I work in tandem with a surgical oncologist, with a radiation oncologist, etc. But sometimes even for patients who don’t need systemic drug therapy, I still see them at regular intervals to just navigate them through the system because no one else is quarterbacking it and I have to. But I do think that while there are so many heterogeneous reasons why patients can come to the same decision, I think that increasingly, and in the last two years, there has just been an exponential rise in the number of patients who come with all sorts of wrong information about what it means to have a cancer diagnosis. What led them to this point? What does treatment mean? And it’s just rooted in a much more adversarial stance around like, “What are you recommending to me? What are your conflicts of interest? What are you financially incentivized to provide for me? What is big pharma either providing or withholding?” And I think that in any given week it went from, this is sort of a rare conversation to have with a patient to nearly every single day having a conversation with multiple patients even about some element of what they’re taking or refusing to take or whatever that is just rooted in mistrust. I mean, it certainly is a phenomenon that people should address more often because it’s certainly causing a ton of physician burnout. To have their credentials and their experience and their whole, you know, reason for being kind of questioned in that way. So yeah, I mean, it’s a complicated problem and obviously patients are very different from one another but this is certainly something that I think I wanted to call out in that essay. Bosch: Yeah, so I’m glad you mentioned that. You recently wrote an essay about MTV VJ Ananda Lewis who I, as an elder millennial, I think they’re called, remember just really admiring as a teenager. She had this sort of like effortlessly cool, warm kind of mother earth hippie vibe. And she recently died from breast cancer at the age of 52 and you wrote about that when it happened. So what happened to her and what made you decide to write about it for STAT? Mullangi: Ananda Lewis was an MTV VJ, media personality, you know, and I think had a family history of breast cancer. In 2020 she shared that she had actually refused mammograms for years out of fear of sort of the low-dose radiation associated with the test. And I will say one thing that I’ll highlight there is that we used to recommend mammogram for patients starting at the age of 50. But increasingly younger and younger patients are presenting with these cancers often enough that that was revised down to age 40. And so already I think like we’re talking about, you know, her mistrust of mammograms occurring in this macro environment of younger people getting cancers that are very eminently treatable. And then when she was diagnosed it was already advanced to a Stage 3, which means that it was a combination of the size of her primary tumor mass and lymph node involvement. In general patients who have Stage 3 cancer, it’s still early — Stage 1, 2, and 3 are still early-stage — and our goals for therapy are curative — my hope is that, you know, the treatments that I provide in combination with my colleagues will restore her to the path that she was in before she was diagnosed in terms of hopefully her life expectancy, etc. But then she turned down standard treatments, including surgery and chemotherapy, and she was treated at an alternative clinic in Arizona with a combination of natural therapies and low dose chemo and passed away at the age of 52. And I can’t say that I know, you know, all of the details of her unique cancer diagnosis kind of what her prognosis had been even with the best standard of care therapy, but I can intuit from this that she wasn’t able to give herself that best chance and that more likely than not her life expectancy was compromised because of these treatment choices that were made. I also think that it’s just, you know, symptomatic of what I had said about more and more patients kind of like choosing against standard of care therapies and they’re no walk in the park, I will give you that, but especially for an early stage cancer with a curative intent like that to me and it constructs me as like truly a tragedy. Bosch: Yeah, you wrote, and I thought this was just really well put, that you’re “increasingly seeing patients reject evidence-based care for holistic or alternative paths that promise healing without hardship. Often they’re driven not by ignorance, but by fear, confusion, and a deep sense that no one in the system is really looking out for them.” Joy, you were the one who pointed out to me that your essay and Sam’s were really in dialogue in some ways, was it that part that made you connect? Rankin: What you just read, Torie, is what I double highlighted and underscored and really resonated. I mean, I saw many themes overlapping between our essays, but Sam’s articulation of patients driven by fear, confusion, or a sense that no one in the system was looking out for them, I think really was my mother’s experience. People have asked me, “Why do you think she made the choices that she did?” And I think at the heart of it was fear, trust or lack thereof, and then communication. I mean, these very brief meetings with people who — later on in your essay, Sam, I love it when you say patients need someone to sit beside them, not above them, because my mom’s experience, and certainly mine with her, was doctors who were very much sitting above her rather than sort of trying to understand, help her understand sort of what might make a difference, what might prolong her life, what might seem like if she was afraid of chemo or afraid of radiation, might surgery alone be something that could increase her life expectancy, for example. Mullangi: And I will say that at least where I practice, and maybe this isn’t reflected everywhere, we do kind of try to meet patients where they’re at because I think maybe practice culture matters, but also the population that you see day in and day out influences the way that you bring yourself to the table. But I think we have the ability to be modular in our approach. Okay, so somebody doesn’t want the full gamut. What are they willing to do? And can we talk about sort of the pros and cons? And I sometimes, you know, when I hear about stories like Carol, I kind of think to myself, “Is my practice pattern unique?” Maybe it is. And that’s also kind of an upsetting thing to learn about sort the medical system at large, because you would wish that everybody was modular in that way. Rankin: And I think to me, this raises another point about timing, which of course, like putting on my professional historian hat, I was looking back researching when medical schools in the United States really started focusing on communication as an essential part of medical education. And I was really not until the ’90s. So I feel like, right, and now that’s changed over time. So hopefully we have more doctors who are better active listeners and better at sort of responding to patient concerns. But I also suspect that my mom was seeing and being treated by a generation of doctors who hadn’t had that approach to practicing medicine. But Sam, I will say from what you’re describing and from other breast cancer survivors I know, it sounds like your practice is not the norm. And I wish it was. Bosch: Because Joy, you have the perspective, not only from having stood beside your mother during her experience, but you also had breast cancer yourself. So I suppose two questions here. The first is: How did you talk to your doctors or perhaps more importantly here, how did your doctors talk to you about your mother? And did you feel that you had a quarterback, as Sam put it, during your experience? Rankin: So I will separate a little bit and say that in general my oncology team, so surgeon, radiologist, oncologist, were amazing. However, prior to that diagnosis, of course I often had many encounters with medical professionals. And I talk a little about this in my essay. Whenever we went through my health history, and of course it was immediately obvious my mom had died of breast cancer and inevitably someone would ask, “Well, was she post-menopausal?” or “How was her treatment?” And I would simply say she refused treatment. And immediately the conversation and that interaction often took a turn to, I felt like I was being questioned in my intelligence, Carol was being questioned in her intelligence for that choice, or that I had to defend that choice. And it was an uncomfortable situation. It made me feel less trust for the person with whom I was interacting. Honestly, after my diagnosis, I sort of felt like I had to put my shields up and armor to prepare to go into a world of where I knew I wanted to get treated. I wanted to do what I needed to do to have as much life as I could, but that I expected resistance because of my mom’s history and what she had and hadn’t done. And so it was really a gift. And I mentioned this in my essay as well. When my surgeon, upon hearing that my mom had refused treatment, said, “That was her choice to make. And a lot of women make that choice.” That moment and reflecting on it, I think, really gave me the time and space to sort of look back at my experience with my mom’s dying years and say, “Oh. This could have been different.” Even if she had continued to refuse treatment, she could have had a provider who might have said, “Okay, this is likely what’s going to happen to your body. And also what kind of death do you want?” Which no one asked. And it’s a hard question. I get it. I understand, but it’s an important one. Mullangi: I think, Joy, there were two things that came to mind as you were sort of saying that. One is that physicians have to find for themselves the right balance between investment, an emotional investment that they’re making in their patients. And sometimes a lot of things can just trigger this sense of relatability. I’m a young person. If I see another young patient with cancer, there’s this automatic sense of, “Oh my gosh, I know what it means to be a young mother. And I want you to get through this.” And there’s this emotional investment that you make in someone. And then there’s also a sense of detachment that you have to exercise both to preserve your own sanity, but also because ultimately this isn’t your journey. This is your patient’s journey. And you have to respect that. And I think that there is potentially a lot of, this is the art of medicine where you have to kind of find the right balance between those two things. You know, you can’t be fully invested because again, that would be so disrespectful to your patients who are actually on the receiving end of a diagnosis and treatment. And you also can’t be too detached because then that’s so unemotional and so cold. And then the other thing that I wanted to say too is what you brought up in your essay around kind of the dichotomy that our insurance system also sets up between curative, like being in care versus being in palliative or hospice care and like. So much of the way in which I think we’re delivering care is not how a physician would design it if left to their own devices, but rather a complete artifact of how the system is set up, you know, from a payment perspective. And I think that is also something that, you know, there’ve been models like experimental models from CMMI and from the VA administration to try and create middle ground models of care, but they haven’t taken off. And I that’s also a bit of a tragedy. Bosch: Sam, earlier you had talked about how you’re seeing patients who are sometimes adversarial, you know, questioning your motives or the motives of other people being treated, or you’re seeing people who want to decline treatment out of fear about financial cost. Joy, it seems to me like Carol was not misinformed about things. She made sort of a decision for herself that she didn’t want to undergo treatment because that was her prerogative, you know. Sam, can you talk a little bit about how you respond to the different ways that a patient might say, “No, I don’t want this”? You know, do you have different approaches depending on their motivation? Mullangi: Yeah, I mean, I definitely do. I mean so much of it isn’t, they’re not adversarial because they fundamentally think I’m in it for the wrong reasons, but it could just be a mistrust. The Covid vaccine is the perfect example, right? Everybody wants all these drugs with all their toxicities, but they draw the line of the Covid-19 vaccine. And, you know, this was a conversation that I had way more in like 2020, 2021, 2022, when the virus was also more virulent. I’d be like, “I’m getting you through this cancer episode, the last thing I want is for you to then get Covid and have a complete decline because that would just be so not honoring this journey that you’ve been on.” But now increasingly, I feel like the vast majority of my patients don’t elect for the vaccine. And like I have run out of the energy to push them on it, because now new things have taken its place. Like everyone is on ivermectin and fenbendazole. Everybody, I have like several patients who are young, young in their late 30s or 40s who are declining medical treatment for their breast cancer because they would like to try a raw food diet. To be honest, I feel like I am refining my script all the time. I’m not saying that I have the right answer and so much of it dictates to how much time I have or how many conversations have I already had about this. Right now with a lot of things, I try to sort of say, this could be in addition to what I’m doing. Like you can do the ivermectin, tell me about it of course, but don’t decline chemotherapy because you want to just rely on that. You know, do the dietary things, but don’t decline chemo. Sometimes folks kind of ask us about, you know, the motives of big pharma and like, “Why are the drugs so expensive?” And we’re just pushing these expensive therapies on them. And it’s for like some kind of monetary gain. And you know, I have colleagues who have tried a version of this argument with some success to say, “You know, ivermectin has a manufacturer as well.” Like, nothing here is free. And you know you want to do good. And I think people are suspicious when you do financially well as a result of it. I went to business school — there was always a current of like, “You can do good and you should do well because of it like those two things should be in synergy.” But the idea of medicine being a business or you know, at the end of the day people are making money on these therapies. Sometimes, I don’t know, it seems like it’s a little bit difficult to square with I think the fact that, you know, from a patient perspective it’s a life-altering thing. And to think that people are attributing financial motives to it is, I don’t know. I don’t know that I have the answer to it but I think that’s definitely what I’m seeing. Bosch: Yeah, it really strikes me listening to both of you just how emotionally exhausting this is on all sides of the equation. Joy, do you think that Carol would be surprised to see that from the outside someone might think that she was someone who turned down treatment because of misinformation or not knowing? Rankin: So it’s hard for me to answer that question. What I will say is I think she would have been very disappointed in social media and all of its platforms as sort of massive ways to broadcast disinformation. Even, again, not knowing exactly why she made the choices that she did, I don’t have a sense that misinformation or disinformation was involved. And I think I mean, upon reflection, I think she might be surprised to feel that people sort of questioned her motives or choice. I mean, she encountered that when she was alive but I think it frustrated her as well because she was educated. She was well read. She was informed. Sam, in your essay, I love this line: “We’re in the middle of a disinformation epidemic. These aren’t fringe beliefs anymore. They’re mainstream, algorithmically amplified, and emotionally persuasive.” And I saw that too as a connection with some of my past work in terms of researching artificial intelligence and algorithms more broadly and thinking about what responsible algorithmic work looks like. And it is certainly not how a lot of media platforms are approaching disinformation, where it is clear that someone is trying to profit by spreading misinformation deliberately. Yeah, so I think too, speaking systemically, this is another huge component that comes into play that we could advocate for but is a big ship to steer. Bosch: Yeah, I think I asked that question really inarticulately but what I was sort of trying to get at is that it seems like right now so much of rejection of treatment is based on something that’s really deeply public facing, right? That’s so much about your connection to some sort of social identity. And Carol’s decision was so deeply personal rather than something to sort of be done on a platform. And so that to me feels so different from what a lot of Sam is seeing in the clinic today. Rankin: Torie, you saying that just now, I mean, reminded me in terms of sort of how private she was when she died, when the obituary was published and when we sort of shared over email about her funeral. I mean our friends and family were shocked because she had not shared her choice with, I mean literally my brother, my dad, and I, my husband. Maybe two or three other people knew. So it was so private to her and it was absolutely the opposite of this sort of very public persona, performance, consumption that we’re seeing now. Bosch: I could keep talking to both of you about this for another hour and a half or so, but I know you have other things to do. Before we wrap up though, I’d love to know, Sam, do you have any thoughts on going forward, how you’re approaching patient decisions, any ways to protect yourself from the way these decisions can be really exhausting for you? Mullangi: Yeah, I mean I think what I’m most interested in is system level solutions to not just this sort of mistrust, et cetera, that we’ve talked about in this conversation, but just in general, how patients kind of move through medicine and ways in which the current system leaves so many gaps and so much reliance on a patient being able to advocate and navigate for themselves. I mean, it’s not just … obviously, you’re leading to poor patient outcomes. It’s like leading to a ton of second- and third-order effects around the cost of the system, the duplication of tests or, you know, like the long wait to visits, the missed visits because, you now, it’s just like hard to remember when you got a complex case and a million different visits added to your calendar. I work at a value-based care enablement company where we think about improving patient experiencing and lowering total cost of care as being a very synergistic goal because oftentimes you see that when you improve the patient journey by solving for a lot of this fragmentation, this issues around navigating a complex system, having that time and bandwidth to just have a conversation with patients about like, “Hey, a clinical trial does not mean you’re a guinea pig. It often means it’s an improvement on standard of care,” and having someone who can have that 30-minute conversation that an oncologist for sure will not find the time to have. All of this will lead to improved experience but also reduced costs. And I think that’s how I feel about most things. You know, doing better should automatically create the economic possibilities around it. But yeah, I mean, I think the modern fee-for-service health care system where your visits are 15 to 30 minutes and you have a caseload of 20 to 30 patients to get through before you go home to your own family is just on an unsustainable trajectory. And the need is so high within oncology, we’re completely understaffed for our aging population. It’s fewer oncologists, more patients, and that automatically will mean an erosion of time that you have per patient. Bosch: And I should note too that back in May 2023, you co-wrote a really fantastic First Opinion titled “ Newly diagnosed cancer patients need help navigating the system .” So anyone who’s interested and more on the need for more navigators and quarterbacks should read that, and we’ll put that in the show notes as well. Joy, any final thoughts from you? Any final thoughts about Carol? Rankin: I would second what Sam said about the current model of U.S. health care really being unsustainable. And I would add upon reflection thinking from a patient perspective or just a person perspective that I think part of this too, it’s not just on the physicians, it’s also on the individuals to maybe … I would love to see us start reframing health and health care more as an approach to holistic wellbeing rather than “you go to a doctor when something is wrong.” I just read about Alice Walton opened a new school of medicine with the idea of prioritizing preventative health and a whole patient approach to considering their socioeconomic health and their mental health. And I think that is absolutely a model I can get behind. But again, this is big systemic reform to think about what insurance companies would need to do in health care practices and individuals as well as platforms to sort of see these changes over time.

9c6dc4525af9,"President Trump is in ‘exceptional health,’ his doctor says, after visit to Walter Reed",donald trump,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is in “exceptional health,” his physician said Friday after he underwent a checkup that included lab tests and preventive health assessments at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Trump spent roughly three hours at the Bethesda, Maryland, hospital earlier Friday for what his doctor, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, called a “scheduled follow-up evaluation” that was a “part of his ongoing health maintenance plan.” While there, Trump also got his yearly flu shot, as well as a Covid-19 booster vaccine. “President Donald J. Trump remains in exceptional health, exhibiting strong cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and physical performance,” Barbabella wrote in a one-page memo released Friday night by the White House. The doctor noted in the memo that the evaluation helped prepare for Trump’s upcoming overseas trips and included advanced imaging, lab testing and preventive health assessments. The president is traveling to the Middle East this weekend and is scheduled to fly to Asia at the end of this month. Barbabella also said he evaluated Trump’s cardiac age, which was about 14 years younger than his chronological age. Trump is 79 and was the oldest U.S. president at his inauguration. The White House this week initially described Trump’s Walter Reed visit as a “routine yearly checkup,” although Trump had his annual physical in April. The president then called it a “semiannual physical.” Trump’s April physical found that he was “fully fit” to serve as commander in chief. The three-page summary of the exam done by Barbabella then said he had lost 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since a medical exam in June 2020 and said he has an “active lifestyle” that “continues to contribute significantly” to the well-being of the president. In July, the White House announced that Trump had recently undergone a medical checkup after noticing “mild swelling” in his lower legs and was found to have a condition common in older adults that causes blood to pool in his veins. Tests by the White House medical unit showed that Trump has chronic venous insufficiency , which occurs when little valves inside the veins that normally help move blood against gravity gradually lose the ability to work properly. At the April physical, Trump also passed a short screening test to assess different brain functions. Presidents have large discretion over what health information they choose to release to the public. Trump’s summary from his April exam included information about his weight, body mass index, past surgeries, mental health screenings, cholesterol levels and blood pressure. When spokesperson Karoline Leavitt discussed the results of his chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis from the briefing room, she noted that the White House was disclosing details of the checkup to dispel rumors about Trump’s health. At the time, Trump was frequently observed with bruising on his hand . The Republican president has also repeatedly used the issue of health as a political cudgel. He repeatedly questioned the mental and physical health of his Democratic predecessor, President Joe Biden, and pointed out that he has undergone cognitive testing that Biden hadn’t. Biden has brushed aside those criticisms and said he was fit to serve, but he dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House after a disastrous debate with Trump raised doubts about his fitness for office. — Seung Min Kim",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/10/president-trump-health-doctor-checkup-results,Health,BBC,Associated Press,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25283530514802-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-11T01:39:24+00:00,f6843c22d1133332898dc7a426568cd8c7ea262f
0e3e13504047,Sarepta to seek approval for gene therapy in rare form of muscular dystrophy,"biotech, drug development, gene therapy, rare diseases, stat+","An experimental gene therapy from Sarepta Therapeutics increased levels of the gene missing in an ultra-rare form of muscular dystrophy, according to data the company presented Friday. The company has said it plans to file for approval in the disease, known as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2E. That would make it the first approved treatment in LGMD, a broad collection of highly rare diseases that can deprive patients of the ability to walk and in some cases shorten life. But it is likely to face a significant uphill battle. The LGMD 2E therapy relies on the same gene-ferrying virus that Sarepta uses in its other treatments, including its approved gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Elevidys , and experimental gene therapies for several other LGMD subtypes.

In their Oct. 1 letter, the lawmakers cite reports that dozens of infected monkeys arrived in Canada between 2011 and 2014 due to a “discredited” screening system, and say the Canadian Food Inspection Agency “has not strengthened oversight, imposed additional controls, or acknowledged the inadequacy of outdated testing protocols.” “Evidence now confirms that monkeys infected with tuberculosis… are entering North America through the international primate trade,” wrote the lawmakers , who are all members of the Ontario New Democratic Party, an opposition party that describes itself as social democratic  and who serve as opposition members in the Ontario Legislative Assembly.

And the closely watched case is being hailed by patient advocates as an example in which public health is taking precedent over corporate profits. Last March, the Delhi High Court questioned the validity of key Roche patents on its Evrysdi treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic disorder that causes certain muscles to become weak and waste away. One severe form of the disease can lead to death by age 2 if left untreated. At the time, the court did not revoke the Roche patents, which expire in 2033 and 2035, but noted that Natco Pharma, the generic company, made credible technical arguments for invalidating the patents. More significantly, the court also signaled that a generic alternative would benefit the public. STAT+ Exclusive Story Already have an account?

The U.S. Senate passed legislation that would restrict U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies from doing business with certain Chinese companies, potentially giving the president another way to pressure the industry into doing what he wants, STAT writes. The BIOSECURE Act, which was passed as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, has been a long time coming. A more aggressive version of the bill was introduced in the Senate in December 2023. The House proposed similar legislation the next month. BIOSECURE is not over the finish line yet, but it is significant that the Senate included it in the National Defense Authorization Act, because the defense budget bill has passed every year for decades. The House passed its version of the defense bill earlier in the year without the BIOSECURE Act, so the two chambers would need to agree to include BIOSECURE in the final version of the defense budget bill when reconciling differences between their versions. Retail pharmacies and prescription drug savings site GoodRx are talking with the Trump administration about joining its TrumpRx website, suggesting an expansion beyond the early description of it as a link to direct discounts offered by pharmaceutical companies , Reuters tells us. Several drugmakers are offering to sell some brand-name medications directly to consumers at the negotiated prices they get from insurers rather than much higher list prices. At a White House event last week, Trump and health officials described TrumpRx as a way to help consumers access drugs at discounted prices. How much value it represents to consumers is still uncertain. Wendy Barnes, chief executive officer at GoodRx, which connects consumers to coupons and discounts, said the Trump administration understands that “if we include the pharma direct programs, we also have to find a way to convey competitive cash pricing at retail pharmacies.” The National Community Pharmacists Association and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said they were also talking with administration officials.

Orbital is developing so-called in vivo CAR-T treatments. Today’s approved CAR-T therapies are effective at treating certain blood cancers, but are complicated to produce and taxing for patients: Their immune cells have to be collected, sent to a facility to be re-engineered to target cancer, and then sent back for infusion. Large doses of chemotherapy are given along the way. In vivo treatments would be given with a simple IV infusion, no costly manufacturing or high-dose chemotherapy involved.

720e5c5f1c8e,Senate-passed BIOSECURE Act would add arrow to Trump’s drug-pricing quiver,"drug development, drug pricing, pharmaceuticals, stat+","WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would restrict U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies from doing business with certain Chinese companies, potentially giving the president another way to pressure the industry into doing what he wants. The BIOSECURE Act, which was passed as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, has been a long time coming. A more aggressive version of the bill was introduced in the Senate in December 2023. The House proposed similar legislation the next month. BIOSECURE is not over the finish line yet, but it’s significant that the Senate included it in the National Defense Authorization Act, because the defense budget bill has passed every year for decades. The House passed its version of the defense bill earlier in the year without the BIOSECURE Act, so the two chambers would need to agree to include BIOSECURE in the final version of the defense budget bill when reconciling differences between their versions of it.

A big round of applause to STAT’s Lev Facher, who won a Loeb Award last night for his series, The War on Recovery! If you’ve never read these brilliant stories about how the U.S. denies lifesaving medications to people with opioid addiction, here’s the first installment . Trump administration escalates assault on AI coalition pushing for more regulation A tech-backed group trying to shape the use of AI in health care is losing support and key members while also facing increasing attacks by the Trump administration and Republican politicians. Amazon, one of four industry founding partners of the Coalition of Health AI, has not renewed its membership to the group and another founding partner, Microsoft, is conducting an assessment of its membership. Neither company indicated that there was a connection between these decisions and the Trump administration’s actions. The Coalition for Health AI boasts 3,000 members, with some of the country’s biggest names in health care and technology, including Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Mayo Clinic. It is also one of the biggest players in health care pushing for increased regulation and more transparency into organizations’ testing and training of AI tools. But Trump administration officials have increasingly argued that industry players should not be allowed to act as a “regulatory cartel.” Who called CHAI a cartel? Why does the administration want to break up the regulatory body? Read STAT’s Mario Aguilar’s story . Top Democrat pushing Medicare Advantage insurers for more AI transparency Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wants the country’s largest Medicare Advantage insurers to provide more detail about their use of artificial intelligence tools, according to a copy of a letter sent to UnitedHealth Group and obtained by STAT. The letter follows a Senate subcommittee report that found payment denials for care of seriously ill patients increased significantly after UnitedHealth and other large Medicare Advantage insurers began using AI and other predictive tools to help make coverage decisions. Similar letters were sent to executives at Humana and CVS Health, which owns Aetna. If you want to know what Blumenthal asked these companies to do in the letter, read STAT’s Casey Ross’ scoop . Jay Shetty built his brand as a health influencer. But his relationship to science is murky. Jay Shetty’s influence is remarkable. On the 38-year-old’s podcast, “On Purpose,” he interviews a bevy of doctors, psychologists, and A-list celebrities on their best practices for healthy living; he also has nearly 4.5 million subscribers on YouTube. His numerous public appearances and connections have fashioned Shetty into a figure of health and spirituality for a fast-paced, modern world. But what has Shetty done with his platform? His health guidance is often stripped of context, designed to prop up his own business interests, or is downright unsubstantiated by science. The show has shared vague advice on how to “cancer proof” your body and offered misleading claims about inflammation and Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. STAT’s Alexa Lee has a deep dive into Shetty, exploring why he’s compelling to millions worldwide, and what his popularity says about the loss of trust in U.S. health institutions.

Ultra-processed food gets its first legal definition A lot of Americans are concerned about how ultra-processed food affects their health — but there’s still debate about exactly what ultra-processed food is, which tends to muddy the conversation about a category that could include everything from canned beans to Skittles. A new California law aimed at making school lunches healthier is particularly noteworthy for providing a legal definition. (STAT covered the bill when it was first proposed in March.) The bill, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday, defines ultra-processed foods as those that contain both high levels of sodium, added sugar, or saturated fat as well as additives like stabilizers, emulsifiers, and artificial flavors. California’s health department will further narrow down the definition for “ultra-processed foods of concern” based on factors like peer-reviewed scientific evidence and other state, federal, and international restrictions, with schools phasing out products that fall in the latter category over the next 10 years. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans this summer to provide a federal definition of ultra-processed foods , though there’s not yet a timeline for when that might be rolled out. — Sarah Todd No, circumcision doesn’t cause autism Kennedy made a wild claim during Thursday’s Cabinet meeting: “Children who were circumcised early have double the rates of autism.” He then said it’s “highly likely” that these findings are linked to Tylenol use, before adding “none of this is positive.” It is unclear where the secretary’s information is coming from. There are two studies that look at autism and circumcision, and neither of the investigations establish a robust association between the two, much less a causal relationship that would “double the rates of autism.” Kennedy also talked during the meeting about being shown a TikTok video where a pregnant woman was “gobbling Tylenol” and saying “F Trump,” asserting that every study investigating a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism showed “profound neurological and behavioral changes.” The science doesn’t back the secretary’s words up , as STAT’s Matt Herper has written. The Trump administration churns out a lot of baseless claims about health, especially autism. It would be impossible to fact check it all here, but it appears that Kennedy’s reshuffling of American health care policy is losing support from the public. To reiterate what Theresa wrote yesterday, 62% of Americans disapprove of how the secretary is handling vaccine policy, according to a recent KFF poll.

64a266566f1e,RFK Jr. says vaccines don’t save lives. He’s wrong,"children's health, infectious disease, public health, rfk jr., vaccines","With health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unable to prove his specious claims about the dangers of vaccines, he has pivoted. In a Sept. 29 Instagram post, Kennedy claims vaccines are ineffective, that is they are not the reason deaths from infectious diseases have dropped in the U.S. over the 20th century. Kennedy claims communicable disease mortality decreased long before vaccines and pharmaceuticals were developed. He argues that sanitation and nutrition are the real reasons Americans are living longer and no longer suffering from infectious diseases. His video is slick and persuasive, but incomplete and deceptive. Kennedy deserves credit for stressing the importance of sanitation and nutrition in reducing infectious diseases and death. In 1900, the average life expectancy in the U.S. was 47 years, and by 1953 — when the polio vaccine was first developed — it was nearly 69 years. Epidemiologists and demographers agree that most of that improvement is from the installation of sewage systems, availability of clean water, clean air, and better nutrition. However, today, the average life expectancy is nearly 80 years . That additional life expectancy improvement is not from sanitation, which has stayed roughly the same since 1953, nor from nutrition, which deteriorated after the 1980s largely due to the proliferation of ultra-processed foods. Vaccines — as well as smoking cessation, safer cars, antibiotics, blood pressure pills, and many other medical advances — are responsible for the dramatic improvement in Americans’ life expectancy since 1953. Vaccines have not only reduced mortality but also morbidity, and in many cases, they have even saved money. Contrary to Kennedy’s charts, sanitation and nutrition did not end deaths from infectious diseases. For instance, in 1950 , long after Kennedy’s cited sanitation and nutrition improvements, influenza/pneumonia was the sixth leading cause of death. Today, influenza/pneumonia is not in the top 10 causes of death. Nor is any other vaccine preventable disease. Indeed, influenza/pneumonia deaths per capita have declined threefold since 1950. This dramatic change is due primarily to vaccines and antibiotics. Vaccines may not have saved quite as many lives as sanitation and nutrition, but they still have saved millions of Americans. Kennedy’s own department has determined that childhood vaccines have prevented or will prevent 1.1 million deaths and 32 million hospitalizations just among Americans born between 1994 and 2023. Furthermore, despite Kennedy’s focus on mortality, health is about more than preventing death. Vaccines have immensely improved Americans’ quality of life. The polio vaccine on its own has saved hundreds of thousands of people from paralysis and other complications. In 1952, there were 58,000 polio cases with 21,000 people paralyzed annually for a population of about 155 million Americans . If we didn’t have a vaccine and the disease occurred at the same rate, today there would be over 150,000 polio cases and 45,000 cases of paralysis annually. By 1979, the polio vaccine brought the number of polio paralysis patients down to eight per year . As every mother from the 1950s would tell you, that is nothing short of a miracle. Similarly, before the Haemophilus influenzae vaccine, also known as Hib, was approved in 1985, Hib caused 10,000 cases of meningitis per year in children predominantly under 5 years of age, leading to lifelong neurological effects , including 3,000 cases of hearing loss, decrease in IQ, and sepsis. Today, the vaccine has almost completely eliminated Hib’s tragic consequences. And we cannot forget measles, Kennedy’s favorite bugaboo. Even after sanitation improvements, measles spread wildly, causing 1,000 U.S. cases per year of lifelong acute measles encephalitis and producing permanent brain damage. Introduced in 1963, the measles vaccine led to zero U.S. measles deaths in 1993 and elimination of the disease (including acute measles encephalitis) by 2000. Vaccination of all children, not sanitation, was what finally eliminated measles and the horrid brain damage it causes. Both measles deaths and cases have returned as vaccine hesitancy has grown, with more than 1,500 confirmed cases and three deaths occurring so far in 2025. Finally, Kennedy pretends that there is no economic cost when rates of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases rise. But without vaccines, health care spending would balloon, imposing costs not just on anti-vaxxers but on all of us. For instance, for every dollar spent on the MMR vaccine, the health care system saves over $13. Why? The direct medical cost of a measles case in the U.S. today is $1,793 . In 1962, the year before the measles vaccine, there were 549,000 recorded measles cases. Since then, the U.S. population has grown by a factor of 1.82. If doctors stop administering the MMR vaccine, as some in Kennedy’s circle urge, and transmission returns to previous levels, measles alone will cost the U.S. $1.79 billion annually. Before the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine there were 10,500 chickenpox hospitalizations per year. Today each chickenpox hospitalization costs $1,308-$38,268 . That’s $13.7 million at best, and $401 million at worst. Kennedy claims he is giving people information to make individual choices. But individuals’ choices to refuse vaccination have huge consequences for the rest of our society. The only way to justify forgoing vaccines would be if they caused harm greater than their benefit. That is not the case. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) definitively demonstrate that vaccines have been: 80%-90% effective against paralytic polio , 98% effective against HPV-induced precancer , 97% effective against measles , 90%-95% effective against Hib , 100% effective against severe chickenpox , and 85%-98% effective against the rotavirus that causes diarrhea in young children. These numbers do not even account for herd immunity and elimination, which magnify vaccines’ positive impact when there is high uptake. While Kennedy is right about the virtues of sanitation and nutrition in the early part of the 20th century, he is dead wrong about the ineffectiveness of vaccines in the later part of the 20th century. Vaccines have saved lives and reduced severe impairments like paralysis, brain damage, and hearing loss. And they have saved us billions of dollars, too.

5b63fb8e73bf,Jay Shetty and his health advice are everywhere. It’s by design,"health, mental health, wellness","Looking directly at the camera with alert, empathetic eyes, Jay Shetty asks: “Do you feel like you try and eat healthy, but you’re constantly tired by 3 p.m.?  Or maybe you’re trying to cut out junk food, and you’re finding it really difficult. Or maybe you’re someone who always feels bloated.” “Or,” he adds, “maybe you’re one of those people who’s thinking, ‘Jay, I need to get a gut test. I need to know what’s going on because I’m not feeling great,’” he says, hand gestures punctuating “not feeling great.” Pause. “If any of those are true for you,” he says, “this episode is for you.” The video , titled “5 Nutrition EXPERTS: The SHOCKING Healthy Foods That are Making You Fat (Food Lies HIDDEN From Us!)” is classic Shetty, exuding earnestness, promising change, and optimized for social media traction. Over the last few years, the 38 year old has built a wildly popular brand as a health and wellness public figure. He’s best known for his podcast, “On Purpose,” where he interviews doctors, psychologists, business leaders, motivational speakers, and A-list celebrities on their best practices for healthy living. With guests like Bill Gates, Khloe Kardashian, Casey Means , and venture capitalist-turned-immortality seeker Bryan Johnson, “On Purpose” has nearly 4.5 million subscribers on YouTube. It’s even bigger as audio, consistently listed as one of the top five health and fitness podcasts on Apple , with a reported 35 million downloads per month. And Shetty’s influence extends far beyond the world of podcasting. He’s well-connected in Hollywood, where he’s reportedly offered spiritual guidance for celebrities like Will Smith (who Shetty has called a “dear, dear spiritual brother and friend”) and Jennifer Lopez (who had Shetty officiate her 2023 wedding to Ben Affleck and later appeared in her 2024 film “This Is Me … Now: A Love Story”). In 2023, Shetty was invited to the White House to interview President Joe Biden about his mental health. Shetty is also the Chief Purpose Officer at the meditation app Calm, an ambiguously defined role that involves daily in-app meditations and HR webinars on self care. He’s written two books and founded the Jay Shetty Certification School life coaching program, the brand agency House of 1212 , as well as the tea line Juni . He’s also spoken about mindfulness to corporate clients like Deloitte, Google, and Novo Nordisk . Altogether, Shetty’s suite of businesses and public appearances portray him as a figure of health and spirituality for a fast-paced, modern world. But Shetty blends his message of mindfulness and healing with health guidance that’s often stripped of context, designed to prop up his own interests, or downright unsubstantiated by science. His show has shared vague advice on how to “cancer proof ” your body and misleading claims about inflammation, which one guest blamed for the high number of Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. while overlooking other, more significant factors . Shetty’s guests often have no formal health training or background. And even the doctors and other licensed health professionals on the show tend to be entrepreneurs selling their own three-day cleanse kits , anti-glucose spiking supplements , or member-exclusive medical spas . Shetty did not respond to multiple requests to be interviewed for this story. Experts told STAT that the monk entrepreneur is less of a health resource and more an example of the increasingly lucrative and poorly regulated wellness industry. Nevertheless, millions of people are listening to what Shetty has to say — a phenomenon that speaks as much to his successful branding as it does to people’s eagerness for solutions outside the current health care system. Who is Jay Shetty? From monk to mogul When it comes to Shetty’s origin story, there are two, periodically overlapping narratives — the one that Shetty offers up about himself and the one that has been documented by investigative reporters, former colleagues, and Shetty’s own digital paper trail. As Shetty tells it, which he does frequently , he grew up in north London and was attending university at Bayes Business School when he heard Gauranga Das, a Hindu monk, speak. He instantly felt connected to Das’ peaceful message and confident aura. After graduating, Shetty moved to an ashram in Mumbai for three years to meditate, study ancient scripture, and “serve with my fellow monks,” according to his 2020 book “Think Like a Monk.” Shetty eventually moved back to London after, he writes, Das told him “he believed I would be of greater value and service if I left the ashram and shared what I learned with the world.” But before that greater value and service could be fully realized, Shetty got a job in digital marketing strategy at the consulting firm Accenture, and became fascinated with social media. By 2016, he left the company to begin his career as a content creator, first as a video host and producer with HuffPost and then as an independent online personality. Shetty launched “On Purpose” in 2019 with the tagline, “The place you come to become happier, healthier, and more healed.” “On Purpose” elevated Shetty from a social media influencer into a mental health authority with his own Kenneth Cole fashion campaign and hand in multiple celebrity marriages . He has earned several fans in positions of power, such as Michelle Obama and Mehmet Oz , who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Earlier this summer, “On Purpose” partnered with Chase Sapphire to host a North America live podcast tour, complete with VIP packages with exclusive meditation sessions and meet-and-greets. But controversies regarding Shetty’s monk backstory and business practices have been well-documented. In 2019, comedian and YouTuber Nicole Arbour posted a video chronicling numerous incidents of Shetty presenting inspirational anecdotes and quotes online as his own without proper citation. Shetty later quietly added retroactive citations to his social media posts. And in 2024, journalist John McDermott published a scathing investigation into Shetty in the Guardian, detailing issues with online plagiarism as well as conflicting details surrounding his time as a monk. The investigation found that not only had Shetty been involved in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (also known as Iskcon or the Hare Krishna movement) years before he claimed to have met a monk for the first time, he also seems to have exaggerated the actual amount time spent at an ashram in India. While Shetty does not explicitly deny his ties to Iskcon now, he’s careful to never mention the religious organization in any capacity, which is notable given how much he otherwise discusses his monk history. Shetty’s brand merges health and spirituality Without medical credentials or professional mental health experience, much of Shetty’s authority stems from his years as a monk. He says as much in “Think Like a Monk,” where he writes, “If you wanted to innovate, you might investigate Elon Musk; you might study Beyoncé to learn how to perform. If you want to train your mind to find peace, calm and purpose? Monks are the experts.” And despite the inconsistencies in his backstory, Shetty has been able to build a highly visible, lucrative brand off his monk reputation. In “On Purpose,” Shetty covers a vast range of health-related topics, including depression, anxiety, finding motivation, building confidence, sleep hygiene, ADHD, dating and friendships, weight loss, gut health, cancer prevention, narcissism, manifestation, and telepathy. Experts with varying degrees of credentials are interviewed without any disclaimers or fact-checking. In one podcast episode, Shetty interviews nutritionist and podcaster Shawn Stevenson , who claims that just by adopting a healthy diet and exercise routine, he was able to cure his degenerative bone disease and herniated discs. It’s a sweeping claim with little nuance: While eating healthy has been shown to somewhat improve spinal and bone disease symptoms, total recoveries are rare, and rely on other factors beyond diet such as genetics and disease severity. In another interview, nutritionist and “cleanse expert” Elissa Goodman says that stage 4 cancer can be healed without “Western modalities” using a positive mindset and healthy diet. “I do believe you can heal from anything, almost,” Goodman said, also extolling detox cleanses , hypnotism , and at-home, shaman-guided psilocybin treatments. Not everything Shetty platforms on his show is unconfirmed by science. Numerous episodes feature doctors advising listeners to reduce ultra-processed foods for a healthier diet, sleep enough to support memory retention , and other life habits that have strong scientific consensus. The problem, experts told STAT, is that this advice is muddled together with unproven theories and soundbites that aren’t backed up by clinical studies. “Celebrities have the capacity to influence online without the domain expertise to provide health and medical advice,” said Stephanie Alice Baker, an associate professor in sociology at City St. George’s, University of London. “Their experience stands in for expertise, yet there are seldom consequences for sharing false, misleading or harmful advice.” Shetty “does spread a skewed view of health at times,” Mariah Wellman, an assistant professor at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University who researches the wellness industry, told STAT. For example, in an interview, surgeon, public speaker, and consultant Vonda Wright discusses the important role of sleep health in weight loss, a link that’s been demonstrated in numerous studies . A few minutes later, she tells listeners to avoid ingesting seed oils and inflammatory foods that can accelerate aging, advice that’s not fully substantiated by medical research and mentioned only in passing without additional context. While Wellman said that she sees Shetty as “someone who is trying to do right by the public in most cases,” she separately noted that “he uses themes tied to heavy emotions, combined with the use of experts to situate himself as the ultimate authority, when in fact, he has come under fire for his confusing backstory.” Newsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Outside of “On Purpose,” Shetty’s other entrepreneurial projects also rely on messaging that promises a healthier life. His tea brand Juni (short for “Just You And I”) features the slogan “where happiness meets function” and claims its adaptogen ingredients such as ashwagandha and reishi mushroom can protect brain health, improve memory, and reduce fatigue. Can a 12-ounce can of carbonated yuzu pineapple tea deliver on this promise? Not really, experts said. Adaptogens are a broad term used to describe any plant-based ingredient that helps your body adapt to stress, explained Rashmi Mullur, a clinical professor of medicine and director of Integrative Medicine Education at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Although some adaptogens have been studied in research trials and Mullur herself has suggested some patients take adaptogens tailored to their needs, she pointed out that products sold as supplements can advertise such ingredients as generally healthy irrespective of the actual science or quality of the product. “The only rule in the United States is that they cannot be a pharmacologic drug and can’t be thought of as a medication,” Mullur said. “If you’re looking for a trial on the benefits of drinking this tea, or any product with adaptogens that’s sold on the market, you will never find one. That is just not something the wellness industry participates in.” Shetty did not respond to requests for an interview with STAT, but has previously commented on criticisms about his paradoxical status as a monk and social media figure. “They want me to not be who I truly am,” Shetty said of his critics in a 2023 interview . “And they want to find that angle on me constantly, because they don’t want to accept that someone who is trying to be good at heart, is doing good at the work, and winning is okay.” For $7,400, a Shetty credential In his business efforts, Shetty’s career has been buoyed by people who empathize with his calls for healthier, happier living. Nowhere is that dynamic more evident than in his life coaching program, the Jay Shetty Certification School. Composed of online group classes, practice coaching sessions, and self-study, the school program costs up to $7,400 to enroll in and is accredited by the Association for Coaching. (Prior to the Guardian investigation, the JSCS website falsely claimed accreditations from other institutions as well.) Life coaches, who are not licensed therapists or medical practitioners, lead most of the program, and Shetty himself only appears periodically for group sessions or in pre-recorded videos . Andrea Borges first discovered Shetty from “On Purpose” and quickly became a fan. Burnt out from her managerial role at work, she decided to enroll in the Jay Shetty Certification School, saying she “resonated deeply with a lot of the messaging.” Two years after graduating and now working as a mindset and healing coach, Borges remains grateful for the lessons and relationships she gained regardless of Shetty’s controversies. “This to me is an important lesson not to put any one person on a pedestal,” she said. Borges told STAT that she was not aware of Shetty’s controversies until after she graduated from JSCS, and had an “overall very positive” experience with the program. Veronica Caulfield, another JSCS graduate and life coach, feels similarly. After completing the certification program last April, Caulfield, 43, founded her own life coaching practice and left her career in operations management. “It’s been a year of transformation … and it’s amazing,” Caulfield said. Caulfield also credits JSCS — which she first learned about through social media ads — with helping improve her relationships with friends and family members. She views her journey as separate from any messy details involving Shetty. JSCS encouraged her to “explore my authentic self, and I got to work with other coaches and be coached,” she said. “That’s what I want to see more of in the world.” What Shetty’s popularity says about health institutions Borges’ and Caulfield’s experiences speak to a critical aspect of Shetty’s popularity and influence: His message to take mental health and physical wellbeing seriously is compelling to millions worldwide, misinformation and controversies be damned. “People aren’t getting duped by the wellness industry because they can’t figure out something better,” Mullur said. “They’re desperate for help and they’re desperate for information.” The rise of wellness influencers like Shetty also coincides with a period of unique health stressors and a loss of trust in the medical mainstream, experts said. “Insurance rates are going up for many, costs in general are increasing, and the relationship with medical professionals is strained as we rely more heavily on technology like telehealth and chatbots to connect with medical staff,” Wellman noted. “People are willing to try anything to secure their wellbeing, including purchasing products and participating in trends they find online.” Irrespective of Shetty’s problematic record in delivering health information, his growing influence speaks to health institutions’ failure to meet the need for trustworthy medical insights. “I don’t know any of my patients who are not struggling with the weight of the world right now,” Mullur said. “But I think it gives us an opportunity in medicine to broaden our conversation around how psychosocial and traumatic stress influence and impact our health outside of just the conventional medical model.”",https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/10/jay-shetty-profile-on-purpose-podcast-host,Health,BBC,Alexa Lee,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SHETTY_ILLO_v1-1024x576.jpg,2025-10-10T08:30:00+00:00,8b697c72e9c2cf692728ebf72e7a648931c2725c

My mom began talking about downsizing right after my dad died. “It’s just me and the dog in this place,” she’d say, her voice echoing down the hallway as I called her on the way home from work.

I tried to help her fill the space, spending a night or two a week at her place, but the silence remained. The signs were subtle at first. She fell again, this time off the front steps, bruising her ribs on the garden fence. Her car was back in the shop after she scraped the passenger side pulling out of the garage. A quiet hesitation had begun to shape her movements. So, when she said she wanted to tour continuing care communities a few months later, I was a little relieved. The director welcomed us with a practiced smile and a sales pitch that was a carefully rehearsed story of belonging. She spoke about the community like it was a private club; there were Sunday brunches, concerts, garden walks, and book clubs. “Limited availability,” she said more than once, as if we’d stumbled onto something rare. As we drove home, my mom said she had a good feeling about it while “Turn! Turn! Turn!” by the Byrds played softly on the radio. A few months later, the call came: A unit was available. Moving my mother in was a massive undertaking, both physically and emotionally. Like many boomers, she had accumulated a lot over the years. We stood there, surrounded by crates, preparing for a move that could only hold a fraction of it all. My mom had been a potter for nearly three decades. Her home was filled with teapots, mugs, and sculptural pieces, sturdy and delicate at once, like her. We wrapped each one in bubble wrap. In her new apartment, we unwrapped them slowly, placing them on shelves to make it feel like home. My son gleefully popped the bubbles with his feet. She eventually settled in, made a few friends, walked the grounds until she found her rhythm in the newness. Things felt stable for a while, until Covid hit. Lockdowns came fast: no visitors, meals left at the door, activities disappeared from the calendar. Around that time, her official Alzheimer’s diagnosis was confirmed, during a FaceTime call on her patio with a neurologist I’d found. The conversation felt both sudden and inevitable. Not long after, she fell and broke her wrist, prompting a call from the director. “She’s now a liability to her own safety,” she said. We needed to decide whether to move her onto the nursing floor or bring in full-time private care. Covid was still tearing through nursing homes, so we layered on care; a second caregiver, then a third. I’m acutely aware of our privilege, not only because she was able to live in a place like this, but because we could afford to expand support when she needed it. The day-to-day responsibilities shifted to me: her pills, her groceries, her connection to the world. Aging in place had always sounded like a comfort, but it turned out to be far less clear-cut. There’s no straight line, just a series of decisions, none quite right, all trying to hold up a promise that was never built to bend. One infection landed her in the hospital for five days. As I rushed to the emergency room, I knew nothing would be the same after this. We had toured the nursing floor before. It felt clinical and quiet, more hospital than home. But she was increasingly in harm’s way, and it was time to move her there. The nursing floor was a different world. Thirty residents assigned to two aides during the day, with even fewer at night. If someone needed to be taken to the bathroom, they pressed the call button and waited — sometimes for close to an hour. State law requires two assisted showers a week, but even that was been inconsistent. Layna Portugal in a hospital emergency room in Evanston, Ill. Courtesy Emily Portugal She needed help getting out of bed and getting dressed. There were days she was left for hours after waking, likely in a wet diaper which opened the door for more infections. One doctor was assigned to her care, but I never saw him. After several unanswered calls, I moved on, relying instead on the counsel of her neurologist, who always responded to my emails. Checking in became a daily routine, calling the nursing station to confirm she’d had her shower. The small things added up, and keeping track of them became its own kind of job. Amid it all, there were kind people — aides who noticed the little things. We kept her main caretaker, Maria, on during the day. She had been with us through the pandemic and remains very close with my mom. Maria was a full partner in her care, advocating for her and often raising concerns about staff or procedures. But turnover was been relentless. After the community was bought by a private equity group last year, there was been a clear push to cut costs and corners. Having spent years in corporate roles, I recognized the signs. The quality of the service and food deteriorated. They brought in contract certified nursing assistants who didn’t know the residents, rushed through care, and treated her like a task. Over time, she wasn’t seen the way she used to be. The slow shift from person to patient had taken hold, another quiet casualty in the math of profit over people. My mom had been vomiting for days, and I only knew because of my daily call — no one seemed concerned. The director of nursing said she’d keep an eye on her. (She didn’t.) When we left for the ER the next day, I wasn’t sure we’d be coming back, as her blood pressure was dangerously low. At the hospital, she got full attention and round-the-clock care. I spent those days walking the halls, talking with friends and family who helped me face our next chapter: hospice. The toll hit hard. Watching my mom slip away in a place that promised so much but gave so little drained me. I’m always on edge, trying to catch what keeps slipping through the cracks. One Sunday, I took her to the living room off the lobby to sit by the fire as other families walked by on their way to brunch. Her eyes were closed tight, and I held her hand even though she didn’t hold mine back. Her skin and hair were dirty, her shirt stained from the day before. In that moment, a mix of despair and fury washed over me. The whole system feels fragile, and with critical programs like Medicaid and Medicare increasingly under threat, families already struggling will face even harder choices. My heart breaks thinking about those who don’t have the buffer we’ve been so fortunate to have. Through all of it, people showed up. Aides, nurses, companions — underpaid and stretched thin, offering care with quiet dignity. They became familiar faces in moments that felt anything but, and I think about them all the time. They remind me of flowers blooming through cracks in the pavement, holding more than anyone sees, holding us. As I recently headed in to see my mom, I came across a man in the parking lot, perhaps 10 years older than me, rolling a cart filled with what looked like his father’s belongings. A small cabinet, some folded overcoats, and a cardboard box of dishes balanced precariously on top. He was rushing when the box slipped and hit the pavement with force, china plates breaking into pieces as shards scattered across the ground. He let out a quick, nervous laugh. “We will probably need to get rid of those anyway,” he said, not looking up. We picked up what we could and placed it back inside the box. His eyes met mine, and I said, “I’m so sorry.” He assured me it was OK, and in my mind, I assured him that I knew firsthand that it was not. “Well, for what it’s worth, you got great distance,” I joked, and he let out a sharp laugh of relief. I knew what he was feeling. It was not just about the dishes, it never is. It was a small moment, but it carried the weight of something larger. The sound of things breaking, the finality of letting go, the instinct to hold it together anyway. We move our people into these places with their important things. We wrap what matters in bubble wrap and place it on shelves. We trust the care will expand as their needs do. More of us are in that space now, learning what it means to care for the people who once cared for us. Some days it’s advocacy — other days, it’s grief. Most often, it’s just showing up to catch what might fall. There’s a quiet solidarity in that, not marked by grand gestures, but by moments like this: noticing what breaks, and staying to gather the pieces.

c7e55a67f66d,Tagovailoa calls out some Dolphins for player meeting attendance,,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said the team has several ""little things"" to clean up following its 1-5 start, including attendance at player-led meetings. Shortly after Miami's 29-27 loss Sunday to the Los Angeles Chargers , Tagovailoa was asked how players can refrain from feeling sorry for themselves. The Dolphins have now lost four games this season in which they trailed by one score in the final two minutes. Tagovailoa, who threw the go-ahead touchdown but also three interceptions, mentioned possible changes to player-led meetings throughout the week. ""I think it starts with the leadership in helping articulate that for the guys and then what we're expecting out of the guys,"" he said. ""We're expecting this -- are we getting that? Are we not getting that? We have guys showing up to players-only meetings late, guys not showing up to players-only meetings. There's a lot that goes into that. Do we have to make this mandatory? Do we not have to make this mandatory? ""It's a lot of things of that nature that we've got to get cleaned up, and it starts with little things like that."" Tua Tagovailoa said Sunday that some Dolphins players are showing up late or not showing up at all to player-led meetings. Sam Navarro-Imagn Images The Dolphins had just a 6% chance to win Sunday's game entering the fourth quarter, according to Next Gen Stats, as Los Angeles led by 10 points. But Miami scored 14 unanswered points, taking a one-point lead on Tagovailoa's 7-yard pass to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining in the game. The Chargers returned the ensuing kickoff to Miami's 41-yard line, however, and quarterback Justin Herbert connected with Ladd McConkey for a 42-yard gain on second down to set up the winning field goal. Tagovailoa called the loss a ""shock"" before revealing the team's internal issues with its player-led meetings. He took responsibility for his three turnovers, and shifted his focus to Miami's game in Week 7 against the Cleveland Browns . ""The only place we can go is next week,"" he said. ""We talk about figuring this out. We talk about getting it together collectively. What are the problems, what are the issues and are they getting fixed? Are they not getting fixed? Why are they not getting fixed? Or if they're fixed, how are we not allowing it to happen again? Things of that nature. ""We've got to look at the film again, we've got to see where we can go. I contributed to a lot of that as well with the three turnovers. You can't do that and expect to win games."" Linebacker Jordyn Brooks , who, like Tagovailoa, is a team captain, declined to comment on the Dolphins' player meetings when asked. Coach Mike McDaniel said player-led meetings are ""outside of what I demand"" and he has seen players hold themselves accountable within what he has asked them to do. ""We've been very accountable to me,"" McDaniel said. ""It sounds like there was something on his mind in regard to the specific meetings with a couple individuals that he was trying to get corrected ... with direct communication. I think that's the only way to lead as far as where we've been at as a program. I think we've opened the air on all of that and it's very clear how we hold people accountable and with all those things. ""Clearly he's sending a message, but from my standpoint, everything that I've asked of the guys, they have delivered on. I'm sure whomever he is talking to, they'll deliver as well."" Tardiness and absences were a prevalent issue within the Dolphins organization last year, when McDaniel said he frequently fined players to no avail. A source who previously played for Miami under McDaniel told ESPN that players were frequently late to meetings and practice dating back to McDaniel's first season in 2022, but the behavior wasn't reprimanded because the team was winning games. That same source said the frequency and severity of players' punctuality was exacerbated by last year's struggles, when Miami rebounded from a 2-6 start to finish 8-9. Multiple sources confirmed to ESPN that Jalen Ramsey and Tyreek Hill were the most notable frequent offenders. Miami traded Ramsey to the Pittsburgh Steelers this offseason while Hill was placed on injured reserve after sustaining a season-ending dislocated knee in Week 4. McDaniel said it's difficult to lose games in the final minutes, as the Dolphins have done four times this season. He pointed to his players' perseverance Sunday as a positive sign but insisted there are no moral victories at this level. He also said he and his staff will collectively work to solve the Dolphins' late-game issues. ""I try to find themes for things that are occurring. Each game is unique to its own,"" McDaniel said. ""I was looking to make sure that this team didn't fall victim to, 'all right man, we want to win, but oh shoot, here we go again.' And fortunately, or unfortunately, I got to find that information out in the third quarter -- because there's where the team quits if the losses have beat them down too much. It wasn't the case. ""They fought back, and I was proud of that, but it's not what we're looking for. There's zero victory that would be considered moral. However, I think it's reasonable to have expectation that we have our best performance at the end of games as we continue to work as a team. Otherwise, we'll be forced to deal with the same result.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46575310/tagovailoa-calls-some-dolphins-player-meeting-attendance,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559308_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,ddd50e9ac0b6c476ea6aed160f1d416d4ab8c321
9c076d59d735,49ers lose top LB Fred Warner to season-ending ankle injury,,"TAMPA, Fla. -- Since entering the league in 2018, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Fred Warner has missed only one game out of a possible 122 because of injury. Which is why, when Warner departed Sunday's 30-19 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with a broken and dislocated right ankle in the first quarter, his teammates were sick, in disbelief or some combination of the two. Warner's injury will require surgery and he will miss the rest of the season, coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game. ""He's one of our best players, also a huge leader, so obviously a huge blow,"" Shanahan said. ""I feel bad for Fred right now."" Warner suffered the devastating injury with just under eight minutes left in the opening quarter. On first-and-10 at Tampa Bay's 36, running back Rachaad White ran off left tackle for a gain of 10 yards. As Warner attempted to turn to corral White, who cut inside him, Niners safety Ji'Ayir Brown brought White down and his legs rolled into the back of Warner's ankle. Brown reacted quickly, knowing that Warner might be seriously hurt, and teammates quickly put their hands on their heads and dropped to a knee as they watched San Francisco's medical staff surround Warner. After the game, Brown was emotional describing the loss of Warner, a player he said has been like a ""big brother"" to him. ""I was right there when it happened,"" Brown said. ""Seeing him go down, a guy that doesn't go down, you know what I mean? It's draining. I think it kind of drained the stadium. Everybody felt that."" Within a couple minutes of Warner's injury, Niners medical and training staff placed his right foot and ankle in an air cast and he was taken to the locker room on a cart. Before he departed, Niners players surrounded him on the cart and wished him well as the seriousness of the injury seemed to hit them. Wide receiver Jauan Jennings said he had to take some nausea medicine because he was ""sick to his stomach"" watching Warner leave with the injury while others noted the shock at seeing a player who has made a career of being available in such condition. ""It's heartbreaking,"" left tackle Trent Williams said. ""Fred, not only is he one of the best linebackers to ever play the game, but he is the heart and soul of this team, not just the heart and soul of this defense. It's one thing to see somebody go down and go to the blue tent and nobody really knows what's going on. When you see a guy that's injured like that, it's really like a gut punch. It's really hard to continue the intensity and playing that game like that never happened."" With Warner in the locker room, the 49ers turned to second-year linebacker Tatum Bethune to handle middle linebacker duties, though weak side linebacker Dee Winters had the green dot on his helmet and handled communication with coordinator Robert Saleh. Although the 49ers gave up touchdown drives to the Bucs on three of their first four full possessions after Warner's departure, Bethune led the team in tackles with 10 in Warner's stead. Shanahan indicated after the game that Bethune will get the first opportunity to replace Warner for the rest of the season. Bethune, who was a seventh-round pick in the 2024 draft, has one NFL start to his name, the 2024 season finale in Arizona in which he had three tackles on 39 defensive snaps. ""You prepare as a starter for reasons like this,"" Bethune said. ""Fred getting hurt was unfortunate but this is why we are all professionals and we've all got a job to do."" Even as Warner was taken to the locker room on the cart, teammates said he was going out of his way to encourage them to keep going and try to beat the Bucs. Warner stayed in Raymond James Stadium for the entire game and Shanahan had him address the team in the locker room when the game was over. Warner's message: There's a lot of football left to play and a lot of things the Niners can accomplish, even without him. ""It's obviously tough losing him and he's our brother and it sucks but we have got a lot of football left,"" linebacker Luke Gifford said. ""And we've got the tools to win games."" Warner's injury wasn't just felt in the Niners' locker room either. Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield opened his postgame news conference by sending thoughts and prayers to Warner. Tampa Bay coach Todd Bowles echoed that sentiment. ""It was sickening,"" Bowles said. ""He's one of the best players in the league. A great guy on top of that. You hate to see something like that happen. Hopefully he has a speedy recovery. That kind of breaks your heart no matter what side of the ball you're on."" Warner has been the leader of San Francisco's defense since his arrival in 2018 and was positioned to break Hall of Fame linebacker Patrick Willis' franchise record for tackles in a career Sunday before the injury. He needed five tackles to reach that mark and had one at the time of the injury. For the Niners, picking up the pieces from losing Warner will be made even more difficult by the fact that his injury isn't the only significant one they're dealing with on defense. They lost star defensive end Nick Bosa to a torn ACL in his right knee in Week 3, and he, too, is out for the season. Which means the 49ers will play the final 11 games of the year without their two best and most indispensable defenders on top of already playing chunks or all of the season without tight end George Kittle (hamstring), quarterback Brock Purdy (toe), receivers Ricky Pearsall (knee), Brandon Aiyuk (knee) and Jennings (ankle, ribs, shoulder). Jennings revealed after the game that the injuries that have limited him this season have mounted in more ways than previously known. He said he played Sunday with five broken ribs, a shoulder he estimated at about 20% healthy, and has had both high and low ankle sprains. ""Everyone know it's difficult when you lose your better and your leaders,"" Shanahan said. ""It's tough. It's huge with Nick, obviously huge with Fred. Hopefully we'll get Kittle back here and some of the other guys, but that's going to give opportunities to other guys. These are the moments guys got to step it up. I'm glad that we played some decent football to put us in this position, at least with the record, and we've got to find a way to get better everywhere else throughout this year.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46574756/banged-49ers-lose-top-lb-fred-warner-ankle-injury,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559292_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e5a34d512476864ff64ab761669c8ba2283e2c71
4a9108d5d356,"Rico Dowdle backs up talk, steamrolls Cowboys for 239 yards",,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle didn't hesitate when asked what his postgame message was to the Dallas Cowboys after telling his former team to ""buckle up'' heading into Sunday's 30-27 victory at Bank of America Stadium. ""They wasn't buckled up,'' Dowdle deadpanned. Not even close. Dowdle had a team-record 239 scrimmage yards against the team that chose not to re-sign him after the 2024 season, making him the seventh player in NFL history to have at least 230 scrimmage yards in consecutive games. His 473 scrimmage yards the past two games smashed the team two-game record of 416 held by Christian McCaffrey and helped Carolina (3-3) reach the .500 mark for the first time since it was 5-5 in Week 10 of 2021. Dowdle's effort also opened up a conversation about who will start once Chuba Hubbard returns from a calf injury that has sidelined him the past two weeks. ""A great question,'' coach Dave Canales said after Carolina improved to 3-0 at home this season with a road game against the 0-6 New York Jets next. ""We're going to figure that part out. But I know Rico is doing a great job, and he will be a big part of what we're doing.'' The Cowboys (2-3-1) and their league-worst defense weren't ready for Dowdle from the outset. Dowdle had 21 yards rushing on his first two carries and caught a 13-yard pass on Carolina's fourth play to set up a field goal. He had a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Bryce Young less than two minutes into the second half to put the Panthers up 20-17. He celebrated that one by spinning the ball and then pretending to shovel dirt on a grave. Burying Dallas wouldn't be as easy as Dowdle bowling over defenders seemed. The Panthers needed a walk-off 33-yard field goal by rookie Ryan Fitzgerald to get the win. That's ultimately what Dowdle wanted the most. ""Definitely,'' said Dowdle, who spent his first five seasons in Dallas after being an undrafted free agent out of South Carolina in 2020. ""I've been saying all week the main thing is I just wanted to get that win. ""Big, big for me, but also big the organization. Getting to .500 and protecting the home field ... just got to keep building.'' Dowdle admitted the game was ""a little personal'' after the Cowboys didn't meet his financial demands following his first 1,000 yard rushing season a year ago. Young, whose five touchdown passes in two games tied for the most he has had over that span since being the top pick of the 2023 draft, smiled when asked if he noticed the game meant more than normal to Dowdle. ""Yeah, of course,'' he said. ""Rico is a competitor. That just speaks to the dawg he is. We knew it was personal. We wanted to have his back. That's our brother. ... If it's personal to him, it's personal to us.'' It almost became historical. Dowdle was 17 yards rushing shy of becoming only the fifth player since 1970 to have 200 in consecutive games. O.J. Simpson did it twice. Earl Campbell, Ricky Williams and Jay Ajayi did it once each. Dowdle's 230-plus yards in consecutive games put him in the company of Jim Brown (Browns), Walter Payton (Bears), Marshall Faulk (Rams), Deuce McAllister (Saints), Josh Gordon (Browns) and Le'Veon Bell (Steelers). This from a back who had 33 touches, 103 yards and one touchdown in the first four games. ""I didn't realize that part,'' Dowdle said of the historical nature of his feat that included breaking McCaffrey's single-game team record (237) for scrimmage yards. ""But definitely special to be able to come here and get in the history books.'' Dowdle wasn't perfect, though. He took full blame for a lateral from wide receiver Xavier Legette that turned into a fumble, pleading with Legette to toss him the ball on a play that initially looked like a bad decision by the receiver. ""That's on me,'' Dowdle said. ""I told the coaches the same thing. [Coach] told me don't make that stuff up.'' Dowdle's storybook run that could land him in the starting lineup is something you can't make up either. It's something few, if any, anticipated when he signed a one-year, $3 million deal that could reach $6.5 million with incentives to back up Hubbard. It certainly got the attention of the Cowboys. ""He told us to buckle up,'' quarterback Dak Prescott said. ""He got the last laugh.''

It means Shohei Ohtani will get just one start in the series, during the middle leg back in Los Angeles. ""He'll pitch at some point, but we just don't know which day,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said on Sunday. Unlike in previous spots, the Dodgers are not concerned with pitching Ohtani before a day off, choosing to maximize rest for the other starters as the team embarks on its first best-of-seven series this postseason. ""Not as important,"" Roberts said. ""I think just appreciating having four starters in a potential seven-game series and who can pitch potentially twice, and that's kind of the impetus, versus Shohei having that day off after a game."" Ohtani is hitting just .148 this month with a 4.50 ERA over six postseason innings. Roberts was asked if the pitching plan for him was related to his slump at the plate. ""No, not at all,"" Roberts answered. ""I think it was just kind of Shohei's going to pitch one game this series. So, it's one game and then you have two other guys that potentially can pitch on regular rest."" The Brewers are likely to counter with an opener in Game 1 before handing the ball to a starter for ""bulk"" innings. ""Game 1 looks, 'OK, who on our team that can give us length,'"" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. ""[Jose] Quintana , [Quinn] Priester , something like that -- give us bulk."" Murphy indicated righty Freddy Peralta would start Game 2 and then they'll figure out Game 3 after that. He wasn't sure yet if rookie Jacob Misiorowski would start a game or pitch multiple innings out of the bullpen. ""I don't know,"" Murphy stated. ""I really don't know. That hasn't been concrete yet. There's a possibility he'd start."" Rosters don't have to be turned in until Monday morning, but the Dodgers are considering carrying just two catchers as Will Smith 's hand injury isn't a big concern.

e998e4bf4bd8,NCAAF,,"Oct 12, 2025, 02:02 PM ET Penn State has fired coach James Franklin after 12 seasons, the school announced Sunday. Franklin is owed more than $49 million, according to his contract. It's the second-biggest buyout in college football history behind only Jimbo Fisher's $76 million buyout from Texas A&M . Associate head coach Terry Smith will serve as the Nittany Lions' interim head coach for the remainder of the season, the school said. No other staff changes are expected at Penn State, a source told ESPN's Heather Dinich. Less than a year removed from an appearance in the College Football Playoff semifinals, Franklin's program appeared to hit a new low when the Nittany Lions traveled out to Los Angeles two weeks ago only to lose to UCLA , a team that not only was winless but hadn't previously held a lead all season. The woes flew back home with the team to Penn State, and with them came ""Fire Franklin!"" chants at Beaver Stadium on Saturday. The Nittany Lions dropped their second straight home game, and third overall, when they fell to Northwestern 22-21 in front of a stunned crowd at Happy Valley. With the two losses, Penn State became the first team since the FBS and FCS split in 1978 to lose consecutive games while favored by 20 or more points in each game, according to ESPN Research. In Saturday's defeat to the Wildcats, the Nittany Lions committed six penalties for 71 yards in the first half alone. They simply could never get out of their own way, and that was before quarterback Drew Allar suffered a season-ending injury in the fourth quarter. Earlier in the season, when the losing streak began against Oregon at Happy Valley, Franklin fell to 4-21 at Penn State against AP top-10 opponents, including 1-18 against top-10 Big Ten teams in conference games. Franklin's .160 winning percentage against AP top-10 teams is tied for the third-worst record by a coach (minimum 25 games) at a single school since the poll era began in 1936, according to ESPN Research. Hired in 2014 in the wake of Bill O'Brien's departure for the NFL, Franklin inherited a team still feeling the effects of unprecedented NCAA sanctions in the wake of Jerry Sandusky's sexual-abuse crimes. Armed with relentless optimism and an ability to recruit, Franklin's program regularly churned out NFL-level talent, from Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley to Green Bay Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons. Franklin guided the Nittany Lions to the 2016 Big Ten title and a seemingly permanent spot in the rankings. Losses vs. AP-ranked team 29 as AP top-10 team 19 vs. AP top-10 team 21 AP top-10 matchup 12 There was hope this fall might be the season when Penn State would finally break through and win its third national championship and first since 1986. Yet after three easy wins during a light nonconference schedule, the Nittany Lions crumbled. Athletic director Pat Kraft said the school owes Franklin an ""enormous amount of gratitude"" for leading the Nittany Lions back to relevance but felt it was time to make a change. ""We hold our athletics programs to the highest of standards, and we believe this is the right moment for new leadership at the helm of our football program to advance us toward Big Ten and national championships,"" Kraft said. The move will cost Penn State at a time the athletic department has committed to a $700 million renovation to Beaver Stadium. The project is expected to be completed by 2027. Former athletic director Sandy Barbour signed Franklin to a 10-year contract extension worth up to $85 million in 2021. According to terms of the deal, Penn State will have to pay Franklin's base salary of $500,000, supplemental pay of $6.5 million and an insurance loan of $1 million until 2031. It's a steep price, but one the university appears willing to pay to find a coach who can complete the climb to a national title. ""We have the best college football fans in America, a rich tradition of excellence, significant investments in our program, compete in the best conference in college sports and have a state-of-the-art renovated stadium on the horizon,"" Kraft said. ""I am confident in our future and in our ability to attract elite candidates to lead our program.""

8e4cd8151efd,Glenn defends Justin Fields despite Jets' -10 net pass yards,,"It was the worst passing performance in New York Jets history, and yet the focal point of the debacle -- quarterback Justin Fields -- received a strong vote of confidence from coach Aaron Glenn, who scolded a reporter for asking if he would consider a quarterback change. ""What kind of question is that?"" Glenn said after the Jets fell to 0-6 with a 13-11 loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. ""There are guys that have bad games,"" the coach added. ""That doesn't mean you just bench them. Come on, you know better than that."" It wasn't just a bad game; it was all-time bad. Afterward, star wide receiver Garrett Wilson , who made only three catches for 13 yards, questioned the playcalling. To make it worse, Wilson, arguably their best player, suffered an injury to one of his knee ligaments, a source told ESPN. He will have an MRI upon returning to New Jersey. The NFL's only winless team finished with a franchise-low minus-10 net passing yards, the worst by any team in nearly three decades. The San Diego Chargers recorded minus-19 yards on Sept. 20, 1998, against the Kansas City Chiefs . Fields completed 9 of 17 passes for 45 yards, and he lost 55 yards on nine sacks, resulting in the negative net total. Several factors contributed to the futility, including conservative playcalling by offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand and occasional pass-protection breakdowns. ""The passing game was nonexistent,"" Glenn said. Jets quarterback Justin Fields was sacked nine times, losing 55 yards Sunday as the Jets finished with a franchise-low minus-10 net passing yards against the Broncos. Kirby Lee/Imagn Images Fields was pressured on 14 of 29 dropbacks (48%), according to NFL Next Gen Stats, but much of that was the result of him holding the ball too long in the pocket. At times, he didn't see open receivers. This wasn't a new trend. Last week, he was sacked five times in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys . ""I understand where you guys are trying to take this, but listen,"" said Glenn, when questioned about Fields' job status. ""There's a number of other guys that have to pick their game up too, so I don't want to sit there and pin this all on Justin. ""You just can't sit there and say, 'Oh man, we're going to bench him,' because I thought in some other games he's played well. So I'm not looking at this as just, 'Man, he played the bad game, we're going to bench him.' I don't see it that way."" The worst sequence came at the end of the first half, when the Jets had a fourth-and-1 at their 47-yard line and didn't run another play even though there were 32 seconds on the clock. The offense showed no urgency on the drive, which consisted of 10 plays, including a successful conversion on a fake punt. It was baffling. An irate Wilson gave an earful to Glenn as they walked off the field at halftime. Glenn excused Wilson's outburst, chalking it up to competitive fire. Afterward, Wilson still was simmering with frustration. ""I just didn't know exactly what the plan was,"" he said, explaining his exchange with Glenn. ""Once I figured it out, I was disappointed. I'll just say that."" Wilson also said, ""I think we've got to truly have a 'We've got nothing to lose' mentality. If that's how we feel, it's got to be obvious. If you're out there as a player, you should feel like, 'Oh, yeah, let's go.' ""Even on the TV, I feel like y'all should see that. As a fan base watching the team and the media, y'all should be able to tell we're playing like we have nothing to lose. I don't think that was evident today. I think that's where we've got to ... we're 0-6. Let's let it fly. I'll say that."" Glenn's explanation for the botched two-minute drive was questionable. In essence, he said he didn't want to give the ball back to the Broncos before halftime, knowing the Jets would receive the second-half kickoff. Glenn wanted the back-to-back possessions, content to take a 10-6 deficit into the intermission. ""I think the biggest thing is, our thought was not let them end the half with the ball,"" Fields said. ""We wanted to end the half with the ball. We were trying to play it like that."" It was one of many curious decisions for the Jets, who dropped to 0-6 for only the third time in franchise history. Their longest pass play was 11 yards, and they finished with 82 total net yards, the third lowest in a single game in franchise history. ""It wasn't good enough, and it starts with me,"" Fields said. ""I have to get the ball out. They've got a good D-line. They got to the backfield fast. Once you get into that rhythm, you have to go one, two and get the hell up out of there."" Guard John Simpson added: ""To not crack 100 yards total is kind of crazy.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46573305/glenn-defends-justin-fields-jets-10-net-pass-yards,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559187_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,64bb73d99d04643b2b2111e83fcce4c61c558425
8b62a48eb7b6,UAB fires football coach Trent Dilfer after 3rd straight loss,,"UAB fired former Super Bowl-winning quarterback Trent Dilfer as its head coach on Sunday, a day after the Blazers lost their third straight game, 53-33 at Florida Atlantic , to fall to 2-4 this season. Dilfer, 53, had a 9-21 record in two-plus seasons at UAB. ""We agree that -- unfortunately -- our on-field performance has not lived up to the standard of winning we have for the program,"" athletic director Mark Ingram said in a statement announcing the decision. ""I wish Coach Dilfer the best and thank him for his class, tireless work and commitment during his tenure at UAB. ""While his efforts did not translate into a winning record, each young man who played for him will be a better person as a result."" Alex Mortensen, the son of late NFL analyst Chris Mortensen, will serve as interim coach. Former NFL veteran Trent Dilfer was named coach of UAB football in November 2022 following a successful four-year run coaching private high school Lipscomb Academy. Dilfer went 9-21 in his two-plus seasons with the Blazers. Randy Sartin/Imagn Images A 14-year NFL veteran, Dilfer was a surprising choice to take over the UAB program after Bill Clark retired for health reasons before the 2022 season. Then-interim coach Bryant Vincent, now at Louisiana-Monroe, guided the Blazers to a 7-6 record that season, and Dilfer's hiring was announced Nov. 30, 2022. Dilfer had never coached in college, and his only experience had come during a highly successful four-year stint at Lipscomb Academy, a private high school in Nashville, from 2019 to 2022. The Blazers went 4-8 in Dilfer's first season in 2023 and 3-9 in 2024. This season, UAB's only victories came in narrow wins against FCS program Alabama State and Akron . The Blazers rank last in scoring defense (41.3 points) in the American Athletic Conference. UAB and Tulane are the league's most penalized teams, averaging 8.5 penalties per game. Dilfer, a former ESPN analyst, was the No. 6 pick in the NFL draft by Tampa Bay in 1994. A 1997 Pro Bowler, Dilfer appeared in 130 games, throwing for 20,518 yards, 113 touchdowns and 129 interceptions.",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46575973/uab-blazers-fire-football-coach-trent-dilfer,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559360_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,18ed68de665e0540fdc89ea2c000acf0d7d28966
3bcf19c3ca55,NFL,,"INDIANAPOLIS -- The Colts were going about their usual Sunday morning routines ahead of their 1 p.m. ET kickoff against the Arizona Cardinals when a seemingly normal day became anything but routine. Backup quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr ., before even leaving the locker room, sustained a bizarre injury while using elastic bands to stretch for the game. The incident left Richardson with an orbital fracture, according to coach Shane Steichen, and required hospitalization. A source told ESPN that Richardson was also expected to need stitches. The specifics were murky, but the source said the incident happened when an apparatus players use to attach the warmup bands to malfunctioned, resulting in an impact with Richardson's face. Richardson was inactive for the 31-27 victory over Arizona and could miss more time. No. 3 quarterback Riley Leonard is the primary backup ""right now,"" Steichen said. ""It was kind of a whirlwind,"" quarterback Daniel Jones said. All that was compounded by another pregame situation a while later when No. 1 cornerback Charvarius Ward accidently collided with tight end Drew Ogletree during on-field warmups, leaving Ward concussed and unable to play. Ward, who was backpedaling at the time of the high-speed collision, remained on the ground for some time before returning to the locker room with assistance. ""There was something in the air today,"" running back Jonathan Taylor said afterward. The pregame mishaps left the Colts unsettled, with players concerned for their teammates. With kickoff approaching, Steichen and team leaders realized the need to regroup as quickly as possible. ""It was a weird day, I won't lie to you,"" linebacker Zaire Franklin said. ""Losing two guys that you depend on. Anthony, we depend on him in a pinch. And obviously, [Ward], losing those guys pregame was tough. It got to a certain point where, in the locker room, you see guys just whispering about what happened to the point where you're like, 'Hey, we've got a job to do.' ""I feel like myself, Shane, Quenton [ Nelson ], [ DeForest Buckner ], did a good job of getting guys back focused. It's like, 'Listen, it's messed up. We're praying for Anthony. We're praying for [Ward]. But at the same time, we've got to lock in and take care of what we have to take care of.' And thankfully, we were able to rally and get a win today."" The Colts moved to 5-1 with the victory, becoming the first team this season to score more than 23 points against an Arizona defense that was fourth in scoring defense entering Week 4. But the challenge was significant. The moments after the Richardson injury were particularly scary, teammates said. ""I didn't see the exact thing that happened,"" receiver Josh Downs said. ""But I did see him over there and everyone gathered around him. We prayed for him. We kind of paused. Everybody was getting ready [for the game] but everybody just came over and huddled around him. It was a wild pregame."" Meanwhile, the Ward injury left the Colts further depleted in the secondary, where they already were short-handed entering the game. His absence pressed undrafted rookie Johnathan Edwards into action in his first extensive playing time. Edwards played 68 snaps after playing a career-high 17 in Week 5. The young secondary forced safety Cam Bynum to do some on-field coaching, he said, because that's what the situation required. ""We had to double and triple check every single little thing,"" Bynum said. ""And that's how it is when you're playing with younger guys that haven't seen as much playing time. You want to make them feel confident.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46572199/colts-richardson-inactive-hurting-eye-mishap-band,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559144_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,25f70e1b04e7b4b95fcd784139707e431eec066a
7ea3a0db5a14,Panthers poking fun at Cowboys tops NFL Week 6 trolls,,"Close victories were the theme across the NFL in Week 7, resulting in plenty of petty posts. The Carolina Panthers beat the Dallas Cowboys 30-27 after a last-second 33-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Fitzgerald . The three points capped off a 15-play, 71-yard drive from Carolina, which is 3-3 through its first six games for the first time since 2021, according to ESPN Research. Panthers running back Rico Dowdle accounted for 239 yards and one touchdown, while quarterback Bryce Young threw for 199 yards and three scores. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott had 261 passing yards and three touchdowns. Carolina's big victory came with a troll as simple as hanging a cowboy hat on a ""W."" The Panthers also highlighted Dowdle -- a former member of the Cowboys -- with a reference to a ""Toy Story"" film theme song: ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" Here are the top NFL trolls from Week 7. The Los Angeles Chargers defeated the Miami Dolphins on the road in a wild ending. After Miami took a one-point lead with 47 seconds remaining, Los Angeles marched down the field with quarterback Justin Herbert connecting with wide receiver Ladd McConkey for 42 yards. Four plays later, Cameron Dicker nailed a 33-yard field goal to win the game. Herbert threw for 234 yards and two scores, while Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa had 205 passing yards and three interceptions. The Chargers used a clip from ""The Simpsons"" to poke fun at the Dolphins. Homer Simpson -- in this case, Los Angeles -- teases a dolphin with a ""W"" before repeatedly pulling it away at the last second. At the end of the clip, he says: ""Stupid dolphin."" The Los Angeles Rams earned their way back into the win column by taking down the Baltimore Ravens . Los Angeles followed up a low-scoring first half with 14 points in the third quarter to head to victory. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford accounted for 181 yards and a score, while running back Kyren Williams ran for 50 yards and a touchdown. Los Angeles' postgame troll came in the form of crab legs forming a ""W"" on a plate. Coming off a bye week, the Pittsburgh Steelers secured their third straight win to advance to 4-1 -- their best five-game start since 2020. The Steelers' defense allowed just 248 yards from the Cleveland Browns , who now have 17 or fewer points scored in 11 straight games dating back to last season, according to ESPN Research. Pittsburgh has won 22 straight home matchups against Cleveland. The Steelers poked fun at the Browns' home stadium section for passionate fans called the Dawg Pound by posting a video of an individual dancing in a Snoopy costume. The Seattle Seahawks ' defense shone on the road against the Jacksonville Jaguars for the victory. Seattle allowed just six points heading into the final frame while putting up 20 itself. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold threw for 295 yards and two scores, and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba had eight receptions for 162 yards and a touchdown. Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence amassed 258 passing yards and two touchdowns himself. Seattle has become known for its postgame comics. This week was no different, with Seahawks defensive end Leonard Williams diving into a pool with Jacksonville mascot Jaxson de Ville inside it. Seattle also highlighted Smith-Njigba's game by turning a sign with ""Jacksonville"" into ""Jaxonville."" The New England Patriots clinched their third straight win in a road matchup against the New Orleans Saints . Patriots quarterback Drake Maye threw for 261 yards and three scores while also leading the team in rushing with 28 yards. The Saints offense garnered 296 yards and scored just one touchdown -- a rush by quarterback Taysom Hill . New England's post-win caption included the popular Louisiana spelling of ""go."" A Thursday night troll counts the same, and the New York Giants made sure to use theirs wisely. The Giants defeated the Philadelphia Eagles behind a three-touchdown performance from running back Cam Skattebo . New York's defense also shut out Philadelphia in the second half in the massive win. The Giants had multiple trolls after the game, including their own spin on the ""Fly Eagles Fly"" chant and a clip from NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" where a golf ball hits a bird.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46575001/nfl-week-6-trolls,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559300_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,b31bc433888886c2616e8fb76bf347216f5a104e
a3e2919add5c,"NFL Week 6: Biggest questions, takeaways for every game",,"Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season kicked off with an NFC East showdown between the Eagles and the Giants on Thursday night. The Giants' rookies dominated their win, as quarterback Jaxson Dart and running back Cam Skattebo accounted for five total touchdowns. Sunday's action began overseas for the third straight week, with the Broncos holding on in London and the Jets remaining the NFL's lone winless team. Back in the United States, the Ravens lost their fourth straight game with three turnovers against the Rams. The Panthers won on a time-expiring field goal over the Cowboys, while the Chargers had one of their own against the Dolphins. In the late window, the Raiders ended a four-game losing streak with a comfortable win over the Titans. The Buccaneers continued their hot start with another victory over an NFC West opponent, beating the 49ers after defeating the Seahawks last week. And the Bengals couldn't get past the Packers in quarterback Joe Flacco 's Cincinnati debut. Our NFL Nation reporters reacted to all the action, answering lingering questions coming out of each game and detailing everything else you need to know for every team. Let's get to it. Jump to: CIN-GB | SF-TB | TEN-LV NE-NO | CLE-PIT | LAC-MIA ARI-IND | SEA-JAX | DAL-CAR LAR-BAL | NYJ-DEN | PHI-NYG Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Packers Did the Packers show enough to think their running game is back? Barely squeaking out a win when you're a two-touchdown favorite isn't a great look, but at least the Packers finally showed they can run the ball again. Running back Josh Jacobs said last week that he has always felt like it takes three or four games to get the running game going. On Sunday, that's exactly what happened. While it was far from a dominating performance, Jacobs & Co. piled up 153 yards on the ground. It included a season-high 93 yards by Jacobs, who had a pair of rushing touchdowns for his fifth game with multiple rushing scores since the beginning of last season. Jacobs averaged 5.2 yards per carry after he came in averaging just 3.3 yards. Trend to watch: Another game without a takeaway for the Packers' defense. It has just two so far this season, and one of those was an end-of-half interception on a Hail Mary in Week 3 against the Browns. Last season, the Packers forced 31 turnovers (17 interceptions and 14 fumble recoveries); and they spent much of the offseason talking about taking the ball away even more. Instead, they've gone the other way. -- Rob Demovsky Next game: at Cardinals (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) play 0:24 Tucker Kraft dives into the end zone to pad Packers' lead Tucker Kraft fights off a pair of defenders as he dives across the goal line to extend the Packers' lead. Bengals Did the Bengals show enough offensively to provide confidence for the immediate future? Yes. Granted, the first half looked incredibly underwhelming. Cincinnati failed to score in the opening two quarters for the first time since Week 1 of the 2024 campaign, when starting quarterback Joe Burrow was coming off a wrist injury. But in the third quarter, things finally turned around. In quarterback Joe Flacco 's debut with the team, he led the offense on a 17-play drive that ended with a 2-yard scoring strike to tight end Tanner Hudson on a fourth-and-goal attempt. Cincinnati scored on its first three drives of the second half. That could be a building block as the team tries to find wins in the middle of the season. What to make of the QB performance: Cincinnati should be encouraged with how Flacco played, particularly in the second half. Flacco did a very good job of playing on time, finding a good rhythm and locating open receivers. When the Bengals traded for Flacco this week, they were hopeful the 40-year-old signal-caller could jump-start a dormant offense. If he continues to play like this, it could be good enough to inject the slightest bit of life into Cincinnati's season. -- Ben Baby Next game: vs. Steelers (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Buccaneers How could the Bucs survive the potential loss of Emeka Egbuka after his hamstring injury ? The Bucs will survive with the same formula that has helped them storm out to a 5-1 record, and that is quarterback Baker Mayfield playing at an MVP level. Mayfield was 17-of-23 for 256 yards and two touchdowns. It's not certain how bad Egbuka's injury is, but the Bucs have already been without Mike Evans for three weeks with a hamstring injury, and Chris Godwin Jr. is ""week-to-week"" with a fibula injury. On top of that, Jalen McMillan won't be back until after the Week 9 bye. Still, Egbuka has been Mayfield's top target by a mile and has been getting so much of the offense's chunk yardage -- 446 receiving yards -- with Sterling Shepard the next closest at 242. Tez Johnson and Kameron Johnson both hauled in touchdown catches Sunday. But none of those other players are high-volume catchers like Egbuka. Biggest hole in the game plan: The Bucs spent all week talking about stopping running back Christian McCaffrey and San Francisco's yards after the catch. But their defense struggled to contend with the downfield connection between quarterback Mac Jones and wideout Kendrick Bourne , who recorded five receptions for 142 receiving yards. Still, Tampa Bay made plays when it mattered with two interceptions. -- Jenna Laine Next game: at Lions (Monday, 7 p.m. ET) 49ers What does Fred Warner 's ankle injury mean for the 49ers' season? Already without star defensive end Nick Bosa ( knee ), the Niners will play the rest of the campaign without their two best defensive players. Considering that unit entered the season with just Warner, Bosa and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir as the returning starters from Week 1 of 2024, it's difficult to envision that defense playing anywhere near as well as it did in the first five weeks. Even with the Nov. 4 trade deadline approaching, it's simply not possible to replace either Warner or Bosa, let alone both of them. On Sunday, the Bucs scored touchdowns on three of their first four full possessions after Warner departed, offering evidence that the onus for any potential Niners playoff push will fall largely on the offense. Stat to know: Eddy Pineiro has made his first 15 field goal attempts of the season. That ties him with Robbie Gould (2017), for the most consecutive made field goals by a San Francisco kicker to start a season, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Considering all the other issues, the 49ers finally seem to at least have figured out the kicking situation. Best quote from the locker room: Wide receiver Jauan Jennings said he had to take nausea medicine after Warner got hurt: ""Just losing Fred, he's one of the guys that I basically look up to. He's been one of the guys who's led this team year in and year out and just his words of encouragement before every game, man, and just know how much he loves the game. It just very sad, and it makes me sick to my stomach."" -- Nick Wagoner Next game: vs. Falcons (Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Raiders Can tight end Michael Mayer continue to step up in Brock Bowers ' absence? The Raiders had always believed they had two starting-caliber tight ends in Bowers and Mayer. After Mayer missed two straight games because of a concussion , he stepped up in a big way. The former Notre Dame standout totaled five catches for 50 yards and a touchdown, which was encouraging while Bowers was out with a knee injury . The Raiders will need Mayer to continue being a reliable presence in the passing game. Turning point: The Titans had a chance to put points on the board at the end of the first half and couldn't capitalize. Quarterback Cam Ward was pressured by Raiders defensive linemen Tyree Wilson and Jonah Laulu before throwing an interception to linebacker Devin White . -- Ryan McFadden Next game: at Chiefs (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) play 0:25 Ashton Jeanty barges in for a Raiders TD Ashton Jeanty gets into the end zone on a 3-yard rush to put the Raiders up 17-0. Titans Is another losing streak looming? The Titans squandered their best chance to get a win over the next few weeks against the Raiders, who were 1-4 before Sunday. Any promise from the previous week's win over the Cardinals died, and the Titans have still not won consecutive games since 2022. The defense tried to keep them in the game, but the Titans couldn't overcome another dismal effort from the offense. There could be another losing streak on the horizon with former head coach Mike Vrabel and the Patriots coming to Nashville next week. The Titans then travel to Indianapolis and get the Chargers at home the following week. Biggest hole in the game plan: The Titans' offense struggled to move the football once again. Tennessee found itself consistently behind the chains because of penalties and sacks allowed. Another issue was its insistence on playing horizontal football, especially with the screen game. Offensive playcaller Bo Hardegree dialed up screen plays on five of their 59 snaps on offense. The Titans gained only eight yards on the screen plays -- none of which led to a first down. -- Turron Davenport Next game: vs. Patriots (Monday, 1 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Patriots Are the Patriots putting too much on Drake Maye ? The lack of a consistent running game made the Patriots one-dimensional, as the offense relied on Maye's arm and growing knack for making clutch passing plays when things break down. The silver lining is that the team's pass protection has improved to a point that airing it out can still be a winning formula, with Maye's scrambling ability producing unscripted rushing yards. But the glass-half-empty view is that a team playing in the Northeast is likely going to need to run the ball late in the season when the weather turns cold. Trend to watch: Maye went 3-for-3 for 107 yards and three touchdown passes on throws of 20 or more yards downfield in the first half -- one to wide receiver DeMario Douglas and the other two to receiver Kayshon Boutte . All were touchdowns, which tied for the most such plays by any player in a game this season (Giants quarterback Russell Wilson in Week 2 at Cowboys). Maye had hit five straight passing plays thrown 20 or more yards downfield entering the game, giving him a streak of eight in a row. Best quote from the locker room: Boutte, who grew up in Louisiana, attended LSU and totaled a team-high five receptions for 93 yards and two touchdowns, gushed about his game that he played in front of 40 friends and family members for whom he bought tickets. ""It was amazing coming back home, first time playing in the Superdome. A little emotional at first -- a full circle moment."" -- Mike Reiss Next game: at Titans (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Breaking News from Adam Schefter Download the ESPN app and enable Adam Schefter's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

The Saints' red zone offense ranked 29th in the league entering Week 6, scoring a touchdown on 41% of their red zone possessions, according to ESPN Research. Against the Giants in Week 5, the Saints scored only field goals and capitalized on turnovers. Against the Patriots, New Orleans scored just one touchdown. Improving in the red zone is something coach Kellen Moore and the players have identified as something they need to do going forward, and that will be emphasized after Sunday's loss. What to make of the QB performance: Spencer Rattler had a solid first half with only two incompletions and was able to make plays with his legs. He finished 20-of-26 for 227 yards and also ran for 20 yards, and he was hindered by some drops ( Chris Olave had two) and a fumble from tight end Juwan Johnson . The biggest issue -- the Saints couldn't turn field goals into touchdowns, and Rattler was sacked on third down on the New England 33-yard line -- a play that resulted in a field goal instead of a potential six points. Best quote from the locker room: The Saints have lamented losing so many close games this season, and safety Justin Reid said they can't take any satisfaction from being in tight games. ""We don't live in a league that we get moral victories for being close. That isn't what the NFL is,"" Reid said. ""It's not about points. It's about Ws and Ls, right? And we only have one W so far, so it is a bit frustrating. Every man in the building knows what it takes to win, we've just got to go out there and execute better."" -- Katherine Terrell Next game: at Bears (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Steelers Are the Steelers the most complete team in the AFC North? Yes -- by their division-leading record, the eye test and maybe even by default with the other three teams falling apart. Playing with a full complement of healthy defensive players for the first time all season, the Steelers swarmed the Browns and rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel with six sacks, 16 quarterback hits and eight passes defensed. Even without a takeaway, it was the kind of complete defensive performance the Steelers have been seeking all season. And on offense, quarterback Aaron Rodgers ' unit finally broke through in the second half of the game with back-to-back touchdown drives after three field goals in the first half. Turning point: The Steelers' first drive of the second half was nearly their first three-and-out of the game, until the Browns were whistled for running into punter Corliss Waitman . The penalty gave the Steelers a fresh set of downs and jump-started the offense. The Steelers rattled off five plays of 10-plus yards and just one incompletion en route to their first touchdown on a vintage 12-yard scramble drill toss from Rodgers to tight end Connor Heyward . Best quote from the locker room: Cornerback Jalen Ramsey had a day he won't forget, recording his first sacks with the Steelers. ""I'm going to probably tell my kids about this,"" he said. ""I played in a game with TJ Watt and Myles Garrett , and I had two sacks. That's crazy."" -- Brooke Pryor Next game: vs. Commanders (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) Browns Should the Browns make trades at the deadline after falling to 1-5? Cleveland made a pair of midweek trades, and although multiple players said the team is committed to winning, perhaps the front office should be more open to accumulating picks in the 2026 NFL draft. The Browns have several veterans on expiring contracts, such as defensive lineman Shelby Harris and tight end David Njoku , who could return the additional picks that Cleveland is going to need to rebuild its foundation. Biggest hole in the game plan: Not having cornerback Denzel Ward shadow Steelers receiver DK Metcalf in cornerback Tyson Campbell 's team debut. Just days after arriving in Cleveland via trade from the Jaguars, Campbell struggled against Metcalf, giving up three catches (six targets) for 70 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, Ward didn't give up a catch to Metcalf on two targets. Best quote from the locker room: ""Losing the same way is frustrating as hell,"" Garrett said after the Browns' offense failed to eclipse 17 points for the 11th straight game. -- Daniel Oyefusi Next game: at Bengals (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Chargers Has the Chargers' offense gotten its groove back? In the first half, the Chargers' offense was out of sync, having little success doing anything. They went into the half with three field goals, but those struggles dissipated in the second half. Justin Herbert & Co. leaned on their running game to build a lead and help seal the late win. The caveat here is that the Dolphins have the league's worst run defense, so the Chargers' success could be the result of taking advantage of a poor unit. Most surprising performance: Running back Kimani Vidal . After drafting Vidal in the sixth round in 2024, the Chargers released him after this year's training camp, opting to go with Najee Harris , Omarion Hampton and Hassan Haskins in the backfield. Vidal re-signed on the practice squad and got an opportunity to be the Chargers' lead back Sunday. He finished with 17 carries for 122 yards and three catches for 14 yards and a touchdown. His performance should make the Chargers feel comfortable about him holding down the backfield with Hampton on injured reserve. -- Kris Rhim Next game: vs. Colts (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) play 0:51 Herbert's magic in pocket sets up winning Chargers FG Justin Herbert escapes pressure and finds Ladd McConkey, putting the Chargers in range for a Cameron Dicker field goal in the final seconds. Dolphins Is there hope for a turnaround for Miami? Coach Mike McDaniel's teams can be criticized for plenty of things, but players do not quit on him. The Chargers' win probability hit a peak of 94% at the start of the fourth quarter, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, but the Dolphins kept it within two scores, got a critical stop and had a go-ahead touchdown with 47 seconds remaining. Ahead are road games against the Browns and Falcons, before a home game against the Ravens on a short week. Miami has lost the privilege of a ""get right"" game, but this three-game stretch is not daunting. However, if its defense continues to falter in critical spots like it did Sunday, things will get scary long before Halloween hits. Biggest hole in the game plan: There's feeding your best players, and then there's what Miami did Sunday. Receiver Jaylen Waddle and running back De'Von Achane accounted for 26 of 42 total touches for the Dolphins' offensive players. Obviously, it's not easy to fill the void left by injured wideout Tyreek Hill -- but Dolphins players said it would take a group effort to do so. Someone needs to step up to keep defenses from keying heavily on Waddle and Achane. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Next game: at Browns (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Colts Did the Colts allay defensive concerns with their late-game stand? The Cardinals were missing their starting quarterback, multiple running backs and lost their top receiver during the game. And yet, Arizona was able to consistently move the ball against a Colts defense that has raised a few questions in recent games. Only the Rams and quarterback Matthew Stafford compiled more total yardage against the Colts this season than the Cardinals' 400 yards on Sunday. But the Colts got the final word when they stopped the Cardinals on a fourth down with the game on the line. What to make of the QB performance: Daniel Jones didn't have a gaudy stat line -- 22-of-30, 212 yards, two touchdowns and an interception -- but he was diligent in not forcing balls into the teeth of a very good Arizona defense. And Jones gets credit for a fourth-quarter game-winning drive when he helped engineer a nine-play, 66-yard drive that ended with the decisive touchdown with 4:32 remaining. -- Stephen Holder Next game: at Chargers (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) Cardinals Should the Cardinals start Jacoby Brissett next week? Unless Kyler Murray is completely, undoubtedly, 100% healthy from his foot injury , then yes. The Cardinals should let Murray rest for another week and into the bye. Brissett played an efficient, relatively clean game and had the Cardinals' offense moving in all four quarters, so playing him isn't a high-risk decision. Even for a team that has lost four in a row, the Cardinals looked as composed offensively as they have all season. What to make of the QB performance: What Brissett did Sunday afternoon was nothing short of impressive, even if it wasn't enough to win. He started his first game in 371 days and put together a solid, efficient performance running a scheme that he was familiar with from spending the 2022 season with the Browns, who had Arizona's offensive coordinator Drew Petzing and quarterbacks coach Israel Woolfork on staff. Even more impressive it that Brissett threw for 320 yards on 27-of-44 passing without receiver Marvin Harrison Jr ., who left the game in the second quarter with a concussion . -- Josh Weinfuss Next game: vs. Packers (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Seahawks Why are the Seahawks so much better away from Lumen Field? Their win pushes their road record to 3-0 this year and 10-1 in two-plus seasons under Mike Macdonald, who became only the fourth coach in NFL history to win 10 of his first 11 away games. In that same span, they're 4-8 at Lumen Field, where they used to own one of the NFL's best home-field advantages. This latest road win at 10 a.m. PT didn't come easy. They needed a huge day from wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and seven sacks from their pass rush, which came alive after a poor showing a week earlier. Trend to watch: The Seahawks could use help at cornerback. With Devon Witherspoon ( knee ) playing in only two games this year and Riq Woolen (who missed this game with a concussion) often plagued by costly mistakes, Josh Jobe has been their most consistent cornerback. But Jobe struggled Sunday, with one of his several miscalculations resulting in a Jaguars touchdown. Cornerback feels like a position the Seahawks will look to upgrade before the Nov. 4 trade deadline. Best quote from the locker room: Smith-Njigba caught eight passes for 162 yards and a touchdown, marking the fourth time in six games this season he's topped 100 receiving yards. He now leads the NFL with 696. Is it time to start talking about him as one of the NFL's truly elite receivers? ""Absolutely,"" safety Coby Bryant said. ""He does it every week. He doesn't say too much. He goes out, [he's] consistent in who he is. He's definitely the best, in my opinion."" -- Brady Henderson Next game: vs. Texans (Monday, 10 p.m. ET) play 0:55 Sam Darnold finds AJ Barner deep for 61-yard gain Sam Darnold launches a 61-yard strike to AJ Barner, who powers through before finally being taken down. Jaguars How can the Jaguars generate more sacks? The Jaguars entered Sunday fifth in the NFL in pressures (69) but 27th in sacks (seven), so they've had trouble finishing all season. It didn't help that defensive lineman Travon Walker missed last week's game with a wrist injury or that defensive end Josh Hines-Allen has managed just a half-sack (he entered the season needing 2.5 to set the franchise career record). The one sack they got against Seattle came on a jailbreak blitz, and blitzing more might be what they should do. They entered Sunday 21st in the NFL in blitz percentage at 25.7%. Stat to know: Before the Jaguars' next-to-last drive, quarterback Trevor Lawrence had been pressured on 25 of his 47 dropbacks (53%). The 25 pressures are the most any quarterback has faced in a game this season, per ESPN Research, and he was later sacked on third down on that drive. The Seahawks sacked him seven times, which was as many times as he had been sacked in the first five games. Best quote from the locker room: Jaguars coach Liam Coen acknowledged that his team played sloppy. ""It's on me. It's an undisciplined operation at the moment, and it's on me. It's got to get fixed. It's a great opportunity this week to get it fixed, right? We're going on the road. We're flying to another country. Being together as a group, looking ourselves in the mirror and try to figure out from an operation and habit standpoint what is standing in our way. Because right now, it's us."" -- Mike DiRocco Next game: vs. Rams in London (Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Panthers Are the Panthers legitimate contenders in the NFC South? Maybe. They're .500 (3-3) for the first time since 2021 and playing well with two straight wins. The Bucs got off to a fast start, but Carolina still gets to play them twice. The emergence of running back Rico Dowdle as a star, smashing Christian McCaffrey's (416) two-game team record for scrimmage yards (473), has made play-action a factor for quarterback Bryce Young . He is taking advantage. The Panthers have a chance to get to three straight wins against the 0-6 Jets. What to make of the QB performance: Young might finally have arrived. After a rough start to the season, he has five touchdown passes over the past two games, something he has done only one other time. He has been in control of Carolina's offense, as coach Dave Canales has preached. Now, he is getting results. Best quote from the locker room: Long-snapper JJ Jansen is one of the few players on the roster who was around the last time the Panthers (3-3) were .500, back when they were 5-5 after Week 10 of the 2021 season. Here's his perspective on the .500 mark: ""It's a good little checkpoint for us. It would be really good for us to go take the show on the road [to the Jets], win a game a game on the road, and now you feel like you're consistently week-in and week-out playing really good football.'' -- David Newton Next game: vs. Texans (Monday, 10 p.m. ET) play 0:17 Fitzgerald's 33-yard FG gives Panthers the win Ryan Fitzgerald hits a 33-yard field goal as time expires to seal the win for the Panthers over the Cowboys. Cowboys Is it time to make drastic changes on defense? Is it time to make a trade for a legit pass rusher? A linebacker? Is it out of the realm of possibility they do something the Cowboys have not done before: make an in-season coordinator change? The Cowboys had no answers for Dowdle, the ex-Cowboy. They did not put any sustained pressure on Young. They gave up too many big plays again. And with 6:07 to play, the Panthers ran down the clock for the game-winning field goal. These problems have been consistent from the opening week of the season. When it goes poorly, the Cowboys don't have a playmaker, like edge rusher Micah Parsons , to get them out of a funk. The trade deadline is in less than a month. Trend to watch: The Cowboys were not pleased with their running game last week against the Jets, despite 180 yards on 29 carries. They are certainly less pleased after Sunday. The Cowboys finished with 31 yards on 19 carries and did not have a run longer than six yards. Take away the 66-yard run by running back Javonte Williams in the second quarter against the Jets, and the run game has not had the consistency the Cowboys need. With a defense that is scuffling (to be kind), that's even more pressure on quarterback Dak Prescott to deliver every time. -- Todd Archer Next game: at Jets (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Rams What does wide receiver Puka Nacua 's injury mean for the Rams? Nacua appeared to be in a lot of pain after injuring his foot in the second quarter but came back into the game early in the third quarter, although he did not have another target. Nacua entered the game leading the NFL in receptions and receiving yards, and the Rams will miss him if he is not able to play or is limited because of the foot injury. They have struggled in first halves this season -- averaging 9.8 first-half points per game -- and did not score a first-half touchdown against a Ravens defense that has been among the worst in the league this season. Stat to know: Rams tight end Tyler Higbee had 8.6 yards of separation when the ball arrived on his 8-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. That's the most open a player has been on a touchdown allowed by the Ravens this season, and the second most on a touchdown allowed by the Ravens over the past three seasons. -- Sarah Barshop Best quote from the locker room: The Rams' defense allowed just three points to the Ravens, which was their fewest in a road game since 2014, according to ESPN Research. ""They carried us all day,"" wide receiver Davante Adams said. -- Sarah Barshop Next game: vs. Jaguars in London (Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET) play 0:55 Stafford's 4th-and-3 completion sets up Rams TD Matthew Stafford makes an amazing throw to Kyren Williams, who comes down with the ball then he rushes in for a touchdown on the next play. Ravens Did the Ravens' playoff hopes end Sunday? Recent history says yes. Since the 14-team playoff format started in 2020, only one team -- Washington in 2020 -- started 1-5 and made the playoffs. A preseason Super Bowl favorite, the Ravens have now lost four in a row for the first time in four seasons. They've been outscored 98-33 the past three weeks. The only glimmer of hope is quarterback Lamar Jackson could return from his hamstring injury after the Week 7 bye, when Baltimore's schedule becomes much easier. Over the next six games, the Ravens play one team with a winning record (Vikings). But Baltimore will likely need some of Jackson's heroics to bring them back from this formidable hole. Stat to know: Under coach John Harbaugh, the Ravens are 8-26 (.235) when they turn the ball over three or more times. On Sunday, Baltimore committed three turnovers, including an interception and fumble by quarterback Cooper Rush , who was benched in the fourth quarter for Tyler Huntley . The Ravens' three points are their fewest at home since 2002, when they were shut out by the Buccaneers 25-0. Baltimore has lost its past six games without Jackson and has failed to score more than 17 points each time. Best quote from the locker room: ""Bad football gets you to 1-5. So whatever you put out there, that's how the football works."" Ravens wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins on whether he is surprised by the team's poor record. -- Jamison Hensley Next game: vs. Bears (Oct. 26, 1 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Broncos How did the Broncos manage to keep this game on a razor's edge? Let them count the ways on the flight home from London. The Broncos fumbled on their first possession, had a cascade of penalties on offense -- including a holding penalty in their own end zone that resulted in a third-quarter safety -- and allowed two massive kickoff returns, including a 72-yarder. Add it all up and it almost negated one of the best defensive performances in the league this season that included nine sacks and holding the Jets to minus-11 passing yards. Broncos coach Sean Payton said he believed the offense would find its identity soon, but they certainly didn't find it in north London. Trend to watch: The Broncos entered Sunday with the league lead in sacks (21) as well as the individual leader in linebacker Nik Bonitto (seven). They showed no signs of slowing down and consistently harassed Justin Fields with a diabolical variety of four- and five-man pressure looks. With three teams in the next four games who were among the top 12 in the league in sacks allowed heading into Sunday's games, the Broncos' pass rush could feast almost until Thanksgiving. -- Jeff Legwold Next game: vs. Giants (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) play 0:35 Broncos defense comes up with game-sealing sack Jonathon Cooper and Brandon Jones get to Justin Fields to seal the game for the Broncos. Jets Should the winless Jets consider a quarterback change? It would be a surprise if coach Aaron Glenn pulls the plug, but let's be honest: Justin Fields struggled mightily against the Broncos. He passed for only 45 yards and took nine sacks. Most of those sacks were on him; he held the ball too long, unable to find his second and third reads when the first was covered. He got no help from offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand, whose conservative playcalling reflected no confidence in Fields. That includes a botched two-minute drive at the end of the first half in which they let the last 32 seconds run off the clock without running a play. The Jets also finished with 82 total yards and their minus-10 passing yards was the lowest in team history. Most surprising performance: The Jets' defense snapped its historic turnover drought with a fumble recovery on the first series -- their first takeaway of the season. The maligned defense, which had a players-only meeting, delivered a winning performance. The Jets blitzed less than usual and held Bo Nix to 174 passing yards. All for naught. -- Rich Cimini Next game: vs. Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap Giants How much have Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo changed the feel of the Giants? The rookie duo showed the difference they can make, being involved in all five of the Giants' touchdowns. Three rushing for Skattebo; one rushing and passing for Dart. But they've also brought a different energy. ""I feel it,"" Skattebo said. Both Skattebo and Dart rushed for 23 yards over expectation against the Eagles, per NFL Next Gen Stats. That's indicative of how they play and act. ""I think we're just trying to set a standard of intensity here each and every day,"" said Dart, who also noted that beating the defending champions is naturally a statement win. It helps change the perception of them. Stat to know: Dart became just the third quarterback in the Super Bowl era to rush for at least 50 yards in each of his first three career NFL starts, joining Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts . Elite company. Dart ran for 60 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, which doesn't even include the handful of sacks he avoided with his mobility. -- Jordan Raanan Next game: at Broncos (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) Eagles How concerning is this loss? This bounce-back opportunity devolved into a lopsided loss that will lead to questions about whether there are foundational cracks. The hope externally was the long meeting between A.J. Brown , Hurts and Saquon Barkley would get everyone on the same page and move the team past some early-season frustrations. The offense looked decent in spots, but Hurts' first interception of the season -- a fourth-quarter crusher in the red zone -- highlighted a mistake-riddled performance in all three phases. Philadelphia was outgained in each of its first five games and was outplayed badly by the Giants' less-talented roster. It will be a long 10 days before the Eagles have another chance to course-correct in Minnesota. Biggest hole in the game plan: The Eagles had to have known that the best way to defend Dart was to bottle him in the pocket, especially after facing QBs with similar styles the past two weeks in Baker Mayfield and Bo Nix . But they lost contain on multiple occasions, and it cost them. Dart ran for a 20-yard touchdown early in the first quarter. Later in the frame, he escaped to his right and found Wan'Dale Robinson , who broke a tackle and raced down the sideline for a 35-yard touchdown. -- Tim McManus Next game: at Vikings (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46531418/nfl-week-6-2025-season-questions-takeaways-lessons-stats-recap-every-game,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559340_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,701c8e29b99c32b397b4ff05de6952c0513f634f
fd636ac7832d,NCAAF,,"Week 7 gave us a perfect set of games for wrapping up the first half of the college football regular season. Ohio State solidified its best-in-the-country status. Indiana and Texas Tech proved that they weren't even slightly interested in fading away after a fast start, while Penn State proved it wasn't slightly interested in a rebound, then fired its coach 15 days after he led the No. 3 team in the country onto the field. Georgia won another very silly SEC game with nothing but grit and guile (and, yes, some fortunate calls). Ty Simpson once again came through exactly when Alabama needed him to, further positioning himself as a major Heisman contender. Texas pulled off exactly the kind of season-saving win that Red River often provides. And USF Bulls further enhanced a résumé that, aside from a pesky loss to Miami , is easily the best the Group of 5 has to offer. With seven weeks down and seven more to go before Championship Week, let's step back and take stock. Who have been the best players and coaches of the year to date? Who has most defied (or fallen most short of) preseason expectations? Let's recap Week 7 by recapping all of the season's first seven weeks. Jump to a section: Coach of the year | Biggest disappointment Top offensive players | Top defensive players Heisman race | SP+ risers, fallers Favorite games Midseason coach of the year: Curt Cignetti Curt Cignetti shakes hands with Oregon coach Dan Lanning after Indiana's first win in a top-10 vs. top-10 matchup. Troy Wayrynen/Imagn Images Fourteen years ago, a midlife crisis of sorts sent Curt Cignetti to Indiana, Pennsylvania. He had established a pretty cushy career as an assistant coach and had spent 2007-10 as Nick Saban's receivers coach and run game coordinator at Alabama. But he didn't want to be an assistant anymore. ""I was hitting the big 5-0,"" he told me a few years ago , ""and I was tired of being an assistant coach. ... I was just ready to be a head coach."" His restlessness took him from Tuscaloosa to a head coaching gig at Division II's Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where his father, Frank Cignetti Sr., had coached for 20 years with two D-II title game appearances. ""It was a big risk,"" Cignetti said. ""It was an unconventional risk. There were many mornings early on when I woke up and thought I was nuts for doing what I did. That's probably a move not too many people have ever made in this profession. But it worked out. Sometimes you've got to bet on yourself."" Yeah, I'd say it has indeed worked out. After six years, 53 wins and three playoff appearances, Cignetti moved up to the FCS' Elon, which had gone a combined 11-46 over the previous five seasons. He immediately led the Phoenix to back-to-back playoff appearances. That brought him to James Madison , where he went 33-5 in three seasons at the FCS level, then 19-4 in the Dukes' first two years after jumping to FBS. And that, in turn, led him to the Big Ten in 2024. Well, sort of. It led him to Indiana , a program that had gone 9-27 in the three years before his arrival. The Hoosiers had never won double-digit games in a season, and in the previous 50 years they had played just two games as a top-10 team, losing both. On Saturday, the Hoosiers beat No. 3 Oregon , 30-20, in Eugene. It ended the Ducks' 23-game regular-season winning streak and their 18-game home winning streak. And this wasn't some sort of smash-and-grab, turnovers-based upset. The Hoosiers actually gave up a fourth-quarter pick-six, in fact. No, they beat Oregon by beating them , allowing just 64 yards in the second half and, aside from a single 44-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter, 213 yards for the game. Even with the pick-six, Indiana's Fernando Mendoza outdueled Oregon's Dante Moore , a onetime Heisman front-runner, and Hoosiers receiver Elijah Sarratt , one of many players to follow Cignetti from JMU a year and a half ago, torched a previously untouchable Oregon secondary for eight catches, 121 yards and a touchdown. This was Indiana's first-ever top-10-versus-top-10 win in five tries. It was also the Hoosiers' 17th win in 19 games under Cignetti. The Hoosiers reached the first 12-team College Football Playoff last season, and the lessons they learned along the way have positioned them for a return trip. The Allstate Playoff Predictor currently gives them a 92% chance of reaching the CFP; only Ohio State (95%) has better odds. This is a new time for college football, with legal player compensation and open player movement completely redefining how roster management works. And no one has made it work better for himself than the guy who set off for a different Indiana a decade and a half ago. This being college football, we can't ever live in the present tense -- we always have to spin it toward the future. Expect loads of ""Cignetti to [insert big-name school]???"" rumors in the coming weeks, especially since he's a Pennsylvania guy and Penn State suddenly, and rather shockingly, has an opening. Who knows, maybe he's destined to end his career somewhere closer to home. But let's embrace the present tense; Indiana has, in this very moment, become one of the surest things in college football. I could type that out another 100 times, and it would still give me a jolt of surprise every time. And besides, considering how many times he's bucked what conventional wisdom would have told him to do, there's nothing saying he won't remain in Bloomington, creating his own football Valhalla, for a few more seasons. Biggest disappointment (and most shocking firing): Penn State Fifteen days after leading the No. 3 team in the country onto the field, James Franklin was fired by Penn State. Isaiah Vazquez/Getty Images Last offseason, in a strange moment of stasis, only five power-conference teams changed coaches ( North Carolina , UCF , Purdue , Wake Forest and West Virginia ). With the House settlement and the age of player compensation approaching, financial caution was the name of the game. (Well, sort of. We still saw 22 coaching changes at the Group of 5 level.) Apparently, however, when our offseasons aren't crazy enough, the pressure builds and ferments and takes us to a very strange place. At the midway point of the season, we've already seen five power-conference teams fire their coaches: Virginia Tech , UCLA , Oklahoma State , Arkansas and, as of Sunday, Penn State . Wisconsin will probably be making a move soon -- especially after Saturday's humiliating 37-0 home loss to Iowa -- and lord only knows if or when the SEC ( Florida ? Auburn ?) or ACC ( Florida State ? North Carolina?) might further join the party. Let this be a lesson to our future selves: If we don't hit the pressure release button quickly enough, things get wild. It was painfully obvious where things were headed with Penn State after the Nittany Lions suffered their third straight loss and second straight as a massive favorite. They came achingly close to beating Oregon two weeks ago but fell in overtime and evidently never recovered. Even after the shocking loss to winless UCLA, it was fair to assume the Nittany Lions would return home, get right against Northwestern , and move on to a semi-respectable 8-4 or 9-3 season. Instead, the offense no-showed in the middle of the game, the defense no-showed late, quarterback Drew Allar suffered a season-ending injury and Northwestern prevailed 22-21. Even if we knew a split would probably happen at some point, Franklin's sudden firing is a jarring development, both because of how close Penn State came to saving itself -- even with unacceptably poor play over the past two weeks, the Nittany Lions are basically three plays from an unbeaten record (just as they were a play away from the national title game last year) -- and how quickly the end came. Franklin led the No. 3 team in the country onto the field 15 days ago ! Now, he's unemployed. His incredible run of steady success, with two nine-win seasons at Vanderbilt (the school's only two in the past century) and five top-10 finishes in the last nine full years at Penn State, will almost certainly earn him another power-conference job pretty quickly. But his nearly decade-long inability to get PSU over that final hurdle meant this season had now-or-never vibes from the beginning. As soon as the school realized that ""never"" was the verdict, it made a move, $49 million buyout be damned. As is the zero-sum nature of sport, I guess, the emerging top-five prowess of teams such as Indiana and Texas Tech meant that someone had to be ejected from the top five to make room. Preseason No. 1 Texas , No. 2 Penn State and No. 4 Clemson are a combined 10-8, and though Texas (with a Red River thumping of Oklahoma ) and Clemson (with blowouts of cratering North Carolina and Boston College teams) have both recently regained their footing a bit, Penn State did the opposite. Goodness, what a stunning ending. The 10 best offensive players of the season Miami's Francis Mauigoa anchors the best offensive line in the country. Doug Murray/Icon Sportswire It's fair to assume that, when Ohio State actually needs Jeremiah Smith to do something, he will. The obvious No. 1 in our preseason player rankings , Smith has gotten plenty of fresh air and easy calisthenics of late as the Buckeyes have won their opening six games by an average of 37-7. But in four games against power-conference opponents, he's also caught 26 balls for only 233 yards -- that's 9.0 yards per catch and 58.3 yards per game. The Buckeyes know as well as anyone that the goal here isn't to entertain -- it's to peak in December. Smith & Co. are well on their way. But it's hard to say Smith has actually been one of the best offensive players of 2025 when he hasn't actually done anything. Here are the 10 who, to my eyes, have best combined skill and actual production. 1. OL Francis Mauigoa , Miami. Consider Mauigoa a placeholder for the Miami line as a whole. The Hurricanes rank second in pressure rate allowed and 16th in stuff rate allowed; they really haven't had to ask quarterback Carson Beck to do much -- he's averaging just 28 passes per game and 11.9 yards per completion -- because they're always on schedule and never uncomfortable. Best offensive line in college football. 2. QB Jayden Maiava , USC. He wasn't amazing in Saturday's 31-13 win over Michigan (265 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT), but he was still very good, and for the season he's a comfortable No. 1 in Total QBR, just as he was No. 1 on my P4 QBs list two weeks ago. 3. QB Ty Simpson , Alabama. Since the season-opening dud against Florida State, Alabama has played in five games, and Simpson has made my weekly Heisman top-10 list five times. He has a 16-to-1 TD-to-INT ratio for the season, and since the start of Week 2, he ranks third nationally in completion rate (76.0%), fourth in touchdowns (14) and sixth in Total QBR (87.2). 4. RB Ahmad Hardy , Missouri. Bama played ball control well enough against Mizzou -- 38:33 time of possession, 75 snaps to 56 -- that Hardy and Jamal Roberts combined for only 17 carries Saturday. (Hardy had 12 for 52 yards.) But he's still on pace for 1,700 rushing yards, and he's still an absolute yards-after-contact star. 5. QB Fernando Mendoza , Indiana. He was steady in wins in two of the most raucous road environments in the country (Iowa and Oregon), and he's almost untouchable at home. It was easy to wonder if Cignetti could conjure more transfer magic after losing some key pieces, including quarterback Kurtis Rourke, from last year's remarkable run. Instead, Mendoza waltzed in and raised the bar. 6. QB Carson Beck, Miami. 7. RB Cam Cook , Jacksonville State. 8. QB Demond Williams Jr ., Washington. 9. RB Justice Haynes , Michigan. 10. WR Danny Scudero , San Jose State. The 10 best defensive players of the season Although he doesn't have the chance to stuff a stat sheet, Caleb Downs' value is undeniable. James Black/Icon Sportswire In FBS vs. FBS games, teams averaged just 21.8 offensive points per game (and 23.0 total) in Week 1 but have hit at least 25.0 (and 25.9) in every week since. Offenses have found their rhythm to a degree, but if I were to rank the top overall units in the sport, I would probably have four defenses (Ohio State, Texas, Oklahoma and Indiana) in the top five. Similarly, if I were making a ""10 best overall players"" list, I might have six or seven defenders. 1. S Caleb Downs , Ohio State. It's a shame Downs doesn't play a natural, box score-filling position because this would be a pretty fun year for a defensive player to make a Heisman run -- and not just a Travis Hunter-style two-way player. Downs, however, is content to simply do his job better than any player in the sport. Need an extra run defender? He'll meet you in the backfield. Lock down someone in the slot? Yep, he'll do that too. He's otherworldly. (And he should still start returning punts again and show up for some offensive snaps, Ryan Day! A Heisman run's still on the table! The lane's wide open, let's go!) 2. LB Jacob Rodriguez , Texas Tech. For all the talk about the difference standout transfers have made for Texas Tech, the best player on this 6-0 Red Raiders team has been in Lubbock even longer than the current coaching staff. Rodriguez, a senior who transferred to town in 2022, has been a dynamite do-it-all man, leading the team in tackles (50) and recording 5.5 TFLs, 2 forced fumbles, 1 sack, 2 INTs and 3 pass breakups. 3. DT Rueben Bain Jr. , Miami. I laughed out loud when I saw that Bain, a 270-pound defensive lineman, is tied for the team lead in tackles. He makes a tackle basically every eight snaps he's on the field, which is pretty wild considering how much offenses try to avoid him. His pressure rate is an elite 16.6%, and his interception against Notre Dame was one of the most delightful (and important) plays of the season. 4. S Louis Moore , Indiana. Moore left Indiana for Ole Miss in 2024, then returned and sued for an extra year of eligibility . Now, the 24-year-old might be the second-best player on the second-best team in the sport. A modern college football story! 5. DE Cashius Howell , Texas A&M. A&M's defense has enjoyed a recent renaissance, allowing 12 points per game in its past three contests, but the Aggies have had an elite pass rush all year thanks to Howell, who has already enjoyed two three-sack games and has eight for the season. 6. DE Vincent Anthony Jr ., Duke. 7. CB Hezekiah Masses , California. 8. CB Leonard Moore , Notre Dame. 9. DE Caden Curry , Ohio State. 10. CB Elijah Green , Tulsa. Midseason Heisman points race winner: Ty Simpson After a season-opening loss to Florida State, Ty Simpson has consistently delivered for Alabama. Jamie Squire/Getty Images Each week near the bottom of this column, I award the week's Heisman, doling out weekly points, F1-style (in this case, 10 points for first place, 9 for second and so on). Here is this week's Heisman top 10: 1. Demond Williams Jr ., Washington (21-of-27 passing for 402 yards and two touchdowns, plus 143 non-sack rushing yards and two touchdowns against Rutgers). 2. Cameron Dickey , Texas Tech (21 carries for 263 yards and two touchdowns, plus 16 receiving yards against Kansas). 3. Tucker Kilcrease , Troy (30-of-39 passing for 415 yards and five touchdowns, plus 25 non-sack rushing yards against Texas State). 4. Taylen Green , Arkansas (21-of-31 passing for 256 yards and two touchdowns, plus 98 non-sack rushing yards and a touchdown against Tennessee). 5. David Bailey , Texas Tech (six tackles, three sacks and a forced fumble against Kansas). 6. Ty Simpson, Alabama (23-of-31 passing for 200 yards and three touchdowns, plus 32 non-sack rushing yards against Missouri). 7. Desmond Reid , Pitt (8 catches for 155 yards and two touchdowns, plus 45 rushing yards against Florida State). 8. Desmond Purnell , Kansas State (5 tackles, 2 TFLs, 1 sack, 2 interceptions -- including a pick-six -- and 2 pass breakups against TCU). 9. King Miller , USC (18 carries for 158 yards and a touchdown, plus 14 receiving yards against Michigan). 10. LJ Martin , BYU (25 carries for 162 yards and a touchdown against Arizona). Granted, he did it against Rutgers' increasingly listless defense -- the 3-3 Scarlet Knights are potentially going to waste their best offense in ages because they can't stop anyone -- but Demond Williams Jr. did something we almost never see late Friday night. Here's a list of players to combine 400 passing yards with 140 non-sack rushing yards in a game in the past 10 years: • Williams • Lamar Jackson vs. Syracuse in 2016 Granted, Jackson topped 200 rushing yards in that game, but anytime you can do something comparable to that quarterback and that game , you get to top the week's Heisman list. Even in a week that also saw Cameron Dickey ripping off multiple long touchdown runs, Tucker Kilcrease leading an incredible second-half comeback and Ty Simpson making some of the most clutch passes of the season. Honorable mention: • Micah Alejado , Hawai'i (34-of-54 passing for 413 yards, 3 TDs and 1 INT, plus 32 non-sack rushing yards and a TD against Utah State). • Anthony Colandrea , UNLV (20-of-32 passing for 361 yards and a touchdown, plus 62 non-sack rushing yards and two touchdowns against Air Force). • Cam Cook , Jacksonville State (31 carries for 218 yards and two touchdowns, plus 15 receiving yards against Sam Houston). • Jalen Garner , Houston (7 tackles, 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and a pass breakup against Oklahoma State). • Haynes King , Georgia Tech (20-of-24 passing for 213 yards and a touchdown, plus 60 non-sack rushing yards and two touchdowns against Virginia Tech). • Fernando Mendoza , Indiana (20-of-31 passing for 215 yards with one TD and one INT, plus 40 non-sack rushing yards against Oregon). • Danny Scudero , San José State (10 catches for 180 yards and four touchdowns against Wyoming). • Nadame Tucker , Western Michigan (seven tackles, 3.5 sacks against Ball State). Through seven weeks, here are your points leaders: 1. Ty Simpson, Alabama (29 points) 2. Taylen Green, Arkansas (22) 3. Demond Williams, Washington (19) 4. Luke Altmyer , Illinois (16) 5. Trinidad Chambliss , Ole Miss (15) 6. Jayden Maiava , USC (12) 7T. Jonah Coleman , Washington (10) 7T. Nico Iamaleava , UCLA (10) 7T. Fernando Mendoza, Indiana (10) 7T. Diego Pavia , Vanderbilt (10) 7T. Sawyer Robertson , Baylor (10 points) It's still early, and of the current top four Heisman favorites, per the ESPN BET odds -- Carson Beck, Ty Simpson, Fernando Mendoza and Jeremiah Smith -- two haven't made the top 10 of our weekly list even once. Things are obviously still pretty uncertain. But Simpson's consistently steady performances have put him in front in the points race. The second half of the season always carries far more weight than the first when it comes to awards and whatnot, but Bama needed Simpson to raise his game after the trip to Tallahassee, and he has very much done so. Largest SP+ risers and fallers The SP+ rankings have been updated for the week. Since we're in midseason mode, it seems like a pretty good time to look at which teams have moved up and down the most since the preseason. Moving up Here are the 10 teams that have seen their ratings rise the most since August. Naturally, teams that started lower had more room to rise, but a couple of projected good teams have taken turns toward greatness. 1. San Diego State : up 16.2 adjusted points per game (ranking has risen from 103rd to 54th). A 23-point loss to Washington State in Week 2 made it seem like the Aztecs were destined to carry their terrible 2024 form into Sean Lewis' second season. Instead, they've won four straight, three by at least 21 points, and per SP+ they now have a 79% chance of going 9-3 or better. 2. North Texas : up 13.7 points (from 95th to 52nd). Friday night's midgame collapse against USF was disappointing. The Mean Green, unbeaten to that point, gave up a 28-0 run in just four minutes to turn a potential program-defining win into an eventual 63-36 loss. But they're still 5-1 with a 57% chance of going 10-2 or better. 3. Vanderbilt : up 13.3 points (from 54th to 19th). Red zone miscues marred a shot at a second straight win against Alabama in Week 6, but the Commodores sure seem like a sturdy and deep team, one capable of winning a few of the many relative tossups on the back half of their schedule. 4. Kennesaw State : up 13.2 points (from 132nd to 93rd). In the Owls' first season in FBS, they went 2-10 and fired the only coach in the history of the program. In their second season, with Jerry Mack in charge, they're 4-2 and have the second-best odds of winning Conference USA (per SP+). 5. Texas Tech: up 12.7 points (from 29th to fourth). If Indiana isn't the story of 2025, the Red Raiders are. For the second time in three games, they lost quarterback Behren Morton to injury and still comfortably overachieved against SP+ projections in a 42-17 win over Kansas. They appear deeper, faster and meaner than anyone else in the Big 12. 6. Indiana: up 11.9 points (from 23rd to third). Cignetti is magic. So is this defense. 7. Old Dominion : up 11.8 points (from 101st to 69th). A week ago, the ultra-explosive Monarchs would have led this list. But even after Saturday's devastating no-show - a 48-24 loss at Marshall - they're still in the top 10. 8. New Mexico : up 11.6 points (from 130th to 94th). Jason Eck's Lobos have mastered the art of the competitive loss, and despite defeats to San Jose State and Boise State in the past two weeks, they still have a 61% chance of bowling, per SP+. 9. Temple : up 11.5 points (from 124th to 88th). First-year coach KC Keeler's Owls have pretty drastically exceeded projections in four of six games and, at 3-3, shouldn't have to wait too much longer to top three wins for the first time since 2019. 10. Memphis : up 11.3 points (from 52nd to 24th). This looked like a retooling year for Ryan Silverfield after some heavy turnover. Instead, the Tigers have already zipped past last year's No. 32 SP+ ranking, and they currently have a 33% chance of getting to 12-0. Moving down Here are the 10 teams whose ratings have fallen the most. It probably shouldn't be surprising that of the top five teams on this list, three have already dismissed their head coaches and the other two have overwhelmed first-year coaches ineffectively working through massive roster turnover. (Penn State collapsed so quickly that the Nittany Lions haven't even had a chance to fall this far yet.) 1. Oklahoma State: down 14.5 adjusted points per game (ranking has fallen from 57th to 112th). Less than two years ago, the Cowboys were playing in the Big 12 championship game. They've now lost 13 straight games to power-conference teams, and the last five have come by an average score of 49-12. 2. North Carolina: down 13.4 points (from 53rd to 103rd). It's not good when the athletic director who was steered by boosters into hiring your coach already has to give the dreaded vote of confidence after five games. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now 3. Virginia Tech: down 12.3 points (from 42nd to 86th). Their play has improved a hair since the firing of Brent Pry, but after two seasons of inconsistency, the bottom has dropped out after an offseason of heavy turnover. 4. Oregon State : down 10.7 points (from 75th to 114th). The Beavers have alternated between terribly unlucky losses and absolute duds, and Trent Bray coached his final game Saturday, a 39-14 home loss to Wake Forest. 5. Sam Houston : down 9.9 points (from 109th to 134th). Keeler won 10 games at SHSU, then left for Temple, and with an almost completely flipped roster and no home stadium - the Bearkats are playing an hour away in Houston while their stadium undergoes renovations - Phil Longo's first season in charge has been a dud. 6. South Alabama : down 9.8 points (from 78th to 117th). Major Applewhite's second season has been wrecked by portal departures and reasonably competitive losses. 7. Georgia Southern : down 9.4 points (from 80th to 115th). The offense is still sprightly, but the Eagles have allowed at least 34 points in five of six games and have won only twice. 8. Clemson: down 9.2 points (from 10th to 39th). Dabo Swinney's Tigers have their footing again after easy road wins against two of the other teams on this list, but they're still 3-3 and have only barely entered the top 40. Now the competition levels ramp up again. 9. Wisconsin: down 9.2 points (from 38th to 72nd). Good early defensive play had the Badgers at 2-0 and 35th after two weeks. But they've lost four straight by an average of 32-9, and their next four games are against Ohio State, Oregon, Washington and Indiana. Yikes. 10. Boston College: down 9.2 points (from 62nd to 97th). I thought BC could be pretty physical and competitive this season, but competitive early losses -- 42-40 to Michigan State, 28-24 to Cal -- evidently broke the Eagles. They were outscored by a combined 89-17 the last two weeks against Pitt and Clemson. My 10 favorite games of the weekend 1. UNLV 51, Air Force 48 . Air Force went on a 21-3 run, then UNLV went on a 16-0 run (which included an 86-yard touchdown pass), and then the back-and-forth began. We saw nine lead changes in the second half, including two in the last 75 seconds. Liam Szarka 's 9-yard touchdown gave Air Force a 48-44 lead with 1:13 remaining, but UNLV's Anthony Colandrea raced 19 yards for the go-ahead score 37 seconds later. The Rebels almost left too much time on the clock -- the Falcons quickly drove 52 yards to set up an attempt for the game-tying field goal, but Jacob Medina pushed it wide right. Total combined yards: 1,200. A glorious track meet. 2. Navy 32, Temple 31 . Temple nearly doubled Navy in first downs (27-15), limited Blake Horvath to 6-for-16 passing and held the ball for nearly 10 more minutes -- against a really good service academy team! That is a feat in itself. The Owls led by 10 in the second half, too. But with the game on the line, Horvath did what he has done on so many occasions over the past two seasons: break into the open field at the right time. 3. No. 8 Alabama 27, No. 14 Missouri 24 . You don't get many realistic shots at beating Alabama, and Missouri couldn't seize its best chance in 50 years. A pair of huge fourth-down completions, including a Ty Simpson -to- Daniel Hill touchdown, gave Bama a late 27-17 lead, but Mizzou looked like it might charge back to tie it before Dijon Lee Jr . picked off Beau Pribula 's pass with 37 seconds left. 4. No. 18 BYU 33, Arizona 27 (2OT) . BYU jumped out to an early 14-0 lead, but Arizona charged back after a lengthy storm delay. A 24-0 run gave the Wildcats a healthy lead heading into the final five minutes, but two late BYU scores, including a Bear Bachmeier sneak with 19 seconds remaining, sent the game to overtime. Neither team could put the ball in the end zone on its first OT possession, but Bachmeier scored again in the second, and Noah Fifita 's last-gasp pass to Javin Whatley fell incomplete. 5. FCS: No. 14 Jackson State 38, Alabama State 34 . I love it when the Small-School Showcase games in my Friday previews exceed expectations. Played in front of 44,000 at Jackson's Veterans Memorial Stadium, JSU-ASU was a battle for early SWAC supremacy. ASU took the lead twice in the second half, but JSU charged back both times. Nate Rembert 's 18-yard touchdown catch gave the Tigers the lead with 50 seconds left, but the Hornets quickly drove the length of the field and needed just 2 yards on the final play to win the game. They got only 1. Jamarie Hostzclaw was knocked out of bounds just short of the goal line. Game, Tigers. 6. Bowling Green 28, Toledo 23 . Few rivalry games are as reliably wild as BGSU-Toledo, with loads of recent comebacks and surprise results. This one was both. Toledo, a comfortable favorite -- and a loser of more games than just about anyone as a comfortable favorite -- led 21-0 late in the first half and finished with a plus-223 yardage margin. But the Rockets' eight second-half possessions produced six punts and two turnovers, and BGSU slowly reeled them in. Chris McMillian 's 1-yard touchdown made the difference in a game with a cliff's-edge win probability chart. ESPN Analytics 7. FCS: Dartmouth 17, Yale 16 . Can I interest you in a 51-yard field goal at the buzzer to cap a 10-point fourth-quarter comeback? Yes? 8. Wyoming 35, San José State 28 . Wyoming's defense bought time, and eventually the offense made it pay off. Down 28-14 with 10 minutes left, the Cowboys' Brayden Johnson took an interception 65 yards for a touchdown, and Kaden Anderson 's 45-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Coenen tied the score with 2:44 left. Overtime? Nope! SJSU went four-and-out, and while attempting to position the ball for a potential winning field goal, Terron Kellman just kept churning his legs and raced 28 yards for the winning TD instead. 9. NAIA: Midland 60, No. 17 Concordia 52 (2OT). Ho-hum, just your typical, run-of-the-mill 31-point comeback. Midland trailed this battle of Nebraska rivals by a 38-7 margin with seven minutes left in the third quarter, but Brodey Johnson threw touchdown passes to four players to give the Warriors a stunning 45-38 lead ... only for Concordia to tie the score again with 21 seconds left. But that wasn't anything a couple more Johnson TD passes couldn't solve. His 13-yarder to Tae Marks provided the winning points of this utterly ridiculous track meet. 10. Northwestern 22, Penn State 21 . This wasn't a track meet, but it was certainly ridiculous.

24eb55a4748e,"Penn State fires James Franklin: Top candidates, transfers and recruits",,"Oct 12, 2025, 02:31 PM ET Less than a month ago, Penn State had legitimate national championship aspirations. Now, the school is looking for a new coach after firing James Franklin on Sunday . Franklin's fall was stunning, swift and historic, beginning with a type of loss (Oregon) that has come to define his Penn State tenure, and continuing with two other losses (against major underdogs UCLA and Northwestern ) that have not. A season-ending injury to starting quarterback Drew Allar against Northwestern added even more anguish to an awful afternoon in Happy Valley. The enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Just like that, Franklin's tenure of 11-plus years at Penn State is over, within the same calendar year as Penn State reached the cusp of the national championship game, only to fall to Notre Dame in a CFP semifinal. Penn State entered this season with a championship-or-bust mission, and boy, did things go bust. Although things fell apart quickly for Franklin, it also became harder to envision a path forward, despite his many successes at Penn State. Where does PSU go from here? The school has made significant investments in facilities, NIL and other areas. Athletics director Patrick Kraft is a football guy who wants to win at the highest level. Penn State has access to talent in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, and can compete for major goals on a regular basis. The team can aim high with candidates, including from within the Big Ten, and certainly target those with a track record of winning the biggest games. Here are several candidates Penn State could pursue, as well as the roster and recruiting situation amid a coaching transition. -- Adam Rittenberg Candidates | Transfers | Recruits Five candidates for the job Nebraska coach Matt Rhule : The fit factor with Rhule at Penn State is off the charts. Rhule walked on for the Nittany Lions and played linebacker, and he also worked under Kraft at Temple, where he was head coach from 2013 to 2016. The two remain extremely close, although that friendship -- and preserving it -- might end up reducing the chances of a reunion. Then again, how many coach-AD combinations who know each other this well get a chance to link up again and chase a national championship? Rhule has won at his previous college stops, Baylor and Temple, and has Nebraska positioned for a Year 3 breakthrough at 5-1. He's a former NFL coach who now has some Big Ten experience and wouldn't shy away from the magnitude of the job. Rhule, 50, also likes his gig at Nebraska and has lifted the program out of an extended slump. But can he win a national title there? He certainly can at his alma mater. Indiana coach Curt Cignetti : Arguably, no move would shake up the Big Ten more than Coach Cig to Penn State. He doesn't have the relationship with Kraft that Rhule does, and he's more connected to Penn State's regional rivals in Pitt (assistant from 1993 to 1999) and West Virginia, where he played quarterback and where his father Frank coached. But Cignetti has won bigger than anyone could have imagined at historic bottom-feeder Indiana, where Kraft played football. Cignetti wins and wins big, including at his first head coaching stop, Indiana University-Pennsylvania, where he went 53-17 with three Division II playoff appearances. Cignetti, 64, could ride out the rest of his career at Indiana, but if he makes a move, it should be to a place with the resources to consistently compete for national titles. Curt Cignetti has already matched James Franklin in CFP trips and has a signature win over Oregon. (Photo by Soobum Im/Getty Images) Iowa State coach Matt Campbell : His name has appeared often on lists such as this over the years, but Campbell has stayed loyal to Iowa State, a program he built into a Big 12 contender. Penn State has long been mentioned as a program that would intrigue him, along with fellow Big Ten heavies Ohio State and Michigan, as well as Notre Dame. Campbell would bring a background on offense and with quarterbacks that could serve Penn State well after the end of Franklin's tenure, where the offense never consistently reached its potential. He played a season of college ball at Pitt before finishing at Mount Union, in his home state of Ohio, where he spent his entire coaching career before taking the Iowa State job. The time seems right for the 45-year-old to make a big move, and Penn State would be a sensible landing spot. Duke coach Manny Diaz : There are a range of opinions on how Diaz's tenure went at Miami and ultimately how things ended for him there. But he's positioning himself for a possible jump to a program on a similar tier to the U. Could it end up being Florida State, his alma mater, or another program in the ACC and Southeast, where he has primarily lived and coached? It's quite possible. But he also spent the 2022 and 2023 seasons as Penn State's defensive coordinator, boosting the Lions' defense to nationally elite levels before heading to Duke, where he is 13-6 in his second season. Diaz would bring a different energy to Penn State's program and an aggressive defensive philosophy that served the Lions well during his two seasons there. He can recruit throughout the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic, and he is 34-21 overall as an FBS coach. UNLV coach Dan Mullen : As UNLV has surged to a 6-0 start in Mullen's first season, the market will view him in several lights. Yes, his Florida tenure fell apart in a hurry, but the issues in Gainesville clearly go beyond Mullen, who still went 34-15 with the Gators and had three AP top-15 finishes. Mullen's overall record of 109-61 is very impressive, and other than Florida, he hasn't been at the top resourced programs. He might not be a rabid recruiter, but he's a superb quarterback developer and has the big-game wins Penn State lacked under Franklin. Although most of Mullen's career took place at two SEC schools, Florida and Mississippi State, he was born in Pennsylvania and played college ball in the state at Ursinus College. Mullen, 53, might seek a move closer to the Northeast. -- Rittenberg Five important players to retain DE Chaz Coleman : The true freshman pass rusher has made a huge impression since arriving on campus and would be extremely coveted if he explored a transfer. Coleman was an ESPN 300 recruit as a 6-foot-4, 220-pound athlete who also played quarterback in high school. In his first year in the program, he has already bulked up to 246 pounds and has flashed big-time potential with 11 pressures through his first five games, three tackles for loss and a strip sack against FIU that he returned 39 yards. LB Tony Rojas : We're finding out just how valuable Rojas is for a Nittany Lions defense that's struggling to stop the run without him. Rojas, a 20-game starter, went down with an unspecified long-term injury in practice days after the Oregon loss, and it's unclear when he'll return. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound junior was tied for the team lead in TFLs with 4.5 when he went down and would have two more seasons of eligibility if he needs to take a medical redshirt for 2025. Tony Rojas has missed time this season but has extensive starting experience. Chris Arjoon/Icon Sportswire OL Anthony Donkoh : If we're assuming Olaivavega Ioane goes pro after this season, Donkoh would be Penn State's most experienced returning lineman next year. The 6-foot-5, 323-pound redshirt sophomore started 10 games at right tackle last year, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten recognition, before suffering a season-ending knee injury in November. He started the first four games this season at right guard. Donkoh has two more seasons of eligibility and should be a leader for this offensive line next year. CB A.J. Harris : Harris transferred in from Georgia in 2024 and immediately proved he was ready to be a difference-maker as a sophomore, earning 15 starts and finishing with 48 tackles, one interception, five pass breakups and the seventh-best defensive grade among Big Ten starting corners, according to Pro Football Focus. If Harris stays in school for his senior season, he could compete for All-Big Ten honors. True freshman cornerback Daryus Dixson looks like a future star as well and would be another important cover man to hold onto. TE Luke Reynolds : Tyler Warren is emerging as one of the top tight ends in the NFL as a rookie, and now it's up to Reynolds to replace him as Penn State's next great tight end. The 6-foot-4, 250-pound sophomore earned four starts during his debut season and ranks fifth among Big Ten tight ends with 197 receiving yards on 18 catches this fall. He'll be a key target for Penn State's inexperienced QBs to finish out this year and will have two more seasons of eligibility. -- Max Olson Three key recruits WR Davion Brown , No. 71 in the ESPN 300 : Not since the 2022 recruiting class -- the same cycle the Nittany Lions landed quarterback Drew Allar -- has Penn State signed a wide receiver rated as highly as Brown. It's part of the reason Franklin and his staff had to hit the transfer portal so heavily to surround Allar with pass-catching talent ahead of the 2025 season. A productive, 6-foot-2, 200-pound receiver from Richmond, Virginia, Brown has been Penn State's top 2026 commit since May when he picked the program amid a slew of ACC, Big Ten and SEC offers. That could soon change if pledges start pouring out of the Nittany Lions' class. OT Kevin Brown , No. 80 in the ESPN 300 : ESPN's No. 2 prospect in the state of Pennsylvania this cycle, Brown is the type of offensive tackle talent Penn State has at times struggled to land as it strived to compete atop the Big Ten in recent years. That's what made Brown such an important piece of Franklin's latest recruiting class as one of the Nittany Lions' earliest pledges in the cycle. Brown, out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has visited Penn State more than a dozen times, but with offensive tackle talent at a premium at this stage, home ties might only do so much in keeping the 6-foot-5, 245-pound blocker committed to the Nittany Lions. RB Messiah Mickens , No. 135 in ESPN 300 : Mickens is a teammate of Brown's at Harrisburg (Pennsylvania) High School and stands as the longest-tenured member of the Nittany Lions' class. ESPN's 14th-ranked running back in 2026, Mickens flirted with a flip to Notre Dame earlier this year before shutting down his recruitment in March. Mickens has been sidelined by an injury over the past month. But with upheaval at Penn State, Notre Dame -- with former Nittany Lions running backs coach Ja'Juan Seider on staff -- should be one of the many programs to circle back with Mickens, Pennsylvania's 2024 Gatorade Football Player of the Year. -- Eli Lederman",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46571365/penn-state-james-franklin-fired-candidates-recruits-transfers,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0307%2Fr1461031_3_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,2692975000235bbc706bc36ed2f9494bc6ce62b1

36a712455b26,NCAAF,,"So much of college football these past few years has been defined by what's new. There's the transfer portal, NIL money, revenue sharing, revamped rosters, realignment, private equity firms looking to do business with schools, and leagues eager to build up their cash reserves so they can finally afford to build those gold-plated lockers they've had their eyes on. If you fell into a coma in 2019 and awoke a week ago, the entirety of the sport would feel like some sort of fever dream. And yet, for all this change, for all that's new in college football, one thing has remained steadfastly true: The biggest brands have continued to dominate the sport. It has been nearly three decades since we've had a first-time national champion. It's been more than four decades since Florida State and Miami forced their way into the staid ranks of college football's blue bloods. It has been a lifetime since someone in the Big Ten could realistically be called ""fun."" But here we are, halfway through the 2025 season, and Indiana has given us something unique, entertaining and truly new -- a program that had wallowed in obscurity for decades is now a genuine power on the national stage. ""We showed the country we're a real team,"" quarterback Fernando Mendoza said after Saturday's stunning 30-20 win over No. 3 Oregon . It's true. Indiana has uniforms, a playbook and everything else. play 0:24 Elijah Sarratt’s TD puts Indiana ahead for good Fernando Mendoza connects with Elijah Sarratt to take the lead against the Ducks. The advent of NIL, revenue sharing and the portal was supposed to simply make the rich richer, but the opposite has largely been true, and Indiana is Exhibit No. 1. Until 2020, Taylor Swift had not been alive during a year in which the Hoosiers finished ranked in the AP Top 25, and stunningly she hadn't written a single song about how sad that was. Even that 2020 season was mostly a figment of COVID's artificial reality, and the program regressed to 2-10 a season later. It's almost impossible to overstate just how bleak Indiana's football history had been, so bad that even amid all the basketball program's malaise, no one ever thought, ""Hey, maybe we could care about football instead."" Indiana was cheerfully irrelevant, not even interestingly bad, but rather just unnecessary to any larger conversation. Like the protagonist of every John Mellencamp song, Indiana was a program destined to relive the indignities of every past generation, no matter how hard it fought against the crushing obviousness of it all. It was Jack and Diane and Gerry DiNardo. Then Curt Cignetti arrived, overhauled the roster, brashly told the world to Google him, and after scrolling past 73 sponsored results selling military-grade generators, you learned that the Hoosiers coach had won everywhere he had ever been, and he wasn't about to change now. ""I felt this coming in,"" Cignetti said of Saturday's win. Cignetti said he had ""big road wins"" at his past stops, and no matter that those stops were in places like IUP, Elon, James Madison and not the Big Ten, his intuition was right. On Saturday, Mendoza slung the ball around, hitting star receiver Elijah Sarratt eight times for 121 yards and a score. On Saturday, Aiden Fisher and the country's most underrated defense held Heisman Trophy favorite Dante Moore to just 5.5 yards per throw and picked him off twice. On Saturday, it became entirely reasonable to ask if Indiana could win a national championship. That is a patently absurd statement, like asking if a fish could be elected prime minister of Canada. Of course, Canada tried that with a particularly cogent salmon in the 1920s, and it worked out horribly. The Hoosiers, on the other hand, seem entirely at home atop the college football universe. Then look around the rest of the Big Ten. Penn State is in shambles after a third straight loss. Michigan was upended by USC 31-13 in a game that was more about what the Wolverines are lacking than what USC might be capable of accomplishing. Of course, this could also all be part of Michigan's plan to lure Ohio State into a false sense of confidence only to beat Ryan Day again at the end of November, because it's way funnier when it happens that way. Elsewhere, Nebraska narrowly escaped Maryland , UCLA now seems like a tough out, and things are so bleak at Wisconsin everyone has already moved on to ice fishing season. Amid all that mediocrity, Indiana is a breath of fresh air, the type of story movies are made about. We can picture it now: a lovable band of hardworking upstarts convinced by a coach brimming with confidence that they're just as good as the power players everyone thinks should win. They could call the movie ""Hoosiers."" It'd be an instant classic. Of course, the story gets the storybook ending only if Indiana keeps winning, and although the remaining schedule is more than amenable, the Hoosiers' ultimate date with destiny will arrive eventually. The Buckeyes are the defending champs, the standard by which everyone else in the Big Ten is judged. Ohio State dominated No. 17 Illinois on Saturday, too -- 34-16 -- but that win hardly warrants headlines because the Buckeyes are used to doing this. Ohio State is a story when it doesn't win, not when it lives up to all the advanced billing. The Buckeyes chug along, replacing bastions of NFL talent with a fresh cast, year after year. Indiana is still a story because we couldn't have seen this coming. Indiana is a surprise. Indiana is new. This is not a sport that welcomes anyone new to the party, which makes what Indiana is doing still an entirely precarious thing. But if Cignetti and the Hoosiers can keep winning, can get to the Big Ten championship and upend the Buckeyes, can make the playoff and win there, too, if they can win so much that no one is surprised when it happens anymore, that would be a real story. More: Trends Group of 5 updates | Big 12 hijinks Under the radar | Heisman five Week 7 vibe check Each week, the biggest games deliver thrilling results that shift the landscape of the college football world. Beyond those headlines, however, a host of other subtler shifts occur. We try to capture those here. Trending down: Week 1 overreactions Two things were clear after the first Saturday of the regular season: Florida State was back and Kalen DeBoer was being fitted for his membership jacket in the Alabama coaching bust club alongside Mike DuBose and Mike Shula. Mike Price would've been in, too, but he accidentally ended up at the wrong club entirely. Well, six weeks later, things look a little different. The Tide knocked off Missouri 27-24 -- the fifth straight team to be handed its first loss of the season by Alabama -- thanks to another brilliant performance by Ty Simpson , who threw for three touchdowns in the win. The Tide defense held Missouri's Heisman Trophy hopeful Ahmad Hardy to just 52 yards rushing, helping pave the way to a win for an offense that mustered just 325 total yards -- including 2 by center Parker Brailsford , 2 by left tackle Kadyn Proctor and none by star receiver Ryan Williams . The win proved another résumé builder in Simpson's Heisman campaign, something that would've seemed patently absurd to say after the FSU loss. It was also another victory for DeBoer's famed ""black hoodie of death,"" which is now the most successful bit of coaching attire since Dan Mullen's legendary ""gray comfy pants of mediocrity."" Meanwhile, Florida State lost for the third straight time, 34-31, to Pitt , and has now gone 386 days without an ACC win. The Noles allowed Pitt freshman QB Mason Heintschel to throw for 321 yards, and FSU has surrendered points on 17 of 33 complete drives during the three-game skid. This leads us to some compelling evidence as we begin to discuss who'll be in the 12-team playoff. Florida State beat, arguably, the best team in the SEC. Florida State is 0-3 in the ACC. Therefore, the ACC is clearly far, far better than the SEC. That's just math. Trending up: Interim coaching UCLA continues to look exceptional after firing DeShaun Foster, as Tim Skipper and the Bruins walloped Michigan State 38-13 on Saturday. After mustering just 57 total points amid an 0-4 start under Foster, the coaching change has provided a spark to UCLA that typically can't be achieved without drinking that lemonade from Panera that has so much guanine it allows you to travel through time. Skipper has been a revelation. On the flight to Michigan, he left a note on each seat on the plane reading, ""Are you a one-hit wonder?"" which served to motivate both his team and Dexys Midnight Runners who returned to the studio for the first time in 43 years in hopes of getting a second hit. Skipper also showed plenty of chutzpah by calling for a brilliantly executed fake punt that led to a UCLA touchdown. UCLA has put up 80 points against Penn State and Michigan State the past two weeks with Jerry Neuheisel calling the plays and, we assume, stealing Kelly Kapowski's heart in the process. The key to the offensive turnaround has been the legs of QB Nico Iamaleava , who ran for 128 yards and three touchdowns in Saturday's win, leading his agent to immediately demand a trade back to the SEC. Trending up: Changes in Happy Valley Penn State opened the season No. 2 in the country. The Nittany Lions have now lost three in a row, after falling to Northwestern 22-21 Saturday. The passing and ground game struggled, and after Penn State scored a go-ahead TD with 10:50 to play in the game, the Jim Knowles-led defense surrendered a 12-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that, until that moment, the folks working at Northwestern's physics department had only hypothesized was theoretically possible. All of this leaves Penn State in a bleak position. Hopes for the playoff are over, and Drew Allar suffered a season-ending injury. Penn State would owe James Franklin a boatload of cash to fire him, and the world's best bioengineers are still months away from developing a microchip that would allow Franklin to experience emotions during a loss. And the next three games for the Nittany Lions: at Iowa, at Ohio State , vs. Indiana. There might be serious rumblings about now that Penn State could be this year's 2024 Florida State, except 2025 Florida State seems to have dibs on that title already. Trending up: Hugh Freeze's anger Two weeks ago, Auburn might've toppled Oklahoma , but a pair of officiating decisions doomed the Tigers. The SEC apologized later for one blown call involving a Sooners player who feigned leaving the game, but it did little to change the outcome. Saturday, Auburn looked to be on the verge of taking a significant lead against Georgia in a game that might've been a turning point for Freeze's program, and again, the officials intervened. Jackson Arnold appeared to be in the end zone for a touchdown that would've put Auburn up 17-0, but he was ruled down at the 1-inch line. On the next play, Arnold again appeared to cross the goal line before having the ball punched out, and again, the official disagreed. The play was ruled a fumble recovered by Georgia, which went on to score its first points of the game. Auburn never came close to cracking the scoreboard again, and the Dawgs won 20-10. So many near misses in back-to-back big games all going against Auburn is hard to believe. What, after all, has Freeze ever done to deserve such things? Wait, don't answer that. Trending down: Nussmeier injury worries Garrett Nussmeier , who is definitely not hurt, threw two picks as LSU struggled to find pay dirt yet again, but the Tigers' defense proved good enough to lead the way to another win, 20-10 over South Carolina . Nussmeier is fine, really. No reason to assume otherwise. Brian Kelly is so sure his QB is fine that his face is red with delight, and he's slamming his fist on tables just to drive home the point that there is definitely nothing wrong with Nussmeier. Still, LSU has played five games vs. FBS competition so far this season, and it has yet to score more than 23 points. Which is fine. Everything is fine. Stop asking. Trending down: A Petrino turnaround If Week 7 was a crowning moment for Curt Cignetti and his ""Google me"" catchphrase, it was a slightly less impressive coaching performance for Bobby Petrino, and his famous catchphrase, ""Please, whatever you do, don't Google me."" Petrino, in his first game as Arkansas ' interim head coach after Sam Pittman was fired two weeks ago, did have the Hogs ready for Tennessee , even leading midway through the second quarter. But Tennessee reeled off 24 straight points before a late Arkansas comeback attempt fell short. Will a close loss to the No. 12 team in the country do much for Petrino's quest to regain the job he was once fired from in disgrace? He should probably brace for the reality that it's not, or boy would his face be red when he doesn't get it. Trending down: Colorado 's petty cash Deion Sanders got his first win over a ranked foe since his first game at Colorado by knocking off No. 22 Iowa State 24-17. The crowd then stormed the field, marking the most excited anyone has ever been about something involving the state of Iowa. Afterward, Sanders was utterly flabbergasted to learn a field storming comes with a $50,000 fine. Thankfully no one told him how much eggs cost now. play 2:13 Colorado fans storm field; Deion 'happy and elated' Colorado fans storm the field after the Buffaloes upset Iowa State, and Deion Sanders shares his thoughts on the victory. Trending up: The Tar Heels North Carolina was off this week, thus going seven full days without an on-field embarrassment. Instead, the only facepalms UNC faced in the past week were the cancellation of a Hulu documentary, the suspension of an assistant coach for recruiting violations, reports of a divided locker room, reports that Bill Belichick and the school were working on a buyout after just five games, and, of course, Belichick using a winch he stole from Roy Williams' shed to remove the statue of Charlie Justice from in front of Kenan Stadium so he could get a better parking spot. Big 12 hijinks Because the Big 12 is essentially college football's Mad Libs, Week 7 was once again wild in the conference. Down to its fourth-string kicker, Iowa State rolled out a 310-pound freshman to boot kickoffs, which must have given Kadyn Proctor some ideas. Things are bleak in Stillwater, but Oklahoma State fans still know how to have a good time. If Mike Gundy was not among those shirtless fans, we question what he's even doing with his free time now. Texas Tech dominated Kansas in a 42-17 win despite the loss of starting QB Behren Morton thanks to tailback Cameron Dickey , who ran for 263 yards and a pair of touchdowns. It was the most rushing yards by a Red Raiders player since Byron Hanspard had 287 in 1996. Arizona State 's hopes to repeat as Big 12 champs took a big hit in Week 7 without starting QB Sam Leavitt . Instead, the Sun Devils turned to journeyman Jeff Sims , who has had stints at Georgia Tech , Nebraska and, we assume, spent a year living off the land and finding his inner truth in Joshua Tree. The result was predictably bad, as Utah dominated in a 42-10 win. And then there was BYU , which was on the verge of losing its first game of the season, trailing by a touchdown with 2:46 to play. That final drive included seven plays inside the Arizona 8, a fumble, two replay reviews and two penalties that gave BYU a fresh set of downs before Bear Bachmeier dove into the end zone for a game-tying score. The game went to a second overtime before Noah Fifita 's final pass on fourth down bounced off a receiver's hands in the end zone, and the Cougars won 33-27 to remain undefeated. Midseason Group of 5 conference rundown A playoff team, no Bull The best team in the Group of 5? It sure looks as if it might be USF . play 1:19 South Florida Bulls vs. North Texas Mean Green: Full Highlights South Florida Bulls vs. North Texas Mean Green: Full Highlights The Bulls already have wins over Boise State and Florida, and on Friday, they used a third-quarter scoring barrage to rack up a dominant 63-36 win over previously undefeated North Texas . USF scored four touchdowns in the span of just 3:37 of game clock, turning a 21-14 deficit just before the half into a 42-21 lead with 11:35 to play in the third quarter. Combined with the hot start by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFL ranks, football has proven to be a saving grace for the local area. Rebels hit the jackpot Six games into his tenure as the head coach at UNLV Dan Mullen has yet to lose, the Rebels are in the mix for a playoff berth, and no one has thrown a shoe at a critical time. UNLV survived an onslaught from Air Force on Saturday, 51-48, as Anthony Colandrea accounted for 423 yards and three touchdowns, including the game winner with 36 seconds to go. The Falcons -- electric on offense and utterly dismal on D -- are an adventure on a weekly basis, with nearly any outcome possible, the college football version of a 2 a.m. trip to Waffle House. It's invigorating and terrifying, satisfying and a little dangerous, and when it's over, you're often confused about why everything is so sticky. And Saturday's affair was no different. Air Force racked up 603 yards of offense, erased six different UNLV leads, and despite coughing up the late score, still had a chance to tie it after going 52 yards on six plays, but missed a 40-yard field goal as time expired. play 1:18 Air Force Falcons vs. UNLV Rebels: Full Highlights Air Force Falcons vs. UNLV Rebels: Full Highlights The win gets UNLV bowl eligible at 6-0, but the Rebels are thinking bigger -- a Mountain West title and a playoff bid, and burgeoning rumors of Mullen being a candidate for the soon-to-be-vacant Florida job. Who, who, who is leading Conference USA? Thursday's action featured a showdown between Conference USA powers rivaled in stature only by a Battle of the Bands competition involving Creed and Sugar Ray. Kennesaw State drubbed Louisiana Tech 35-7 behind a four-TD performance from QB Dexter Williams. Believe it or not, the Owls are now 4-2 on the season, doubling last year's win total already. That's a massive success for a football program that was founded just 10 years ago by 22 guys at the back of an Atlanta security line that had reached all the way to Kennesaw's campus, and the sky is the limit for where the Owls might go. Of Kennesaw State's remaining schedule, only New Mexico State (3-2) has a winning record. If the team can run the table and make it to the conference title game, it's likely no more than a couple years away from getting an official invitation to join the American, so that conference can properly create a separate parliament of owls division with FAU, Temple and Rice. MAC-tical jokers It was either Leo Tolstoy or Frank Solich who said, ""All good teams are alike; each bad team is bad in its own way."" This was certainly true for Saturday's pillow fight between MAC doormats Kent State and UMass . The Golden Flashes hadn't won a FBS game since 2022, but at least there is some history of success there. It's a program in search of leadership and direction, finding its place in the new world of college football in 2025. UMass's failures, however, can best be described as the football equivalent of that Ben Affleck picture where he's wearing a towel at the beach and staring out toward the horizon pondering his own insignificance in an infinite, uncaring universe. The Minutemen are 4-57 vs. FBS since the start of the 2019 season and 26-127 overall since becoming an FBS team in 2012. And so it was that Kent State proved that, on the ladder of success, it has at least climbed one rung, while UMass continues to dig deeper into its own grave Saturday. The Golden Flashes cruised to a 42-6 win, behind four touchdown passes from Dru DeShields . Bonus: Beavers hopes damned Things are bleak for Oregon State . The Beavers fell to 0-7 on the year after Wake Forest backup QB Deshawn Purdie threw four touchdown passes in a 39-14 win. The Beavers have now lost 13 of their past 14 games, with the lone win coming against the only other team currently in their conference, Washington State . Meanwhile, those Cougars had Ole Miss on upset alert, as the Rebels faltered early when QB Trinidad Chambliss was replaced by his far less successful twin Tobago Chambliss, who struggled in the red zone early, and the Rebels trailed 14-10 midway through the third quarter. Chambliss recovered, however, and finished the game with three total touchdowns and a 24-21 win. Since the breakup of the old Pac-12, Washington State and Oregon State are now a combined 3-10 vs. Power 4 competition, while George Kliavkoff wallows on his couch staring at an old photo of the Oregon Duck. Herd QB revival When last we saw Carlos Del Rio-Wilson , he was benched at Syracuse in favor of a tight end in a season that ultimately got Dino Babers fired. But as anyone in Syracuse knows, when life deals you 43 feet of snow, you pick yourself up, grab your shovel and start digging again. And so it is that Del Rio-Wilson has found new life at Marshall , accounting for four touchdowns in a dominant 48-24 win over a suddenly surging Old Dominion on Saturday. Del Rio-Wilson threw for 219 yards and a pair of scores and ran for 95 and two more touchdowns. It's the type of shocking success that makes one wonder whatever happened to other infamously unsuccessful Syracuse QBs such as Rex Culpepper, Zack Mahoney, Terrel Hunt, Greg Paulus, AJ Long, Clayton Welch ... and we're sorry we're being told we do not have space for a complete list. Under-the-radar play of the week As if football wasn't hard enough for the guys at Stanford right now, SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings upped the degree of difficulty by a sizable margin Saturday, dishing a behind-the-back pass to tight end RJ Maryland midway through the first quarter. Nine plays later, Jennings connected with Derrick McFall for a 19-yard TD pass, giving the Mustangs their first points of the game in what would eventually be a 34-10 win over the Cardinal. It wasn't all good news for SMU, however. Jennings' ball distribution was so pretty that, by Dallas law, the Dallas Mavericks had to immediately trade him to the Los Angeles Lakers after the game. Under-the-radar game of the week Bowling Green is feline good after a frisky 28-23 come-from-behind win Saturday over Toledo . For most of the game, Bowling Green simply seemed to be toying with the Rockets like so many balls of yarn, but during a wild four-play stretch midway through the fourth quarter, the Falcons proved they weren't kitten around, scoring on a 73-yard pass, recovering a fumble Toledo coughed up like a hair ball two plays later, then attacking the end zone like a laser pointer from 1 yard out on the next play. Eddie George picked up his first MAC win as Bowling Green's coach, though honestly no one cares. Bowling Green has a team cat. Everyone loves the cat. Heisman five 1. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza In the past calendar year, Mendoza is completing 71% of his throws with 29 total touchdowns and five interceptions, and that's despite half those games coming while playing in the ACC, which as we all know isn't supposed to have nice things. 2. Alabama QB Ty Simpson Since the opener against Florida State, Simpson is completing 76% of his throws, averaging 9.7 yards per pass, and has thrown 14 touchdowns with just one pick. Honestly, it feels really strange to list off a bunch of good stats while adding, ""if you don't count the Florida State game."" 3. Miami DE Rueben Bain Jr . Most people have Carson Beck as the Heisman front-runner because it is, by and large, a QB award. But no one at Miami has made a bigger impact on the Hurricanes this year than Bain, who has been an absolute wrecking machine off the edge. But, of course, the odds of a defensive player winning the Heisman are long, and the only path to it happening is for Bain to have an undeniably captivating narrative that voters can embrace. So, for as long as he remains Miami's best player, we'll work on building that narrative by sharing a little-known fact about the Canes' star defensive end. For example, did you know Bain was born on Sept. 8, 2004, and on Sept. 10, 2004, he drove his mom home from the hospital and assembled his own crib? 4. Cincinnati QB Brendan Sorsby A quick blind comparison: QB A: 87.3 Total QBR, 9.8 yards/pass, 14 TD, 1 INT QB B: 88.4 Total QBR, 10.8 yards/pass, 14 TD, 0 INT QB A represents Simpson's stat line since an opening-week loss. QB B is Sorsby's numbers after Cincinnati's opening-week loss. The country's most underrated QB is slinging it and has the Bearcats in contention in the Big 12. 5. Notre Dame QB CJ Carr Carr threw for 342 yards and a pair of scores in a 36-7 win over NC State . The performance helped Notre Dame avoid losing a second straight game to an ACC foe for the first time since 2014. Since then, the Irish are 49-10 vs. the ACC. Only Clemson (80) and Miami (50) have more wins vs. the ACC in that span than Notre Dame, despite the fact that Notre Dame does not play in the ACC.",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/gamedayfinal101125/college-football-week-7-highlights-top-plays-games-takeaways-2025,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1558946_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,2c474072fc53cdb29475f1ac9a4dbfac1eff9350
0f6177a5d6de,Week 6 winners and losers: Dowdle and Smith-Njigba deliver again; time to sack Fields?,,"Oct 12, 2025, 05:23 PM ET Week 6 of the 2025 fantasy football season featured several big performances and also quite a few disappointing ones. Who were the big winners and losers? Matt Bowen and Tristan H. Cockcroft offer their analyses. Jump to a topic: Ranking winners | Ranking losers Biggest injuries and what's next Ranking fantasy winners of Week 6 1. Rico Dowdle , RB, Carolina Panthers : Wow, 32-plus PPR fantasy points in back-to-back weeks, and this from a player who was available in 85% of ESPN leagues at the beginning of the month. Dowdle has totaled 66.3 points, 10 explosive runs, 140 more rushing yards than expected, and a 60.4% rushing success rate in his two starts, filling in for the injured Chuba Hubbard (calf). Though that's a wholly unsustainable level of performance, not to mention Hubbard is important enough to the Panthers' offense to reclaim at least some semblance of his former starting role, there's no question that Dowdle has a clear place in this backfield. If he gets the call against the Jets again in Week 7, he'd be a fantasy RB1. -- Cockcroft De'Von Achane scored twice and rushed for 128 yards against the Chargers. AP Photo/Lynne Sladky 2. De'Von Achane , RB, Miami Dolphins : He's doing remarkably well for a running back on a team that has averaged only 289 total yards per game while running 57% of its offensive plays while trailing on the scoreboard. Achane scored a season-best 31.0 PPR fantasy points, thanks in large part to his top-shelf speed -- his 13.8 mph average speed, per Next Gen Stats, is fastest among running backs with at least 20 carries -- and contributions in the receiving game. His team's struggles and likelihood of being trade deadline sellers make Achane more risk/reward than you might want from a fantasy RB1, but he has the skills to finish 2025 as one. -- Cockcroft 3. Cam Skattebo , RB, New York Giants : His ""Thursday Night Football"" performance was significant from a couple of angles. First, he took a trio of goal-to-go carries (4, 1 and 1 yards) in for touchdowns, alleviating fantasy managers' possible worry about his ability in that regard after he had scored on only one of six such tries entering the night. Second, Skattebo played a significantly greater percentage of offensive snaps (72%) and had more total touches (21) than Tyrone Tracy Jr . (30% and 4) in what was the latter's return from a shoulder injury. Skattebo has quickly shaped up as a high-end fantasy RB2, with the quarterback switch to Jaxson Dart helping diversify the Giants' offense. The team's task is more challenging in Week 7 against the Denver Broncos , but Skattebo should be started with confidence, nevertheless. -- Cockcroft Fueled by a 61-yard touchdown, Jaxon Smith-Njigba had his biggest fantasy output of the season. Logan Bowles/Getty Images 4. Jaxon Smith-Njigba , WR, Seattle Seahawks : Smith-Njigba scored a season-high 30.2 points against the Jacksonville defense in the Week 6 win. Smith-Njigba, who caught eight of a team-high 13 targets for 162 yards and a touchdown, showed his traits at every level of the route tree, including his scoring grab on a 61-yard vertical throw. Smith-Njigba has now posted 20 or more points in three of his past four games. He'll remain a solid WR1 -- even in a tough matchup -- for the Week 7 game versus Houston. -- Bowen 5. Josh Jacobs , RB, Green Bay Packers : For the second consecutive game, Jacobs exceeded 30 PPR fantasy points; his 32.0 on Sunday coming after the 31.7 he had the week before the Packers' Week 5 bye. This was Jacobs' best game yet in 2025, as he averaged 5.2 yards per carry, had four explosive runs and continued to hold the crown as the best goal-line running back in football, turning a 3-yard opportunity into a score in the second quarter. He's the NFL's leader with 46 carries, 18 touchdowns and a 5.0 yards-per-carry average on goal-to-go plays since the beginning of last season. Jacobs should continue to perform like an RB1 against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 7. -- Cockcroft 6. George Pickens , WR, Dallas Cowboys : Pickens' 31.8 points led all wide receivers through the early window, when he caught nine passes for 168 yards and a touchdown in the Week 6 loss to the Panthers. Pickens showcased his playmaking traits here, plus we saw how quickly he can get up to top speed on his touchdown catch. Take the slant route and erase the defensive angles after the catch. With at least one touchdown reception in five straight games, Pickens will be in the WR1 discussion for the Week 7 game versus Washington if CeeDee Lamb (ankle) is still out. -- Bowen 7. Kimani Vidal , RB, Los Angeles Chargers : If Week 6 was any indication, there was little doubt as to who is the Chargers' No. 1 running back in Omarion Hampton 's (ankle) absence. Vidal played 68% of the offensive snaps, had 18 of the team's 24 rushing attempts and totaled 21 touches to Hassan Haskins ' six, scoring a career-best 22.8 PPR fantasy points. Vidal had four explosive runs and 58 more rushing yards than expected, per Next Gen Stats. He needs to be added in the remaining 72.9% of ESPN leagues in which he's available, even with his next opponent, the Indianapolis Colts , having performed well against running backs the past three weeks (17.7 PPR FPTS per game allowed). -- Cockcroft play 0:59 Can Kayshon Boutte build on a successful Week 6 in fantasy? Eric Karabell explains why he expects Kayshon Boutte to continue his recent fantasy success in Week 7 vs. the Titans. 8. Drake Maye , QB; Kayshon Boutte , WR, New England Patriots : Maye scored a season-high 27.24 in Sunday's win over the Saints, and he was dialed in as a thrower. Maye completed 18 of 26 passes for 261 yards and 3 touchdowns, and he also added 28 yards rushing on nine carries. Boutte caught all five of his targets in this one for 93 yards, with two of those receptions going for touchdowns. Maye will remain a QB1 with a positive Week 7 matchup versus the Titans, while Boutte, who is available in over 90% of ESPN leagues, could be a potential waiver pickup/streaming option in deeper formats. -- Bowen 9. Tyler Warren , TE, Indianapolis Colts: He scored double-digit fantasy points for the fifth time in his first six NFL games, benefiting significantly from Daniel Jones ' rebound season. Warren, who matched his Week 4 seasonal best with 18.3 PPR fantasy points this week, leads the Colts in targets (40), receptions (29), receiving yards (370) and red zone targets (7), effectively being Jones' go-to receiver. Consider the rookie a fantasy TE1, even in Week 7 against a tough Los Angeles Chargers matchup. -- Cockcroft 10. Brian Thomas , Jr., WR, Jacksonville Jaguars : After a slight uptick in fantasy numbers over his past two games, Thomas posted his best totals of the season in the Week 6 loss to the Seahawks. Thomas finished with 23.0 points, catching eight of a team-high 10 targets for 90 yards, plus he brought in his first touchdown catch. Thomas has caught 17 of 23 targets over his past three games, and we are seeing more efficient throwing from quarterback Trevor Lawrence when targeting his No.1 receiver. The arrow is pointing up on Thomas heading into the Week 7 game versus the Rams. -- Bowen 11. Dallas Goedert , TE, Philadelphia Eagles : Goedert played a volume role in the Thursday night loss to the Giants, producing season highs in receptions (nine), targets (11), receiving yards (110) and fantasy points (26.0). And even though Godert's recent touchdown grabs have a gadget-like feel to them, he has found the end zone at least once in four straight games. This Eagles pass game needs some work, but Goedert continues to post numbers as an underneath option for quarterback Jalen Hurts . And those are high-percentage throws to the tight end. Goedert sticks in the midtier TE1 range for the Week 7 game at Minnesota. -- Bowen Ranking fantasy losers of Week 6 Justin Fields was sacked nine times and finished with only 45 passing yards against the Broncos. DANIEL HAMBURY/EPA/Shutterstock 1. Justin Fields , QB, New York Jets : In a bad football game in London, Fields scored just 4.9 points during the 13-11 loss to the Broncos, finishing with as many completions as sacks (nine). Fields added 31 yards rushing on seven carries; however, his inability to play on time as a thrower, plus his poor pocket awareness versus pressure, contributed to his rough final line (9-of-17 passing, 45 yards). With an 0-6 record and Fields regressing as a passer, the Jets could make a move to backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor for the Week 7 matchup versus Carolina. Stay tuned. -- Bowen This game was a statistical nightmare. Fields' 4.90 fantasy points were his worst in any game he played to completion since his 1.16 in Week 7 of 2021, the fifth career start during his rookie campaign. The Jets totaled 24.5 PPR fantasy points from their skill-position players (QB, RB, WR and TE), the fewest by any team in a game since the Arizona Cardinals totaled 17.2 in a 27-0 loss to the Cleveland Browns in Week 9 of the 2023 season, in Clayton Tune 's only career NFL start. -- Cockcroft 2. Saquon Barkley , RB, Philadelphia Eagles: Barkley scored a season-low 8.7 points in the Thursday night loss to the Giants. After a strong start on an opening drive that featured two rushes of 10 or more yards, Barkley was limited by the Giants' defense. The Eagles' offensive tackles (and tight ends) failed to win the edges, and I didn't see enough vertical displacement to create running lanes for Barkley on zone run schemes. Barkley, who finished with 67 total yards on 14 touches, gets the Vikings' defense in Week 7. And there's a lot to fix with this Eagles offense. -- Bowen 3. Matthew Stafford , QB, and Davante Adams , WR, Los Angeles Rams : Puka Nacua 's injury (see below) set the Rams' passing game back, despite what was an extremely favorable matchup on paper, as Stafford and Adams mustered only 9.34 and 7.9 PPR fantasy points, respectively. Adams had to tangle with CB Nate Wiggins , by far the Ravens' most effective defender in coverage this season, as the veteran wideout managed only two catches for 29 yards on five targets with Wiggins the nearest defender. Even if Nacua can't play in Week 7 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the matchup is every bit as favorable (if not more so), meaning Stafford and Adams should rebound in a big way. -- Cockcroft 4. Javonte Williams , RB, Dallas Cowboys: The Cowboys' well-regarded offensive line couldn't open any holes for him, especially up the middle, as Williams was stuffed at or behind the line four times, had 27 fewer rushing yards than expected, and scored a season-worst 8.4 PPR fantasy points against the Carolina Panthers. It was his most disappointing performance as a Cowboy, and he was started in 81.0% of ESPN leagues. Williams has good odds of a rebound against the Washington Commanders in Week 6, however. -- Cockcroft 5. Quinshon Judkins , RB, Cleveland Browns: Judkins had a season-worst 3.6 points in Sunday's loss to the Steelers. Judkins had 12 carries, but he averaged 3.0 yards per rush and failed to record a reception for the first time this season. With Pittsburgh controlling the line of scrimmage, plus Cleveland's lack of explosive play ability, Judkins was a nonfactor. He'll look to rebound next week with a positive run game matchup versus the Dolphins. -- Bowen 6. Travis Etienne Jr ., RB, Jacksonville Jaguars: After four straight games with double-digit production to start the season, Etienne has cooled off over the past two weeks. Etienne, who scored 8.8 points in the Week 5 win over Kansas City, managed 9.5 points in Sunday's loss to the Seahawks. Though Etienne caught four passes for 28 yards, he had only 27 yards rushing on 12 carries (2.3 YPC). With another tough matchup in Week 7 against the Rams' defense, Etienne will stay in my Flex ranks. -- Bowen 7. Michael Pittman Jr , WR, Indianapolis Colts: Pittman posted season lows across the board in the Week 6 win over the Cardinals. Pittman had just three targets, catching two for 20 yards (4.0 points). With quarterback Daniel Jones playing like a point guard, distributing the ball to seven different players, Pittman had a quiet day. However, Pittman had seen at least five targets in each of his first five games played this season, and he'll remain a high-floor WR3 for the Week 7 matchup versus the Chargers. -- Bowen 8. Chase Brown , RB, Cincinnati Bengals : Game flow played a factor in Brown's usage during the Week 6 loss to the Packers, as he finished with 42 yards rushing on nine carries, plus he caught two passes for 7 yards (8.9 points). However, Brown hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 1 (with Joe Burrow under center), and the switch to Joe Flacco on Sunday didn't boost his numbers. Given the consistent lack of rushing production for Brown this season (2.7 YPC), he will remain a lower-tier Flex for the Week 7 matchup versus Pittsburgh. -- Bowen Injury impact Emeka Egbuka , WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers : What we know: Egbuka departed the game because of a hamstring injury in the second half versus the 49ers, and he did not return. Egbuka finished with two catches (on four targets) for 24 yards. What's next: If Egbuka is out for the Week 7 game at Detroit, he would potentially join Mike Evans (hamstring), Chris Godwin, Jr. (fibula) and Jalen McMillan (neck) as Tampa receivers who are out because of injuries. Managers will need to stay on top of the injury reports out of Tampa this week, as Sterling Shepard and Tez Johnson could serve as streaming options versus the Lions. --Bowen Marvin Harrison Jr . , WR, Arizona Cardinals What we know: Harrison left the game because of a head injury in the second quarter versus the Colts, and he was eventually declared out because of a concussion. Before exiting, Harrison caught both of his targets for 32 yards (5.2 points). What's next: If Harrison is out for Week 7, managers can pick up Cardinals wide receiver Zay Jones for the matchup versus the Packers. Jones' usage increased with Harrison out, catching five of eight targets for 79 yards (12.2 points). And Jones is available in over 90% of ESPN leagues. --Bowen Puka Nacua , WR, Los Angeles Rams What we know: He suffered a lower leg injury while falling hard on the ground while attempting a second-quarter catch in the end zone. Though he returned to the game in the third quarter, he played only seven more offensive snaps. Rams coach Sean McVay said afterward that Nacua has an ankle injury that casts doubt on the star receiver's status for Week 7 against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. What's next: The Rams couldn't get much done passing without Nacua, as Tyler Higbee scored a team-best 10.6 PPR fantasy points after the injury. Davante Adams would step up as Matthew Stafford's top target, with Jordan Whittington and Konata Mumpfield Nos. 2 and 3, respectively, if Nacua can't play. -- Cockcroft David Njoku , TE, Cleveland Browns What we know: He injured his knee shortly before halftime, and despite briefly returning multiple times during the second and early part of the third quarters, he was removed from the game for good early in the fourth quarter. What's next: The severity of Njoku's injury is unknown, so he'll be a player to monitor entering the practice week. Rookie Harold Fannin Jr ., who has more targets (37), receptions (28) and PPR fantasy points (59.8) than Njoku (36, 23 and 51.3), would benefit most and elevate to fantasy TE1 status for Week 6 against the Miami Dolphins , should Njoku miss additional time. -- Cockcroft",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/FFSundayHighLows-46574955/nfl-week-6-fantasy-football-winners-losers-injuries-rankings-more,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559335_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,85adc3d6743a7621d7ac66ee0ed1a3600df6548a
bba9a8750054,Judging biggest overreactions for NFL Week 6 games,,"Being 0-6 is no fun, so it's no surprise that Jets coach Aaron Glenn wasn't in the best mood at his postgame news conference Sunday in London. Asked whether Justin Fields would remain his starting quarterback next week against Carolina, Glenn said, ""What kind of question is that?"" After watching Fields look totally lost against the Broncos, I would say it's a good one. But is it an overreaction? Oh, I'm so glad you asked. Let's tackle that and a few other potential overreactions to NFL Week 6 games, sizing up which ones are legitimate and which ones are irrational. (And we will also hit a few fantasy football topics at the bottom.) Jump to: Jets should bench Fields? Maye is the top 2024 QB? Cowboys need a trade on D? Jags' 4-1 start wasn't for real? Healthy Bucs would be unstoppable? Five fantasy-related overreactions The Jets need to bench Justin Fields Fields was 9-for-17 for 45 passing yards against the Broncos , and because he took nine sacks for a total of 55 lost yards, the Jets finished the game with minus-10 net passing yards. This happened in 2025 ... when the forward pass has been legal for over a century. Fields didn't do much with his legs, either, rushing seven times for 31 yards. Overall, the team had 82 total yards of offense and went 2-for-15 on third down. And it was a shame, because the Jets' defense actually stood up in this one. New York had a chance to win if it could have generated any offense at all. Thanks to a third-quarter safety, it led this game 11-10 until the Broncos kicked a go-ahead field goal with 5:06 left. The Jets got the ball back twice after that, but those two possessions generated minus-6 yards on nine plays. Fields was pressured on 14 of his 29 dropbacks, which obviously makes it difficult. But he was completely lost when facing pressure, completing just one pass for minus-1 yard and taking those nine sacks. Denver's defense is one of the best in the league, sure. But this isn't the first time this season that Fields has looked very bad. He was a mess before garbage time in Week 5 against a Cowboys defense that has been torched this season by the likes of Russell Wilson , Caleb Williams and Bryce Young . Fields had a 0.9 QBR in Week 2 against the Bills before leaving because of a concussion . Fields and the Jets' offense just don't look like they're on the verge of any kind of solution. Verdict: OVERREACTION Hear me out: What's the point of switching to Tyrod Taylor ? The Jets are 0-6. Their season isn't going anywhere. They're probably going to start trading away guys in the next couple of weeks ahead of the trade deadline. They gave Fields a $40 million contract last offseason and planned to evaluate him this entire season to decide whether he can be the future at the position. There's no reason to move off that plan unless the Jets now think this is totally irretrievable. And Fields has played a couple of very good games this season -- against Pittsburgh in Week 1 (one of the best games of his career) and against Miami in Week 4 . The Jets have a lot of issues on offense, and Fields might be the most glaring of them all. But as ugly as it looks -- and as reasonable as the question is, Aaron Glenn -- the rest of this season for the Jets has to be about evaluation. And Fields is probably the most important evaluation they need to make. Drake Maye will turn out to be the best QB from the 2024 draft class There was no letdown whatsoever for Maye and the Patriots after last Sunday night's huge victory in Buffalo . They went down to New Orleans and beat a surprisingly game Saints team 25-19 . Maye threw three touchdown passes in the first half, all of which traveled at least 20 yards in the air. At the time, at least, that tied the Giants' Russell Wilson (yeah, Week 2 against the Cowboys) for the most such touchdown passes by any player in a game this season. The Patriots are 4-2. The last time they started 4-2 without Tom Brady as their quarterback was 1999. They have won three games in a row for the first time since 2022 and are firmly in the AFC East division race thanks to that Week 5 victory. And the Patriots certainly aren't coddling their second-year quarterback at all to do it. Verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTION Yes, Washington's Jayden Daniels is the clear leader right now and might always be the answer to this question. Chicago's Caleb Williams has the talent to overtake both of these guys. But to think Maye could turn out to be the best of the bunch is not farfetched at all. play 0:35 Maye connects with Boutte for 2nd TD of the game Drake Maye finds Kayshon Boutte for their 2nd touchdown connection of the game. This isn't a scaled-down, dink-and-dunk offense in New England. In fact, it appears offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels is making major alterations to the game plan week to week based on the opponent -- the way he used to when Brady was there. You don't do that if you don't have tremendous faith in your quarterback's ability to handle it. Maye is playing at a higher level than a lot of people realize, using his arm and his legs to beat teams with different receivers and a running back corps that has done a lot of fumbling. He's already a star. The Cowboys need to trade for defensive help this week A week after beating the Jets in New Jersey, the Cowboys couldn't keep Bryce Young and the Panthers off the scoreboard in Carolina. They lost 30-27 when the Panthers kicked a tiebreaking field goal with no time left on the clock. Dallas allowed 410 yards of offense, 216 of which were rushing yards and 239 of which came from former Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle . Dowdle has been subbing in for injured Panthers starter Chuba Hubbard the past couple of weeks and surely enjoyed tearing through the team that let him walk in free agency. This is the fourth game this season in which a Cowboys opponent scored at least 30 points, and Dallas gave up 24 and 22 in the other two contests. The 184 points the Cowboys have allowed are the third most through the first six games in franchise history. Verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTION Once upon a time, the Cowboys were struggling on offense and traded a first-round pick for receiver Amari Cooper ahead of the trade deadline. That move worked out great. I'm not sure what the equivalent move is on defense this season, but if it's out there, the Cowboys need to find it -- and fast. play 0:22 Young finds Dowdle for 36-yard TD Bryce Young escapes the pocket and finds Rico Dowdle for a 36-yard touchdown to give the Panthers the lead. The offense is elite, even without top wideout CeeDee Lamb and with the O-line all banged up. Dak Prescott has 11 total touchdowns in his past three games, and the Cowboys are 1-2 in those matchups. That is the first time a quarterback has had that many touchdowns and a losing record over a three-game span since at least 1950. That speaks to a really big problem on the other side of the ball. Dallas has an extra first-round pick as a result of the Micah Parsons trade and should see what kind of Parsons replacement they might be able to get for it. The Jaguars' 4-1 start was just a mirage Jacksonville could not build on the momentum from its thrilling Monday night victory over the Chiefs , falling 20-12 at home to the Seahawks on Sunday. Trevor Lawrence and an offense that's clearly a work in progress in its first year under coach Liam Coen looked sleepy against a Seattle defense that was missing three starters in its secondary. The Jaguars' defense was OK -- it held the Seahawks to 1-for-12 on third down, making the Seattle the first team this season to win despite converting fewer than two third downs. But for the first time this season, the Jags didn't get a takeaway. And without that part of the game, they weren't able to keep Seattle off the scoreboard in the key moments. Jacksonville is now 4-2 and feeling a bit more disappointed headed into next week's game in London against the Rams . All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Verdict: OVERREACTION Nope, not buying it. There will be better days for the Jacksonville offense, which was done in by some penalties. Lawrence was able to make magic a couple of times on third and fourth down to keep drives alive. The offense, which was playing Sunday without starting center Robert Hainsey and starting tight end Brenton Strange , will continue to improve. And the defense has shown that it can be relied on to hold things down in the meantime. The Jaguars are a good team that lost to another good team Sunday. That happens. It doesn't mean their season is headed for the drain. If the Buccaneers get healthy, they're the best team in the NFL Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Already without injured star wide receivers Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin Jr . (fibula) and starting running back Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder), the Bucs lost rookie star Emeka Egbuka to a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against the 49ers . Baker Mayfield couldn't care less. He's just out here throwing long touchdown passes to random dudes named Johnson. These Bucs have been playing without starting right guard Cody Mauch ( out for the year ), starting right tackle Luke Goedeke (currently on injured reserve ) and starting defensive tackle Calijah Kancey ( out for the year ). Wide receiver Jalen McMillan , who came on strong as a rookie at the end of last season, hasn't played yet this season. Godwin has played one game. And the Bucs didn't have left tackle Tristan Wirfs to start the season and moved their center out there to replace him. That is not even a complete list of their injuries. But in spite of all of that, they took out the 49ers 30-19 and improved to 5-1 for the season. play 0:30 Tez Johnson celebrates 1st TD of season with backflip Tez Johnson hauls in Baker Mayfield's dart and celebrates his first touchdown of the season with a backflip. Verdict: NOT AN OVERREACTION The 49ers certainly aren't going to feel sorry for the Bucs, not with the injury issues they're dealing with right now. But you have to be impressed with the fact that Tampa Bay keeps finding ways to win. Mayfield is the clear MVP of the league through Week 6. Not all of the injured guys are coming back, but many are, and if the Bucs can get to something resembling full strength, they're going to be very tough to handle. This four-time defending division champion is determined to go further in the playoffs than it has during that span. Winning these games early with all that's going wrong sets the Buccaneers up for a high playoff seed and could put them on a path toward that goal. Quick-hitter fantasy overreactions Jaxon Smith-Njigba is a top-five fantasy receiver. NOT AN OVERREACTION . Seattle-Jacksonville was a game in which almost nobody looked good on offense. The Seahawks were playing a more conservative game plan than usual because of the Jaguars' takeaway proficiency. Still, Smith-Njigba had eight catches for 162 yards and a spectacular 61-yard touchdown catch. It's his fourth 100-yard game this season, and outside of Puka Nacua , it's hard to find a more reliable high-end contributor at receiver. Cam Skattebo is an RB1. NOT AN OVERREACTION . He's not getting three touchdowns every week, but you can't argue with the workload, especially on a short week . Tyrone Tracy Jr . being back and healthy didn't cut into Skattebo's production at all. Keep firing him up as long as he stays healthy. Vibes are high with the Giants right now. Your League, Your Rules Create a league and customize league size, scoring and rules to play in the league you want to play in. Create a league today! Kendrick Bourne is a starting WR in fantasy. OVERREACTION . Yeah, he has had exactly 142 receiving yards in each of his past two games, and he did it on half as many catches this week . But once receiver Ricky Pearsall and QB Brock Purdy are healthy , Bourne slides back down the depth chart. He's had fun catching a bunch of passes from his old New England pal Mac Jones these past couple of weeks, but he's there for depth and should fade back into the shadows once the Niners are back to full strength. You missed your chance to get Ladd McConkey at value. NOT AN OVERREACTION . Seven catches for 100 yards Sunday , his second game in a row with a touchdown catch. Quentin Johnston missed this game because of a hamstring injury, which helped, but don't be surprised if this keeps up even once Johnston is back. Justin Herbert got hit seven more times Sunday, and the Chargers' tackle injuries are causing pass protection problems. With less time to throw, McConkey will be an even more trusted outlet for Herbert moving forward. George Pickens is the best Cowboys receiver for fantasy. OVERREACTION . Pickens is awesome and has caught at least one touchdown in every game. And in that Dallas offense, he's going to be a fantasy starter even once CeeDee Lamb is back from injury . But we know what Lamb is for fantasy, and Pickens' target share will drop once Lamb is back. And Pickens' 17-touchdown pace isn't sustainable. His value might actually be an opportunity to sell high -- just make sure it's really high.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46573302/nfl-week-6-overreactions-surprises-fantasy-jets-patriots-cowboys-jaguars-buccaneers,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559338_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,d070fd0ed762f6c222185bec2208cacc000febf4
7ec20f8bcea7,"MLB playoffs 2025: ALCS, NLCS expert predictions",,"Oct 12, 2025, 07:00 AM ET The 2025 MLB playoffs are down to the final four teams after an action-packed division series round that saw the Milwaukee Brewers and Seattle Mariners move on in thrilling Game 5s. Now that the matchups are set -- Los Angeles Dodgers -Brewers and Mariners- Toronto Blue Jays -- it's time for some (more) predictions! We asked our MLB experts to weigh in on who will reach the World Series, which players will earn league championship series MVP honors and the themes that will rule the week to come. We also had our experts explain why their initial Fall Classic picks are still in play -- or where they went very wrong. LCS previews: Blue Jays-Mariners, Dodgers-Brewers | Bracket Jump to: ALCS | NLCS | Predictions we got right | ... and wrong ALCS Seattle Mariners (8 votes) In how many games: seven games (5 votes), six games (3) MVP if Mariners win: Cal Raleigh (4), Randy Arozarena (2), Josh Naylor (1), Julio Rodriguez (1) Who picked Seattle: Jorge Castillo, Alden Gonzalez, Paul Hembekides, Eric Karabell, Tim Keown, Kiley McDaniel, Jeff Passan, David Schoenfield Toronto Blue Jays (7 votes) In how many games: seven games (3 votes), six games (3), five games (1) MVP if Blue Jays win: Vladimir Guerrero Jr . (3), George Springer (1), Kevin Gausman (1), Daulton Varsho (1), Ernie Clement (1) Who picked Toronto: Tristan Cockcroft, Bradford Doolittle, Tim Kurkjian, Matt Marrone, Dan Mullen, Buster Olney, Jesse Rogers The one thing we'll all be talking about: How a perpetually tormented franchise is going to represent the American League in the World Series. The Mariners have played 49 seasons. They're the only team in MLB never to make the World Series. And to advance to the American League Championship Series in such dramatic fashion only supercharges the stakes for them. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, spend year after year in the AL East meat grinder, haven't been to the World Series since winning it in 1993 and returned much of the roster from a team that went 74-88 last year. They're a delightful team to watch, though, putting the ball in play, vacuuming balls on the defensive side like Pac-Man, running the bases with purpose and throwing tons of filthy splitters. Destiny calls one of these snakebit organizations. It's a fight decades in the making. -- Jeff Passan The stars in both lineups. On one side you have George Springer and Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who torched the Yankees in the American League Division Series. On the other, it's Julio Rodriguez and Cal Raleigh. Complementary players matter in October, but stars fuel deep October runs. -- Jorge Castillo There's so much to like about the Mariners -- the powerful lineup led by Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodriguez, good starting pitching and an effective closer, and they're good at home -- but they will start this series at such a disadvantage because of how their series played out against the Tigers. Whether Dan Wilson chooses an opener or goes with a starting pitcher on short rest or leans into Bryan Woo for his first appearance in a month, the dominoes from the ALDS Game 5 will affect the choices Seattle will have to make in this round. Meanwhile, the Jays will be relatively well-rested. -- Buster Olney It rarely comes down to one thing in baseball, but as I like the way the Blue Jays' hitters match up against the Seattle staff, I think we'll be harping on the importance of making contact as a standout trait for an offense in this era of strikeout hyper-inflation. This will especially be the case if the Blue Jays end up playing the Brewers in the World Series. Batting average is alive and well! -- Bradford Doolittle NLCS Los Angeles Dodgers (10 votes) In how many games: seven games (2 votes), six games (4), five games (3), four games (1) MVP if Dodgers win: Shohei Ohtani (6), Blake Snell (2), Teoscar Hernandez (1), Freddie Freeman (1) Who picked Los Angeles: Jorge Castillo, Alden Gonzalez, Paul Hembekides, Tim Kurkjian, Matt Marrone, Kiley McDaniel, Buster Olney, Jeff Passan, Jesse Rogers, David Schoenfield Milwaukee Brewers (5 votes) In how many games: seven games (3 votes), six games (2) MVP if Brewers win: Jackson Chourio (4), Andrew Vaughn (1) Who picked Milwaukee: Tristan Cockcroft, Bradford Doolittle, Eric Karabell, Tim Keown, Dan Mullen The one thing we'll all be talking about: How the Dodgers' rotation doesn't just have them on the brink of becoming the first repeat champion in a quarter century, but might make a case for the best a team has ever fielded this time of year. The foursome of Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto , Shohei Ohtani and Tyler Glasnow will continue to dominate. -- Alden Gonzalez How the big market Dodgers have tipped the economic scales in baseball will be the talk during the World Series, but for the LCS, the conversation will be about Shohei Ohtani. He's going to get hot. Hitting .148 in the postseason so far -- with 12 strikeouts to just three walks -- is an outlier. That will reverse itself very soon as his struggles this postseason come to an end starting on Monday. He's your NLCS MVP. -- Jesse Rogers One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » Can anyone stop the Dodgers? It's the same question that was asked last year. The answer was no. And now Los Angeles is coming off a series in which it beat a very game Philadelphia team while posting a .557 OPS and hitting two home runs, the fewest of any division series team. The prospect of the Dodgers' bats staying cold for an extended period of time is unlikely, regardless of what's thrown at them. After two rounds, the Dodgers have solved their closer issue -- Roki Sasaki is the guy -- but their lack of bullpen depth has been exacerbated. For a seven-game series, manager Dave Roberts needs to find at least one more reliever he can trust, or the Dodgers could find themselves in the sort of late-inning trouble that has yet to derail them. If that and the paltry offense couldn't do the job, perhaps nothing can. -- Passan The talk of the NLCS will be the same story as in the Dodgers' NLDS win over the Phillies: the starting pitching and their new closer. Blake Snell, Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow are peaking at the right time, the main reason -- along with Roki Sasaki -- why the Dodgers held the Phillies to a .212 average in their series (and under .200 if you ignore the Clayton Kershaw disastrous relief outing). Of course, the related talk, if they do dominate, is that this is the ultimate store-bought staff of high-end pitchers, with four free agents and Glasnow (acquired in a trade, signed to a big extension). Not a single homegrown starter. -- David Schoenfield World Series predictions we're right about -- so far I rarely go chalk when filling out a bracket, but this year I did exactly that by seed line -- picking both the Brewers and Blue Jays. Of course, those No. 1 seeds were also far less popular choices going into the postseason than the Yankees and Phillies, among others, but a second straight World Series between top seeds is still in play. -- Dan Mullen The Blue Jays easily handled the Yankees, especially at Rogers Centre. They're rightfully the slight Vegas favorite to win this series with home-field advantage. But I picked the Mariners to win the World Series before the regular season started and again before the postseason, so I'm sticking with them. -- Castillo How the Dodgers fixed Roki Sasaki After a disastrous MLB debut, L.A.'s new ninth-inning man has unleashed jaw-dropping stuff in October. Jeff Passan » The Dodgers were one bad Orion Kerkering decision away from potentially having to go back to Philadelphia and win a do-or-die game -- and now, they should be everyone's favorites. The Yankees just got beaten by a better team. -- Passan Well, obviously the Phillies found a way to ""Phillies"" again, so they won't be winning, but I had the Mariners representing the AL, and they have the pitching to hold the Blue Jays relatively in check. In the NL, it's Milwaukee's best chance in such a long time. It may be unconventional against the behemoth Dodgers, but the Brewers have the pitching and depth. We'll have a first-time WS champion, the Brewers. -- Eric Karabell World Series predictions gone wrong My World Series pick (Phillies-Yankees): If I had it to do all over again, I would have picked two teams that did not lose in the LDS. Thinking back to my late-September self, I'm sure I was entranced by the veteran presence and long ball power on both the Phillies and Yankees. It did not work out. -- Doolittle All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now I also predicted Yankees-Phillies, a 2009 World Series rematch that failed to materialize thanks to a scorching Blue Jays lineup and a dominant showing from the Dodgers' starting rotation. -- Paul Hembekides Before the playoffs, I predicted the Phillies would beat the Dodgers in the NLDS and go on to win the World Series. The home-field advantage wasn't what I thought it would be for Philly, though the starters and Jhoan Duran were as good as expected: 30.1 innings, 6 earned runs for a 1.78 ERA in the series. I'll shift my World Series winner prediction over to the Dodgers, as they were my second option from before the playoffs. -- Kiley McDaniel I had the Phillies winning the World Series, which says a lot about what it meant for the defending-champion Dodgers to get past them in the division series. They might have been the most talented in this field. -- Gonzalez Since my original pick, the Phillies, decided to play the Dodgers just as Roki Sasaki and Emmet Sheehan transformed the Dodgers' bullpen into a formidable unit, Los Angeles seems like the obvious pick here now -- and why not a West Coast World Series against the Mariners, with the shadows creeping from the mound to home plate in the late afternoon sun, and every game ending 2-1? -- Tim Keown",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46556337/mlb-playoffs-2025-alcs-nlcs-expert-predictions-dodgers-brewers-mariners-blue-jays,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1011%2Fmlb_lcs_preview_brewers_16x9.jpg,,f195f7ede687bf202215dd8bd4d03f575cae56ef
4be35eab7d12,MLB,,"Oct 11, 2025, 10:45 PM ET The 2025 League Championship Series matchups are set! Starting Sunday in Toronto, the No. 2 seed Seattle Mariners and No. 1 seed Toronto Blue Jays will clash with a trip to the World Series on the line. The next day, the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers and top-seeded Milwaukee Brewers will begin their series on the National League side of the bracket. Seattle outlasted the Detroit Tigers in a thrilling ALDS Game 5 on Friday night, two days after Toronto dispatched the AL East rival New York Yankees to get to the ALCS. Meanwhile, in the NL, Los Angeles rolled past the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee edged the division rival Chicago Cubs for the final NLCS spot. What has stood out about all four remaining teams so far? What does each need to do to punch a ticket to the Fall Classic? And who are the X factors on each roster? Our ESPN MLB experts break it all down. Note: Matchup odds come from Doolittle's formula using power ratings as the basis for 10,000 simulations to determine the most likely outcomes. Team temperatures are based on Bill James' formula for determining how ""hot"" or ""cold"" a team is at any given point; average is 72°. Jump to: Dodgers-Brewers | Mariners-Blue Jays Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Milwaukee Brewers AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill This is the Brewers' second showdown with the Dodgers in the NLCS, the first a seven-game loss to L.A. in 2018. Since Milwaukee started its run of contending seasons in 2017, only the Dodgers have won more regular-season games in the National League. The Brewers haven't been able to translate that tap-tap-tapping at the championship door into a World Series crown, and twice their season has been ended by the Dodgers behemoth. L.A. entered the season with all the hype, but the Brewers exited it with a No. 1 seed. Seems easy to say now that it has come to pass, but wasn't this always going to be how the Brewers got back to the World Series? -- Bradford Doolittle No. 1 seed Brewers' concern level: None. Why should the Brewers be worried? Forget the seeds, the records, the run differentials -- Milwaukee will enter this series perceived as a decided underdog. That's not based just on what we've thought the Dodgers would be since last winter, but because of how L.A. has rolled through the beginning of its latest postseason run. But you know who else is rolling? The Brewers. And they are too young, too athletic and having too much fun to be intimidated by the Dodgers' hype aura. Of more immediate concern, from a baseball perspective, is the fact that L.A. is awfully good. -- Doolittle Los Angeles Dodgers Odds of advancing: 48.2% Team temperature: 110° What stood out most as the Dodgers rolled past the Phillies in the NLDS? Jeff Passan: The team that the Dodgers were supposed to be has shown up in October. It's not just the talent, which itself can be overwhelming. It's that they are particularly comfortable in the sorts of games that would have others panicking through an expanded zone at the plate or too-fine nibbling on the mound. Philadelphia's starting pitching was excellent, and that still wasn't enough to stop the Dodgers. And considering L.A. has done it without significant contributions from Ohtani or Betts over the first two games**, and with a bullpen that beyond Roki Sasaki and Alex Vesia remains in flux, the prospect of the Dodgers getting better is very real -- and very scary. David Schoenfield: Their ability to eventually get to the starting pitcher. In Game 1, Cristopher Sanchez was cruising through 5⅔ innings, having allowed just four hits. Then with two outs in the sixth, Freddie Freeman worked a walk, Tommy Edman singled and Enrique Hernandez drove both in with a double. The Dodgers then later added three runs against the bullpen. Jesus Luzardo had been even more dominant in Game 2 with one hit allowed and 17 consecutive batters retired entering the seventh, when Teoscar Hernandez singled and Freeman doubled to chase Luzardo from the game. The bullpen entered and the Dodgers eventually scored four runs in the inning. Going back to last year's postseason, Freeman seems to be involved in so many of these rallies while both Hernandezes become tougher outs in the postseason. Why will (or won't) it work against the Brewers in the NLCS? Passan: The Brewers have a more balanced offense and a far better bullpen than the Phillies, and each is the sort of thing that could trip up Los Angeles. Now, admittedly, Milwaukee hasn't faced the caliber of pitching the Dodgers present, so their NL-best strikeout rate this postseason will climb. And the Dodgers hit high velocity about as well as any team in MLB, so the advantage there for the Brewers -- who are averaging more than 97 mph on their fastballs this postseason -- isn't quite as acute. The brand of baseball the Brewers play can work against Los Angeles. The execution simply needs to be immaculate. Schoenfield: There are two factors in play here. The Brewers' starting pitching isn't as good, so manager Pat Murphy will be much quicker to his bullpen even if the starter is pitching well. The Brewers' bullpen is much better and less likely to hemorrhage runs late like the Phillies did. So the ""score late"" philosophy is probably less likely of an outcome. Which puts pressure on the Dodgers' offense to put runs on the scoreboard early in the game. Which one player is the X factor who can make (or break) L.A.'s World Series hopes? Passan: If Ohtani continues to disappear -- he is in line to make two starts in the series and will continue to bat leadoff -- the Dodgers have enough talent to overcome it, but their margin of error shrinks significantly. He is the one player in baseball capable of single-handedly winning a series, and with his fastball sitting at career-best velocities even after his second reconstructive elbow surgery and his off-speed stuff still elite, he can control multiple games with his arm in addition to his power serving as an ever-present threat. How the Dodgers fixed Roki Sasaki After a disastrous MLB debut, L.A.'s new ninth-inning man has unleashed jaw-dropping stuff in October. Jeff Passan » Poor pitching performances, on the other hand, can lose games, and lack of getting on base by a leadoff hitter hampers the ability of Mookie Betts , Teoscar Hernández and Freddie Freeman to do damage. The difference between good Ohtani and bad Ohtani is profound enough to dictate the result of the series. Schoenfield: Emmet Sheehan . Dave Roberts has found a closer in Roki Sasaki, and Alex Vesia is the one lefty he seems to trust, but it seems unlikely the Dodgers can win a World Series with just two relief pitchers. Tanner Scott , the closer for most of the season, has been buried on the depth chart. Roberts went to Blake Treinen in Game 2, and he nearly blew the game. Sheehan now looks like the top right-handed setup guy. He's going to pitch some important innings. The regular-season numbers, mostly as a starter, say he can do the job: a .185 batting average allowed and 89 strikeouts in 73⅓ innings. Milwaukee Brewers Odds of advancing: 51.8% Team temperature: 74° What stood out most as the Brewers beat the Cubs in the NLDS? Jesse Rogers: The Brewers came out with their hair on fire in the division series, not letting getting down early in Games 1 and 2 -- after a week layoff -- didn't faze them. Most interesting was their power surge in the series. Solo shots and three run homers were all the rage for the Brew Crew. Add the fact that Milwaukee deployed one arm after another throwing around 100 mph -- starting with righty Jacob Misiorowski -- and the Chicago Cubs were overwhelmed in the strike zone, both at the plate and on the mound. How the Brewers built a $115 million power As small-market Milwaukee rolls along with MLB's best record, everyone wants to know the Brew Crew's secret formula. Jesse Rogers » Schoenfield: Scoring nine runs in the first game without hitting a home run and then scoring seven runs in Game 2 all via the home run was impressive, but no doubt it's those power arms in the bullpen that offered a huge exclamation point. Misiorowski threw an incredible 31 pitches over 100 mph in his three-inning stint in Game 2, including two at 104.3 and 104.2 mph. Trevor Megill is back after missing more than a month and hit 98. Jared Koenig hit 99.8. Abner Uribe throws a 99-mph sinker with a wipeout slider. Good luck. Why will (or won't) it work against the Dodgers in the NLCS? Rogers: Umm, hitting home runs and throwing 100 mph? That works against anyone. Of course, there's a good chance the Brewers won't hit as many long balls but that's when they'll rely on the other parts of their game: contact, speed and defense. And if confidence matters at all, Milwaukee swept the season series against L.A, providing further hope in the NLCS. If somehow they can continue to go deep, watch out, an upset might be, ahem, Brewing. Schoenfield: Bullpens can get hot in the playoffs, and it looks like the Milwaukee bullpen is hot. It's worth noting that the Dodgers had the third-highest OPS in the majors during the regular season against pitches of 97-plus mph, hitting .255/.330/.429. So the Dodgers can do some damage against premium velocity. Of course, 104 is a different beast. Still, it feels like the Dodgers will have to score some runs early in the game to win this series. Which one player is the X factor who can make (or break) Milwaukee's World Series hopes? Rogers: Jacob Misiorowski. It's clear he's going to have an important role no matter how the Brewers elect to use him. If he can control his emotions, as well as his stuff, Misiorowski could be the bridge to the late innings in several potential Brewers wins. Or perhaps they let him start a game. Dodgers hitters are 4-for-17 with eight strikeouts this season against the rookie. More of that -- along with fastballs at 103 mph or more -- could help Milwaukee through a tough L.A. lineup. Schoenfield: Jackson Chourio . There was a scare in Game 1 when Chourio left the game after tweaking his hamstring (after going 3-for-3) but he returned in Game 2 and had two more hits, including a big three-run home run in the fourth inning. Still just 21, Chourio is already showing a propensity to shine in the October spotlight. In his first five career playoff games, he had multiple hits in four of them (including a two-homer game last year against the Mets). We'll see if the Dodgers can exploit his tendency to chase out of the zone but if he keeps producing, the Brewers will score some runs. Dan Hamilton/Imagn Images At last! Super-fans of 1977 expansion have been waiting for this LCS matchup since the early days of the Carter administration. The Blue Jays and Mariners came into existence at the same time, but they have never met with stakes like these in play. The M's beat the Jays in a wild-card round matchup in 2022, but this is different. The two strongest division champs in the AL are vying to end long World Series droughts.

Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The great Willie Horton was among the first players to play for both franchises. Even though he's best remembered as a Tiger and has a statue outside of Comerica Park, they should still let him throw out the first pitch in Seattle and Toronto. -- Doolittle No. 1 seed Blue Jays' concern level: Appropriately alert. Toronto has the better seed and home-field edge, but Seattle has been playing slightly better in the latter stages of the season, and the run differentials are virtually the same. What's really exciting is the star power on both teams and that the standouts have been shining in October. Julio Rodriguez , Cal Raleigh and the scorching Vladimir Guerrero Jr . have played huge roles in the teams getting this far. Both teams have leaned on the long ball for scoring, getting more than half their runs on homers. It's a really close matchup that could be decided by Andres Munoz , Seattle's edge at the back of the bullpen. -- Doolittle Toronto Blue Jays Odds of advancing: 55.1% Team temperature: 96° What stood out most as the Blue Jays rolled past the Yankees in the ALDS? Jorge Castillo: The relentlessness of their lineup. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. starred from start to finish, but Toronto received contributions from seemingly everyone manager John Schneider put in there. Four players not named Guerrero recorded two hits in Game 1. Daulton Varsho had four extra-base hits, and Ernie Clement went 3-for-4 in Game 2. Clement added another four hits in Game 3. The Blue Jays were the toughest team to strike out during the regular season, and they registered more home runs than strikeouts in the first two games at Rogers Centre, where they've thrived all season. It helped that Playoff Vladdy Jr. surfaced, going 9-for-17 with three home runs, including a monumental grand slam in Game 2. The return of George Springer The Blue Jays' playoff run features the AL's top seed -- and a modern Mr. October on their side. Jeff Passan » Schoenfield: Have to go with Trey Yesavage 's absolutely dominant performance in Game 2, when he made his fourth career start and held the Yankees hitless for 5⅓ innings while striking out 11. The Yankees had no chance against him. Other than the length of the start -- the Blue Jays pulled him with a big lead -- it was as dominant a postseason outing as we've seen in a long time. His over-the-top delivery creates an unusual look for batters, and he's throwing 95-96 mph with a slider and wipeout splitter. Hard to believe there were 19 players selected ahead of him in the draft in 2024. Why will (or won't) it work against the Mariners in the ALCS? Castillo: It'll work at Rogers Centre because it has always worked at Rogers Centre this season. The Blue Jays scored 431 runs at home during the regular season, the third most in the majors. In the ALDS, they scored 23 in two games in Toronto. The Blue Jays dominate pitchers north of the border. The question is whether it'll work in Seattle. T-Mobile Park is a difficult place to hit. Mariners pitchers posted a 3.28 ERA at home this season. But the Blue Jays scored 21 runs in a three-game sweep of the Mariners in May. Maybe their offense will travel. Schoenfield: It will ... if he throws strikes. He did against the Yankees, walking just one batter in his start, but in the minors, he walked 41 batters in 98 innings. The Mariners have a mix of patient hitters (Cal Raleigh, Randy Arozarena ) and hitters who chase (Julio Rodriguez, Eugenio Suarez ), but like the Yankees, the Mariners also whiff a lot. Which one player is the X factor who can make (or break) Toronto's World Series hopes? Castillo: Trey Yesavage. Asking a rookie with four major league starts to continue dominating deep into October is a lot, but the Blue Jays lack that clear premier ace. Yesavage has the potential to supply it. Not only is his stuff good enough, he's different enough to flummox even the most experienced hitters. His release point and arm angle are among the highest in baseball, making his fastball-splitter combination especially difficult to solve. Then, there's his slider, which often runs arm side instead of the usual glove side. Toronto has been careful with the 22-year-old right-hander. He hasn't thrown more than 94 pitches in a game this season, which started for him in Low-A. Now, he's on the sport's grandest stage and could be the difference in October. Schoenfield: Shane Bieber . Kevin Gausman and Yesavage looked great, but given a 6-1 lead in Game 3, Bieber got knocked out in the third inning. Given how poorly Toronto's bullpen pitched after that, maybe it was a bit of a quick hook, but it's clear the Blue Jays will need all three of these starters to pitch well, given the bullpen didn't post a bunch of zeroes against the Yankees. The Blue Jays' ability to put the ball in play -- they had the lowest strikeout rate in the majors -- means they should continue to score some runs, so the question is whether they can keep enough runs off the scoreboard. Seattle Mariners Odds of advancing: 44.9% Team temperature: 89° What stood out most as the Mariners beat the Tigers in the ALDS? Alden Gonzalez : The effectiveness of the starting rotation, which should come as no surprise. George Kirby , Luis Castillo , Logan Gilbert and Bryce Miller -- before the fifth inning, at least -- all pitched well in the ALDS. The hope is that Bryan Woo, the Mariners' best starter this season, will return from a pectoral injury for the ALCS, taking this rotation to yet another level. The Big Dumper ... and some magic? Seattle has never won a World Series. Or even an American League pennant. Could a little bit of alchemy change that? Alden Gonzalez » The Mariners feel really good about their back-end relievers and believe this is the deepest lineup they've fielded in this era. But this team still revolves around its starting pitching -- a unit that dominated throughout 2024 and finally started to round into form again in the stretch run of this season. The starters need to consistently provide six and seven innings so that manager Dan Wilson doesn't have to venture outside of Gabe Speier , Matt Brash and Andres Munoz late in games. That's the formula. Doolittle: Seattle's lineup depth is really impressive, even without a standout designated hitter. It's eye-popping to see Eugenio Suarez hitting in the six-hole and J.P. Crawford at No. 9. It's a group that hits for power, steals bases and strikes out at a much less problematic rate than the Mariners lineups we're used to. Raleigh and Rodriguez make for such a dynamic one-two stack in the batting order. The R&R Boys. Why will (or won't) it work against the Blue Jays in the ALCS? Gonzalez : No team struck out less often than the Blue Jays this season. Only the Yankees and Dodgers finished with a higher OPS. And when the playoffs arrived, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Ernie Clement and Daulton Varsho slugged a combined 1.000 in four ALDS games. This offense operates at a different level than the Tigers' -- and could have Bo Bichette back for this next round. One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » Gilbert and Woo pitched pretty well against the Blue Jays this season (five earned runs in 11 2/3 innings). Castillo and Miller (15 earned runs in 15 innings) did not. But these two teams have not seen each other since May. The Mariners' rotation is not the same as it was then. Doolittle: A deep lineup plays against anybody, but there's one factor that works in Seattle's favor. With Trey Yesavage emerging for Toronto, the Blue Jays have four key hurlers who can dominate with splitters, the breakout pitch of the 2025 postseason. (Yesavage, Kevin Gausman, Seranthony Dominguez and Jeff Hoffman are the four.) The Mariners were in the middle of the pack in hitting splitters during the season, but they had two hitters who crushed them. And it's the R&R Boys -- Raleigh had 1.159 OPS against splitters and Rodriguez 1.091. Which one player is the X factor who can make (or break) Seattle's World Series hopes? Gonzalez : Randy Arozarena. The Mariners inserted Arozarena at the top of the lineup after they acquired Eugenio Suarez and Josh Naylor at the trade deadline, and Arozarena has struggled mightily ever since. He showed some flashes in the ALDS, but the Mariners need ""Playoff Randy"" -- the one who took over during the 2020 postseason and became a sensation while playing for Team Mexico in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. If he gets going ahead of Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodriguez, the Mariners' offense will be scary. Doolittle: Matt Brash. Well, that's not fair, as Brash is good, and I picked his name as an avatar for Seattle's middle relief crew. If the Mariners' roster has a soft underbelly, it's the non-closing part of the bullpen. It's not a bad group, but with a deep, productive lineup and a star closer in Munoz, plus excellent starting pitching, it might well be Brash, Eduard Bazardo , Gabe Speier and Carlos Vargas who determine if the Mariners can finally play in a World Series.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46532595/mlb-playoffs-2025-first-look-preview-alcs-nlcs-reach-world-series,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1008%2Fr1557597_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,38deadcf1f509660ae1a5c9e44dfe68c368312c6

""This showed the country we're a real team,"" Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza told reporters after the Hoosiers' 30-20 win at Oregon. ""We're not just a one-hit wonder."" Separation has started to occur, true playoff contenders have begun to emerge through statement wins, and the battle for No. 1 is ongoing. Alabama has made a case for the selection committee's top one-loss team, and Notre Dame has battled back after an 0-2 start to position itself as the top two-loss team. The jockeying for top seeds, first-round byes and first-round home games continues, but Week 7's top 12 prediction is a snapshot of who's got the early edge if the ranking were released halfway through the season. Jump to: Ranking | Bracket Projecting the top 12 Ohio State first-year starting QB Julian Sayin has thrown 15 touchdowns and just three interceptions this season. Michael Hickey/Getty Images Why they could be here: The Buckeyes now have two impressive road wins, adding Saturday's 34-16 victory at Illinois to the Sept. 27 win at Washington. The Buckeyes have defeated three straight Big Ten opponents who are all at .500 or better, including two on the road. Miami has one road win and hasn't left its home state yet. Ohio State's defense has been one of the best in the country, and quarterback Julian Sayin has been one of the nation's most efficient, mistake-free quarterbacks. The Buckeyes are a complete team, ranked in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency -- a historic trait of the selection committee's past playoff teams. The 70-0 win against FCS Grambling, though, impacts some of that. Ohio State's nonconference win against Texas will continue to be valuable within the committee meeting room, as the Longhorns' win against rival Oklahoma bolsters their chance to be a CFP top 25 team. Why they could be lower: Indiana just earned the best win in the country, and Miami still has one of the best overall résumés. The Canes were on a bye week but got another boost Friday night when South Florida hammered previously undefeated North Texas 63-36. Some committee members would argue that Miami's win against Notre Dame is better than Ohio State's win against Texas. Need to know: Ohio State has more than a 50% chance to win each of its remaining games, according to ESPN Analytics. Toughest remaining game: Nov. 29 at Michigan. The Buckeyes are trying to avoid a fifth straight loss to their rivals. Why they could be here: The selection committee typically doesn't move teams around if they don't play, unless it happens as a result of shuffling around them. Ohio State's win at Illinois strengthened its résumé, and the Buckeyes were also helped by Texas beating Oklahoma. It didn't help the Canes that Florida State picked up its third loss, this one to an unranked Pitt team. Miami's overall body of work, though, is still worthy of consideration for the top spot. South Florida's 63-36 lopsided win Friday night against previously undefeated North Texas further enhanced the Canes' 49-12 drubbing of the Bulls on Sept. 13. What's really separating Miami from Ohio State, though, is the season-opening win against Notre Dame, which has played its way back into the top 25 after winning four straight. Why they could be higher: Miami has a case to be ranked No. 1 with wins against Notre Dame, South Florida, Florida State and Florida. The win against the Irish continues to look good after Notre Dame pulled away for a convincing win against NC State on Saturday. Entering Week 7, Miami was No. 2 in ESPN's Strength of Record metric, with a slight edge over Ohio State. Need to know: Entering Saturday, no team in the country had a better chance to win out than Miami (32.1%), according to ESPN Analytics. Miami is projected to win each of its remaining games -- and none of them are likely to feature a top 25 opponent. Toughest remaining game: Nov. 1 at SMU. This will be the first time Miami leaves its home state, and it's not an easy trip. It's also the last chance to make a first impression on the CFP selection committee, which will release its first of six rankings the Tuesday after this game. Omar Cooper's one-handed catch was part of an impressive Indiana win at Oregon. Troy Wayrynen/Imagn Images Why they could be here: The Hoosiers just earned the best win in the country, beating Oregon on its home turf, where the Ducks had won 18 straight games. Indiana's defense looked legit, and the Hoosiers have a Heisman hopeful quarterback in Mendoza. IU has now reeled off three straight wins against Big Ten opponents, including back-to-back road wins against Iowa and Oregon. The selection committee would likely hold the Hoosiers back from a higher spot right now, though, because half of their wins came against Old Dominion, Kennesaw State and FCS Indiana State. Why they could be higher: The selection committee compares common opponents, and while the Hoosiers don't play Ohio State during the regular season, they both played Illinois. Indiana hammered the Fighting Illini 63-10, handing coach Bret Bielema the worst loss of his career. Ohio State won with relative ease Saturday, beating Illinois 34-16, but it wasn't the kind of jaw-dropping beatdown the Hoosiers executed. Need to know: Indiana's head-to-head win against Oregon impacts both the Big Ten standings and the CFP seeding process. If IU's only loss were to Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, the Hoosiers could still finish in the top four and earn a first-round bye because those top four seeds are no longer reserved for conference champions. This was the only game on Indiana's schedule the Hoosiers weren't favored to win. Toughest remaining game: Geez. Nov. 1 at Maryland is suddenly the biggest looming obstacle. The Terps are a respectable 4-2 and have lost their past two games by a combined seven points. The Nov. 8 trip to Penn State is a shadow of the test it once appeared to be after the Nittany Lions have lost three straight, reaching a new low with Saturday's loss to Northwestern. Why they could be here: The Aggies eventually pulled away from a stingy Florida defense to remain undefeated and with a lead in the SEC race. The Aggies and Ole Miss are the only undefeated teams remaining in their conference, but Texas A&M entered Saturday ranked No. 1 in ESPN's Strength of Record metric -- ahead of both Miami and Ohio State. The Week 3 win at Notre Dame continues to elevate the Aggies' résumé, but it's the only road win so far. Why they could be lower: Some selection committee members could give Alabama more credit for three straight wins against ranked opponents, including two on the road. Texas A&M has only one win against a ranked opponent, and wins against UTSA and Utah State don't help much. Need to know: The Aggies are about to enter their season-defining stretch of three straight road games (Arkansas, LSU and Missouri). If Texas A&M loses a game, it will also likely lose the debate with one-loss Alabama if it hasn't already. Toughest remaining game: Nov. 28 at Texas. The Longhorns might have had a turning point Saturday in their win against rival Oklahoma. If Texas can continue to improve offensively, it could be one of the most complete teams the Aggies face in the second half of the season. Alabama QB Ty Simpson has thrown 16 touchdowns and just one interception this season. Reese Strickland/Imagn Images Why they could be here: The Tide earned a second road win against a previously undefeated team, this time escaping Missouri to remain undefeated in the SEC. Alabama has now won five straight games since its season-opening loss at Florida State, including three straight against ranked and previously undefeated SEC teams. That résumé combined with the evident growth of quarterback Ty Simpson gives the Tide the strongest case to be the committee's highest-ranked one-loss team. Heading into Saturday, the only other one-loss team that came close to the Tide in ESPN's Strength of Record metric was Illinois, and the Fighting Illini lost to Ohio State in Week 7. Why they could be lower: Ole Miss wasn't pretty Saturday against Washington State, but the Rebels are still undefeated and Bama's not. Plus, Alabama's loss is now to a three-loss Florida State after the Noles lost to Pitt. Need to know: The selection committee considers injuries to key players, and Alabama had a few scares Saturday. Receiver Derek Meadows appeared to be knocked unconscious in the first quarter, and coach Kalen DeBoer later said Meadows suffered a concussion. Running back Jam Miller , who had 136 yards in the Tide's win against Vandy, also suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter. Toughest remaining game: Nov. 29 at Auburn. The Tigers gave Georgia fits Saturday night and controlled the first half. They'll have home-field advantage in the Iron Bowl, where anything can happen. Why they could be here: The Rebels were underwhelming after a bye week and fortunate to beat Washington State at home 24-21. The committee pays attention to how teams win, and the Rebels trailed 14-10 late in the third quarter. Still, Ole Miss has wins against Tulane, which is in the running for the Group of 5 playoff spot, and the committee will continue to reward the Sept. 27 home win against LSU. The Rebels also have a budding star in quarterback Trinidad Chambliss , who accounted for three total touchdowns against the Cougars on Saturday. Why they could be lower: Georgia State, Kentucky and Arkansas are a combined 5-12 and unranked, and the win against the Wildcats is the Rebels' lone road win. Need to know: Ole Miss has back-to-back road trips to Georgia and Oklahoma looming, what's likely to be its last games against ranked opponents. If the Rebels were to lose both, the rest of their schedule could raise concerns with some committee meeting members. Ole Miss needs to find a statement road win this month to help avoid that debate. Toughest remaining game: Oct. 18 at Georgia. The Bulldogs found a way to beat a gritty Auburn team on the road and are looking better than the Sooners right now. Why they could be here: The Bulldogs were outplayed by Auburn in the first half but found a way to win on the road against a decent team that had a bye week to prepare. Georgia remains one of the country's top one-loss teams but will be stuck behind Alabama in the committee meeting room because of the head-to-head tiebreaker as long as their records are comparable. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Why they could be lower: Georgia's best win is against a Tennessee team that hasn't exactly wowed anyone yet, and the Bulldogs needed overtime to do it. Texas Tech is still undefeated, and some committee members could reward it for that ahead of both Georgia and Oregon. Need to know: Georgia's two best remaining chances to impress the selection committee will be Saturday against Ole Miss and in the regular-season finale against Georgia Tech. If Georgia beats the Jackets, it's still possible they could have a win against the eventual ACC champs. Toughest remaining game: Oct. 18 vs. Ole Miss. If the Rebels play like they did in their win against LSU -- a complete game -- they'll give Georgia trouble. Why they could be here: The Ducks faced their toughest opponent to date and lost at home to Indiana, a significant setback in the Big Ten race but hardly a dagger in their CFP hopes. The bigger problem is the lack of a true statement win, as the Sept. 27 double overtime win at Penn State has been significantly devalued following the three-loss Nittany Lions' unraveling. A win against FCS Montana State isn't going to impress the committee, nor will a win against an Oklahoma State team that fired its head coach. Oregon's best win so far is at 4-2 Northwestern, which also beat Penn State. Indiana's defense also gave Oregon its biggest challenge of the season, holding the Ducks to a season-low 20 points. Why they could be lower: Oregon didn't exactly pass the eye test against better competition, as quarterback Dante Moore threw two interceptions and was sacked six times. Oregon has three pick-sixes this season, its most in a season since 2018. Oregon was just 3-of-14 on third downs and was held to 81 rushing yards. Need to know: That might have been Oregon's last chance during the regular season to impress the selection committee with a win against a ranked opponent. If the Ducks run the table and finish as a one-loss team -- which they should barring an upset -- that could come back to haunt them on Selection Day. Another one-loss team like Alabama that has multiple wins against CFP top 25 teams will get the edge in a debate. That doesn't mean their playoff hopes are in any danger, but it could mean the difference between hosting a first-round home game and traveling. Toughest remaining game: Nov. 29 at Washington. The Ducks also have a tricky matchup Nov. 22 against USC but will have home-field advantage. Ending the season on the road against a respectable Washington team after a tough game against the Trojans is more difficult than it appears. Texas Tech's Johncarlos Miller II celebrates a 2-point conversion score during the win over Kansas. Michael C. Johnson/Imagn Images Why they could be here: The Red Raiders have gained traction and legitimized their place in the playoff with three straight convincing wins against Big 12 opponents with winning records. Entering Week 7, Texas Tech was ranked No. 8 in ESPN's Strength of Record metric, which gave the average top 25 opponent a 44.1% chance to achieve the same undefeated record against the same opponents. The Red Raiders have the best chance to reach the Big 12 title game and win it, which would guarantee them a spot in the field. Why they could be lower: Texas Tech's weak nonconference schedule includes a win against FCS Arkansas-Pine Bluff (2-3), Kent State (2-4) and Oregon State (0-7). Their best win is Sept. 20 at Utah, which isn't as impressive as most of the other contenders' statement wins. Need to know: Backup quarterback storylines have been integral to the CFP selection process -- for better or for worse, depending on the situation -- and the Red Raiders have proved on multiple occasions now that they can win without injured starter Behren Morton . He was hurt again Saturday and left the game against Kansas, but the Big 12's third-leading passer also had to leave against Arkansas-Pine Bluff and Utah with injuries. The committee will appreciate the fact that Texas Tech has a No. 2 capable of winning in Will Hammond . Toughest remaining game: Nov. 8 vs. BYU. The Cougars and Red Raiders could face each other in the Big 12 championship game, but they have to face each other during the regular season first. Why they could be here: Even the speedy return of injured quarterback John Mateer wasn't enough to overcome a stingy Texas defense Saturday, as the Sooners were held to just six points. Oklahoma's Week 2 win against Michigan is still one of the better nonconference wins in the country, though, and helps separate the Sooners from some other teams with weaker nonconference lineups. The selection committee also respects wins against opponents with .500 records or better, and the Sept. 20 win against Auburn would still be favorable in the committee meeting room. Why they could be lower: Texas was the best defense OU has faced so far, and it exposed some weaknesses teams like Illinois State, Temple and Kent State couldn't. Mateer threw three interceptions and completed 20 of 38 pass attempts just 17 days after surgery on his right hand. Need to know: Oklahoma entered Saturday with the most difficult remaining schedule in the FBS, according to ESPN Analytics. The Sooners travel to South Carolina on Saturday before ending the season against what should be five straight ranked opponents. Toughest remaining game: Nov. 15 at Alabama. The Tide have won five straight and will have a bye week and home-field advantage. Patrick Payton (6) and the LSU defense celebrate a turnover against South Carolina. Michael DeMocker/Getty Images Why they could be here: The Tigers' lone loss is to an undefeated Ole Miss on the road, and LSU's defense continues to be one of the best in the country. LSU held off a pesky South Carolina team Saturday, limiting the Gamecocks to just one touchdown. Why they could be lower: Wins against Clemson and Florida aren't going to separate LSU from other one-loss teams, and the Tigers have struggled to consistently play complete football in all three phases. Quarterback Garrett Nussmeier threw two interceptions against South Carolina, and the Tigers also lost a fumble. LSU is still searching for a statement win. Need to know: One of the statistics the selection committee has historically leaned on is called ""relative scoring defense,"" which is something it would probably look at with LSU. How are the Tigers doing defensively against teams that typically score more than they allow? Those tests are yet to come, but the 24-19 loss to Ole Miss likely didn't help that particular metric. If LSU is going to lean on its elite defense, it has to show up against the best offenses. Toughest remaining game: Nov. 8 at Alabama. It's not just that it's Bama -- it's the third straight game against a ranked opponent, as LSU faces Vandy and Texas A&M before the Tide. If LSU loses to one of them, it will be under tremendous pressure to win in Tuscaloosa. Why they could be here: The Vols were fortunate to beat a 2-4 Arkansas team at home -- one week after they escaped Mississippi State with an overtime win. It hasn't been pretty, and Tennessee is still searching for a statement win. They've got an FCS win, a lopsided win against UAB and a decent nonconference win against a 3-3 Syracuse team that was more formidable with its starting quarterback in the lineup at the time they played them. That's a detail the selection committee would consider. Why they could be lower: Tennessee hasn't looked like an elite team, struggling to stop the run and racking up penalties. The Vols were tied at 17 at the half with a team that recently fired its head coach. The committee has overlooked a lack of statement wins before, but typically that forgiveness happens when a contender is controlling games -- not squeaking by unranked teams. Need to know: If the playoff were today, the Vols would be bumped out to make room for the fifth-highest ranked conference champion, which is guaranteed a spot in the 12-team field. Right now that team -- the American champion -- would be ranked outside the top 12. Toughest remaining game: Saturday at Alabama. Tennessee's lone loss was in overtime to Georgia, which also lost to Alabama. Bracket Based on the rankings above, the seeding would be: First-round byes No. 1 Ohio State (Big Ten champ) No. 2 Miami (ACC champ) No. 3 Indiana No. 4 Texas A&M (SEC champ) First-round games On campus, Dec. 19 and 20 No. 12 South Florida (American champ) at No. 5 Alabama No. 11 LSU at No. 6 Ole Miss No. 10 Oklahoma at No. 7 Georgia No. 9 Texas Tech (Big 12 champ) at No. 8 Oregon Quarterfinal games At the Goodyear Cotton Bowl, Capital One Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl Presented by Prudential and Allstate Sugar Bowl on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.

49533d1622d7,NCAAF,,"Kyle Bonagura Close Kyle Bonagura ESPN Staff Writer Covers college football. Joined ESPN in 2014. Attended Washington State University. Mark Schlabach Close Mark Schlabach ESPN Senior Writer Senior college football writer Author of seven books on college football Graduate of the University of Georgia Oct 12, 2025, 12:45 PM ET The biggest results from Week 7 were Indiana's impressive road win at Oregon and Texas' sound victory over Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl, but there were other games that impacted the postseason picture. Texas A&M continued its strong start by routing Florida, Texas Tech wiped out Kansas to keep its hold on the Big 12, Georgia Tech remained unbeaten and SEC contenders Alabama, Ole Miss, LSU and Georgia all came away with wins. As with last season's inaugural 12-team CFP, the five highest-ranked conference champions, plus the next seven highest-ranked teams, will make the field. Unlike last year, the four highest-ranked teams (not necessarily conference champions) will be awarded first-round byes. The other eight teams will meet in first-round games at the campus sites of seeds Nos. 5 through 8. From there, the quarterfinals and semifinals will be played in what had been the New Year's Six bowls, with this season's national championship game scheduled for Jan. 19 at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. All of that is just the tip of the iceberg, though. Apart from the playoff is the 35-game slate of bowl games, beginning with the Cricket Celebration Bowl on Dec. 13. We're here for all of it. ESPN bowl gurus Kyle Bonagura and Mark Schlabach are projecting every postseason matchup, including their breakdowns of how the playoff will play out, and we'll be back every week of the season until the actual matchups are set. Jump to a section: Playoff picks | Quarterfinals Semis, title game | Bowl season College Football Playoff First-round games (at campus sites) Friday, Dec. 19/ Saturday, Dec. 20 Times and networks TBD. Bonagura: No. 12 Memphis at No. 5 Texas Tech Schlabach: No. 12 South Florida at No. 5 Ole Miss Bonagura: No. 11 LSU at No. 6 Ole Miss Schlabach: No. 11 LSU at No. 6 Texas Tech Bonagura: No. 10 Georgia at No. 7 Alabama Schlabach: No. 10 Georgia Tech at No. 7 Alabama Bonagura: No. 9 Georgia Tech at No. 8 Oregon Schlabach: No. 9 Oregon at No. 8 Georgia First-round breakdown Bonagura: These things have a way of being settled with time, but there is a strong case for the SEC to send five teams to the playoff, and who those five teams should be is still up for debate. For now, I settled on Texas A&M (bye), Ole Miss, Alabama, Georgia and LSU, but there are nine teams in the conference with zero or one loss, plus two-loss teams in Texas and Mississippi State. What this means is there will likely be some SEC vs. SEC first-round games. In this case, they are 10. Georgia at No. 7 Alabama and No. 11 LSU at No. 6 Ole Miss. Georgia Tech is a new inclusion on my playoff pairings this week with the Yellow Jackets 6-0 at the midway point of the season. Tyler Onyedim and Texas A&M continue to impress, posting a decisive win over Florida on Saturday night. Maria Lysaker/Imagn Images Schlabach: I've got two new teams in my top four after Indiana's stunning 30-20 upset of Oregon on the road. The Hoosiers are a legitimate CFP title contender, regardless of their nonconference schedule, and coach Curt Cignetti is going to be one of the hottest names in the coaching market this offseason. I also moved Texas A&M up one spot after its 34-17 win against Florida at home. Ole Miss fell to No. 5 after a closer-than-expected 24-21 victory against Washington State at home. The Rebels might have been looking ahead to this week's SEC road trip to Georgia. Georgia Tech is also in my bracket for the first time this season after its 35-20 win against Virginia Tech, which moved the Yellow Jackets to 6-0 for the first time since 2011. I love the physical football team Brent Key has built on the Flats, and Georgia Tech faces a tricky road trip to Duke this week. Oklahoma fell out of my bracket following its 23-6 loss to Texas in the Allstate Red River Rivalry in Dallas. I also considered USC, Tennessee and BYU for the final at-large spot. South Florida continues to be impressive -- the Bulls overcame some early turnovers to rout North Texas 63-36 on the road Friday night -- to keep the fifth conference champion spot. I also considered Memphis. CFP quarterfinals Wednesday, Dec. 31 CFP quarterfinal at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas) 7:30 p.m., ESPN Bonagura: No. 7 Alabama vs. No. 2 Indiana Schlabach: No. 6 Texas Tech vs. No. 3 Indiana Thursday, Jan. 1 CFP quarterfinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl Hard Rock Stadium (Miami Gardens, Florida) Noon, ESPN Bonagura: No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 3 Miami Schlabach: No. 7 Alabama vs. No. 2 Miami CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Prudential Rose Bowl (Pasadena, California) 4 p.m., ESPN Bonagura: No. 8 Oregon vs. No. 1 Ohio State Schlabach: No. 8 Georgia vs. No. 1 Ohio State CFP quarterfinal at the Allstate Sugar Bowl Caesars Superdome (New Orleans) 8 p.m., ESPN Bonagura: No. 5 Texas Tech vs. No. 4 Texas A&M Schlabach: No. 5 Ole Miss vs. No. 4 Texas A&M Quarterfinals breakdown Bonagura: Texas Tech continues to look like the class of the Big 12 and a possible meeting with Texas A&M in the quarterfinals would be one of several interesting games in the quarterfinals. Another Oregon vs. Ohio State playoff game would give the Ducks a chance to avenge last year's exit at the hands of Buckeyes. Indiana and Miami are jockeying for the No. 2 seed. Schlabach: I have the favorites advancing out of the first-round games, although the potential Georgia-Oregon game in Athens, Georgia, would be a tightly contested one with Kirby Smart facing his former defensive coordinator, Dan Lanning. The Bulldogs have some obvious flaws in the offensive and defensive lines, but they keep finding ways to win on the road. I'm not sure they would be able to handle Ohio State's menacing defense in the Rose Bowl. Texas Tech continues to play like the class of the Big 12, and Alabama has regrouped nicely after losing at Florida State in its opener. The potential Orange Bowl would feature two of the best quarterbacks in the FBS: Miami's Carson Beck and Alabama's Ty Simpson . CFP semifinals, national championship game Thursday, Jan. 8 CFP semifinal at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl State Farm Stadium (Glendale, Arizona) 7:30 p.m., ESPN Bonagura: No. 4 Texas A&M vs. No. 1 Ohio State Schlabach: No. 3 Indiana vs. No. 2 Miami Friday, Jan. 9 CFP semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta) 7:30 p.m., ESPN Bonagura: No. 3 Miami vs. No. 2 Indiana Schlabach: No. 4 Texas A&M vs. No. 1 Ohio State Monday, Jan. 19 CFP national championship Hard Rock Stadium (Miami Gardens, Florida) 7:45 p.m., ESPN Bonagura: No. 2 Indiana vs. No. 1 Ohio State Schlabach: No. 2 Miami vs. No. 1 Ohio State National championship breakdown Bonagura: After Indiana went to Autzen and beat Oregon, the Hoosiers can claim the best win in college football this season. But that was also the case for Oregon after it won at Penn State -- and it only took a week for that result to be framed much differently. It's hard to think of many turnarounds that can even be compared to the one Curt Cignetti is executing in Bloomington. There are shades of Kalen DeBoer at Washington, but DeBoer did it at a place with a history of success. Turning Indiana into a national title contender at all -- let alone this quickly -- would have seemed impossible two years ago. Schlabach: I'm going with chalk again with the top four seeds advancing to the semifinals. I love what Mike Elko is building in his second season at Texas A&M. The Aggies are playing much better on defense and are a complete team. They still play four road games in the SEC, starting with Saturday's trip to Arkansas. They'll play at LSU, Missouri and Texas in November. Ouch. I've got Ohio State and Miami meeting in the CFP National Championship game. I'm not sure I'm completely sold on the Hurricanes just yet, but they're playing very well. They might be tested by Louisville at home Friday night.

bf4ddc53e4c6,MLB,,"Let's ignore the fact that the 2025 MLB playoffs began on the last day of September and might end on the first day of November -- because it's always October when it comes to playoff baseball -- and ask this: Who is this year's Mr. October? What if I told you that so far, it's a certain Japanese-born star on the Los Angeles Dodgers with a nasty splitter? OK, admittedly that doesn't narrow it down as much as you would think, but I'm guessing the first name that flashed in your mind was Shohei Ohtani . The right answer: Roki Sasaki . For now, anyway. At least that's the answer through the rubric of Win Probability Added (WPA, a metric that's been around for a while now and has a lot of utility in putting numbers to the narratives that emerge as the October bracket plays out.) How the Dodgers fixed Roki Sasaki After a disastrous MLB debut, L.A.'s new ninth-inning man has unleashed jaw-dropping stuff in October. Jeff Passan » The Dodgers, the sole wild-card team remaining, have played an extra round, and Sasaki currently leads all players on baseball's final four rosters in playoff WPA with .706. Here's Sasaki's game-by-game performance: Oct. 1: .015 (Finished the last inning of an 8-4 wild-card win over the Cincinnati Reds , a relatively low-leverage outing. But he looked good doing it, setting the Reds down in order with two whiffs. Hmmm. Maybe this means something.) Oct. 4: .099 (Closed out the Dodger's 5-3 win Game 1 of the division series at the Philadelphia Phillies . Something is definitely brewing here.) Oct. 6: .208 (Sasaki faced one batter! But it was the last batter of the game, Trea Turner , and there were runners on the corners with two outs with the Dodgers clinging to a 4-3 lead. Turner grounded out, and the Dodgers grabbed a commanding lead in the series. L.A., we might have a new closer.) Oct. 9: .384 (Sasaki retired all nine batters he faced during the eighth, ninth and 10th innings of a 1-1 game. The Dodgers went on to win the series clincher, and any doubts that L.A. has found a lethal, high-leverage playoff reliever were erased.) Numbers that function as narrative. That's WPA. We've been keeping tabs on these numbers as the playoffs have unfolded -- and will continue to do so. Our leaderboards and conclusions will be updated here as we move forward, so keep checking back. Jump to: Methodology | Top 5 | WPA hero of the day Top 10 for eliminated players | Ohtani tracker | The all-time WPA champs Methodology The way WPA works is that play-by-play during a game, if you do something that improves your team's chances to win, you get a positive credit. If you don't, it's a negative. In small samples, one play can have an outsized effect on WPA. A grand slam in a 10-0 game? Great for your stat line, but the blast does little to change the game's outcome. Hit the same homer with your team down 3-0 in the eighth, and you've made some history. Because of that, there is a bias toward players who end up in a lot of close games -- but only if they come through. All we've done here is to marry the hitting and pitching versions of WPA together based on the version of the system at Baseball-Reference.com. Why add pitching and hitting WPA together in 2025, the era of the universal DH? Well, you know why -- Mr. Ohtani -- and it was his historic debut as a two-way postseason player this season that inspired us to watch the WPA results a little more closely this October. So far, Ohtani has been pretty quiet during this postseason, but these leaderboards can change fast, so don't write off Ohtani just yet. Top 5 alive Best postseason WPAs from players on teams still playing 1. Roki Sasaki, Dodgers | .706 The current 2025 Mr. October. 2. Andres Munoz , Seattle Mariners | .598 Munoz went 4-for-4 in posting positive WPAs during Seattle's tense five-game win over the Detroit Tigers in the ALDS. Munoz put up 5⅓ scoreless innings during his four outings. One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » 3. Alex Vesia , Dodgers | .591 Vesia is a good example of why WPA can be more telling than traditional stats in the short series of October. His postseason ERA is 6.00. Egad! But that's because he gave up two low-leverage runs in the first game against Cincinnati, a Dodgers rout. Vesia hasn't been dinged in four subsequent outings that had a lot more weight to them, including the last inning of L.A.'s extra-inning, close-out win over Philadelphia, when he came on for Sasaki. 4. Blake Snell , Dodgers | .581 Snell was dealing in both of his outings so far, one in Game 1 against Cincinnati, the other in Game 2 against Philadelphia, the terse affair in which Sasaki recorded the last out. 5. Vladimir Guerrero Jr ., Toronto Blue Jays | .434 We all saw what Guerrero did against the Yankees -- 9-for-14 with three homers and nine RBIs. Because Toronto won so many lopsided games in the series, it limited the chances of any of the Jays to roll up WPA points. But the early damage Guerrero did in those contests were enough to land him here. About last night Golden Guy: Chad Patrick , Milwaukee Brewers (.240) Patrick retired all five batters he faced during a midgame stretch in which the Brewers led the Chicago Cubs just 2-1. He replaced Aaron Ashby in the sixth with two runners on base and one out, getting Seiya Suzuki on a long fly and striking out Ian Happ to escape the threat. FanGraphs measured those two plate appearances as the first- and third-highest leverage plays of Game 5. This was Patrick's third straight game leading the Brewers in WPA. It's been quite a run for the rookie, who was moved to the bullpen for the postseason after making 23 largely successful starts during the regular season. Good while they lasted Top 10 postseason WPAs from players on eliminated teams 1. Will Vest , Tigers | .848 2. Tarik Skubal , Tigers | .609 3. Kerry Carpenter , Tigers | .591 4. Aaron Judge , New York Yankees | .579 5. Jose Ramirez , Cleveland Guardians | .482 6. Keider Montero , Tigers | .441 7. Cristopher Sanchez , Phillies | .349 8. Garrett Crochet , Boston Red Sox | .348 9. Cam Schlittler , Yankees | .314 10. Brad Keller , Cubs | .283 Ohtani tracker Since Ohtani inspired all of this, we should keep tabs on him. Through the NLDS: Hitting WPA: minus-.257 Pitching WPA: minus-.062 WPA: minus-.319 (267th of 284 players this postseason) It can only get better from here, right? Ohtani is 4-for-27 at the plate (.148) with two homers. Both dingers came in Game 1 against Cincinnati and one of those was with the Dodgers already leading 6-0. Ohtani posted a good line in his lone pitching outing so far -- six innings, three runs, nine strikeouts. But the runs he gave up were early and with the Dodgers down three runs for much of his outing, that limited his chances to compile WPA. The WPA pantheon Top 10 single-season postseason WPAs since 1903 Note: It's a big time frame, but the cumulative nature of the leaderboard heavily favors the recent decades when there have been more playoff rounds. 1. David Freese, 2011 St. Louis Cardinals | 1.908 2. David Ortiz, 2004 Red Sox | 1.892 3. Curt Schilling, 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks | 1.748 4. Alex Rodriguez, 2009 Yankees | 1.704 5. Yordan Alvarez , 2022 Houston Astros | 1.646 6. Carlos Beltran, 2013 Cardinals | 1.582 7. Bernie Williams, 1996 Yankees | 1.545 8. John Wetteland, 1996 Yankees | 1.522 9. Eric Hosmer, 2014 Kansas City Royals | 1.443 10. Mariano Rivera, 2003 Yankees | 1.420 Ohtani is unique as a full-time two-player in a series, but not the first. For one, Babe Ruth won two games on the mound and played in left field during the 1918 series, though he did not start any of the games as a position player. But there have been pitchers who have had big postseasons with the bat. Here are the four instances in which a player posted at least .200 WPA on both the hitting and pitching sides during the same postseason. This is the list we thought Ohtani might join. He has some work to do to get there, but at least we know that if he doesn't do it, in 2025 baseball, no one else will. • Christy Mathewson, 1913 New York Giants (1.054 WPA | .447 hitting; .607 pitching) • Rube Foster, 1915 Red Sox (.883 WPA | .303 hitting; .580 pitching) • Babe Ruth, 1918 Red Sox (.710 WPA (.209 hitting; .501 pitching) • General Crowder, 1935 Tigers (.923 WPA | .207 hitting; .716 pitching) • Jake Arrieta , 2016 Cubs (.480 WPA | .218 hitting; .262 pitching)",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46553741/2025-mlb-playoffs-wpa-leaderboard-win-probability-added-shohei-ohtani,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559158_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,d863e2f61f151ac612d172bc64f65b4585976282
efc7779321e4,Tuchel's Bellingham stance could help England at World Cup,,"Thomas Tuchel has already demonstrated throughout his club coaching career with Borussia Dortmund , Paris Saint-Germain , Chelsea and Bayern Munich that he is not afraid to ruffle feathers or argue with his bosses. That is why his appointments are often short-lived. And that tendency to never avoid confrontation was very evident in his decision to omit England 's star player, Jude Bellingham , from the squad for this month's games against Wales and Latvia . However, you dress this up -- and Tuchel denies that he has a problem with Bellingham -- it is apparent that the England boss is making a point, and arguably aiming a shot across the bows of his most gifted player. Why? Reading between the lines of many a dispatch from the England camp, it seems there is an issue with how the Real Madrid star's demeanor has been received by some of his teammates. - Rogers firmly enters No. 10 debate for Tuchel's England - When can England qualify for the 2026 World Cup? - Why has Bellingham, officially England's best player, been dropped? He is a perfectionist whose body language can occasionally seem a little disdainful of less gifted colleagues. Are these accusations fair? Or is Bellingham simply trying to improve those around him to get results for the team? You suspect the player himself has, until now, been unaware of the vibes surrounding him. Though Bellingham himself has admitted he maintains a ""macho image"" to deflect from personal vulnerabilities, which suggests he is hearing the current mood music. ""You notice when he is not there,"" England teammate Anthony Gordon said. ""He is a big presence, such a big player,"" No one is denying Bellingham's importance to England's World Cup mission as both creator and scorer. If the squad were to be selected tomorrow, he would certainly be included. And those who know him well, such as his good friend Jordan Henderson , describe him as a ""brilliant character."" But even going back to his Borussia Dortmund days, there were stories that some more senior players took exception to the then-teenager giving them a piece of his mind if things were going wrong. It is easy to forget how much has happened to Bellingham. He was a fixture in Birmingham City' s team at age 16 and has since played 282 club games and 44 times for England. He has become an A-list global celebrity. So it is somewhat excusable for anyone to get a little giddy on that phenomenal success. But here is Tuchel sending a message that he should take nothing for granted, that there are other No. 10s -- such as Cole Palmer , Morgan Rogers or Morgan Gibbs-White -- on the radar. In other words: ""Fight for your place like everyone else. There are no favorites here."" The head coach astounded reporters last year by saying that his mother sometimes found Bellingham's on-pitch behavior ""repulsive."" He has since retracted that unfairly incriminating remark and apologized, but the quote did appear to reflect a level of dissatisfaction with how the player conducted himself. It seems Tuchel wants a slightly modified version; a great tourist as well as a great player. But is he right to do so? It is reminiscent of England's only World Cup-winning manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, who liked to keep even his most trusted players guessing back in 1966. His magnificent goalkeeper Gordon Banks left an England camp in that era with a cheery ""See you next time, boss."" ""Will you?"" was Ramsey's icy response. Jude Bellingham will look to play an important role for England under Thomas Tuchel in next summer's World Cup. (Photo by Eddie Keogh - The FA/The FA via Getty Images) So what we are witnessing here may be Tuchel's attempt to mold a World Cup squad free of the tensions that have undermined many a campaign for several teams, notably favorites France with their memorable row in 2010 and Spain (prior to their glut of trophies in more recent tournaments) on the frequent occasions when the rival Barcelona and Real Madrid players simply would not mix. This week, legendary England midfielder Steven Gerrard said the talented national teams he played in failed because they were ""egotistical losers"" with petty cliques of Manchester United , Arsenal , Chelsea and Liverpool players barely speaking. So building a unified squad that pulls in the same direction is paramount for Tuchel, as it was for his predecessor, Sir Gareth Southgate. It would have been easy for the England boss to explain the cold shoulder for Bellingham as an injury-related issue. He has, after all, been recovering from shoulder surgery, albeit featuring five times for Real Madrid since that operation, including starting the Madrid derby against Atlético. But, typically, the German made it clear that it was a decision based on form, and said Bellingham had ""no rhythm"" in his play yet. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Besides, he wanted to reward the players who put in a breakthrough display for him with a 5-0 win in Serbia by naming an unchanged squad, even though he had to replace injured winger Noni Madueke with Bukayo Saka . Yet it is fair to deduce that there is another agenda at play here, namely, the quest to head to the World Cup next summer with a happy band of brothers bursting with the team spirit that can make the difference in tight games. Tuchel, like Ramsey 59 years ago, is going to do the job his way, even if it puts some noses out of joint. He does not care about that. It is not only a brave option, but the right one. Bellingham will return to the team determined to prove a point and, as the world-class player and top character that he is, he will have taken note of what his boss is telling him. It is all just part of the learning curve, and one day, he might reflect that the day England left him out made him realize how he could become an even better contributor to the cause.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46555053/tuchel-tough-love-bellingham-help-england-player-world-cup,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1010%2Fr1558440_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,cd9c59fad9153581890febe1678e3fc9a5e7834d
8fad424c923d,"WWE Crown Jewel takeaways: Cena, Styles pass the torch to Rollins, Rhodes",,"John Cena and AJ Styles stole the show at WWE's Crown Jewel in Perth, Australia, with a love letter to professional wrestling. The match between two retiring legends -- Cena at the end of this year and Styles in 2026 -- featured an impressive amount of tributes to past opponents and WWE legends. Cena also won his 100th WWE Premium Live Event (PLE) match. Only The Undertaker has more with 107, a record we will have to wait a while to see broken. Also on the card, Seth Rollins finally got the validation and vindication he was seeking against Cody Rhodes. Bronson Reed also picked up a historic victory over Roman Reigns in a finish that not many people saw coming. And the Australian wrestlers understood the assignment. Crown Jewel results • Bronson Reed defeats Roman Reigns • Stephanie Vaquer defeats Tiffany Stratton (Women's Crown Jewel Championship) • John Cena defeats AJ Styles • Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky defeat Asuka and Kairi Sane • Seth Rollins defeats Cody Rhodes (Men's Crown Jewel Championship) Cena vs. Styles was a brilliant tribute to pro wrestling play 0:47 John Cena uses a Tombstone to pin AJ Styles at WWE: Crown Jewel John Cena pays homage to Undertaker with a Tombstone to AJ Styles, then hits an Attitude Adjustment to pick up the win at WWE: Crown Jewel. John Cena vs. AJ Styles might go down as the best match Cena has had during his retirement tour -- full of tributes. It began with Cena passing a paper to ring announcer Alicia Taylor with a special introduction, which included references to Total Nonstop Action wrestling and the Bullet Club had the crowd chanting ""Holy s---"" and ""This is awesome"" even before the match started. The match started with some catch-as-catch can, with several lockups and shows of sportsmanship, with both wrestlers clearly respecting the other. The tributes to past opponents continued for Cena, including a Skull Crushing Finale (The Miz), an Accolade (Rusev) and even a Walls of Jericho (Chris Jericho). Styles donned his old TNA ring gear for the match. Cena hit a DDT with Style's feet on the ropes followed by an RKO, a Randy Orton special (followed by a missed Punt). We also almost saw a 619 and Sweet Chin Music (from Styles). The loudest ovation for a tribute, though, was Cena delivering a Sister Abigail, complete with forehead kiss to the delight of the crowd, who then brought out their phone flashlights in a fitting firefly scene. Cena pinned Styles following a Tombstone into an Attitude Adjustment, a terrific ""follow that"" kind of match and a beautiful love letter to professional wrestling. It's Rhodes' and Rollins' turn now play 0:48 Seth Rollins uses Rolex watch to get his first career victory over Cody Rhodes Seth Rollins uses the Rolex watch Cody Rhodes gifted him to defeat Rhodes for the first time in his career. It was poetic that on the same card we saw Cena vs. Styles, we also got Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins, a showcase between the present and future of the industry for years to come. Rollins defeated Rhodes after hitting him with the Rolex watch gifted to him previously by Rhodes, followed by a stomp from the top rope. Rollins finally got a win over Rhodes and claimed the men's Crown Jewel Championship in the process. After weeks of putting pressure on Rollins to win, perhaps we will now hear Paul Heyman say this was all a test to get Rollins out of his head and find a way to unlock his true potential. Regardless, it was a terrific match to follow Cena vs. Styles. We often talk about the ""passing of the torch"" from one wrestler to another in a match (such as Cena to Rhodes at SummerSlam), but in a way, through their match, Cena and Styles passed the torch to Rollins and Rhodes. Roman Reigns was not happy to see The Usos play 0:50 Jey Uso's accidental spear of Roman Reigns leads to Bronson Reed's win at Australian Street Fight Jey Uso accidentally spears Roman Reigns through a table, leading to Bronson Reed getting the pin at the Australian Street Fight at WWE: Crown Jewel. We learned that an Australian Street Fight consists of cricket bats, rugby balls and brawling all over the arena. Reigns owned the first several minutes of the match, getting a measure of revenge on Bronson Reed until Reed turned the tide, with the crowd firmly against their fellow countryman. Bron Breakker inevitably showed up to help Reed, spearing Reigns on the outside. The Usos came to Reigns' aid, but it turned to disaster as Jey Uso accidentally speared Reigns through a table, leading to a Tsunami and a victory for Reed. Reed joins Cody Rhodes as the second WWE Superstar to pin Reigns in the last several years. Reed also wins in his home country, another rare feat (in folklore) in WWE. It must have felt extra sweet for Reed, who was injured last year and couldn't compete in Perth at the 2024 Elimination Chamber. At the end of the match, Reigns told The Usos, ""I don't want to see y'all until Christmas."" Funny, that is exactly what I say to all of my extended family at Thanksgiving. Stratton vs. Vaquer could have gone longer play 0:47 Stephanie Vaquer defeats Tiffany Stratton for the Women's Crown Jewel Championship Women's heavyweight champion Stephanie Vaquer defeats Women's WWE champion Tiffany Stratton for the Women's Crown Jewel Championship. During the women's Crown Jewel Championship match between Stephanie Vaquer and Tiffany Stratton, the crowd, which was into the action all night, gave dueling ""La Primera/Tiffy Time"" chants. Vaquer won in what felt like a quicker match than expected following a Corkscrew Splash, earning the Women's Crown Jewel Championship, ending Stratton's undefeated streak. Give it up for the Aussies play 0:44 Rhea Ripley, IYO SKY pick up the tag team win against The Kabuki Warriors Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY defeat The Kabuki Warriors at WWE: Crown Jewel. The Australian contingent shined in Perth. Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky defeated the Kabuki Warriors as the crowd showered Ripley with love. Bronson Reed picked up a historic win.

24b98ede5b6c,"2026 NFL draft questions, latest intel, risers, standouts",,"Oct 12, 2025, 02:10 PM ET We're through Week 7 of the 2025 college football season , and this weekend's games were all about the quarterback matchups. Indiana's Fernando Mendoza beat Oregon's Dante Moore . Texas' Arch Manning beat Oklahoma's John Mateer . LSU's Garrett Nussmeier beat South Carolina's LaNorris Sellers . And elsewhere, Alabama's Ty Simpson put up big numbers against Missouri , and Penn State's Drew Allar went down with a leg injury in a loss to Northwestern . That's a lot to break down. The 2026 NFL draft is still roughly half a year away. But our NFL draft analysts are always looking down the road, taking early notes on top prospects and starting to stack their rankings for an exciting class. With that in mind, Mel Kiper Jr., Matt Miller and Jordan Reid will size up CFB action through a draft-centric lens on Sundays all season long. (Save this link!) They will answer lingering questions on the best 2026 prospects, share insights from scouts, pick out risers to watch and pull back the curtain on their evaluation process. Here is what they've seen and heard through Week 7. Jump to notes on: Week 7 | Week 6 | Week 5 Week 4 | Week 3 | Week 2 Oct. 12 Did anyone finally lay claim to the QB1 spot with his performance on Saturday? Miller: I really wanted Saturday to be the day that cleared up the quarterback pecking order, given the big games we had on the docket -- but I left with no clear-cut QB1. Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore battled each other while showing their trademark touch, deep-ball accuracy and all-around arm tools, but both quarterbacks also threw two costly interceptions. South Carolina's LaNorris Sellers struggled both through the air and on the ground; Garrett Nussmeier was once again crisp on intermediate passes in the same game but also threw two interceptions. It's still a very wide-open race, but Alabama's Ty Simpson has become a real player to watch. Despite being a first-year starter, he has carved up opponents throughout the first few weeks of the season, including three TD passes on Saturday against Missouri . But no, we still don't have a serious QB1 who is pulling away from the pack. play 1:04 What does Ty Simpson, Alabama's win over Mizzou prove? SEC Now crew agree that the Tide are hitting on the right cylinders, while discussing Simpson's ability to take care of the ball, make plays and get the whole offense involved. Which QB produced more questions than answers with his big head-to-head showdown Saturday? Reid: Sellers. Against LSU, he finished 15-of-27 for 124 yards, no touchdown passes and an interception, while rushing for only 19 yards on 22 carries. It was his second straight game without a touchdown. Sellers' process looks sped up. Entering the weekend, he had been sacked on an FBS-high 12.4% of his dropbacks, and that number will only increase as he took five sacks on Saturday. The Gamecocks' leaky offensive line has allowed bad habits to creep into his game; his timing and rhythm from the pocket have been inconsistent throughout the season. What else are we seeing and hearing? Reid: Penn State QB Drew Allar suffered a season-ending injury . Allar had been viewed as a potential Day 2 pick prior to the injury, and he returned to Penn State for the 2025 season hoping to join the Round 1 discussions. He hadn't really lifted his play, though, with 1,100 yards, eight TD throws and three interceptions this season. What happens now? Being that it was the Nittany Lions' sixth game of the season, Allar is unable to apply for a medical redshirt -- meaning he has played his final collegiate game. His draft stock will be fascinating to watch over the next few months. Miller: Missouri edge defender Damon Wilson II continues to look like a top-40 prospect and has really emerged as one of the best transfers in the nation after joining the Tigers from Georgia. He posted two sacks in Saturday's close loss to Alabama, running his total for the season to 5.5. At 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, Wilson's first-step burst and length make him a tough ask for college offensive tackles to contain. I think I might be adding him to my top 25 after that big game. Kiper: Alabama defensive end LT Overton was outstanding on the other side of that game. His great hustle in particular stood out. Overton finished with six tackles and 1.5 sacks, and his lateral pursuit speed and ability to fight through blocks was on full display. He played outside but shaded inside. He dropped in coverage here and there. At 6-foot-5 and 278 pounds, he was everywhere -- and he played like a future NFL starter. But Overton needs to show consistency. If he puts up more games like this one, Overton could go in late Round 1 or early-to-mid Round 2. Miller: Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer was receiving Round 1 praise before missing three games with a hand injury . But his return against Texas showed accuracy struggles while he navigated a messy pocket. Mateer threw three interceptions while missing his receivers when asked to make throws under pressure. Notably, his third pick was off the hands of his receiver when the pass catcher had to extend away from his body for the ball. Mateer (6-1, 224) does have all of this season and next season before he has to enter the draft, and that might ultimately be the route. Reid: I was excited to watch Alabama offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor (6-7, 366) against the talented Mizzou edge rush of Zion Young and Damon Wilson II. He had allowed nine pressures so far this season, with seven coming in Week 1 against Florida State. But I thought Proctor played a clean game against the Tigers. His consistency as a pass protector was tested, and he remained firm. Plus, he generated good movement in the run game. Proctor is still polarizing as a prospect because of his inconsistency. There are some scouts who still believe he's a Round 1 prospect, but others are hesitant to buy into his draft stock as an early-rounder. Upcoming matchups against Tennessee , South Carolina , LSU and Oklahoma will be huge for him. Kiper: We saw a great game from Georgia's CJ Allen . The talented off-ball linebacker affected this matchup with Auburn in a lot of ways, finishing with 10 tackles, a sack, two tackles for loss and a pass defensed. His read-and-react skills, speed and physicality make him a tough task for opponents. At 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, Allen took on blocks in run defense, made plays on the ball in coverage and got after the QB. That screams ""three-down linebacker"" at the next level. My first Big Board comes out this week, and Allen was truly a borderline top-25 guy. I see a first-rounder. Kiper: Defensive tackle A'Mauri Washington was solid in Oregon's loss. He had a bull rush for a sack and added three tackles. His game is still raw, but I see a nice combination of explosiveness, power, quickness, toughness and overall athleticism. Washington was really strong at the point of attack Saturday, and at 6-foot-3 and 330 pounds, he proved disruptive on the interior. He's another one who could play his way into Round 1. Reid: Indiana receiver Elijah Sarratt continues to be one of the top options for Mendoza. He had eight catches for 121 yards and a touchdown against Oregon. Sarratt is sure-handed and thrives in contested situations. His body control and hand-eye coordination at the catch point were showcased on Saturday, too. While Sarratt (6-2, 209) won't consistently win with vertical speed on his route stems, his detailed route running helps him create separation in the short-to-intermediate areas. He is viewed as a middle-round target, but for teams searching for immediate contributors at receiver, he has the potential to play early on. play 1:03 Manning, Wisner on Texas' mentality after dominant win over No. 5 OU Arch Manning discusses his bounce back performance and raves about his star running back Quintrevion Wisner, while Wisner reflects on the all-around effort shown by the Longhorns. Kiper: In a year where there aren't a bunch of running back options, Texas' Quintrevion Wisner is someone who could emerge. He is one of the key reasons that Texas won Saturday against Oklahoma. He is back from a hamstring injury and looks quick and explosive between the tackles. Wisner is dynamic in both the run and pass games, and he's shifty with the ball in his hands at 6-foot and 194 pounds. He rolled to 1,064 yards last season on the ground, adding 44 catches. And he made a statement Saturday with 94 rushing yards and 34 receiving yards against the Sooners. Wisner is just a real good all-around prospect, and I have him in that third- or fourth-round range right now. Kiper: OK, here's a late-Day 3 guy to watch. Illinois State receiver Daniel Sobkowicz is a fourth-year stater and has put up some good tape. On Saturday against Murray State, he posted eight catches for 162 yards and a touchdown -- and added another TD on the ground. He uses his great length, 6-foot-3/205-pound size and slight adjustments in his routes to haul in deep balls. Sobkowicz sells his routes and has reliable hands, too. The big question will be his speed, and scouts will be watching him during all-star events and/or at the combine. Oct. 5 Does Nico Iamaleava fit into this QB draft class after his big performance? Reid: Iamaleava had a rough start to the season. Though his first four games, the Tennessee transfer ranked 78th in QBR in the country (54.4). Then Saturday, against by far the team's best opponent of the season, Iamaleava looked like a different quarterback (97.4 QBR). He finished 17-of-24 for 166 passing yards and two touchdown passes, and Iamaleava made multiple impressive throws against the stingy Nittany Lions defense. His rushing ability was the real separator between the first four games and Week 6, though. Iamaleava kept drives alive with his legs, generating explosive plays and ultimately gaining another 128 yards and three more scores on the ground (16 carries). So what does it all mean for his draft stock? At 6-foot-6 and 215 pounds, Iamaleava has dual-threat traits and a big arm, but he needs time. He's still just a redshirt sophomore. He has 19 career starts, and he is still inconsistent with accuracy and decision-making. I don't expect Iamaleava to declare for the 2026 draft. I'd put him in the Day 3 conversation right now for next year, but it makes sense for him to keep developing before entering the 2027 or even 2028 class. play 0:30 Nico Iamaleava takes off for his third TD for UCLA Nico Iamaleava skirts in for a 7-yard UCLA touchdown and a 42-28 lead. Call it now: How many Miami players will go in Round 1? Miller: Two ... maybe three. Miami is anchored in the trenches by a pair of high-end prospects, one of which is playing better than any other player in the nation at this time. Defensive end Rueben Bain Jr . has been exceptional all season, with two sacks and a résumé full of impact plays. At 6-foot-3 and 275 pounds, he has a combination of power and quickness to his game that makes him an easy evaluation to the next level as a power rusher. In that way, he's similar to Trey Hendrickson ; he has a well-rounded skill set. Bain is playing like a top-five pick. And on the other side of the ball is right tackle Francis Mauigoa , who some scouts see as a guard at the next level thanks to his power in the run game. Miami has had success running behind the 6-foot-6, 315-pounder -- something the Hurricanes leaned on against Florida State -- and I think his play has been better than that of any other offensive tackle in the nation. The predraft all-star circuit will be important for Mauigoa's evaluation as NFL teams decide if he's a guard or tackle, but he is performing like a top-15 pick. The wild card is quarterback Carson Beck . Considered a Round 1-caliber player at this time last year before falling off, Beck has played cleanly this season following a transfer from Georgia. His four touchdown throws against Florida State remind us how smooth, poised and accurate he can be with a clean pocket, and in his first real test of the season, he answered the call. Beck fell apart when pressured in 2024, but he seems to have grown in that area based on what we've seen. And in a draft class without an established QB1, Beck has room to rise into the Round 1 picture. What else are we seeing and hearing? Miller: Ohio State has become WRU as NFL scouts evaluate players, and senior wideout Carnell Tate continues to impress as a pro-ready pass catcher. Saturday against Minnesota , Tate posted nine catches for 183 yards and a touchdown with crisp, strong routes and the same professional-level concentration we've come to expect from him. Tate (6-3, 195) has the all-around game to receive a Round 1 grade, especially in a class with limited top-tier receiver prospects. Tate likely won't jump Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State) as the top player at the position, but he has pushed himself into the WR2 conversation. Reid: This was Beck's fourth game with four touchdown passes and zero interceptions over the past two seasons -- tied for the most in the FBS during that span, per ESPN Research. A true pocket passer, Beck stays in-rhythm in the Hurricanes' offense. I had Beck graded as a middle-round prospect prior to this season, but he's trending upward. Like Matt, I have him entering the early-round discussion with his play through the first quarter of the season. play 0:29 Carson Beck connects for 40-yard TD pass Carson Beck connects for 40-yard TD pass Kiper: Louisville receiver Chris Bell is a Day 2 prospect who could play his way into the Day 1 mix. After catching 10 balls for 135 yards and a TD last week against Pitt , he rolled up 12 catches for 170 yards and two TDs on Saturday against Virginia . He's a big 6-foot-2, 220-pounder who plays the game with a power forward mentality. Cornerbacks really struggle with his physicality; Bell wins on 50-50 balls, and he wins over the middle. He appears almost uncoverable on tape. Bell does body catch at times, but he's becoming more consistent there. I love his competitiveness, and I'm keeping an eye on him in this WR class. Miller: The Penn State rushing attack hasn't found its footing throughout the first month, and scouts are wondering why coach James Franklin isn't leaning more on running backs Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen . In the loss to UCLA, those two combined for 89 yards on just 19 carries as the Nittany Lions tried to keep pace with the Bruins' offense. Singleton, who started the season as my No. 2 RB in the class, has struggled to find space behind an offensive line that has been pushed around all season. Allen has been the more productive of the two despite being the lesser-regarded prospect, making a name for himself as a 5-foot-11, 217-pound downhill power runner. Conference play will be important for both; will Penn State again rely on the run game? At 6-foot and 224 pounds, Singleton's all-around ability as a runner, pass catcher and blocker had him ranked as a late-Round 1 prospect. Looking around the NFL, it's easy to see him as a seamless upgrade for numerous teams. For instance, Kansas City is struggling to find an explosive ground game, and Singleton's ability to break off big runs and make an impact in the passing game would be a great fit for the Chiefs. Reid: Coming into the season, one prospect I had circled as a breakout candidate was Texas A&M edge rusher Cashius Howell . He had to wait his turn behind two eventual top-40 picks in Shemar Stewart and Nic Scourton , but his patience has paid off. With his second three-sack performance of the season Saturday against Mississippi State , he's now up to seven sacks on the year. At 6-foot-2 and 248 pounds, his ability to win with bend or power makes him a versatile rusher, too. He still needs to show production against upper-tier teams in the conference, but with upcoming matchups against Florida and LSU , he has prime opportunities to continue improving his draft stock. I have Howell ranked as a top-50 prospect and inside of my top five at edge rusher. Kiper: Jordan beat me to the punch on Howell, but ... wow, he was outstanding once again Saturday. He played like a first-rounder. What I really like about is game is that he isn't purely an edge rusher. He can get inside pressure, too. Howell gets blockers off balance because he mixes up his moves, and then he closes in the blink of an eye. We saw it at the end of last season, too, and he has continued that stretch of dominance into 2025. NFL teams want closers, and that describes Howell. Kiper: How about Cincinnati linebacker Jake Golday ? He had 12 tackles, his third sack of the season, a forced fumble and a pass deflection on Saturday against Iowa State . He was all over the field. Through five games, Golday has 48 tackles. Turn on the tape, and you see a rugged tackler with sideline-to-sideline speed. As a former defensive end, his pass rush skills show up often, too. Since coming over from Central Arkansas before the 2024 season, Golday has made a big impact on the Bearcats' defense. And Cincinnati uses him all over -- in the slot, off the ball, wherever. The 6-foot-4, 240-pounder has the traits, talent and work ethic to be a big contributor in the pros, and I have him in the Day 2 conversation right now. Sept. 28 What are scouts saying about the start to Drew Allar 's season? Miller: The line on Allar from scouts is that he's talented and toolsy with prototypical arm talent and mobility -- but that he also fails to rise to the moment. The 6-foot-5, 235-pound signal-caller has played with consistent timing, accuracy and pace from the pocket. But we saw him struggle against top-tier talent last season, and Allar's play against Oregon was unfortunately what we've come to expect when Penn State needs him to carry the team. He went 14-of-25 for 137 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. The two scores were encouraging, but the 5.5 yards per attempt and one pick indicate that the game is not slowing down for Allar in his senior season. ""He's still way too panicked in the pocket. Keep it clean and simple, and he'll carve you up, but any pressure, and his eyes go to the rush,"" is how one NFC East area scout put it. Despite Allar's 43 starts in college so far, an AFC West area scout said, ""To me, he looks like a player that needs upper-level quarterback development still. Not mechanically or athletically, but from a processing standpoint, he's not seeing it fast enough."" Name recognition, program legacy and his great physical tools will keep Allar in early-round conversations, but his tape isn't consistent enough to earn him a starting QB label from NFL teams. I polled six scouts Saturday night, and all of them see him as a likely Round 3 option. How many top-50 picks do you see on Ohio State's roster -- and which stood out the most Saturday? Reid: An impressive victory against Washington showed just how much depth the Buckeyes have this season. I count five Buckeyes with top-50 grades for 2026: safety Caleb Downs , linebacker Arvell Reese , wide receiver Carnell Tate , linebacker Sonny Styles and tight end Max Klare . But it was Reese who really popped against Washington . He was viewed as a late-round prospect coming into the season, but Reese has been the Buckeyes' best prospect on defense -- yes, even more so than Downs -- since becoming a starter in 2025. On Saturday, the 6-foot-4, 243-pounder showcased his versatility as a second-level defender and edge rusher, picking up five tackles. Ohio State defensive coordinator Matt Patricia tasked him with spying Washington QB Demond Williams Jr ., putting his closing speed and physical play to use. I spoke to multiple scouts in Seattle prior to the game, and they were buzzing about Reese's skill set. The talented linebacker has catapulted into the Round 1 discussion. And if he continues on this rapid climb up boards, he has a chance to be the first linebacker selected and a top-20 pick. What else are we seeing and hearing? Reid: Matt already mentioned Allar, but I can't say enough about the poise of the other QB in that game: Oregon's Dante Moore . Scouts have been waiting to see him face a high-level opponent, and Moore went 29-for-39 for 289 yards and three touchdowns. He plays with an unflappable demeanor; he never showed panic in his game, despite the hostile environment. And even after Penn State put up 14 unanswered points to send the game to overtime, Moore consistently and accurately found his targets at all three levels of the field, making big play after big play in the extra frames. Scouts are still on the fence about whether he will declare for the draft after this season, but he has been one of the best QB prospects in the class through five weeks. Moore just became only the third Oregon player in the past 30 years with three or more passing touchdowns in four of the team's first five games of a season ( Bo Nix in 2023 and Akili Smith in 1998). Evaluators have certainly taken notice, despite the 6-3, 206-pound QB starting only five career games to this point. play 0:44 Dan Lanning calls Dante Moore the 'best quarterback in college football' Dan Lanning has high praise for Dante Moore after Oregon's double-overtime win against Penn State. Kiper: Yeah, Moore is playing like a potential first overall pick. He has that ceiling. But I instead want to highlight an under-the-radar QB: Jaden Craig . This 6-foot-2, 215-pound signal-caller might play at Harvard, but he could have been a solid Power 4 quarterback. Craig has an NFL arm, and he uses it on the move. When he gets outside the pocket, he isn't looking to run; he's looking to throw. Craig processes and sees the field well, and he shows the accuracy and touch to deliver the ball downfield and into tight windows. Craig has six TD passes -- including four Saturday against Brown -- and no interceptions through two games, and he's completing 77.3% of his throws. I think he's a Day 3 pick right now, but the arrow is pointing up. I like what I'm seeing on tape, and a good all-star event showing could push him up boards even further. Miller: ""Now that's what a first-round running back looks like,"" is what one NFL general manager texted me during Notre Dame's blowout win against Arkansas . Tailback Jeremiyah Love scored four touchdowns in the first half. We've been waiting for the true breakout game as he ramps up after ending last season with a knee injury. And if Saturday was any indication, Love is warm now. Despite sitting for most of the second half, Love had 57 rushing yards and two scores on 14 carries, along with 70 receiving yards and two more scores on five catches. His ability as a home run hitter, plus what the 6-foot, 214-pound back brings to the table as a pass catcher, makes him a potential top-10 talent in this draft class. Miller: Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson continues to build his résumé as WR1 in the 2026 class. Friday night's win over TCU saw him grab eight passes for 126 yards and two scores. Tyson (6-2, 200 pounds) has improved his consistency as a pass catcher while still being the run-after-catch threat that made him so unstoppable last season. The work he has done to perfect his positional craft is impressive, and it's allowing him to run away from the pack as the top receiver in the class. Tyson could be a top-15 pick. Reid: Another wide receiver prospect whom scouts have been complimentary of this season is USC's Makai Lemon . I talked about him here last week, and he kept rolling with 11 receptions for 151 receiving yards and two touchdowns Saturday against Illinois . Lemon is a savvy route runner who catches everything, and he can be effective from the slot or on the outside. Lemon (5-11, 195 pounds) can create separation with ease, but he can also make contested catches when needed, as he had a miraculous fourth-quarter grab Saturday. Lemon came into the season as a middle-round prospect, but I actually think he can battle Tyson as a WR1 candidate. Reid: Oregon edge rusher Matayo Uiagalelei finished with four tackles and a sack against Penn State. The most impressive part of his performance was his hustle and ball pursuit. Because of his relentless motor, the 6-foot-5, 272-pound standout was able to create constant disruption as a run defender and pass rusher. Coming into the season, scouts had mixed opinions on his projection; some viewed him as a late Round 1 prospect, while others thought he was more of a Day 2 guy in a loaded defensive line group. He's the No. 5 edge rusher on my own board. Kiper: Ole Miss tight end Dae'Quan Wright now has catches over 25 yards in all four games played this season, after adding a 26-yarder against LSU . The Virginia Tech transfer has consistently come up big. On Saturday, he had two fourth-down catches, including a 20-yard pickup on fourth-and-3 to ice the win. The big-play ability is there, and he's a reliable pass catcher who can be flexed out wide. The 6-foot-4, 255-pound senior just needs to improve his blocking. At the moment, I'd put him in the Day 3 range. Miller: Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza made a handful of NFL-level throws this weekend against Iowa . With considerable pressure in his face all day, Mendoza (13-for-23, 233 yards, 2 TDs and one INT) made big-time throws with accuracy and timing. And he's still building chemistry with playmakers like running back Roman Hemby and wide receiver Elijah Sarratt , so the production could get even better for the 6-5, 225-pound passer. I haven't heard Round 1 talk from NFL scouts yet, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see that buzz get going as we get into October. Reid: Alabama OT Kadyn Proctor continues to be one of the most interesting prospects in this draft class. He has flashes that suggest a potential early-round pick. But then there are lapses in play where he looks more like a middle-round prospect. A strong argument could be made that he had one of the best games of his career against Georgia , though. Proctor was physical as a pass protector and constantly showed his bruising ability as he paved lanes in the run game. He even caught one of the most entertaining screen passes that you'll ever see, as he gained 11 yards and almost scored. The athletic traits and power of Proctor showed, but he needs to find more consistency. play 0:33 Ty Simpson throws pass to 6-foot-7, 366-pound tackle Kadyn Proctor Ty Simpson throws it out to Kadyn Proctor, who barrels over everyone to set up first-and-goal. Kiper: Jordan mentioned a bunch of early-round Buckeyes, but here's a sleeper from that roster. Edge rusher Caden Curry leads the team in sacks (five) and tackles for loss (five), and he is third in tackles (16). His game is built on consistency and hustle; he never lets up. At 6-foot-3 and 260 pounds, Curry is solid against the run. He can drop in coverage. And he is versatile enough along the line that he can generate pressure no matter where he is lined up. He actually had a sack Saturday when kicked inside over the nose tackle. When I watch Curry play, I think ""future Steeler."" He plays with that mentality. Watch him as a Day 3 prospect with plenty of potential to rise before April. Sept. 23 What does John Mateer 's right hand injury mean for his draft stock? Reid: Mateer will be sidelined for about a month after suffering an injury to his throwing hand . He is expected to undergo surgery. Mateer was climbing rankings quickly after impressive early-season performances against Michigan and Auburn . He was viewed as a middle-round prospect coming into the season after transferring from Washington State to Oklahoma, but scouts were starting to mention him in the early-Day 2 discussions. He's the No. 4 QB on my board, though he began the 2025 season outside my top five at the position. Now, missing a month could keep Mateer outside the top 50 picks. Returning for a late-season stretch of games against ranked opponents -- including Alabama , Missouri and LSU -- could help him salvage his Round 1 potential. Evaluators are taking a wait-and-see approach following his injury. It should be noted that Mateer also has the option to return to school because he has another year of eligibility. play 0:21 John Mateer plows into the end zone for a big-time OU TD John Mateer breaks the plane to give the Sooners a lead late in the fourth quarter. At 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds, he plays with an aggressive mentality and fearlessness. He operates well inside the pocket, isn't afraid of testing tight windows and throws with anticipation in the Sooners' up-tempo offense. Mateer was off to a fast start this season with 1,215 passing yards and six TD passes -- and the underrated runner added another 190 rushing yards and five more scores on the ground through four games. Sept. 21 What are you seeing from USC's top two receivers? Reid: Trojans wideout Makai Lemon was generating plenty of interest from scouts I spoke with Saturday in Los Angeles at USC's win over Michigan State . He caught eight passes for 127 yards and a touchdown (40 yards), and then he also rushed twice for 11 more yards and an additional score. A polished route runner, Lemon transitions well in and out of his breaks. At 5-foot-11 and 195 pounds, he's capable of lining up in the slot or on the outside, and his reliability at the catch point has shined through four games this season. Lemon has also shown that he can be an adequate return specialist at the next level. At this point in the season, he looks like a potential early-Day 2 pick. Of course, Lemon isn't even the highest-ranked WR prospect on USC's roster. Ja'Kobi Lane entered the season as my No. 2-ranked receiver, and I haven't moved off that grade through four games. He missed Saturday's game with an injury , but he has nine catches for 239 yards and a touchdown over three games. At 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, Lane is a long strider with unique ball-tracking skills. He's able to sky over defenders and make catches as a vertical threat. Lane still needs to refine his route tree and show more consistency in the short-to-intermediate areas, but he for sure has the potential to be a top-50 pick. What stood out about Indiana's Fernando Mendoza vs. Illinois? Miller: Mendoza turned in the single best performance of any player in the country this week. Facing the No. 9-ranked Fighting Illini -- a team that had allowed just 22 points all season -- Mendoza was nearly flawless. He completed 21 of 23 passes for 267 yards and five touchdown throws. His command from the pocket stood out consistently throughout the game, as he was comfortable and confident standing tall and throwing darts downfield. Mendoza is an on-time passer who gives his receivers plenty of time and room to run after the catch, and his best attribute is how accurately he delivers the ball. Passes were right where they needed to be Saturday. After transferring from California this offseason, the biggest question marks for Mendoza were his ability to play against better competition and whether he could cut down on turnover-worthy throws where he overtrusted his arm. He has done both of those things this season with 14 touchdown passes and no interceptions in four games. The 6-foot-5, 225-pound quarterback is easily one of the most improved players in the class. There is no set-in-stone QB1 for next year, and Mendoza's play is putting him into that conversation. The success of on-target passers like Jared Goff -- whom Mendoza reminds me of -- will only help to boost his stock if his strong play continues. What else are we seeing and hearing? Miller: The Clemson defense was billed as an elite unit featuring first-round prospects along the defensive line and at cornerback. But much like Florida State's much-heralded defense last year, not all of the prospects have lived up to expectations. Defensive tackle Peter Woods -- a player considered to be a top-five prospect before the season began -- has failed to make a real impact and has yet to record his first sack this season. The 6-foot-3, 315-pounder's tape from prior seasons showed a player who was rarely moved around by offensive linemen, but this year, his ability to get off blocks and finish plays is missing. There's time to turn it around, but the junior defensive tackle's stock might be slipping. Reid: One prospect who immediately caught my attention while I was out on the scouting trail this weekend was USC linebacker Eric Gentry . At 6-foot-6 and 225 pounds, Gentry is a long and rangy defender with a wiry build. Primarily playing at the second level, he's an explosive enforcer from his inside linebacker spot. Scouts are intrigued by his potential at the next level because of his instincts and range when chasing ball carriers. Gentry will be a bit of a polarizing prospect because of his frame; he needs to add more weight. But when asking scouts about him, many believed that he's a middle-round prospect. Kiper: Michigan running back Justice Haynes is making a case to be a third- or fourth-round pick next April. He's the son of Verron Haynes, a former Georgia running back who I scouted before he went in the fifth round of the 2002 draft to the Steelers. The younger Haynes was great Saturday against Nebraska , carrying the ball 17 times for 149 yards and a score. At 5-foot-11 and 210 pounds, he plays with a low center of gravity and generates powerful leg drive. This isn't a running back who is going to dance around behind the line of scrimmage and take a tackle for loss; he's a one-cut-and-go runner with good body lean. But once he gets through the hole, he can be hard to catch. Haynes has four carries for 50-plus yards this season, helping him to 537 yards and six TDs through four games. The Alabama transfer also stands out as a pass catcher and blocker. He high-pointed a catch Saturday, and his ability to pass protect is evident on the tape. play 0:28 Justice Haynes breaks off for 75-yd rushing TD Justice Haynes takes it 75 yards to the house to put Michigan back in front vs. Nebraska. Miller: One of the best matchups of the day was the Texas Tech pass-rush duo of David Bailey and Romello Height against Utah offensive tackles Caleb Lomu and Spencer Fano . This was a résumé game with best-versus-best attributes, and Bailey walked away from the field the clear winner of the four prospects. Matched up across from Fano for much of the game, Bailey's first-step quickness kept Fano off-balance. At 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, his ability to counter with power and use of his arm length really frustrated the Utah right tackle. Fano entered the matchup as my top-ranked tackle thanks to his experience at both tackle spots, but his lack of anchor strength at 6-foot-6 and 300 pounds was noticeable. He's still a Round 1 player -- we don't overreact to one game here -- but Bailey's strong showing (3 tackles, 1 sack) against elite competition is tape to go back to throughout the process. Bailey has the makings of a top-75 player. Reid: One of the best edge rusher duos in the country is at Missouri. Damon Wilson II (6-foot-4, 250 pounds) and Zion Young (6-foot-5, 262 pounds) have continued to climb up boards after a strong start to the season. Wilson spent the first two years of his career at Georgia before transferring to the Tigers, and after recording a half-sack against South Carolina , he has already matched his career high in sacks (3.0) from a season ago. He still needs to refine his hand usage as a pass rusher, and that would allow him to climb the board even more. Young, meanwhile, is more versatile in that he can put his length to use as both a run defender and pass rusher. He had two tackles for loss and a sack Saturday. With an explosive first step and the hand power to match, Young is viewed as a top-50 prospect. Kiper: Second week in a row that I'm piggybacking off something Jordan pointed out, but I had to call out Young -- he was terrific Saturday. The stat line doesn't even tell the full story. Young was disruptive, and I love his length, power and burst. He shows really strong eye discipline, too. His game is consistent, and I think he's going to be really good in a pass rush rotation in the NFL. Right now, I see a third- or fourth-rounder, but Young keeps climbing the board, so don't be surprised if he ultimately goes even earlier. Miller: Arkansas' close loss to Memphis perfectly summarized the Taylen Green experience. The Razorback quarterback is a playmaker with a big arm and the running ability to go through or around defenders. Each week he's putting the team on his back and carrying the offense. But on Saturday, a late interception in the fourth quarter cost the team, before a fumble by running back Mike Washington Jr . while driving for a go-ahead field goal ultimately kept Arkansas from winning. Green showed the traits that scouts love while throwing for 325 yards and a touchdown pass and adding 53 yards as a runner, but his two interceptions on the day point to a prospect who is still growing. There was some QB1 rumblings about Green, and the tools are fun, but he has to clean up his decision-making before he's ready for that title. Kiper: Here's an FCS name to file away as a potential late-round pick next April -- Youngstown State wide receiver Max Tomczak . You might recognize that last name; Max is the nephew of Mike Tomczak, who played quarterback for Ohio State and then was a member of the 1985 Bears. Max was a walk-on at Youngstown State, and he put together three solid seasons before jumping out to a good start again in 2025. Through four games, Tomczak has 21 catches for 306 yards and a TD. The 6-foot, 195-pounder posted seven catches for 116 yards Saturday against Towson , and some of those grabs came in the fourth quarter when the Penguins needed them. Tomczak is a nuanced route runner, and he recognizes different coverages well. He adjusts on the ball in the air and then has the hands to secure it. And I see the versatility to play outside or inside -- and return punts. I'm hoping to see him at an all-star event against better competition after the season, but he's the type of player who will fight his way onto an NFL roster. Sept. 14 Has Carson Beck revived his draft stock at Miami? What are scouts saying about his status? Reid: Coming into last season, Beck was viewed as a potential first overall pick for 2025 -- but an inconsistent final year at Georgia created questions. He didn't declare for the draft, instead transferring to Miami, where he aimed to reestablish and revive his draft stock. play 0:13 Carson Beck to Joshua Moore for an 8-yard TD Carson Beck to Joshua Moore for an 8-yard TD Well, Beck has 812 passing yards, seven touchdown passes and two interceptions through three games, and his 89.9 QBR is fourth in the nation. He threw for 340 yards in Miami's win against South Florida on Saturday. Beck (6-foot-4, 220 pounds) looks comfortable in the team's adjusted offense (Miami ran more up-tempo, Air Raid-style last season) and has routinely stayed on-schedule and in rhythm -- sneaky good traits in his skill set. He entered the season with primarily Day 3 grades from scouts, and they are taking notice of his early-season play. He is certainly trending up. But evaluators aren't ready to put Beck back into that first-round conversation just yet. Most still consider him for the middle rounds. Has anything changed in the WR1 race through Week 3? Miller: Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson is still the front-runner. He's averaging 104.7 receiving yards per game this season (tied for 10th in the FBS) and has four TD catches, including one Saturday against Texas State. Tyson (6-foot-2, 200 pounds) had drop issues last year, but he has emerged as a more polished pass catcher (just one drop on 37 targets though three games). His deep-route-running ability and how well he separates over the top still has him as the top receiver in the class. However ... the WR1 race is very wide open, and Alabama's Germie Bernard is emerging in the mix. He has been the best thing about Alabama football so far this season. Scouts had him with a fringe Round 1-2 grade over the summer. But to me, he's right in the WR1 convo with Tyson and has a game very similar to Emeka Egbuka as a college receiver. At 6-foot-1 and 204 pounds, he is already a high-end route runner with good physicality and strength. Bernard had two scores in Saturday's blowout win over Wisconsin -- one on the ground and another through the air. What else are we seeing and hearing? Kiper: Right tackle Spencer Fano gets most of the recognition on Utah's offensive line, but left tackle Caleb Lomu deserves to be in the same conversation. He's a Round 1-caliber player despite 14 career starts. In the Utes' big win over Wyoming, he showed really strong footwork and technique. Lomu mirrors well, and he handles twists and stunts without much problem. And Lomu is strong as a run blocker; he can pull and get to the second level, though he needs to improve as a drive blocker. Keep an eye on both of these Utah tackles. Miller: Scouts were buzzing all week after Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer carved up the Michigan defense last Saturday . ""It's going to be very hard to not think Round 1 with him if he keeps this up,"" said an NFC West scout. The 6-foot-1, 224-pound Mateer, who transferred from Washington State, has another year of eligibility, but his red-hot start has his stock soaring in a QB class that does not yet have a lock on the top guy. We saw more classic Mateer Saturday against Temple, as he threw one touchdown pass and one interception while showing the arm angles and fun play in the pocket that makes him one of the most intriguing passers in the nation. play 0:34 John Mateer takes it 51 yards to the house for OU John Mateer takes it 51 yards to the end zone for the Sooners vs. the Owls. Miller: Mateer might be the hottest name among draft-eligible quarterbacks, but Fernando Mendoza is playing as well as anyone at the position. The Cal transfer has been at home in Curt Cignetti's offense at Indiana. Against Indiana State on Friday night , Mendoza went 19-for-20 with 270 yards and five touchdowns through the air and one on the ground. That's as close to flawless as you can get. Scouts I talked to over the summer were high on him after his junior season but wanted to see him cut down on turnovers. So far this season at Indiana, Mendoza (6-foot-5, 225 pounds) has done that, throwing nine touchdown passes and zero interceptions. I wouldn't be surprised to see him start getting attention from NFL scouts as a potential Round 1 player. Reid: After an injury-riddled 2024 season, Miami defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr . has been terrific in the early parts of 2025 -- and he is in the first-round picture. At 6-foot-3 and 275 pounds, he's a bit of a tweener, and I've heard mixed opinions on his position at the next level. There are some scouts who like him as a 3-4 defensive end, while others believe he could transition to 3-technique with added bulk. Regardless, Bain's combination of power and disruption makes him arguably one of the three best defensive linemen in a loaded class at the position. He has 1.5 sacks and 10 tackles over three games. Kiper: I wanted to call out Bain, too. I just love the way he plays the game. He is constantly hustling and never takes plays off. Bain is powerful, bends well, shows speed off the edge and knows how to use his hands to get leverage. He can generate pressure inside and outside; I really like his inside moves, and he displays a reliable rip move to beat blockers. Taking the right angle to the QB is a very underrated trait for an edge rusher, and Bain does that as well as anyone. And it's not just the pass rush. Bain can shed blockers and make run stops. He's really disruptive, and if he stays healthy this season, he has top-10 upside. Reid: When talking to scouts out on the road this week, Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese was repeatedly mentioned as someone making the jump to another level this season. At 6-foot-4 and 243 pounds, Reese is a rangy second-level defender who wears multiple hats in the Buckeyes' scheme. He serves as a strongside linebacker, but defensive coordinator Matt Patricia also deploys him as an edge rusher. With explosive playmaking traits, Reese has 16 tackles and two sacks over three games. If his current level of play continues through conference matchups, he could start receiving Round 1 chatter, too.

Miller: Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik had summer hype as a first-rounder, but NFL scouts are backpedaling faster than the cornerbacks he faces. One AFC East scout said: ""I think he's a Day 3 guy, and you saw why today. When his weapons were missing [including Antonio Williams ], he looked average. OK arm, OK processing speed. Way too overhyped."" Kiper: Yeah, I don't want to overreact, but the quarterback class overall has been disappointing. Remember in the lead-up to the 2025 draft when everyone kept saying teams should wait until 2026 for this great group of QBs? Remember when there was talk about six or seven passers primed for Round 1? (I even predicted six first-rounders myself a few weeks ago , before the CFB season started.) Well, nothing has materialized. No one is really playing up to the preseason hype. Mateer and Mendoza have been the most impressive passers so far, but the rest of the bunch have underwhelmed. Speaking of Mendoza, his next three games ( vs. Illinois , at Iowa and at Oregon ) will be telling. Reid: After missing the first two games of the season with a foot injury, Florida interior defender Caleb Banks made his season debut against LSU. But in the third quarter, Banks reaggravated the injury and was later seen on crutches and with a walking boot. The 6-foot-6, 330-pounder had significant buzz from NFL scouts over the summer, and some believed he had top-15 potential. His injury recovery is something to monitor moving forward. Sept. 7 Which prospect caught your eye in Michigan-Oklahoma ? Miller: The Michigan defense was supposed to be the star of the show, but I couldn't help but zero in on Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer . The Washington State transfer put the Sooners on his back with his strong right arm and mobility both inside and outside the pocket. Mateer rushed for 74 yards and a score, and he threw for another touchdown with 270 yards passing against a talented defense that features one of the country's best D-lines. Mateer (6-foot-1, 224 pounds) is a gunslinger, and he'll take a lot of chances with passes that will make you hold your breath -- but he also makes plays many other college QBs simply aren't making at this point in the season. Mateer's arm strength, mobility, moxie and playmaking mindset make for a great watch. NFL scouts had a conservative Day 3 grade on Mateer this summer, but I'm seeing a player with enough starter traits to put him inside my top 50. And if he continues to play this well against SEC defenses, a Round 1 grade isn't out of the question. play 0:31 John Mateer scores his 2nd rushing TD vs. Michigan John Mateer gets great blocking and keeps it to give Oklahoma a 21-7 lead. What have we learned about Arch Manning over two games? Reid: Expectations for Manning were sky high entering the season. But he never got into a rhythm against Ohio State in Week 1, which led to erratic accuracy, late reads and poor overall decision-making. Manning managed just 170 passing yards, one TD throw and an interception. He did have a much better performance in Week 2 against San Jose State -- 295 passing yards and four touchdown passes. There, Manning was more decisive, and the offense seemed to flow much better as a result. But he is very much still in the early stages of his first year as a starter. Where Manning has been the most disappointing is his mechanics. His body hasn't been in sync with his throwing motion, causing him inaccuracy on what should be routine throws. To really hit the next level, he needs to iron that out. As I've said since the summer, I still believe the earliest we'll see Manning in the NFL is 2027. Which potential first-round QB most needs a quick turnaround after a slow start to 2025? Miller: LaNorris Sellers , QB, South Carolina. Let me start by saying I'm a Sellers fan. He's my No. 1-ranked quarterback for the 2026 draft based on his potential and talent. That said, he has to be cleaner as a passer than he was on Saturday against South Carolina State . He was just 11-of-19 in a vanilla game plan. Much like we saw in the season opener against Virginia Tech , Sellers can overwhelm opponents with his mobility and arm talent, but he is still taking shots as a passer that are just too risky -- which lead to incompletions and turnover-worthy plays. He is completing 60.5% of his passes right now, and he has been off-target 10.5% of the time. Sellers (6-foot-3, 240 pounds) is incredibly talented, but he has to become a better on-target passer, especially in the pocket, and improve his on-time rhythm to take that next step as a prospect. He's still holding firm as my QB1, but there are holes in his game that I'll be watching this season. Reid: Cade Klubnik , Clemson. Coming into the season, I was high on Klubnik as he showed a huge bump in his development throughout 2024. Based on the personnel and infrastructure in place at Clemson, there wasn't a QB in the country who was better set up to succeed this year. But after watching him live against LSU last week, I see issues when he faces pressure. He was also indecisive and took too long to make decisions within the framework of the offense. Those concerns popped up again this weekend against Troy . In talking to scouts around the league, Klubnik (6-foot-2, 210 pounds) is polarizing as a prospect because he has a lot of solid/average traits but lacks a dominant one. You need that one superior skill to catapult to the front of this QB class, and it's why his draft grades are all over the place with NFL evaluators. play 0:25 Cade Klubnik airs it out for 26-yard touchdown pass Cade Klubnik connects for 26-yard TD pass Which player is already rising your draft board based on his play so far -- and how high could he go? Reid: Mansoor Delane , CB, LSU. No other draft-eligible prospect impressed me more during my Week 1 scouting trip than Delane. One of the biggest transfer portal additions in the country across any position, he has been excellent through two weeks since arriving in Baton Rouge from Virginia Tech. At 6-foot and 190 pounds, Delane is a smooth-moving corner with the ability to mirror-and-match the movements of opponent receivers. His ball skills have also been exceptional to start the season, with two pass breakups and an interception. Delane has the savviness and awareness to find the ball and make plays on it in the air. His technique is always relaxed, too, and he hardly ever allows wide receivers to speed up his process while sticking in coverage with them. And Delane has not only been consistent in man coverage; his zone instincts have shined as well. Because of the spring injury to Tennessee's Jermod McCoy , the CB1 race is wide open. Delane has strengthened his case through the early portions of the season and currently projects as a top-50 pick. Miller: Fernando Mendoza , QB, Indiana. There was a good amount of summer hype and excitement surrounding Mendoza after he transferred into the wide-open Indiana passing game from Cal. And so far, the hype has been warranted. Mendoza hasn't faced a quality opponent yet, but it's obvious his traits are next-level. Against Kennesaw State , Mendoza was 18-of-25 for 245 yards and four touchdown passes -- the type of numbers you expect a top-tier prospect to put up against a lower-level opponent. He's showing great command of the offense while building chemistry with senior wide receiver Elijah Sarratt (who had three scores on Saturday). Mendoza's ability to layer the ball on deep throws stands out. And in a quarterback class where we're very much waiting for someone to emerge, his showing through two weeks -- even against not great competition -- has been notable. Mendoza's arm talent, size (6-foot-5, 225 pounds) and what he adds to the game as a runner could put him into the QB1 derby we're seeing play out every Saturday. What else are you seeing and hearing? Kiper: I have been impressed with Oregon quarterback Dante Moore . He was a big recruit out of high school but struggled in Year 1 at UCLA and then sat behind Dillon Gabriel in Year 2 after transferring. Now he's taking full advantage of this Will Stein offense in Eugene. Yes, the Ducks have only faced Montana State and Oklahoma State -- two teams they should handle most of the time -- but Moore is playing at a high level. The 6-foot-3, 206-pounder showed great accuracy on Saturday against the Cowboys . The touch on his deep balls was fantastic, and he routinely threw with precision from different arm angles and while rolling either direction. Moore has thrown for at least 200 yards, completed at least 75% of his throws and tossed at least three TD passes in both contests -- and he hasn't thrown any INTs yet. Now, the schedule is going to get tougher. I have Moore's trip to Penn State circled for late September. How will he handle a ""white out"" environment? But if Moore keeps playing like this, Round 1 will be in play. Miller: During summer evaluations of the 2026 class, Ohio State safety Caleb Downs emerged as one of my favorite players to study now that he's finally draft-eligible after two All-American seasons to start his college career. Downs ranks as my No. 1 safety and a top-five player overall. But that sentiment wasn't shared by scouts I spoke with before the season. ""He's a liability in man coverage. He might be a [weakside linebacker] in the NFL with how often he plays in the box,"" said an AFC East area scout. The issue with that idea is that Downs is listed by Ohio State at 6-foot and 205 pounds, hardly linebacker size by today's standards. In my view, Downs is a Kyle Hamilton -esque defender, and his play against Texas highlighted his versatility. Kiper: Jordan touched on this, but I still think Manning goes back to school. He needs to become a great college quarterback before he can become a great NFL quarterback, and he hasn't gotten there yet. The potential is here, for sure. But one full year as a CFB starter isn't going to be enough to reach that next level before jumping to the pros. I wouldn't put him on mock drafts or even rankings right now. Kiper: Kevin Coleman Jr . has perfectly filled the Luther Burden III void in the Missouri offense. The 5-foot-11, 180-pound slot receiver has been all over the place. He was at Jackson State in 2022. Then Louisville in 2023. Then Mississippi State in 2024. Now he's on to Missouri. And the production has been good so far, including 10 catches for 126 yards and a touchdown against Kansas on Saturday. Coleman displays the quick burst to separate underneath, and he can tag on extra yards after the catch. His body control is impressive, and he snags the ball in stride. And I really like how quickly Coleman reads zone coverage and finds openings. Toss in some punt return ability, and I see a potential Day 2 prospect. Reid: One player who has NFL scouts already buzzing is Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq . They specifically call out his ability as a blocker at 6-foot-3, 245 pounds. ""He's an absolute weapon as a run blocker that tries to put guys in the dirt whenever he gets hands on them,"" an AFC area scout said. Sadiq came into the season as my TE1, and he looks like one of the most consistent prospects in the country so far, regardless of position. Sadiq received Round 1 buzz coming into the year, and if his level of play continues, he could be a top-20 pick. Miller: Ohio State offensive lineman Ethan Onianwa -- a highly regarded transfer from Rice with top-75 grades from NFL scouts -- did not start against Texas and played just 13 snaps after he eventually rotated into the game at right guard. The 6-foot-6, 333-pound senior had high expectations this season, but the early word from sources with the Buckeyes is he has struggled to pick up the offense. Kiper: The Clemson defensive line is loaded, with the likes of T.J. Parker and Peter Woods . But how about Will Heldt ? He's leading the Tigers with two sacks so far, and he looked great against Troy this weekend. The Purdue transfer has good length, the ability to get pressure both inside or outside and solid closing speed. Heldt mixes up his pass-rush moves to get home, but don't sleep on his ability to get off blocks and pursue laterally, and even drop in coverage. Dabo Swinney doesn't typically use the transfer portal, but landing Heldt this year was a big win. The 6-foot-5, 260-pound edge rusher is playing like a first-rounder. Miller: Baylor quarterback Sawyer Robertson is worth keeping an eye on as an emerging talent in the 2026 draft class. An AFC South area scout texted me on Saturday: ""Robertson is the real deal. He's got it all."" The 6-foot-4, 220-pound senior was phenomenal in a shootout with SMU on Saturday, throwing four touchdown passes and completing 34 of 50 passes for 440 yards in a double-overtime win. Kiper: The Ole Miss defense lost a lot of talent this year, including Walter Nolen III . But defensive tackle Zxavian Harris (6-foot-7, 320 pounds) has been huge for the Rebels, with his second sack in as many games on Saturday against Kentucky . Harris moves well for his size, especially laterally, and he makes his presence felt against both the run and the pass. He still needs refinement as a pass rusher, but defensive coordinators can move him around to get advantages. His draft stock is still TBD -- I need to see more. Kiper: Tanner Koziol left Ball State for Houston before this season, and he has been outstanding. The early Day 3 prospect still has to improve his blocking, but he's a dangerous pass catcher. Koziol is basically a receiver in a tight end's body (6-foot-6, 250 pounds). He already has 13 catches on the season, including six for 52 yards on Saturday against Rice .",https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2026/story/_/id/45531306/2026-nfl-draft-notebook-questions-latest-updates-risers-cfb-prospects,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559191_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,443bcb68ef057740cfd4115b6e7f45cfa2f1a50d
5c3fe7e834af,NFL,,"LONDON -- As the Denver Broncos closed out their 13-11 win over the New York Jets , coach Sean Payton could see clearly how they got it done. Despite a résumé full of record-setting NFL offenses, Payton suddenly finds himself with a defensive powerhouse that pushed, pulled and thumped to an odd victory over the Jets on Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Denver gave up only 82 yards and no touchdowns to New York. The win moved the Broncos to 4-2 on the season. Payton was asked after the game whether he thinks his team has a defensive personality. He said, ""Well, it was a defensive team [Sunday], and I hope it's a defensive team all season. In order to win, I think that's extremely necessary in our league. And, man, they were something."" Denver finished with nine sacks, the second-highest total in a game in franchise history and the most the Broncos have had in a game since 1996. Eight Denver players had at least a half sack, and outside linebacker Nik Bonitto got his eighth sack of the season. The Broncos now have 30 total over six games. ""It was honestly pretty crazy,"" Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II said. ""We're covering and it's one or two seconds, I look up, and there's a sack."" New York quarterback Justin Fields finished 9-of-17 for 45 yards. And the Jets' minus-10 net passing yards were the fewest by an opponent in Broncos history, breaking a record of minus-7 net set in 1971 (vs. Chicago Bears ). ""I was pretty shocked when they told us after the game,"" Bonitto said. ""That's pretty funny."" Yet, when the third quarter ended, the Broncos' struggles on offense and special teams left them trailing 11-10. They had fumbled on their first offensive series. They surrendered a 72-yard kickoff return. They had a holding penalty in the end zone for a safety. And after their only touchdown of the game in the first quarter, they ventured inside the Jets' 40-yard line just once. But the swarming pass rush -- bolstered by a versatile and physical secondary, with Surtain as the hub of the coverage wheel -- took control. And it certainly had Payton's attention in a season where the Broncos have already been in five one-score games. The Broncos have already dealt with two walk-off losses -- to the Indianapolis Colts (Week 2) and Los Angeles Chargers (Week 3). ""Did I want this to be a one-score game? No, but it was,"" Payton said. ""So, fortunately, we've been able to go with what maybe last year was an Achilles' heel. ... You just hope to get through it. You're disappointed you're in a dogfight like that, but you're in it, and you've got to figure it out."" The Jets scored field goals on their first two possessions. Broncos wide receiver Troy Franklin fumbled at Denver's 37-yard line, leading to one. Then they allowed a 72-yard kickoff return to Kene Nwangwu , giving New York the ball at the Broncos' 24-yard line for another. But the Jets still didn't run a play inside the Broncos' 20 on either of those two drives, and the defense made its statement for the day. Roughly three hours later, the Broncos closed the deal much the same way. The Jets had a first-and-10 at the Denver 46 with 1:56 to play, but the Broncos' defense forced an incompletion and had two sacks on the next four plays -- including a sack split by outside linebacker Jonathon Cooper and safety Brandon Jones on fourth-and-8. play 0:35 Broncos defense comes up with game-sealing sack Jonathon Cooper and Brandon Jones get to Justin Fields to seal the game for the Broncos. The Broncos have given up only 31 points in the past three games combined, and they have now had three games this season in which they've allowed 106 net passing yards or less. They are also first in the NFL in defensive EPA. As a result, the Broncos have their best start in any of Payton's three seasons with the team. Denver has three of its next four games against teams that were in the bottom half of the league in offense heading into this weekend's games: the New York Giants ( next Sunday ), the Houston Texans ( Nov. 1 ) and Las Vegas Raiders ( Nov. 6 ). ""It's almost impossible what they did,"" Broncos quarterback Bo Nix said. ""It was impressive. ... They'd be a fun defense to watch, probably an awful defense to play against.

4822636597cd,Patriots win third straight thanks to Kayshon Boutte's big day,,"NEW ORLEANS -- When wide receiver Stefon Diggs made his way to the locker room after the New England Patriots ' 25-19 win against the New Orleans Saints , he clapped his hands and noted the roll the team is on by saying, ""That's three in a row!"" Then, before boarding the team bus, Diggs was one of the last remaining players in the locker room and already looking ahead to Sunday's road game against the Tennessee Titans . ""We'll enjoy this for 12 hours and then we have a big one next week,"" Diggs said. Why so big? ""People are going home, I guess,"" he said with a touch of humor. Diggs' reference to coach Mike Vrabel bringing the Patriots (4-2) to Tennessee, where he served as head coach from 2018 to 2023, highlights what will be a top storyline in the days to come. The ""homecoming"" theme has been prevalent for the surging Patriots in recent weeks, as this marks the first time the team has won three in a row since 2022. In a Week 5 win against the Buffalo Bills , it was Diggs' return to Western New York -- and his stellar performance in a prime-time upset -- that generated headlines. And in Sunday's road victory over the Saints, it was Louisiana-born and former Louisiana State receiver Kayshon Boutte rising up with a clutch performance that included a team-high five catches for 93 yards and 2 touchdowns (deep shots of 25 and 29 yards). Boutte became the first Patriots player to score multiple touchdowns of 25 or more yards in a game since Phillip Dorsett II in 2019. ""Something about going home, I think guys feel comfortable back at the crib,"" Diggs said. The Patriots won despite a performance that included ""a lot to clean up,"" according to Vrabel. A lack of running game (73 yards on 31 attempts), 11 penalties and shaky pass defense at times were among the primary struggles. But when they needed a play to close it out, Boutte delivered. He capped off his day by making a 21-yard catch from quarterback Drake Maye on third-and-11 before the two-minute warning, which allowed the Patriots to kneel on the ball for the win. It was a contested catch on an out route that he converted to a fade. Saints cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry was glued to his hip, and Boutte turned to haul in the back-shoulder throw along the left sideline and he landed in bounds with a thud. ""What a play by Boutte,"" said Maye, who finished 18-of-26 for 261 yards with three touchdowns and a 92.6 QBR. ""It felt right being back home for him."" The 5-foot-11, 197-pound Boutte, who joined starting left tackle and fellow Louisiana native Will Campbell in returning home, had 40 family members and friends at the game for whom he purchased tickets. He called it an ""emotional day"" and ""full-circle moment"" while noting the twists and turns of his career -- going from a once-highly touted prospect to sixth-round pick whose NFL career hit a crossroads this past spring before it took off under Vrabel and receivers coach Todd Downing. ""Three, four years ago I wasn't in the best position. I think a lot of off-the-field stuff. I look at myself like I've been through a lot. I feel like I'm finally getting back together and everything is coming good. I feel like it's good to beat the adversity and keep working,"" Boutte said. The work continues in Week 7 with a trip to Tennessee to face the Titans (1-5), with the spotlight on Vrabel and his team who is 3-0 on the road this season. ""We know Vrabes has been there and everything like that, but he's here now,"" Patriots cornerback Marcus Jones said. ""So we're going to try to take advantage of the opportunity we have and try to go 1-0 next week.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46576555/new-england-patriots-win-third-straight-thanks-kayshon-boutte-big-day,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559387_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,ebcb5e4fe8fa7303e1347b89b9eecdede75bb3dc
708efc47a1cd,What the trenches - more than QB play - say about the top championship contenders this season,,"This season belongs to the trenches. It's what my eyes have been seeing and Week 7 of college football confirmed. The best teams in the country aren't quarterback-driven. They are line-driven. I thought rushing success was the common thread, but it's really trench superiority -- elite run blocking, relentless pass rushing and coverage units that erase passing windows. That's the true power curve of 2025. To me, these are the current top teams: Ohio State , Indiana , Texas Tech , Miami and Texas A&M . One team that is ranked up top that I don't agree with? Alabama -- which is no surprise if you've been following my work. Every one of these teams besides Bama grades top 20 nationally in run defense and pass rush, and four of them sit top 15 in run blocking. It's no coincidence that five of those six are undefeated. The separation isn't coming from quarterback play, it's coming from line integrity. Line play is the new quarterback Let's start with Indiana. The Hoosiers have allowed just one red-zone touchdown all season, on six opponent trips. That's absurd. Their defense ranks top 10 in run defense, pass rush and coverage, while their offensive line ranks second in the country in run blocking. Fernando Mendoza 's 17 touchdowns and 71% completion look great, but Indiana's real edge is how rarely it loses the line. Ohio State's blueprint is similar. The Buckeyes have faced 11 red-zone possessions and allowed just two touchdowns. Their defense is top 15 across run defense, tackling and coverage, and their offensive line sits top 10 in pass blocking. Julian Sayin is thriving because the foundation is so stable. Texas Tech is my favorite team right now; top-ranked run defense, No. 1 pass rush, No. 3 coverage and a top-40 offensive line. Behren Morton left Week 7 with an injury and the rhythm dipped, but after halftime Tech leaned on the run, with Cameron Dickey rushing for 263 yards. Talk about powering up. That was a line-of-scrimmage win for the Red Raiders. Miami is close behind. Dominant up front (No. 2 run defense, No. 3 pass rush) but shaky inside the 20s. Alabama and A&M? Talented, sure, but flawed. Alabama ranks 113th in pass rush, and A&M is among the worst tackling units. The difference between ""playoff lock"" and ""top-15 team"" is trench drop-off. Why the Heisman feels lost The Heisman race feels disoriented because this isn't a year of statistical heroes but rather a year of five-man walls and seven-man fronts. The favorites right now are all quarterbacks: Carson Beck (+350), Ty Simpson (+400), Fernando Mendoza (+500) and Julian Sayin (+1600). Yet, none of them are leading their teams in impact. Beck is 46th nationally in passing grade, and his defense ranks top three in run defense and pass rush. Simpson has Alabama at 5-1, but his offense ranks in the bottom third in run blocking and his defense is average by Alabama standards. Mendoza might be the only one who has truly earned his spot on the board, but even his candidacy is propped up by an elite defense. The problem isn't the players, it's the award. The Heisman still rewards production in a season defined by prevention. The best players in the country this year don't touch the ball. The best players right now are the ones who pressure it, protect it or eliminate it entirely. The betting angle: What the market is missing Vegas is halfway there. The national championship odds reflect what's really happening: Ohio State +350 (6-0 ATS) Alabama +650 (4-1-1 ATS) Miami +750 (4-1 ATS) Indiana +900 (4-2 ATS) Texas Tech +1600 (6-0 ATS) The betting market is telling the same story. The best trench teams are the ones covering spreads. The teams that win the line of scrimmage are the ones beating the number. Yet, the Heisman board is still chasing quarterback metrics from a different era. If you're betting, the edge is simple: look at who wins in the middle. Game totals: I had a stellar Week 7 hitting the unders. When trench teams meet, totals are the value play. Indiana, Miami and Ohio State are a combined 7-10 to the under because their defenses kill drives early. Opponent team totals are worth targeting, along with opposing player prop unders.

Make Your Picks I say market inefficiency because the books are still pricing ""explosive passing"" as the defining edge, but this year it's front-seven dominance that drives outcomes. The market hasn't caught up yet. It will. Futures: If you're holding Alabama or A&M national title tickets, you're paying for the brand, not the numbers. Eventually the math will catch up. Right now, Indiana, Ohio State and Texas Tech are the teams best equipped to win it all. They own the line of scrimmage, and that's been the truest predictor of playoff football this season. The irony is that the storylines we keep chasing: Heisman odds, passing yards, etc. are all distractions from what actually decides games. The numbers have already told us that the teams built on the line are the ones that last into December. If you want to find this year's champion, stop watching who's throwing touchdowns and start watching who's preventing them.",https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/46572557/college-football-betting-week-7-takeaways-odds-cfp-championship-contenders,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559181_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,771b2fe3900c234f61c6813a4544501e05506ae8
049620b695b4,MLB,,"Oct 11, 2025, 10:50 PM ET The 2025 MLB playoffs are here -- and for some teams, October has lasted a lot longer than it has for others. Starting with the wild-card round, the Cincinnati Reds became the first team eliminated from postseason contention -- on the very first day of the month, no less. They were followed the next day by the Cleveland Guardians and, ultimately, the San Diego Padres and Boston Red Sox . In the division series, the New York Yankees were first to go, followed by the Philadelphia Phillies , Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs . What's next for the teams and towns that won't be celebrating a World Series parade this fall? As each contender is eliminated, ESPN MLB experts Bradford Doolittle, Alden Gonzalez and David Schoenfield will list that club's key free agents and biggest offseason questions and make their predictions for the long, cold winter ahead. Teams eliminated in division series Eliminated by: Brewers Key free agents: OF Kyle Tucker , IF/OF Willi Castro , RHP Brad Keller , LHP Caleb Thielbar , RHP Ryan Brasier , LHP Drew Pomeranz , 1B Carlos Santana , LHP Shota Imanaga (club/player option), RHP Andrew Kittredge (club option), 1B Justin Turner (mutual option), LHP Taylor Rogers , RHP Colin Rea (club option), RHP Michael Soroka Biggest offseason priority: Re-sign Tucker. The Cubs have a long list of free agents and possible free agents, but let's face it, Tucker is the one who matters most. When Tucker was healthy and rolling early in the season, he was a viable MVP candidate and a catalyst in a dynamic, varied offense. In other words, he was exactly what the Cubs hoped he'd be when they traded a considerable group of players and controllable seasons ( Isaac Paredes , Cam Smith and Hayden Wesneski ) to get him. Tucker's contract should have been extended already, but now anything can happen. It would be eye-opening if one of baseball's flagship teams and revenue producers couldn't spend its way to keeping a player like this. Otherwise, Cubs fans everywhere will have nightmares of Smith and Paredes crushing homer after homer into the Crawford Boxes in Houston. Can the Cubs fashion a championship-caliber bullpen? For a couple of years, the Cubs have iterated their bullpen to mixed results. There have been successes -- the emergence of Daniel Palencia , the reinvention of Brad Keller , and the depth hasn't been bad. But Chicago hasn't pinned down that core duo or trio of late-inning relievers who anchor the bullpens of baseball's best teams. The answer here isn't necessarily a high-level free agent or an expensive trade, but it can be with the right assessments. The Cubs ranked in the middle of the pack in every relief pitching metric, including strikeout percentage, and until they crack that nut, it limits Chicago's ceiling. Offseason prediction: Tucker will sign a massive, long-term deal to hold down right field and anchor the lineup ... of a team that doesn't play on the North Side of Chicago. Call me a pessimist, and this is more of a hunch than anything. Financially, the Cubs should be in position in terms of revenue profile and payroll outlook to get a deal done. But until they prove otherwise, the Cubs have a track record of not going all the way to the top in free agency. -- Doolittle Eliminated by: Mariners Key free agents: RHP Jack Flaherty (player option), RHP Jose Urquidy (club option), RHP Paul Sewald (mutual option), RHP Alex Cobb , 2B Gleyber Torres , RHP Rafael Montero , RHP Tommy Kahnle , RHP Chris Paddack , RHP Kyle Finnegan Biggest offseason priority: Restocking the rotation. The Tigers have a tremendous foundation in ace Tarik Skubal and midrotation standout Casey Mize . But with health concerns surrounding the likes of Ty Madden , Jackson Jobe and Reese Olson , the Tigers will need more. Most of the top-ranked prospects in a talented system are on the position player side, which will allow GM Scott Harris to target the pitching side this offseason, though you can always talk yourself into a splurge on a middle-of-the-lineup hitter. The Tigers' focus on building out their depth with veterans on short-duration contracts gives the club all kinds of flexibility this winter. Signings. Trades. It's all on the table for an organization just a move or two away from becoming an American League front-runner by the time next season begins. How can the Tigers diversify their offense? Detroit's offense was above-average this season but it was uneven stylistically in ways that might have contributed to its demise in the postseason. Strikeouts are a big problem. Against Cleveland, the lineup stalled as the Tigers had so much trouble simply making contact with runners in scoring position, much less bringing those runners home. The offense was even worse against Seattle. The Tigers laid down five sacrifice bunts all season and finished last with 61 stolen bases. Detroit has two ideal solutions for this problem at the top of its prospects list in infielder Kevin McGonigle and outfielder Max Clark. The question the Tigers have to answer in the short term is how soon these young stars -- who both topped out in Double-A this season -- will arrive in Detroit ready to boost a contending team. Whatever the answer, the Tigers are an organization ideally positioned to contend in the short and the long term. Offseason prediction: The Tigers will go hard after multiple free agent starters -- think Framber Valdez and Dylan Cease -- in free agency. The time to make a splash has arrived. -- Doolittle Eliminated by: Dodgers Key free agents: C J.T. Realmuto , DH Kyle Schwarber , OF Max Kepler , LHP Ranger Suarez , RHP Jordan Romano Biggest offseason priority: Replacing the free agents. The Phillies aren't going to enter into a soft rebuild, a hard rebuild or any kind of rebuild. The Phils have a star-studded group of free agents, but assuming the payroll remains in the same neighborhood -- a luxury neighborhood at that -- it's safe to say the Phillies will remain a top-heavy team with expensive stars. It just might not be the same group of stars. The future in Philly Impending free agents, aging stars and an injured ace: How much longer can the Phillies keep contending? David Schoenfield » At the same time, ""replacing"" a couple of the free agents by bringing them back has to be considered, especially in the case of Realmuto, given the lack of impact-quality depth at that position across the majors. But that also means the Phillies will have plenty of competition to retain him. And, oh yeah, the DH coming off a 56-homer season? The Phillies will be part of a crowded market for Schwarber as well. How long can this model be sustained? Dave Dombrowski's teams have generally been contenders, and even champions. They've also tended to get expensive, and he has tended to move on when the team hits a plateau. Are the Phillies at that stage? The 2025 club had nine players earning eight digits, and seven of them made $20 million or more. Given the list of free agents and the uncertainty over what version of Zack Wheeler the Phillies get when he returns from his shoulder injury, you can't help but wonder if the Phils' window is ever so slightly beginning to close. Offseason prediction: Realmuto stays, Schwarber goes, and the Phillies land two star free agents from other teams. -- Doolittle Eliminated by: Blue Jays Key free agents: 1B Paul Goldschmidt , CF Trent Grisham , RHP Luke Weaver , RHP Devin Williams , OF/1B Cody Bellinger ($25 million player option) Biggest offseason priority: With Bellinger almost certain to opt out after an under-the-radar 29-homer, 5-WAR season, and Grisham coming off a shocking 34-homer season, the Yankees will have not only two big hitters to replace but a hole in center field. Jasson Dominguez is not the answer there given his poor defensive metrics in left field, so there might be pressure to re-sign either Bellinger or Grisham, with Bellinger the more desirable player given that Grisham had hit under .200 in the three previous seasons. Bellinger's ability to play first base is a big plus, although Ben Rice will likely take over there on a full-time basis. Outside of Kyle Tucker , the rest of the outfield free agent class is pretty thin, however, so the Yankees will have competition for Bellinger's services. Another wasted year of Aaron Judge Will the captain end up the greatest Yankee never to win a World Series -- or can the Bombers build a championship team around him? Jorge Castillo » The other option is to hand center field to Spencer Jones , the 6-foot-7 slugger who hit 35 home runs between Double-A and Triple-A. Although he also struck out 179 times in 116 games, he leaves a lot of questions as to how the bat will translate to the majors. Despite his size, he's a good athlete (he also swiped 29 bases) with the instincts to remain in center field. The Yankees have finished seventh in the AL in runs allowed three seasons in a row. How can they improve that figure in 2026? Well, they played all of 2025 without ace Gerrit Cole after his spring training Tommy John surgery, so getting him back will help. Luis Gil , coming off his Rookie of the Year season, didn't make his first start until August. Cam Schlittler started the year in Double-A and ended it with a 2.96 ERA in 14 starts in the majors, living off 98 mph heat. Max Fried and Carlos Rodon will be back after winning 37 games, and while Clarke Schmidt had TJ surgery, Will Warren adds even more depth. The Yankees might project as the best rotation in the AL. The bullpen obviously didn't have its best season, but the reinforcements Brian Cashman made at the trade deadline -- David Bednar , Camilo Doval , Jake Bird -- will help the depth in 2026. Still, you could see a move here, maybe re-signing Weaver, who has been a durable, valuable arm the past two years. Offseason prediction: With most of the roster set, it shapes up as one of the least active Yankees offseasons in years. While last year the prediction was re-signing Juan Soto (a swing and a miss), let's go with re-signing Bellinger while working Jones into the lineup. With Marcus Stroman and Aaron Hicks (yes, they were still paying him) coming off the books, that's $28 million in savings. Goldschmidt made $12.5 million in 2025. DJ LeMahieu has just one year left on his bad contract. The pitching is in good shape. Jose Caballero gives them an excellent utility player who can play anywhere. Yes, it was another bitter ending for Yankees fans, and 2009 looks like a very long time ago, but the Yankees will enter 2026 among the clear favorites in the AL, especially if Cole can return to where he was before the injury. -- Schoenfield Teams eliminated in wild-card series Eliminate d by: Dodgers Key free agents: RHP Nick Martinez , RHP Emilio Pagan Biggest offseason priority: Flipping their home run differential. The Reds badly need middle-of-the-order power, the kind that will better align their lineup with the long-ball-friendly vagaries of Great American Ballpark. The Reds gave up 25 more homers than they hit in 2025, postseason included, the fifth-worst differential in the majors. That differential was minus-18 at home. The Reds have the pitching they need to win the NL Central, but they need a major uptick in firepower to support the arms. With Martinez's salary coming off the books, Cincinnati has a wide-open payroll, which -- one would think -- means lots of flexibility, whether it's a free agency splurge or a high-impact trade. Is it time to really unleash this rotation? The Reds have collected quite a collection of high-upside young pitchers. Some of them have established themselves in the majors -- Hunter Greene , Nick Lodolo , Andrew Abbott . Abbott had a career season in 2025, but Greene still hasn't paired his dominance with season-long durability. Lodolo produced 28 mostly excellent starts but has plenty of room to grow in his innings count. Then you have Chase Petty , Chase Burns and Rhett Lowder , along with the veteran stability of Brady Singer . The ideal for 2026 would be for manager Terry Francona to push this group of seven for a full season and perhaps lighten up a bit on the innings management side of the equation. This has the potential to be among MLB's best rotations. Offseason prediction: The Reds will get aggressive. No, they won't go wild, of course, but besides having a contention-worthy rotation and a star in Elly De La Cruz who is edging toward his prime, they have a 66-year-old future Hall of Fame manager in Francona who isn't going to be around forever. -- Doolittle Eliminated by: Tigers Key free agents: OF Lane Thomas , C Austin Hedges , RHP Jakob Junis Biggest offseason priority: The term ""Guards Ball"" caught on during Cleveland's unlikely second-half run. It was fun to watch and even inspiring. It's also not generally how championships are won in baseball these days. The Guardians need more firepower on offense, and while there are a lot of promising bats in the system, maybe for once the team will splurge on a middle-of-the-order anchor? Yeah, that's probably wishful thinking. What will Cleveland get from its young hitters? It's not hard to imagine some of the Guardians we saw on the playoff roster getting better -- Kyle Manzardo , CJ Kayfus , Johnathan Rodriguez , Jhonkensy Noel . It's not hard to see Chase DeLauter becoming an AL Rookie of the Year favorite. Given his numbers at Triple-A, it's a little harder to see Travis Bazzana being part of the Opening Day mix, but it's not difficult to envision him making a leap during the 2026 season. The crucial question the Guardians have to answer is: What will this group do to lift the offensive profile of a lineup led by Jose Ramirez and Steven Kwan ? The Guardians won a division title despite scoring more runs than just two other teams. That's not a sustainable formula. Offseason prediction: The Guardians, with prospects on the way and the roster full of players under team control, won't do much in the offseason. They certainly can afford to with so little future guaranteed funds tied up -- a big pillow contract to someone like Ohio native Kyle Schwarber would be amazing -- but it's not likely. So, take heart, Cleveland fans, and enjoy the Guardians' still-spewing fountain of youth. -- Doolittle Eliminated by: Cubs Key free agents: 1B/2B Luis Arraez , SP Dylan Cease , SP Michael King ($15M mutual option), CL Robert Suarez ($8M player option), 1B Ryan O'Hearn , OF Ramon Laureano ($6.5M club option), INF Jose Iglesias , RP Wandy Peralta ($4.45M player option), C Elias Diaz ($7M mutual option), SP Nestor Cortes One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » Biggest offseason priority: Cease and King will venture into free agency, and the Padres will have to replace them in the rotation. San Diego will have Joe Musgrove back in 2026, but he'll be coming off Tommy John surgery. Yu Darvish will still be there, but he'll be in his age-39 season, having accumulated fewer than 100 innings each of the past two years. The depth beyond them, outside of Nick Pivetta , is suspect. First base will also be a priority unless the team brings Arraez back. Will they spend again? The Padres lost their local-television contract in 2023, then missed out on the playoffs despite fielding arguably the most talented team in franchise history. Shortly thereafter, Peter Seidler, their beloved, free-spending owner, died. The Padres dropped the payroll by roughly 30% the following year. A 25% increase followed in 2025, putting them at roughly $215 million. Where will they go in 2026? It's hard to say. But Manny Machado 's salary will keep increasing -- from $13 million in 2025 to $21 million in 2026 and $35 million thereafter. If they want to keep surrounding him with talent as he ages, they'll have to keep spending. Offseason prediction: The Padres will pay six players -- Xander Bogaerts , Fernando Tatis Jr ., Darvish, Musgrove, Machado and Pivetta -- a combined $120 million in 2026. The team's success will come down to the production of those players -- along with Jackson Merrill and Mason Miller , who are still not in their prime earning years. But A.J. Preller will look for ways to acquire a front-line starting pitcher and will get creative if he has to. Last offseason, he landed Pivetta on a deal that paid him only $4 million in 2025. This offseason, that front-line starter might have to come via trade. -- Gonzalez Eliminated by: Yankees Key free agents: 3B Alex Bregman (opt-out), RHP Lucas Giolito ($19 million mutual option), OF Rob Refsnyder , RHP Dustin May , LHP Steven Matz Biggest offseason priority: Re-signing Bregman if he opts out ... and improving the starting pitching depth. Bregman had a solid season, hitting .273/.360/.462 around an injury, but aside from the numbers he also brings fire and leadership to the team. It's also possible Bregman will opt back in at $40 million per season (for 2026 and 2027), but he had a good enough season that he'll probably opt out. Yes, Marcelo Mayer is a possible replacement -- especially if the Red Sox direct that money instead to the pitching staff. Giolito had a solid season as a low-volume starter in his return from Tommy John surgery, so there could be mutual interest there on a longer deal. But outside of Garrett Crochet , Brayan Bello and perhaps rookie Connelly Early , who looked good in four late-season starts, the projected rotation is unsettled. Will the Red Sox trade any of their outfielders/young players? It's still a crowded outfield picture with Roman Anthony , Jarren Duran , Ceddanne Rafaela and Wilyer Abreu (plus Masataka Yoshida , signed for two more years, as a DH option). It played itself out this season as Abreu and Anthony both missed time with injuries, while Rafaela played some infield. But Rafaela is such a wizard in center field, you'd like to keep him there. Throw in Mayer and Kristian Campbell , and the Red Sox have a deep group of young players who could be used to acquire pitching help. Craig Breslow refrained from trading anyone at the deadline, but let's see what he does this offseason. Offseason prediction: I think the Red Sox will play it safe and bring back a similar roster, starting with re-signing Bregman. They could then slide Mayer to second base. That still would leave four outfielders plus Campbell, who started the season with a lot of helium after making the Opening Day roster, but his defense at second wasn't good, and he didn't rip up Triple-A after getting sent down. If anyone is the odd man out, it's probably him, so he's the one most likely to get traded. Bringing back Giolito -- assuming he's healthy after missing the postseason with an elbow injury -- also makes sense, as he wouldn't break the bank but would fill a need. If he's deemed too risky, a veteran such as Merrill Kelly or, if the Red Sox want to spend bigger, Framber Valdez or Shane Bieber , makes sense. -- Schoenfield",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46367410/mlb-playoffs-2025-offseason-eliminated-teams-questions,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1558977_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,af2f7809f6be1f4041058af9ab7a0a5d8c81394b
41303e99141d,"After MLB playoff exit, how long can Phillies keep contending?",,"A baseball team's season doesn't really come down to one play, or two plays, but if you're a loyal fan of the Philadelphia Phillies , the final play of the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers will live in your nightmares for a long time. Orion Kerkering 's throwing error, leading to the Phillies' elimination in Game 4 of the NLDS , is another addition to the list of heartbreaking postseason defeats. It's a long list, of course, because that's what playoff baseball does. But there were two other short throws from Game 2 that might have also impacted the outcome of the series: (1) Trea Turner 's throw that was wide right to catcher J.T. Realmuto , allowing Teoscar Hernandez to beat the tag and slide in safely and leading to a four-run rally for the Dodgers, and (2) Max Muncy firing a perfect throw to Mookie Betts on a bunt attempt in the ninth inning that nailed Nick Castellanos at third base as the Dodgers held on for a 4-3 victory. It's easy to think about the what-ifs -- what if either throw went a few inches the other way? Or if Kerkering threw to first base instead of home? But it's not as simple as a few throws, although those plays highlight the small margin of error in the playoffs. The Phillies' season is also over because the big names didn't hit. During this four-year run of what you might call the Bryce Harper / Kyle Schwarber era, they reached the World Series -- somewhat surprisingly -- in 2022 but haven't made it back despite having some of the top front-line talent in the sport. In fact, the Phillies are 3-10 in their past 13 postseason games and 2-8 in their past 10. In those 10 games, they've hit .195 as a team. Harper hit .206 with one home run and three RBIs. Schwarber hit .162 with three home runs and four RBIs, two of those home runs and three of the RBIs coming in Game 3 of this series. The others around them didn't fare any better in those 10 games, with Turner, Bryson Stott and Brandon Marsh each hitting under .200. As the Phillies soak up a disappointing end to 2025, you have to wonder if this might be the end of this era of Phillies baseball. Schwarber, Realmuto and Ranger Suarez are free agents this offseason. Zack Wheeler will attempt a comeback following thoracic outlet syndrome surgery -- though his timeline is uncertain. Aaron Nola is coming off a 6.01 ERA. And to top it all off, their four most valuable position players this season were all 32 or older. The Phillies have had a remarkably stable roster of core players during this four-year run, and though they might look very different in 2026, one thing is for certain: Harper is not going anywhere. Signed through 2031, he has connected with the fans of Philadelphia like few athletes do in their adopted cities. He also knows their pain. ""I know fans are upset. I know the city's upset. Obviously, it's warranted. We're upset in here as well,"" Harper said after Game 4. ""Our daily life is Phillies baseball. This is our family in here. This is what we do. We want to win not just for ourselves, but for everybody that watches us play. ... I want to hold the trophy and that's the goal every single time you get into spring training."" While most people in baseball don't believe the Phillies will let Schwarber go, not coming off his 56-homer campaign, the reality of the situation is clear: This is an aging roster with a high payroll. They have a committed owner in John Middleton, who has run top-five payrolls, and a future Hall of Fame executive in Dave Dombrowski, who knows how to build teams loaded with star players, but throwing more money at older players feels risky, even for a team coming off a 96-win season and trying to win the World Series. Offseason questions for eliminated teams Here's how the winter looks in Philly -- and in all the towns whose teams made an early exit from the 2025 MLB playoffs. Story » The organization is at a critical juncture, one that eerily resembles another Phillies era: the 2007-2011 teams that won five consecutive NL East titles and the World Series in 2008. If anything, that group was even more talented than this one -- and the best of those teams was the 2011 squad that won 102 games, only to lose in the NLDS. But look what happened to those Phillies as the front office tried to keep winning with the same team: In 2012, they finished 81-81. In 2013, they finished 73-89. In 2014, they finished 73-89 and in last place in the division. In 2015, they hit rock bottom and finished an MLB-worst 63-99. The similarities between the Phillies of the past four years and those 2007-2011 teams are more than a little eerie: 1. That 2011 NLDS ended with a 1-0 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals and on an atypical final play, when Ryan Howard grounded out and blew out his Achilles. 2. The ace of the 2011 staff was Roy Halladay, who won 19 games and posted 8.8 WAR. He was never the same again, suffering a shoulder injury the next season and winning just 15 more games in the majors. Wheeler, who had posted 5.0 WAR before this season ended when a blood clot was discovered near his right shoulder in August, will have to overcome a major injury at age 35 -- the same age as Halladay in 2012. 3. The average weighted age (based on playing time) of the 2011 Phillies position players was 31.5, the oldest in the NL. The average age of the 2025 Phillies position players was 30.3, second oldest in the NL. 4. The 2011 Phillies had locked themselves into some hefty long-term contracts for older players. Howard had signed a five-year, $125 million extension in 2010 that didn't begin until the 2012 season and was worth minus-5.0 WAR over those five seasons. Cliff Lee had signed a $120 million extension running through 2015, but he got hurt and won just four games in 2014, not even pitching in 2015. They banked on Chase Utley and Jimmy Rollins to remain stars as they entered their age-33 seasons in 2012, but that didn't happen. The 2025 Phillies have similar issues with Wheeler making $42 million the next two seasons, Nola signed all the way through 2030, and are banking on Harper and Turner remaining productive as they enter their age-33 seasons in 2026. Final grades for all 30 MLB teams Whether your team is headed to October or packing its bags for the offseason, how did 2025 measure up to expectations? David Schoenfield » It's also hard to imagine the Phillies suddenly rebuilding. That's not in the nature of Middleton or Dombrowski. Even with the uncertainty with Wheeler, they have another ace in Cristopher Sanchez , plus Jesus Luzardo for one more season. We might finally see top prospect Andrew Painter enter the rotation in 2026. Taijuan Walker is still around for another year, so even if they don't re-sign Sanchez, the rotation could be solid, although a lot of that depends on Nola bouncing back. Closer Jhoan Duran is under team control for two more seasons, so Philadelphia at least finally has some stability in the ninth inning. The other key relievers will be back, including Jose Alvarado, if his $9 million club option is exercised (not a sure thing given his PED suspension made him ineligible for the postseason). On the position player side, Castellanos ($20 million) and Walker ($18 million) come off the books after 2026, so that's money that can go to re-signing Schwarber. They also have a pair of highly touted prospects in shortstop/third baseman Aidan Miller and outfielder Justin Crawford, who should both be ready at some point in 2026, so that's an opportunity to weave in some younger players. There's also the question of who will be managing this group for the long run. While Rob Thomson is under contract through the 2026 season, there are always rumblings that it might be time for a change after a string of painful playoff exits. Despite that potential uncertainty, Thomson has no doubt about what the Phillies will have planned for 2026: ""John [Middleton] is going to spend money. He wants to win. He wants a world champion. There's good years ahead, no doubt."" That may very well be the case. It's easy to envision the Phillies right back in this position next October, hoping Harper and Schwarber get hot at the right time, hoping the right throws are made this time, hoping the whims of postseason baseball go their way. History, however, also suggests that's hardly a sure thing.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46555121/mlb-2025-playoffs-phillies-nlds-exit-elimination-harper-schwarber-contention-winning,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1011%2Fr1558497_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,f934bb0815c859f3aa59e1f23279faea127a59b6
04f3a47afc0c,The three stars who made the Aces three-time WNBA champs,,"PHOENIX -- Jackie Young dribbles the ball up the court as the final seconds in Game 4 of the WNBA Finals tick down on Friday night. She can do whatever she wants with it. The title is secure. Chelsea Gray runs to A'ja Wilson and jumps into the four-time MVP's arms. They hop and hug while the scoreboard makes it official and time expires. Young throws the ball into the air. The Las Vegas Aces are the 2025 WNBA champions. They defeated the Phoenix Mercury 97-86 and closed out the first best-of-seven WNBA Finals with a 4-0 sweep. Gray wraps Wilson in a bear hug. Now Young. Coach Becky Hammon pulls the much taller Wilson down to her. Aces fans who traveled to Phoenix celebrate by chanting ""Aces, Aces"" from their small but enthusiastic section in Mortgage Matchup Center. One fan waves a championship banner, the third for the Aces in the past four years. ""We got the best player in the world in A'ja Wilson ,"" Gray says. ""Jackie Young the best guard in the league. Everybody that stepped in was huge. We champions."" Only one team in league history had won three titles in four years before the Aces, and that was the Houston Comets in the league's first four seasons (1997-2000). The Minnesota Lynx , who won four titles in seven years from 2011 to '17, became the league's second ruling family. And now it's the era of the Aces and the era of Wilson and Young and Gray. The roster has shifted and changed since the Aces' first title in 2022, but these three have been constants, choosing to chase rings and banners in Las Vegas with each other. ""They understand winning,"" former Aces coach Bill Laimbeer said to ESPN on Friday. ""They understand the grass is not greener on the other side."" Individually they are exceptional. Together they are legendary. ""They're family,"" Aces president Nikki Fargas said. ""They look at this game that they are so fortunate to play as an opportunity to build long, lasting memories. The journey hasn't always been that easy for the three of them, but they've navigated the waters and they've done it with each individual stepping up at different times to lead."" A'ja Wilson, Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray celebrate their third title together with the Las Vegas Aces. Adam Hagy/NBAE via Getty Images THE SEEDS OF this modern WNBA dynasty were planted in 2018 when the woeful San Antonio Silver Stars moved from a Texas city to the glitz and glam of Las Vegas and became the Aces. The franchise hired Laimbeer, a three-time WNBA championship-winning coach with the Detroit Shock, as president of basketball operations and head coach. The Aces arrived with the No. 1 draft pick up their sleeves. Wilson, who led South Carolina to its first national championship in 2017, was the ""no-brainer"" choice, as Laimbeer saw it. The agile 6-foot-4 forward won Rookie of the Year in 2018 after averaging 20.7 points and 8.0 rebounds. But the Aces finished 14-20 and wound up with the top pick again in the 2019 draft. Las Vegas chose Jackie Young, a 6-foot guard who had won a national championship with Notre Dame in 2018. ""People might have thought him drafting me was a little questionable,"" Young said. ""But he saw the vision all along. He knew the kind of player I could turn into."" Wilson and Young led Las Vegas to its first Finals in 2020, where they got swept by Seattle in the bubble. Before the 2021 season, Gray, a 5-11 point guard maestro with a championship ring from the 2016 season with the Los Angeles Sparks , signed with Las Vegas. ""She had championship experience, which the Aces needed,"" Laimbeer said. ""She was somebody who had been there, done that, but also has the unselfish mentality."" In Game 5 of the 2021 semifinals against the Mercury, the Aces trailed by two when Wilson caught the ball with mere ticks left on the clock and the opportunity to send the Aces back to the Finals. She split a double-team and drove to the basket, but Mercury center Brittney Griner blocked her shot at the buzzer. Wilson collapsed on the court, exhausted and emotional. Her teammates helped her back to the locker room. Young stood right there, holding Wilson and encouraging her. Gray walked off the court ahead of them, raising her jersey to cover her face. ""To have it literally smack back in my face, it was hurtful,"" Wilson said. ""But at the same time, it built me."" The year 2021 stands out in Aces history for another reason: Mark Davis bought the team and the Aces hung the jersey of former franchise great and then-San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Hammon in the rafters that summer. Fargas remembers clutching Hammon's hand as her jersey was lifted to the ceiling. ""I'm almost sending her vibes,"" Fargas said. ""Like, 'We want you here.'"" Laimbeer stepped aside after 2021, and in 2022 Hammon returned to the franchise that retired her number, this time ready to show out on the sideline. Chelsea Gray cemented her reputation in Game 4 as one of the best clutch shooters the league has ever seen. Christian Petersen/Getty Images LOST IN THE Aces' dominance of the Mercury in the 2025 WNBA Finals is the fact that they almost didn't make it to the final round at all. Gray, who has made a career of putting the basketball in the right place at the right time, stamped their third trip in four years. In overtime of Game 5 of the semifinals, the Aces needed a big shot. Las Vegas was up by one over an Indiana Fever team that would not go away. The Fever had lost All-Stars Aliyah Boston (fouled out) and Kelsey Mitchell (injury), and didn't have the likes of Caitlin Clark and Sophie Cunningham , who had long been out with season-ending injuries. But the players on the court simply didn't give a damn. They refused to let the Aces pull away. With just over three minutes left in overtime, Gray waved at Young, who was driving to her left to the middle of the floor. Young turned and passed the ball back to Gray, who was set up on the wing. Gray caught the ball and immediately launched a 3-pointer. It dropped through the net. The next time down the floor, Young scanned the floor as the shot clock dwindled. Gray ran toward her and caught the ball behind the 3-point line. She took two dribbles with her left hand before pulling up over a defender and fading to her side to hit another 3-point shot. ""That was crazy,"" Young said. ""I told her 'Sorry, I set you up for sure.'"" It didn't matter that she was 0-for-3 from 3-point range until those two shots or that her sideways momentum made the degree of difficulty on the shot a 10 out of 10. It was crunch time. It was Gray time. With 1:09 to go, Gray flicked in a layup to give Las Vegas all the points it needed to finally break the Fever and claim a spot in the Finals against the Mercury. Gray's clutch gene delivered when the Aces needed it most. The Aces had seen this show before. Gray was named Finals MVP when the Aces won their first championship in 2022 by beating the Connecticut Sun in the Finals. During that playoff run, Gray averaged 21.7 points and 7.0 assists per game while shooting 61.1% from the floor and 54.4% from beyond the arc. In 2023, the Aces ran it back, defeating the New York Liberty 3-1. Gray fractured her foot in Game 3 and was sidelined for the final game of the series. She also missed the first 12 games of the 2024 season, and still wasn't quite herself during the 2024 playoffs when the Aces got bounced in the semifinals by a Liberty team out for revenge. This year's run necessitated a different style of play from Gray. She was called upon less often to score, but her 7.5 assists per game were a career postseason high. Still, in Game 4, she hit two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to stymie a late Mercury push. ""My job with A'ja and Jackie is to find them a bucket that's easy, all they have to do is lay it up,"" Gray said. ""They're capable of going to get a bucket any time they want one-on-one, but there's passes that only a few can catch."" Game 2 of the WNBA Finals belonged to Jackie Young, but she also had 18 points in Game 4 to help Las Vegas sweep Phoenix. Stephen Gosling/NBAE via Getty Images YOUNG SIZED UP Mercury forward Natasha Mack on the wing in the third quarter of Game 2 of the 2025 Finals. She jabbed with her right foot, poking for vulnerabilities and looking to drive. When that door didn't open, Young peered around Mack and looked for an opening to pass the ball down to NaLyssa Smith in the post. Mack shut down that idea too. Then Young squared up, launched a 3-pointer over Mack's head and drained it. Her first three points in a historic 21-point quarter, the most in a single quarter of a WNBA Finals game ever. Her ability to score in bunches had been so well documented by then that folks in her hometown had a name for it. Laimbeer learned about it a year after the Aces drafted Young when he ran into someone from her hometown. ""There's nobody from Jackie's hometown,"" Laimbeer joked of Princeton, Indiana, population 8,481. Laimbeer shared with the Princetonian that what he liked about Young was that she would willingly defer to others, but she would also willingly take over the game when required. No questions asked. ""The lady goes, 'In our town, we call that Jackie Time,'"" Laimbeer said. ""Jackie Time"" was on full display in the third quarter of Game 2. But she had help. Like the ball screens Wilson set to open up driving lanes, or the seal from Wilson that gave Young a wide-open jumper. Wilson and Young have played together for seven years now. Their relationship grew one game and one car ride at a time. In their first couple of years together with the Aces, they often drove around Las Vegas. Their city. Mostly in Wilson's car because ""I'm a bit of a passenger princess,"" Young said. Those off-court moments built a relationship that strengthened their on-court chemistry. ""That's my little sister I never wanted, but God put in my life,"" Wilson said. Laimbeer told them to cherish each other. ""You two are a team forever,"" Laimbeer recalled saying to Young and Wilson. ""Don't ever leave each other."" A'ja Wilson became the first WNBA or NBA player to win the scoring title, MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP in the same season. Christian Petersen/Getty Images WILSON CAUGHT THE inbounds pass from Gray with the score tied in Game 3. The clock blinked as it ticked down toward the buzzer. Wilson dribbled to her left, past Mercury All-Star Alyssa Thomas . When she met DeWanna Bonner , she picked up her dribble and spun to her right. Thomas recovered and tried to contest as Wilson elevated for her shot. She flicked her wrist toward the basket with 2.2 seconds left. The ball rattled around the rim before dropping through to deliver the Aces a 3-0 series lead. It was the crowning moment of ascension for Wilson. She, alone, occupies the mountaintop. Her legacy, though still taking shape, has already secured her a place among basketball legends. ""Probably No. 1,"" Wilson said of where she'd rank that shot in her career. ""I don't think I've ever shot a true game winner, and then when I see the 2.2 on the clock, it just reminds me that I'm covered [by God]. And I think that's just truly special."" Laimbeer knew he had made the right choice when he selected Wilson No. 1. But he also knew she had a lot of leadership lessons to learn in the transition from college to pro. ""There's a ton of other stuff that comes with the responsibility of being a franchise player, and she had to learn that,"" Laimbeer said. After losing Game 1 of the semifinals at home against the Fever last month, Wilson had a tough message for her teammates. ""I told my team the loss yesterday was more embarrassing to me than the 53-point loss,"" Wilson said the day after the game, referencing the Aces' Aug. 2 111-58 debacle against Minnesota. ""It was like we really didn't do anything."" Wilson, herself, didn't play well in the opener of the semifinals. She shot 6-for-22 and scored 16 points. From then until she lifted the trophy, she averaged 27.3 points on 47.9% shooting, 10.1 rebounds, 2.3 steals, and 2.5 blocks. She was named MVP of the Finals -- after winning the scoring title, MVP and Co-Defensive Player of the Year this season. ""She just continues to get better,"" Hammon said. ""She just continues to blow me away, too. And we just keep challenging her in these different ways. She just keeps adding things. She's not even 30 yet."" A'ja Wilson and Chelsea Gray wasted no time before starting the celebration of their third title together in four years. Christian Petersen/Getty Images ""HOPE Y'ALL ENJOYED THAT!"" Gray says as she walks down the hallway toward the Aces' locker room. ""See y'all next summer!"" Wilson isn't far behind. Clutching the championship trophy, she skips down the hallway before running to the locker room. When the players emerge, they are wearing champagne goggles and reek of beer. Wilson enters the news conference ringing a pink tambourine while Aces owner Davis attempts to answer a serious question. ""I need to sit down,"" Wilson says and finds a spot among the media chairs, still wearing her goggles. The celebration continues. Wilson rings the tambourine, using it as emphatic punctuation for statements from her teammates. She looks bewildered when someone brings up Michael Jordan comparisons. Young quietly holds her oversized bottle of champagne or beer, it isn't clear which, opting not to speak unless spoken to. Except when she's whispering to Wilson behind Gray's back. Gray tries to keep everyone in line. ""These three,"" Hammon says about her star trio, tears welling in her eyes. ""I love being their coach. I love being their friend. I love being a phone call for them. I push them probably sometimes to their disliking a little bit, but I'm invested in their greatness."" As Hammon speaks, Wilson holds up a towel so she can't look at her coach. But as Hammon continues, Wilson brings the towel down, raises her goggles, and covers her teary eyes. Gray and Young both look away from their teammate and coach in an effort to conceal their own emotion. Gray, Wilson and Young are all free agents after this season. They could go anywhere, but why would they? Individually they are exceptional. Together they are legendary. ""Greatness is who you're around,"" Wilson says. ""Like this group.""",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46558184/las-vegas-aces-2025-wnba-title-aja-wilson-chelsea-gray-jackie-young-big-three,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1011%2Fr1558609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,03491649f90398248f83bc837079f98962051d06
02ef11c10694,Way-Too-Early WNBA Power Rankings: Early look at 2026,,"PHOENIX -- The Las Vegas Aces are the 2025 champions after a WNBA Finals sweep over the Phoenix Mercury, giving the franchise its third league title in the past four years. Now ... welcome to chaos. This offseason will be the busiest in league history. A new collective bargaining agreement is needed, plus expansion drafts for two new franchises and the draft lottery. Then comes a free agency bonanza that includes almost every player who isn't currently on a rookie contract. There has never been more uncertainty about each team's roster than there is right now for next year. But that won't stop us from projecting an early look at the 2026 season. We do make one concession to the unknown. Since the two expansion teams, the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, don't have head coaches or any players yet, they aren't included in these rankings. But here goes for the other 13 teams. 2025: 30-14, won WNBA title They saved the best for last: Going from a .500 record in early August, to the No. 2 seed in the playoffs, to taking most of the drama out of the WNBA Finals. A'ja Wilson won her fourth MVP award and at 29 still has a lot of great basketball in front of her. As long as Wilson, Jackie Young , Chelsea Gray and coach Becky Hammon remain with the Aces, they will be championship contenders next season, too. 2025: 27-17, WNBA runner-up It was a great season for a Mercury team that was almost completely remade after Diana Taurasi's retirement and Brittney Griner 's departure to Atlanta. Forwards Alyssa Thomas and Satou Sabally found a new home in Phoenix and seem likely to want to stay there and build on all they did this year under second-year coach Nate Tibbetts. The organization has won three WNBA titles, but the last was in 2014. Returning to the Finals this season -- beating the 2024 finalists, New York and Minnesota, to get there -- was a success regardless of how the last series ended for the Mercury. 2025: 30-14, lost in first round The Dream were happy with their regular season, but not with their playoff performance. After winning Game 1 at home against the Fever, they lost Game 2 in Indiana and Game 3 back in Atlanta. Still, there was a lot positive for 2025: a franchise-record 30 wins, career-best seasons for Allisha Gray and Naz Hillmon and a successful transition to coach Karl Smesko, who was in his first season in the WNBA after a long college career. Now the question, as it is with most other teams, is whether the Dream keep their core (Gray, Rhyne Howard and Brionna Jones ) together. 2025: 34-10, lost in semifinals Minnesota was the championship favorite almost all season, but things went awry in the playoffs. Injuries to guard DiJonai Carrington and forward Napheesa Collier took a toll, and Phoenix ended the top-seeded Lynx's season. Since then, Collier has criticized WNBA leadership and commissioner Cathy Engelbert. That conflict and the abrupt end to Minnesota's title dreams have, to some degree, overshadowed all the Lynx did this season. But if the Lynx return their core and add a top draft pick -- Minnesota has a spot in the lottery obtained from a 2024 trade -- they will return to the championship hunt again. 2025: 24-20, lost in semifinals This Fever season was defined by resilience over injuries to multiple players. The biggest was the loss of point guard Caitlin Clark , who was limited to 13 games and didn't play after July 15. But even without the 2024 Rookie of the Year, Indiana made it to the deciding Game 5 of the semifinals. The Fever lost to Las Vegas in overtime after guard Kelsey Mitchell had to leave in the third quarter. She was affected by rhabdomyolysis, which caused her to severely cramp up. Clark and 2023 Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston remain on their rookie deals, and the Fever hope to bring back free agent Mitchell -- who has spent her eight-year career with Indiana -- to continue the climb of the past two seasons. What might the 2026 WNBA season have in store? A'ja Wilson and Las Vegas open at No. 1 in our projections, and Aliyah Boston and the Fever are No. 5. Brian Spurlock/Icon Sportswire 2025: 27-17, lost in first round The Liberty won their opening playoff game at Phoenix but then lost badly at home in Game 2 and saw the series -- and coach Sandy Brondello's tenure at New York -- end with a Game 3 loss back in Phoenix. Brondello guided the Liberty -- an original WNBA franchise dating to 1997 -- to their first WNBA title in 2024, but general manager Jonathan Kolb said she wasn't the right person to keep the organization moving forward. Considering her New York roots, it would seem forward Breanna Stewart will stay with the Liberty for 2026. But there might be questions about other key New York players returning as the Liberty look to bring in a new coach. 2025: 23-21, lost in first round Top-seeded Minnesota swept the Valkyries, but just getting to the playoffs was a big step for the first-year organization. No WNBA expansion franchise had ever reached the postseason in its first season. The team was immediately embraced by an enthusiastic fan base that made games at San Francisco's Chase Center -- nicknamed Ballhalla -- an event. Natalie Nakase was WNBA Coach of the Year, and Veronica Burton was named the league's Most Improved Player. Golden State did what it needed to do to make the franchise more attractive to free agents. 2025: 21-23, missed playoffs Adding former Aces guard Kelsey Plum was a plus for the Sparks, who improved from a league-worst eight wins in 2024. Plum, Dearica Hamby , Rickea Jackson and Azura Stevens formed a good core. We will see if that stays together under coach Lynne Roberts, who like Atlanta's Smesko came over from the college game this WNBA season. Cameron Brink , the 2024 No. 2 draft pick, returned July 29 from a knee injury that cut short her rookie season. Brink and Jackson, the No. 4 pick in 2024, are still on rookie deals. 2025: 23-21, lost in first round All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now After parting with longtime guard Jewell Loyd, who was traded to Las Vegas in the offseason, the Storm struggled to be consistent this year. Still, they came close to upsetting the Aces in Game 3 of the first round, falling 74-73. Think how one more Storm basket in that game could have changed this postseason, and the fate of coach Noelle Quinn. She was let go after seven seasons with the Storm, the last five as head coach. Guard Skylar Diggins and forward Nneka Ogwumike are the top Storm veterans, and post players Ezi Magbegor and Dominique Malonga are the top young stars. We will watch to see if they all stay together under a new coach. 2025: 11-33, missed playoffs The Sun lost their entire starting five from 2024, got a new coach (Rachid Meziane) and had few expectations for 2025. Reaching double-digit wins was an achievement, all things considered. Rookies Leila Lacan , Aneesah Morrow and Saniya Rivers provide a young nucleus for the future. Veterans Tina Charles and Marina Mabrey were the Sun's top scorers this season, so it will be interesting what 2026 brings for them. Off the court, the potential sale of the Sun is another story to watch during the offseason. 2025: 16-28, missed playoffs The first year of a rebuilding period for the Mystics under new coach Sydney Johnson and general manager Jamila Wideman had its positives, although Washington finished the season on a 10-game losing streak. Guard Sonia Citron and forward Kiki Iriafen , 2025 lottery picks, were All-Stars and the Mystics' top scorers. Washington right now has three 2026 first-round picks, including one in the lottery, so the draft could continue to help the Mystics grow. 2025: 10-34, missed playoffs Rookie of the Year Paige Bueckers led the Wings, and she's a great player to build around. They have a chance to get another No. 1 pick in 2026 and will have a new coach after Chris Koclanes was let go after just one season. This franchise is not a magnet for free agents, to be sure. But perhaps the lure of playing with a point guard like Bueckers and the fact that so many players will be in the free agent market will help the Wings bring more talent to Dallas. 2025: 10-34, missed playoffs The Sky seemed in disarray at season's end after second-year star Angel Reese 's published remarks about needing great players to come to Chicago to make the team more competitive. Reese apologized to her teammates, but there was no doubting the sincerity of her frustration with the organization. In his first season as coach, Tyler Marsh had a lot to deal with regarding injuries and on-court/off-court chemistry.

d9006b92ea01,WNBA,,"Oct 10, 2025, 10:24 PM ET The WNBA champion has been crowned. The Las Vegas Aces swept the Phoenix Mercury to win their third title in four years. And now all 13 teams will turn their focus to the offseason. This is expected to be one of the most pivotal offseasons in WNBA history. The league and the players are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement; new teams in Toronto and Portland, Oregon, will join the league and hold an expansion draft; and there will be an unprecedented number of free agents, given that many players signed one-year deals after the players' association opted last October to terminate the current CBA. The draft lottery also will determine which team will get the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft. In the meantime, we're breaking down potential moves for each WNBA franchise, including a look at the state of each roster, team needs and priorities for each front office. (Note: All players listed as ""reserved"" can become free agents if no qualifying offer is extended from their current team.) Jump to a team: ATL | CHI | CON | DAL | GSV | IND | LV | LA | MIN | NY | PHX | SEA | WAS Won WNBA championship 2025 record: 30-14 (2nd place) Free agents: Dana Evans (unrestricted), Chelsea Gray (unrestricted), Megan Gustafson (unrestricted), Jewell Loyd (unrestricted), Cheyenne Parker-Tyus (unrestricted), Kiah Stokes (unrestricted), A'ja Wilson (unrestricted), Jackie Young (unrestricted), Kierstan Bell (restricted), NaLyssa Smith (restricted) 2026 draft capital: Own second- and third-round picks Season recap: From disaster to dominance. When they suffered a 53-point loss at home to Minnesota on Aug. 2, the Aces were 14-14 and in eighth place. For a team with championship aspirations, the playoffs were no guarantee. Then, just like that, everything came together. Las Vegas immediately turned around to beat the Golden State Valkyries to begin a 16-game winning streak and finish the regular season with the league's second-best record. Becky Hammon shook up the lineup, bringing Loyd off the bench. The trade for Smith began to pay dividends. The defense and 3-point shooting became more consistent. Wilson reestablished herself as the league's best player, leading the league in scoring (23.4 PPG) and blocks (2.3 BPG) and winning a record fourth MVP. Las Vegas swept the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA Finals to win its third title in four years, with Wilson winning MVP of the series. State of the roster: Only rookie Aaliyah Nye has a contract for next season, but it's hard to imagine the core not returning. No player in the league is more associated with a franchise than Wilson is with the Aces. This is also the only franchise Young has known, and she is the perfect No. 2 behind Wilson. Gray is 32, but Las Vegas will be hard-pressed to find a point guard more savvy and clutch on the free agent market. Bringing Smith back would also seem to make sense, but the rest of this roster could look very different in 2026 as the front office tries to maximize Wilson's prime years. Las Vegas' big three of Chelsea Gray, A'ja Wilson and Jackie Young are all unrestricted free agents this offseason. Christian Petersen/Getty Images Top front office priority: Building more reliable depth. The Aces' offense is heavily dependent on Wilson and Young scoring at a high level, and there is little room for error. Assuming there aren't other pieces of their core to replace, the Aces could use any combination of another wing scorer, an additional ball handler and some interior length. Evans was a helpful addition this season and Smith made a difference, but more players may be necessary to avoid being the .500 team Las Vegas was for the first 2½ months. Biggest offseason question: What will Loyd's status be? When it was clear that Kelsey Plum wanted to move on, getting Loyd was a nice return in the trade. But she is not the same player she was for the Seattle Storm . She is still an adequate defender, but, offensively, was largely just a 3-point shooter. Is that enough to bring her back or is there an upgrade available somewhere? -- Charlie Creme Eliminated in the WNBA Finals 2025 record: 27-17 (4th) Free agents: Kahleah Copper (unrestricted), Satou Sabally (unrestricted), Alyssa Thomas (unrestricted), Sami Whitcomb (unrestricted), DeWanna Bonner (unrestricted), Natasha Mack (reserved), Kitija Laksa (reserved), Lexi Held (reserved), Monique Akoa Makani (reserved), Kathryn Westbeld (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own second-round pick Season recap: The Mercury had to navigate an injury-riddled first half of the season, with Copper and Sabally notably missing time. But as Phoenix awaited their returns, the squad's depth -- namely, its untraditional rookie class -- stepped up. Those contributions from Laksa, Held, Akoa Makani and Westbeld squashed any concerns that the Mercury were too thin behind their stars, and a midseason trade for Bonner only made them deeper. Thomas put together a historic season, setting the single-season league record for assists (357) and becoming the first player in WNBA history to record eight triple-doubles in a season. Finishing fourth in the standings was a major step forward for this team from a year ago, especially considering the roster turnover. Unfortunately, Phoenix lost Sabally to a concussion late in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, and got swept by Las Vegas in four games in the best-of-seven series. Can Phoenix retain unrestricted free agent Alyssa Thomas and its younger stars like Monique Akoa Makani and Kathryn Westbeld for 2026? Stephen Gosling/NBAE via Getty Images State of the roster: While most of the roster consists of free agents, Phoenix should feel good about retaining its top players. Last offseason, Sabally and Thomas were looking for a competitive organization with resources to pour into its athletes -- it's why they chose Phoenix. The more interesting players to watch will be the younger stars who had breakout seasons and will likely be targeted by other teams trying to build depth. Top front office priority: In addition to bringing back Copper, Sabally and Thomas, Akoa Makani should be near the top of the list of players to re-sign. And if Phoenix isn't able to keep most of its depth, it will need new targets to replenish the bench unit. Biggest offseason question: What is the next step in Copper's progression? The Mercury see her as their centerpiece, and gave her the keys to the franchise this season. She has more scorers and shooters around her now, but her numbers did dip a bit from a year ago. How can she continue to develop and ensure that she stays among their top options? -- Kendra Andrews Eliminated in the WNBA semifinals 2025 record: 24-20 (6th) Free agents: Kelsey Mitchell (unrestricted), Natasha Howard (unrestricted), Lexie Hull (restricted), Sophie Cunningham (unrestricted), Damiris Dantas (unrestricted), Sydney Colson (unrestricted), Brianna Turner (unrestricted), Aari McDonald (unrestricted), Odyssey Sims (unrestricted), Chloe Bibby (reserved), Kristy Wallace (contract expired following suspension ) 2026 draft capital: Own first-, second-, third-round picks Season recap: The 2025 campaign started with championship aspirations for the Fever after a productive offseason, but little went to plan from there. Caitlin Clark , last year's Rookie of the Year, was in and out of the lineup because of an array of soft tissue injuries, appearing in just 13 games before being sidelined for the second half of the season. DeWanna Bonner abruptly left the team in June, and four other players sustained season-ending injuries in August and September. Still, coach Stephanie White and the short-handed Fever managed to finish four games above .500, securing their second consecutive postseason berth coming off a seven-year drought. Indiana won the franchise's first playoff game and postseason series since 2015 by upsetting the Atlanta Dream in the first round. The Fever then took two games from the Las Vegas Aces , finding themselves one win away from reaching the WNBA Finals. But after Mitchell exited with cramping in the third quarter of the winner-take-all Game 5, they were ultimately knocked out in the semifinals. State of the roster: The Fever already have two of the most talented players in the league under contract for 2026: Clark and Aliyah Boston , Indiana's No. 1 picks in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Hull is also a restricted free agent, meaning Indiana has the right of first refusal if she signs an offer sheet with another team. That's a fantastic young core to build around as the organization assesses the next steps for the offseason. How will Caitlin Clark approach the offseason ahead of a hopefully healthy Year 3 in Indiana? Joe Buglewicz/Getty Images Top front office priority: Much like last offseason, re-signing Mitchell will be the No. 1 priority. From there, the front office must determine which complementary pieces fit with its long-term vision, and which players to move on from. Gaining veteran experience was a huge priority this past offseason; does that mean the team looks to re-sign players like Cunningham and Howard? If not, which other free agents could the team attract to play alongside Clark and Boston? This season showed the importance of having guard depth surrounding Clark, but the Fever also felt a little thin in the frontcourt at times. Biggest offseason question: What do this offseason and ultimately Year 3 hold for Clark? Her sophomore season never fully took off due to injuries, and the Fever insisted they have been operating with her long-term health and well-being top of mind. Can Clark leave her injury issues behind, and how quickly can she return to her dominant form in 2026? Once she's finally able to return to the floor, it wouldn't be surprising to see a version of Clark hungrier than ever before. The Fever's championship hopes fell short this year, but how much can they level up as they aim to win it all in 2026? -- Alexa Philippou 2025 record: 34-10 (first) Free agents: Napheesa Collier (unrestricted), Kayla McBride (unrestricted), DiJonai Carrington (unrestricted), Courtney Williams (unrestricted), Alanna Smith (unrestricted), Natisha Hiedeman (unrestricted), Bridget Carleton (unrestricted), Jessica Shepard (unrestricted), Maria Kliundikova (reserved), Jaylyn Sherrod (reserved), Camryn Taylor (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own first-round pick from Chicago; third-round pick Season recap: The Lynx entered this season with a chip on their shoulders. Despite making it to the WNBA Finals last season -- losing in five games to the New York Liberty -- they had something to prove. They felt the championship was ""stolen"" from them, so they were determined to make it back. For all four months of the regular season, Minnesota looked primed not only to reach that goal but capture its fifth title in franchise history. Collier was the MVP front-runner for most of the way, until a right ankle injury caused her to miss seven consecutive games across July and August. While she was runner-up for that award, Collier became just the second player in WNBA history to finish a season with a 50-40-90 shooting split, going 53.1% from the floor, 40.3% from 3 and 90.6% from the foul line. Minnesota swept the expansion team Golden State Valkyries in the first round of the playoffs but looked far less invincible in the semifinals against the fourth-seeded Phoenix Mercury . It all came to a head in Game 3 when Collier was injured after making contact with Phoenix's Alyssa Thomas on a play that sent Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve into a rage against the officials. With Collier sidelined, the Mercury went on to win Game 4 and the series, ending Minnesota's campaign in a far more painful way than last year's Finals loss. How will unrestricted free agent Napheesa Collier approach the offseason with her injury? Christian Petersen/Getty Images State of the roster: The Lynx have no players guaranteed to return next season. While there isn't an immediate reason to believe their core players won't want to come back, it could be time to make some tweaks to the roster. Top front office priority: Given what this group has accomplished over the past two years, there is no need to blow up the roster -- but some adjustments need to be made. Namely, the Lynx need more guard and wing depth. That could come from bringing back Carrington -- who missed the final stretch of the regular season with a shoulder injury and the semifinals due to a left foot sprain -- or from signing someone else in free agency. Biggest offseason question: There are really two questions. The first: How long will Collier's recovery take? There are eight months before the WNBA season starts up again, but Collier was set to play in the second season of the Unrivaled league in January. Is that still on the table? Or will her injury affect her offseason and her plans to grow her game? The second question: How do the Lynx recover from this loss? It sounds a bit dramatic for a semifinal ousting, but Minnesota must figure out how to move on emotionally from this ending. Collier and the Lynx have spoken at length about how their Finals loss to the Liberty fueled the past 12 months. It wasn't enough to get them over that hump or even back to the Finals. Now, they have to do it all over again. -- Kendra Andrews Eliminated in the first round of the playoffs 2025 record: 27-17 (5th) Free agents: Breanna Stewart (unrestricted), Sabrina Ionescu (unrestricted), Jonquel Jones (unrestricted), Natasha Cloud (unrestricted), Kennedy Burke (unrestricted), Isabelle Harrison (unrestricted), Emma Meesseman (unrestricted), Stephanie Talbot (unrestricted), Rebekah Gardner (reserved), Marine Johannes (reserved), Betnijah Laney-Hamilton , Annika Soltau , Raquel Carrera , Seehia Ridard (expiring suspended contracts) 2026 draft capital: Own third-round pick Season recap: The Liberty returned nearly all of their players from the 2024 title run (excluding Laney-Hamilton, who was injured in the offseason and did not play in 2025, and Kayla Thornton , who went to Golden State in the expansion draft). The Liberty began the season with optimism about potentially defending their championship. They started the year 9-0, but injuries and inconsistency derailed those ambitions as Jones, Stewart, Cloud and Ionescu all missed games. New York signed three-time EuroLeague MVP Meesseman, the 2019 WNBA Finals MVP, on Aug. 1, but the move didn't have the intended impact because of a short runway and shifting lineups. A 12-11 regular-season record after the All-Star break dropped the Liberty to the No. 5 seed, but they were finally (mostly) healthy when their first-round series began. They won Game 1 against the Mercury, but Stewart suffered an MCL sprain in overtime. She was hampered moving forward, and Phoenix won the next two games to oust the defending champs. The Liberty owned the league's most talented roster but failed to capitalize on it. Breanna Stewart and the New York Liberty fell short of returning to the WNBA Finals. Catalina Fragoso/NBAE via Getty Images State of the roster: The Liberty have only two players under contract for 2026 -- Nyara Sabally and Leonie Fiebich -- and just one pick in the 2026 draft, so the roster is in flux. Depending on the CBA negotiations, the Liberty will likely core Ionescu or Cloud, but under current CBA rules, could not core Stewart or Jones. Top front office priority: Two words: free agency. The Liberty need a team for 2026, and because of limited draft capital and players on existing rookie contracts, they have to construct that team through free agency. Expect New York's front office to aggressively pursue players from the current roster, as well as possibly add a couple of new faces. General manager Jonathan Kolb has made big splashes in recent years. Biggest offseason question: The biggest question is the simplest one, and perhaps facing most teams this offseason: Who is coming back? This offseason could be straightforward if Stewart, Jones, Ionescu and Cloud all re-sign and this version of the Liberty core makes another run at it. Or ... some or all of them move on. -- Katie Barnes 2025 record: 23-21 (7th) Free agents: Skylar Diggins (unrestricted), Ezi Magbegor (unrestricted), Tiffany Mitchell (unrestricted), Nneka Ogwumike (unrestricted), Katie Lou Samuelson (unrestricted), Brittney Sykes (unrestricted), Erica Wheeler (unrestricted), Gabby Williams (unrestricted), Zia Cooke (reserved), Mackenzie Holmes (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own third-round pick, plus first-round picks coming from Los Angeles and Las Vegas and a second-round pick from Dallas Season recap: The start of August was a pressure point for Seattle. Tied for fourth in the league entering the month, a six-game losing streak sent the Storm reeling. They recovered enough to make the playoffs -- and, perhaps more crucially, ensure their draft lottery pick from the Sparks -- but got stuck matching up with Las Vegas in the opening round for a second consecutive year. While Seattle was competitive against the WNBA's top teams in the regular season, beating every playoff team except Indiana twice, that didn't translate as the Aces knocked the Storm out of the postseason for the third time in four years. State of the roster: Only two players are under contract for 2026: veteran guard Lexie Brown , who struggled to find consistent playing time this season, and 2025 No. 2 pick Dominique Malonga . The latter is the centerpiece of the next generation for the Storm , who will add two first-round picks next spring and get 2023 first-rounder Jordan Horston back from an ACL tear in 2026. If Seattle is going to remain in playoff contention, though, maintaining the veteran presence provided by All-Stars Diggins and Ogwumike could be crucial. Nneka Ogwumike is an unrestricted free agent ahead of the 2026 season. Will she remain with the Storm? Steph Chambers/Getty Images Top front office priority: Finding more shooting. The Storm finished ninth in makes and attempts from 3-point range, a key factor in ranking eighth in offensive rating -- ahead of only one playoff team, the Golden State Valkyries . Seattle tried in free agency, but Samuelson was lost to an ACL tear and Alysha Clark fell out of the rotation before a midseason trade for Sykes. The Storm's young core could use a knockdown shooter to complement Malonga. Biggest offseason question: Should Seattle continue a two-timelines approach? Trading Jewell Loyd for the pick used to get Malonga meant developing the promising teenager, who ranked No. 4 in ESPN's 25 under 25 players , while also trying to win now. The optimistic view was she could become a star quickly enough to complement close friends Diggins and Ogwumike while they're still capable of leading a contending team. That became more difficult to justify during the Storm's second-half swoon. Support from Diggins and Ogwumike was crucial to Noelle Quinn, the WNBA's second-longest tenured coach after Cheryl Reeve, maintaining her position last offseason. If that changes, or if Seattle's front office decides to move toward a younger group that's more on Malonga's timeline, there could be turnover on the sidelines. -- Kevin Pelton 2025 record: 30-14 (3rd) Free agents: Brittney Griner (unrestricted), Brionna Jones (unrestricted), Jordin Canada (unrestricted), Allisha Gray (unrestricted), Nia Coffey (unrestricted), Shatori Walker-Kimbrough (unrestricted), Rhyne Howard (restricted), Naz Hillmon (restricted), Maya Caldwell (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own first-, second-, third-round picks Season recap: Under new leadership in Karl Smesko and a new offensive system, the Dream thrived, putting together their best season in years. They improved in nearly every statistical category from a year ago, going from third to first in rebounding (36.6 per game), 12th to third in assists (21.4 per game) and 10th to third in 3-pointers made (421). They are also second in offensive rating -- they finished in last place a season ago -- and defensive rating. Their 30 wins are also a single-season league record for a first-year WNBA coach. They also finally won a postseason game for the first time since 2018. State of the roster: Te-Hina Paopao and Taylor Thierry will still be under their rookie contracts, making them the only players guaranteed to return. Paopao, the 18th overall pick in 2025, carved out a solid role in her rookie season, starting 17 games and averaging 5.8 points on 43.8% shooting and 2.4 assists. Te-Hina Paopao is guaranteed to return to Atlanta next season -- but can the Dream retain their core trio of Naz Hillmon, Rhyne Howard and Allisha Gray? Brett Davis-Imagn Images Top front office priority: The Dream need to find a way to retain their core of Gray, Howard and Hillmon. Atlanta general manager Dan Padover told ESPN the trio has been the centerpiece for the franchise's rebuild over the past four years -- and when the Dream drafted Howard and Hillmon in 2022 and traded for Gray the next year, the plan was to keep them around long term. Biggest offseason question: What does Griner's future in Atlanta look like? Her arrival last offseason was surprising, and there were even more questions about how she -- as well as Jones, two dominant bigs -- would work in Smesko's offensive system that's built around shooters. Griner averaged just 9.8 points per game, her fewest points since her rookie year (12.6). She also played a career-low 20.8 minutes. -- Kendra Andrews 2025 record: 23-21 (8th) Free agents: Tiffany Hayes (unrestricted), Kayla Thornton (unrestricted), Monique Billings (unrestricted), Temi Fagbenle (unrestricted), Kaila Charles (unrestricted), Cecilia Zandalasini (restricted), Veronica Burton (restricted), Kaitlyn Chen (reserved), Janelle Salaun (reserved), Iliana Rupert (reserved), Laeticia Amihere (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own first-, second- and third-round picks Season recap: The Valkyries made history in their first season, becoming the first expansion franchise to make the playoffs in its inaugural year. A roster built up of former sixth women, the Valkyries said they always maintained the belief that they would outperform expectations and what previous expansion teams had done, but acknowledged even they were a bit surprised by just how quickly the group built its chemistry. This was even more the case after Thornton -- at the time a candidate for Most Improved Player -- was lost for the season to a knee injury in July. The award instead went to teammate Burton. Golden State had the opportunity to finish as high as sixth in the regular season but finished eighth because of some late-season losses and tiebreakers. Still, even making the postseason in its first year is an incredible feat. Can the Valkyries retain WNBA Most Improved Player Veronica Burton, left, and Kayla Thornton for next season? Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty Images State of the roster: Only Kate Martin and Carla Leite aren't free agents for the Valkyries. Both were important rotation players for WNBA Coach of the Year Natalie Nakase, with Leite also starting six games. But neither are going to be the nucleus for this team. Golden State owner Joe Lacob wants to keep as many players from of this roster together as he can, but it will be a tall task. Top front office priority: Bringing back as many players as possible, especially Thornton and Burton. If the Valkyries want to continue to build off this impressive season, they need to retain these two guards who are the leaders of this team on and off the court. Biggest offseason question: The Valkyries thought they were a desirable landing spot before they had even played one game. Now, after this historic season, they believe even more they can attract big names. Can the front office land a star in free agency? Part of the Valkyries' feel-good story was how successful they were with a roster full of former rotation players. To continue to build, they should target a game-changing player. -- Andrews Eliminated in the regular season 2025 record: 21-23 (9th) Free agents: Julie Allemand (restricted), Emma Cannon (unrestricted), Dearica Hamby (unrestricted), Alissa Pili (reserved), Kelsey Plum (unrestricted), Azura Stevens (unrestricted), Julie Vanloo (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own second-round pick, Seattle's second-round picks, own third-round pick. Traded their first-round pick to Seattle Season recap: Lynne Roberts left Utah and the college game to coach in the WNBA for the first time. Record wise, her Sparks improved a lot from last season's 8-32 last-place finish, and despite beginning the summer with a 5-13 record, had played relatively solidly after the All-Star break. They remained in contention for the playoffs until the third-to-last night of the season. Still, a franchise that for many years was practically automatic about reaching the playoffs has now missed the postseason for the fifth year in a row. State of the roster: Post players Rickea Jackson , Cameron Brink and Sania Feagin , and guard Sarah Ashlee Barker will still be on their rookie contracts. Jackson has had the most success, averaging 14 points and 3.6 rebounds over two seasons. Brink returned from an ACL injury that cut short her 2024 rookie season, playing 19 games this year and averaging 5.1 points and 4.3 rebounds. The Sparks hope both of their 2024 lottery picks are long-term pillars for the team. Los Angeles will hope its 2024 draft lottery picks, Rickea Jackson and Cameron Brink, can be long-term pillars. Juan Ocampo/NBAE via Getty Images Top front office priority: Bringing back Plum, the team's leading scorer, and Hamby and Stevens, its top rebounders. After the Sparks were eliminated Sept. 9, Coach Roberts said she is hopeful that the franchise can keep its core together as she believes the Sparks can build a lot on the progress made this season. She also said her biggest disappointment was some of the close games the Sparks felt got away from them, but that experience should help next season. Biggest offseason question: How much better can Brink be? Provided players such as Plum -- who asked to be traded from Las Vegas last offseason -- choose to remain in Los Angeles, maybe the biggest key for Roberts and general manager Raegan Pebley will be Brink's ongoing recovery. Brink averaged 7.5 points in 2024 before she was injured, and it seemed as if she was really starting to build confidence around the time she got hurt. This year, she returned to action but didn't seem very comfortable offensively. Brink still has a chance to be one of the league's impact players, which would be a big boost for the Sparks. -- Michael Voepel All of ESPN. All in one place.

Sign Up Now 2025 record: 16-28 (10th) Free agents: Shakira Austin (restricted), Alysha Clark (unrestricted), Stefanie Dolson (unrestricted), Emily Engstler (reserved), Jade Melbourne , Madison Scott (reserved), Sug Sutton (restricted) 2026 draft capital: Own picks in all three rounds -- Seattle's first-round pick, New York's first-round pick (via swap with Connecticut), Minnesota's second-round pick Season recap: The Mystics really had two different seasons. Through Aug. 5 with a 13-15 record, they were battling for a playoff spot behind three All-Stars: rookies Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen and first-time veteran Brittney Sykes . After trading Sykes to Seattle to get the Storm's first-round pick for 2026, Washington then struggled down the stretch. The Mystics finished the season on a 10-game losing streak, which could allow them to move up in the draft lottery order, pending the Sparks' season finale. The late slide can't take away the excitement about Citron and Iriafen, both locks for the All-Rookie first team. Washington will look to build around its rookie All-Stars Kiki Iriafen and Sonia Citron for 2026. David Dow/NBAE via Getty Images State of the roster: After holding two of this year's top four draft picks, Washington will again add young talent in the spring. Seattle's late slide will give the Mystics three draft picks in the top 11 to join Citron and Iriafen. The other long-term building block for Washington is center Austin, who finally enjoyed a healthy season and averaged a career-high 12.7 PPG. A restricted free agent this offseason, the former No. 3 pick is still just 25 years old. With so many rookie contracts on the books, the Mystics have the option of being aggressive in free agency. Top front office priority: Scouting the 2026 draft. Citron and Iriafen both ranked among our top 10 players under 25 last month, but Washington could still use another high-end prospect. Whether the Mystics move up in position to draft that player in the spring may go a long way toward determining their offseason strategy. If Washington comes out of the lottery with the No. 4 or No. 5 pick, the front office may aim to take another swing in 2027 when USC star JuJu Watkins could be available. Biggest offseason question: How much can the Mystics expect from Georgia Amoore ? The team's third 2025 first-round pick, No. 6 overall, Moore suffered a season-ending ACL tear during training camp. Washington's limited ballhandling options after the Sykes trade helped cause the late losing streak. If Amoore is a long-term starter at point guard, the Mystics can focus their resources on adding alongside Citron on the wing. Given the timing of Amoore's injury, however, she may not play in a competitive game before the 2026 preseason. -- Kevin Pelton 2025 record: 11-33 (11th) Free agents: Lindsay Allen (unrestricted), Tina Charles (unrestricted), Bria Hartley (unrestricted), Marina Mabrey (unrestricted), Olivia Nelson-Ododa (restricted), Haley Peters (restricted), Mamignan Toure (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own two first-round picks (via Phoenix and via Minnesota), one second-round, one third-round Tina Charles and Marina Mabrey are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Melissa Tamez/Icon Sportswire Season recap: It's been a tough season for the Sun. They went 2-8 in their first 10 games and won 11 games overall -- and yet, it was difficult to count them out late in the season. They played the Liberty close on Aug. 25, and beat the Mercury at home on Sept. 6. Through the losses, a young core emerged in Leila Lacan , Aneesah Morrow and Saniya Rivers . The Sun traded for former UConn star Aaliyah Edwards prior to the deadline and also rostered rookie Rayah Marshall . This group of players was a much-needed bright spot, considering this year's winning percentage (.256) was the lowest in franchise history. State of the roster: The Sun have a clear core of young players and question marks everywhere else. They also have only the players on rookie deals under contract for next season: Lacan, Morrow, Rivers, Edwards and Marshall. Everyone else is a free agent of some sort. How those chips fall will dictate the next moves by the front office, but expect GM Morgan Tuck to take a run at keeping Nelson-Ododa, Charles and Mabrey. Top front office priority: The Sun need to build around their young core through the draft, and look for value in free agency. Signing Charles ahead of the 2025 season is a good example of value paying off. And because Uncasville may not be an attractive destination for top-tier free agents, the Sun will have to be creative in wooing international prospects. Biggest offseason question: What is the future of the franchise? The Sun are embroiled in conflict around a possible sale. It is not clear if it will happen, or to whom -- or if the Sun will be in Connecticut, New England or somewhere else entirely. What is clear is that the Connecticut Sun will remain the Connecticut Sun and play in Uncasville for the 2026 season. Beyond next season, though, things are much more uncertain, which could further complicate signing talent in free agency. -- Katie Barnes 2025 record: 10-34 (12th) Free agents: Rebecca Allen (unrestricted), Ariel Atkins (unrestricted), Rachel Banham (unrestricted), Kia Nurse (unrestricted), Michaela Onyenwere (unrestricted), Sevgi Uzun (reserved) , Courtney Vandersloot (unrestricted), Elizabeth Williams (unrestricted) 2026 draft capital: Own picks in all three rounds -- Phoenix's first-round pick, their own second-round pick, New York's second-round pick, own third-round pick. However, Minnesota (via trade) has Chicago's original first-round pick, meaning the Lynx will have the lottery selection, not the Sky. Chicago must find a way to fix its issues this offseason -- beginning with the relationship with Angel Reese. Melissa Tamez/Icon Sportswire Season recap: Under new coach Tyler Marsh, the Sky lost by 35 points in their season opener at Indiana -- and things didn't improve from there. Chicago never won more than two games in a row, doing that just twice, and missed the playoffs for the second year in a row. Longtime Sky point guard Vandersloot returned to the team after two years in New York but was lost for the season on June 7 with a knee injury. In early September, Angel Reese 's published remarks about the franchise needing ""great"" players also caused a stir with her teammates. She later apologized to them and was suspended for half a game . But what she said struck a chord with many frustrated fans. Due to a league suspension for getting her eighth technical foul, the team suspension and back issues, Reese did not play in the Sky's last four games. State of the roster: Reese and Kamilla Cardoso (the team's leading scorers and rebounders), fellow post player Maddy Westbeld and guard Hailey Van Lith all remain on rookie contracts. Vandersloot turns 37 before the start of next season but said she intends to return after rehabbing her knee. With free agency more imperative than ever this offseason, the Sky don't appear well-positioned to draw top players. But bringing back a similar team in 2026 won't work. As Reese told the Chicago Tribune, ""I'm not settling for the same s--- we did this year."" Top front office priority: Fix the relationship with Reese. Or figure out how to part ways without alienating the fan base -- which would be a tall order. Perhaps Reese might have waited until after the season to make her remarks so as not to offend her current teammates, but the substance of what she said has merit. Biggest offseason question: Is general manager Jeff Pagliocca on the hot seat? He was hired as the team's first standalone GM in October 2023 (until that point, the Sky combined the GM and head coach roles). Known as a skill development guru, he had worked with the franchise in that capacity for four seasons before stepping into the GM role. But does that translate to mastering team construction? The Sky's plummet the past two years, after five consecutive playoff appearances, is concerning. Teresa Weatherspoon was fired as coach after a 13-27 finish in 2024; Marsh's record was worse. Pagliocca also traded the Sky's No. 3 pick in the 2025 draft to Washington for veteran guard Atkins. She's a very good player, but will turn 30 next July. Chicago could have instead kept the pick and drafted guard Sonia Citron, 21, from nearby Notre Dame, who ended up becoming an All-Star for the Mystics this season and is under a rookie contract. -- Voepel 2025 record: 10-34 (13th) Free agents: Grace Berger (reserved), Luisa Geiselsoder (reserved), Tyasha Harris (unrestricted), Myisha Hines-Allen (unrestricted), Haley Jones (reserved), Arike Ogunbowale (unrestricted), Li Yueru (reserved) 2026 draft capital: Own first- and third-round picks. Traded second-round pick to Seattle How will Dallas build around Paige Bueckers? Is Arike Ogunbowale's time with the franchise nearing its end? The Wings have a lot to consider this offseason. Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images Season recap: Dallas fired coach Latricia Trammell after going 9-31 in 2024, replacing her with first-year head coach Chris Koclanes and general manager Curt Miller, a longtime WNBA coach/GM. Then the Wings started this season 1-11, won just twice after July 30 and missed the playoffs for a second consecutive year. This year's No. 1 draft pick Paige Bueckers delivered on her potential and is expected to be named Rookie of the Year. But injuries and offseason moves that didn't work (such as bringing in DiJonai Carrington and NaLyssa Smith , both of whom were then traded midseason) doomed the Wings to finishing in the WNBA's cellar. State of the roster: Bueckers will enter the second season of her rookie deal, along with fellow guards Aziaha James and JJ Quinerly . All three provided much of the team's heart this season. Forward Maddy Siegrist and guard Diamond Miller will enter the option (fourth) year of their rookie deals from 2023. Siegrist missed the second half of June and all of July with a knee injury but has played well since returning in August. Miller, the 2023 No. 2 pick, was acquired from Minnesota in an August trade and still hopes to find consistent minutes. Top front office priority: Build the team around Bueckers, a franchise-changing player who has adjusted quickly to the pro game. Biggest offseason question: Is it time for the Wings and Ogunbowale to part? She has been the face of the franchise since being selected No. 5 in the 2019 draft. She was limited to 29 games this season, not playing after Aug. 10 because of knee tendinitis. She also recorded the lowest scoring average (15.5 PPG) and field goal percentage (36.4) of her WNBA career. Ogunbowale will turn 29 in March, so she is still in her prime and may decide to see what the rest of the league has to offer. The Wings may be ready to totally reconstruct around Bueckers. -- Voepel",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46157526/wnba-offseason-2025-draft-trade-free-agency-guides-every-eliminated-wnba-team-playoffs,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0917%2Fr1546786_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,158cece720054494dca820c4b61b0b9b8ccdb0ab
f61932c1c53b,"Gareth Taylor, Liverpool must regroup after loss to Man City",,"It was a second half that summed up Liverpool's season. For a spell, it looked as if Gareth Taylor's side was on course for the unlikeliest of Anfield victories against the manager's former club, Manchester City . For an even longer period, it seemed like Liverpool's defensive doggedness might earn them a precious point to kick-start their stuttering season. Ultimately, though, it was the same old story for the Reds, as a late strike from Aoba Fujino consigned them to a 2-1 defeat that leaves them without a single point in the Women's Super League (WSL) through five games this term. Extending back to last season, Liverpool have now lost a club-record seven games in a row in the competition, with only West Ham United's inferior goal difference keeping them off the bottom of the table. In other words, the club's current situation is bleak. The start of Gareth Taylor's tenure at Liverpool hasn't gone to plan, with five straight losses to begin the season. WSL/The FA via Getty Images It was only two seasons ago that Liverpool looked like a force on the rise, usurping rivals Manchester United to claim a spot in the WSL's top four. Fast forward to present day, and the Reds look a million miles from being able to compete with Europe's elite. It has been a difficult few months for the club, both on and off the pitch. The departure of club-record signing Olivia Smith to Arsenal in the summer drastically weakened Liverpool's attack, while the delayed nature of Taylor's appointment -- he was only officially announced as head coach in August -- left them with little time to adequately reinvest Smith's £1 million transfer fee into the squad. The death of former manager Matt Beard last month has also had a profound effect on many associated with the club, with nine of the 11 players that started against City having been signed during his tenure. Still, results have not been good enough, and Liverpool go into next week's international break with plenty of problems to solve. Admittedly, it was always going to be a big ask for Taylor -- facing City for the first time since he was sacked earlier this year -- to mastermind a victory. In the first half, many of his team's problems were laid bare. Liverpool goalkeeper Rafaela Borggräfe was kept busy, making important saves on shots from Vivianne Miedema , Khadija ""Bunny"" Shaw and Fujino, while offensively the hosts struggled to pose a threat to their visitors. In fact, Liverpool struggled so much in attack that they went into halftime with an expected goals (xG) value of 0.0, having had zero shots and just one touch inside the opposition box, compared to 22 for City. They also saw one of their most creative forces, midfielder Marie Hobinger , forced off the pitch with what looked like a knee injury inside the first 30 minutes. Taylor's side did improve dramatically after the break and took the lead when Cornelia Kapocs diverted Ceri Holland's fine cross past Ayaka Yamashita and into the back of the City net. However, Liverpool led for just 12 minutes before Borggräfe palmed the ball into the path of Iman Beney , who finished with aplomb to draw the visitors level. Iman Beney's 64th-minute goal sparked Manchester City to overturn a 1-0 deficit. George Wood/Getty Images From that moment on, it felt like a City winner was inevitable, and it arrived in the 86th minute when Fujino coolly slotted home to continue Liverpool's wretched Anfield record -- they have won just one of their eight WSL matches at the stadium, a 3-1 victory over Manchester United in March. There was a brief moment of hope right at the death when defender Gemma Bonner thought she had snatched an equalizer in front of the Kop. However, she was promptly flagged offside -- a painful reminder of how fine the margins are at the elite level. ""At this moment, we're not getting what we deserve, and it's tough,"" Taylor said after the game. ""But it's fine. I think it's close to working; it's close to coming. It takes time. There's been a lot of change, and we've got to keep working. Things are obviously tough at the moment because we've probably felt a little bit hard done by in some games. Like I said, we've changed a lot of things. We've been asked to come in and bring a new way, and sometimes that takes time."" Of course, defeats against title-chasing City won't define Liverpool's season, but it is clear the Reds are in desperate need of a spark to ignite their campaign. With the club's owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) having invested heavily to repurchase Liverpool men's former training ground, Melwood, back in 2022, the need for greater financial support is clear -- particularly considering that the men's team spent close to £450 million in the transfer market this summer after winning the Premier League . Renewed investment is expected in the January window. Until then, Liverpool need to find a way out of their current rut and start climbing the table. If not, it could be a very long season.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46572031/gareth-taylor-liverpool-regroup-loss-man-city-womens-super-league,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559177_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,f8a8ffc37ee4b98d52066e61f21db1af16206650

d59441b1d880,Timeline of Tiger Woods' injuries throughout his PGA Tour career,,"Oct 12, 2025, 07:46 AM ET Fifteen-time major champion Tiger Woods underwent surgery recently to replace a disc in his back. It's the latest injury setback for Woods, who also underwent surgery in March after rupturing his left Achilles tendon while ramping up training and practice at home. Here's a look at some of the injuries Woods has had throughout his PGA Tour career. Oct. 10, 2025: Back surgery Woods underwent lumbar disc replacement surgery -- his seventh back surgery. Woods said in a social media post that he had the surgery in New York and added it was the right decision for his health and his troubled back. He did not mention how long it would keep him out of golf. It was his second surgery of the year and his second back surgery in 13 months. Woods said he consulted doctors and surgeons after experiencing pain and lack of mobility in his back. ""The scans determined that I had a collapsed disc in L4/5, disc fragments and a compromised spinal canal,"" Woods wrote in the post. ""I opted to have my disc replaced yesterday, and I already know I made a good decision for my health and my back."" March 11, 2025: Achilles tendon injury Woods underwent surgery after rupturing his left Achilles tendon while ramping up training and practice at home, he announced in a statement on X. Woods, 49, said Dr. Charlton Stucken of the Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida, performed a ""minimally invasive"" Achilles tendon repair. ""The surgery went smoothly, and we expect a full recovery,"" Stucken said in a statement. Sept. 13, 2024: Back surgery Woods announced that he underwent surgery on his lower back . In a statement on his social media, the procedure was described as a microdecompression surgery of the lumbar spine for nerve impingement in the lower back. ""The surgery went smoothly, and I'm hopeful this will help alleviate the back spasms and pain I was experiencing throughout most of the 2024 season,"" Woods said. April 19, 2023: Ankle surgery Woods underwent surgery to address post-traumatic arthritis in his right ankle that was caused by injuries suffered in a February 2021 car wreck. According to a statement posted to Woods' Twitter account, Dr. Martin O'Malley at HSS Sports Medicine Institute in New York performed the subtalar fusion procedure to address arthritis caused by a previous talus fracture and ""determined the surgery to be successful."" ""He's resting now and will start the recovery process,"" Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview at the time. April 9, 2023: Withdraws from Masters Woods withdrew prior to Sunday at the Masters -- he would have needed to play 28½ holes due to weather suspensions. "" I am disappointed to have to WD this morning due to reaggravating my plantar fasciitis."" Tiger Woods withdrew before Sunday at the 2024 Masters. AP Photo/Matt Slocum Feb. 23, 2021: Injuries from car crash Woods was involved in a one-car crash in Southern California in which the vehicle rolled several times and left him trapped in the car. He later had surgery to deal with ""open fractures"" to his lower right leg, had a rod placed in a tibia and had screws and pins inserted in his foot and ankle during emergency surgery. Woods was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center by ambulance. Later that night, Dr. Anish Mahajan issued a statement in which he said Woods suffered ""significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity"" and had emergency surgery for ""open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portion of the tibia and fibula bones."" Mahajan said Woods' leg was ""stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia and additional injuries to the bones of his foot and ankle were repaired with screws and pins. To relieve pressure from swelling, doctors also removed the covering of muscles."" Dec. 23, 2021: Another back procedure Woods underwent a fifth back procedure , his fourth microdiscectomy, meant to alleviate nerve pain in his lower back. The time frame for a return is typically 2½ to 3 months. Aug. 20, 2019: Left knee surgery Woods had an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee -- the fifth time that knee had been operated on -- and later said the knee hindered him throughout the summer and that he had put the procedure off. He said he would be ready in time for the Zozo Championship in Japan. April 20, 2017: Back surgery Woods announced he underwent successful back surgery to alleviate ongoing pain in his back and leg. ""The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,"" Woods said via his website. ""When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long."" Feb. 3, 2017: Back spasms Woods withdrew before the second round of the Dubai Desert Classic, citing back spasms. Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said at the time that the problem was not related to nerve issues that had plagued the 14-time major champion over the prior few years and resulted in three surgeries, the most recent in September 2015. Oct. 28, 2015: Follow-up back procedure About a month after his second back surgery in a year and a half, Woods announced that he had undergone a follow-up procedure to relieve discomfort in the area. The procedure was performed by Dr. Charles Rich, the same neurosurgeon who performed the previous two surgeries. Sept. 16, 2015: Back surgery again Back surgery again: Woods missed the cut in three of the four majors of 2015, but in August he posted his best finish of the year. That was his final start of the year, however, because Woods underwent a second microdiscectomy surgery in September. He said he hoped to return in ""early 2016."" April 1, 2014: Back surgery Woods announced he would miss the Masters after undergoing a microdiscectomy for a pinched nerve, which had been hurting him for several months. Woods said he would return to golf ""sometime this summer,"" which he did in late June at the Quicken Loans National. March 18, 2014: Back spasms Woods announced he wouldn't play the Arnold Palmer Invitational, citing lingering pain. March 2, 2014: Back issues Woods withdrew from the final round of the Honda Classic. March 11, 2012: Injury to left Achilles tendon Woods withdrew from the final round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship. May 12, 2011: Knee, Achilles act up Woods withdrew from the Players Championship with apparent injuries after nine holes (he shot 42). ""The knee acted up, and then the Achilles followed after that, and then the calf started cramping up. Everything started getting tight,"" he said. Woods didn't play again until the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in August 2011. April 26, 2011: Left MCL sprain, strained left Achilles tendon Woods announced he would miss the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina. During the third round of the Masters, he suffered a Grade 1 mild MCL sprain to his left knee and a mild strain to his left Achilles tendon while hitting a difficult and awkward second shot from the pine straw under the Eisenhower tree left of the fairway at No. 17. Woods was able to continue playing at Augusta and later decided to seek a medical evaluation. 2010: Apparent neck injury Woods was forced to withdraw from the Players Championship during the final round with a neck injury. An MRI revealed that he had an inflamed facet joint in his neck. 2008-09: Torn right Achilles tendon At the 2010 Masters, Woods revealed that he tore his right Achilles in 2008 and reinjured the tendon several times in 2009, yet continued to play. 2008: Arthroscopic knee surgery Two days after finishing second at the 2008 Masters, Woods had arthroscopic knee surgery to clean out cartilage. He was expected to recover in four to six weeks, and he returned to action at the U.S. Open. The result? He won. Woods had reconstructive surgery on the damaged ACL and missed the remainder of the 2008 season. In addition to the ACL problem, Woods had a double stress fracture in his left tibia as a result of his preparation for the U.S. Open. 2007: Ruptured ACL Woods ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while at home running after the 2007 British Open, but he decided against surgery.

b48bea4c9b21,7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’,,"7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’ From deep dives into the notorious killer to explorations of Psycho and the Holocaust, learn the real history behind Ryan Murphy's Netflix hit Producer Ryan Murphy loves to blur the line between fact and fiction , and there’s no shortage of that in his most recent entry, Monster: The Ed Gein Story . Ostensibly, the eight-part Netflix show is about Gein (played by Charlie Hunnam), a small-town Wisconsin farmer who was discovered in 1957 to have killed at least two women, grave-robbed several others, and used their remains to make grotesque clothing and decor for his home. His story became national news, and even after he was sent to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life, it inspired young writers and filmmakers to create the archetype for modern horror: the monster hidden among us. In Monster , Murphy explores this idea by including dramatized scenes of the making of some of these films, including Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs . He also includes the fantasies Gein might have had about Ilse Koch, a Nazi who was accused of using the skin of her death camp victims to make lampshades and bind books. And like any good true crime series, the show leaves viewers wanting to know more. So, instead of spending hours scrolling and searching the web, we’ve curated seven podcasts that delve into the stories explored in Monster: The Ed Gein Story. The Compendium Podcast: Ed Gein: Monster, Murderer, and the Real Story Behind Hollywood’s Nightmares For a story like that of Ed Gein, whose crimes have become so deeply ingrained in American culture that they can sometimes be hard to see, it’s beneficial to have an outsider’s perspective. The Compendium Podcast is a little newer than a lot of the podcasts on this list — it launched in 2023 — but it’s done a good job establishing itself among a growing number of nerdy British buddy podcasts (check out The Rest Is History if you want the OG) by publishing well researched deep dives on everything from Ocean Gate and Heavens Gate to Princess Diana and Roald Dahl. In this episode, co-host Adam Cox walks the listener through the story, while co-host Kyle Risi offers reactions on Gein, his crimes, and the films he inspired. Last Podcast on the Left: Ed Gein Last Podcast on the Left is one of the longest-running comedy-true crime shows out there (quite possibly the only one). The hosts’ casual rapport can sometimes feel at odds with the seriousness of the crimes that they’re discussing, but the schtick of the show — one friend explaining a crime to a group of friends, a now-common premise they helped establish back in 2011 — works well with a crime like Gein’s, where there’s so much myth and rumor to discuss. Some points in this three-part series can feel a little dated (it was made in 2015, after all), but overall, it’s a detailed, deep dive into a complicated subject made by a group of podcasters at the top of their game. You’re Wrong About: Ed Gein and Slasher Movies For this episode of the excellent series You’re Wrong About , co-hosts Sarah Marshall and Michael Hobbes not only give a nice dive into Gein’s story, but use it as a jumping-off point to discuss horror cinema. Going down the rabbit hole on topics like America’s mid-century obsession with Freud, how 1970s horror films reflected changing opinions of the Vietnam War, and the transphobic message at the heart of Silence of the Lambs , it opens up new lines of thought in Monster ’s other story: that of Gein’s affect on American art. (If you’re curious about the themes explored in Monster ’s final episode, you might also check out Y ou’re Wrong About: Mindhunting where Marshall dives into the world of criminal profiling.) Unspooled: Psycho Unspooled , hosted by actor Paul Scheer ( The League, Black Monday ) and L.A. Times film critic Amy Nicholson, launched in 2018, initially working its way through the American Film Institute’s 100 best films of all time. Though they’ve long since branched out, on that original list was Psycho , clocking in at number 14. In this episode, Scheer and Nicholson only briefly touch on Gein himself, instead focusing more on a critical exploration of the film. But their discussions of the film — along with an interview with Alexandre O. Philippe, director of 78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene , a documentary entirely about that cinematic murder — reveal how important this work was in the history of film. Inside Psycho Wonder’s eight-part series Inside Psycho, which came out in 2017, follows the formula of a lot of that podcast production company’s early shows: Told chronologically, with a cinematic, omnipotent perspective, it goes through the production of the film, from inspiration through its effect on Psycho director Alfred Hitchcock’s life and career. Although only the first episode focuses on Gein himself, the podcast delves into the nitty-gritty of how writer Robert Bloch used his knowledge of the case to write his novel, Psycho , and the adaptation took on Hitchcock and the film’s star, Anthony Perkins. Murphy took a lot of liberties in his dramatization of this in Monster , but this podcast gets closer to the truth. The Holocaust History Podcast: The Trials of Ilse Koch with Tomaz Jardim Hosted by historian Dr. Waitman Wade Beorn, The Holocaust History Podcast is a serious and sobering look at the Nazi regime during World War II. In this episode, he sits down with fellow historian Dr. Tomaz Jardim, author of Ilse Koch on Trial: Making the ‘Bitch of Buchenwald,’ to separate truth from fiction around this larger-than-life Nazi villain. While they take care to remind the listener that Koch was a full-blown Nazi who was morally complicit in the atrocities, they get past the layers of the caricature she became after the war, particularly the allegations that she used the skin of Jewish victims to make lampshades and bind books. That cartoonish figure is what Gein would have read about — and what Murphy shows in Monster — but they show that hers was a more mundane evil, and one shared by many wives of the Nazis in power. Morbid: Ed Gein What’s a podcast list without a couple of women who call their beloved fans “Weirdos” and chat about true crime? Sisters Alaina Urquhart and Ash Kelley host this long-running podcast, breaking Gein’s story into three parts: His life and upbringing (they have particularly harsh words for his mom); his crimes and capture; and his life after conviction and legacy. Unlike some other chatty podcast series, Urquhart and Kelley go through the story with empathy and care, and often cite their sources. Like many of the podcasts on this list, they rely heavily on Harold Schechter’s 1989 book Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho .",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/monster-ed-gein-podcast-1235444428,Entertainment,BBC,Elisabeth Garber-Paul,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T15:00:00+00:00,a7a3773ad8ece0dd6122d58b2621b5246157955f
38a180547215,The 20 Best NES Games of All Time,,"The 20 Best NES Games of All Time From duck and vampire hunts to boxing and football sims, these are the titles that made the Nintendo Entertainment System legendary It was in October of 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System first hit North America, with an initial test run of 100,000 units being sold exclusively in New York City. Following the post-Atari video game market crash of 1983, no one was sure if there’d even be an appetite for yet another new digital toy to connect to the TV. But after the massive reception to the device and launch titles like Baseball and Duck Hunt , the potential was clear. It was a new era of gaming, and the Japanese company Nintendo was leading the charge. Within that first month, Super Mario Bros. also arrived, later becoming a pack-in title for the nationwide release of the NES the following year. With its killer app firmly established, the NES would begin its pop culture takeover that lasted well into the Nineties, amounting to a nearly 62 million units sold across all regions — a success so big, it’s credited with saving the home console market altogether. And although it was powerful enough for its time and introduced several hardware gimmicks (the NES Zapper is a stroke of genius), the NES’ legacy will always be defined by its downright ludicrous library of software. On top of its own first-party games like Mario , Metroid , and The Legend of Zelda , the OG Nintendo console was home to fledgling franchises from external partners like Konami, Capcom, and Tecmo — all of whom worked symbiotically (and at times antagonistically) with the Big N. Dragon Quest , Final Fantasy , Ninja Gaiden ; so many of today’s gaming dynasties began on the NES. It can be tough to narrow down which of the console’s games are its best. While nostalgia plays a factor, it’s just a fact that much of its lineup feels dated to play today. But looking back, there’s an astonishing number of NES releases that hold up to modern standards, and even the ones that may feel rough around the edges retain an undeniable impact. A bona fide classic can always be measured by how much you love it, even when it’s a pain in the ass to play. So, from groundbreaking platformers to slick shooters, these are the best NES games of all time. ‘Tecmo Super Bowl’ Image Credit: Tecmo Although most folks love RPGs or action-packed shooters, it’s impossible to understate the impact of sport games as a cultural juggernaut. There’s just something spectacular about bridging the gap between the cult of IRL sports with playable fantasy. The NES arrived with a handful of big ones like the bluntly named Baseball and Tennis , but 1989’s Tecmo Bowl brought it to another level. The first console game to officially strike a licensing agreement with the NFL Players Association, Tecmo’s sports sim let players control real athletes like Jerry Rice and Joe Montana to compete in the living room. Its sequel, Tecmo Super Bowl, upped the ante by also licensing the official team names, making for the most authentic football experience on the NES. Tecmo Super Bowl may feel rudimentary now, but the progenitor to franchises like Madden continued to be popular for decades thanks to an obsessive modding community that updated the game’s roster each season to give it an exponential afterlife. ‘Bionic Commando’ Image Credit: Capcom A key part of platforming games is the ability to jump, but Capcom’s Bionic Commando offers an alternative by letting players swing like Spider-Man using the protagonist’s robot arm. The game is challenging — especially during the learning curve of mastering the mechanics of grabbing, swinging, and climbing — but once it clicks, there’s few titles quite like it. Due to the angles required by the swinging system, Bionic Commando was one of the first games to emphasize eight-way aiming, although it’s limited to the grapple feature. Later entries would include the ability to shoot more directions and (thankfully) extend the arm mid-air, but the original remains a feat of ingenuity at a time when action-platformers were cementing their foundations. In a crowded field, Bionic Commando stands apart. ‘Blaster Master’ Image Credit: Sunsoft One of gaming’s greatest blessings is just how stupid a story can be as justification for the action. Sunsoft’s Blaster Master opens with a cinematic sequence that depicts a young man named Jason, whose pet frog breaks free and dives into a hole in the ground. Obviously, Jason follows and discovers a giant battle tank — which he immediately commandeers to slay a race of subterranean mutants. After its bizarre setup, Blaster Master quickly sets into one of the most kinetic experiences ever developed for the NES. Jason’s tank is extremely agile, allowing players to move quickly, jump nimbly, and aim freely in multiple directions. Each of its eight labyrinthine levels are dense with areas to explore, and the action remains constant. The mobile mech controls of Blaster Master feel so smooth, you’d almost be convinced they’re from a later era, feeling like the natural predecessor to contemporary mech-suit series like Armored Core . ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project’ Image Credit: Konami Although arcades were the true home of early beat ‘em ups, early consoles like the NES had their fair share too. One such gem was the NES-exclusive Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project , which arrived in 1991 just when turtle mania was at its apex. With controls based on the previous entry, which itself was built off the coin-up arcade version of TMNT , The Manhattan Project is a mechanically streamlined gauntlet of ass-kicking. The game can be played solo or as a pair and features the ability to toggle on and off friendly fire (depending on how much you want to agitate your siblings). Like other TMNT games, each level is filled with an array of baddies from the animated series like Bebop and Rocksteady, as well as many iterations of Foot Clan soldiers, all of which have unique abilities based on their colors. While its SNES sequel, Turtles in Time may be heralded as the best in the series, The Manhattan Project is a high point for NES-era beat ‘em ups. ‘Excitebike’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the best-selling games for the NES, Excitebike has one hell of a legacy. Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto for its 1984 Japanese release, the motocross racing game wasn’t just extremely well-designed in its own right, but its systems would influence other titles across genres for generations. Most directly, its 2D side-scrolling controls were adapted for Super Mario Bros ., giving the lead character his trademark inertia-building energy while running and jumping. Later on, its DNA could be felt in everything from Wave Race 64 to Flappy Bird , where strategically holding a button to gain altitude and angling the correct pitch for landing is key. But even if it hadn’t been so influential, Excitebike would still just be a damned fun game that holds up exceptionally well today. Dodging between lanes and correcting timing a jump boost is exhilarating, and the desire to best your own time always warrants another lap. ‘Super Dodge Ball’ Image Credit: CSG Imagesoft Long before the Ben Stiller movie introduced the idea of dodging a wrench as training for dodgeball, this spin-off of the River City game series made the gym class sport into a brutal proposition. Players control a six-man squad of ballers, with three populating the infield and another three surrounding the opposing team on the fringes of the court. Balls can be thrown plainly, but by initiating a sprint and properly timing the pitch, a superpowered special beans the opponent hard enough to propel them into the invisible walls. Like many games of the era, the visuals are janky. There’s almost never a moment when one or more characters are fully visible, constantly flickering and clipping in and out of frame. Yet the gameplay is smooth, precise, and surprisingly deep in its complexity. Traveling the world to conquer the dodgeball league is fun, but the real treat is the “bean ball” mode that boils the action down to a six-man free-for-all in a schoolyard where there are no rules or borders — only the ball and your killer instinct. ‘StarTropics’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the few titles developed for the NES to never be released in Japan, StarTropics is a strange mash-up of RPG exploration and dungeon-crawling that feels like multiple games blended into one. The story follows a 15-year-old named Mike Jones who is visiting his archaeologist uncle on a tropical island. After his uncle goes missing, Mike must follow the clues gleaned from conversations with various townspeople that lead into different multi-level dungeons filled with puzzles to solve and creatures to beat with his trusty yo-yo and baseball-inspired kit. At times, it feels like Zelda , with shades of Final Fantasy , but the game oddly shares much of its DNA with the Japanese-only release, Mother (1989), which also followed a boy armed with a yo-yo and baseball bat for a fantasy adventure. StarTropics ultimately spawned just one sequel, but its genre-mixing premise and lush environments would make for a great modern revival, should Nintendo be so inclined. ‘R.C. Pro-Am’ Image Credit: Rare You’d think that the best racing game on the NES would involve high-power motorcycles or spaceships, but in truth, all that’s needed is a set of remote-controlled cars. Developed by Rare well before they reinvented Donkey Kong on the SNES , R.C. Pro-Am is an inventive take on top-down racing that wringed every ounce of power out of its console for finely tuned controls and solid physics. The game is played from a three-quarter perspective rather than from the rear of the cars, making it possible to turn in a full 360 degrees — often by mistake. The POV is distinct, forcing you to focus on the track’s many curves and anticipate the positioning needed, but it’s generous in how easily one can course correct a miscalculation. Instead of leaning into speed or hazards on the horizon, the rally vibe of Pro-Am offer a different way to race that’s surprisingly enthralling despite its quaintness. ‘Duck Hunt’ Image Credit: Nintendo Duck Hunt needs little introduction. One of the key launch titles for the NES’ North American market, its appeal is obvious. Utilizing the Zapper peripheral, it brought shooting gallery games from arcades and bars to people’s homes, and became a sensation so big, it was paired with Super Mario Bros. in a single cartridge as the must-have Nintendo games for many years. Its concept is simple: players aim the handheld gun at their CRT screen (it unfortunately doesn’t work with modern flatscreens) and shoot either flying ducks or play pigeons round after round in carnival game fashion. It’s a lizard-brained kind of pleasure, and is enjoyable at any skill level — although children of the Eighties likely have memories of being scolded for sitting too close to the TV. (Not cheating!) ‘Life Force’ Image Credit: Konami A spin-off of the Gradius series, Life Force (called Salamander in Japan) is a classic side-scrolling spaceship shooter where players must battle waves of flying baddies and constant environmental hazards, powering themselves up with pick-ups along the way. While Gradius itself is the bigger name and would be worthy of inclusion on any list, Life Force is the superior choice for numerous reasons. Firstly, the game is more forgiving, allowing players to bounce back from death right where they fell rather than being sent back to an arbitrary checkpoint. Secondly, its power-up system is streamlined, and allows multiple items to be combined to create an insane arsenal. Fully playable in co-op, Life Force is one of the best two-person games available for the NES. ‘Punch-Out!!’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the most instantly recognizable names from the NES era, Punch-Out!! has seen multiple re-releases that will quickly pinpoint when someone picked up the game. The 1987 version featured then-World Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as its final boss, with a later 1990 release swapping out the at-times problematic (and pricey to license) real-life figure for the fictional creation, Mr. Dream. Adapted from Nintendo’s own arcade series, Punch-Out!! is arguably the best boxing game ever made. While it lacks the realism and depth of more contemporary franchises, its emphasis on rhythm and learning an opponent’s weakness was brilliant for the time. Aside from the entry-level fighter Glass Joe, bouts demand a deft balance of stamina management and reading each person’s tells, with specific behavior and character animations indicating when it’s time to dodge or strike, and in which direction. Endlessly playable, it’s a franchise that’s come and gone throughout Nintendo’s history, and there’s never a bad time to bring it back. ‘Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation’ Image Credit: Square Enix The NES as a platform was ground zero for numerous iconic roleplaying games like Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem , but the best of the bunch was Dragon Warrior ( Dragon Quest in Japan). The Americanized title has fallen by the wayside in recent years as Dragon Quest became more popular globally, and the third entry is considered by many to be the essential starting point. Featuring artwork from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama , and RPG mechanics that will be familiar to fans of tabletop and video games of all eras, Dragon Quest III may look visually modest, but it plays extremely well. With a sprawling open world that allows for non-linear exploration, a heavily detailed class system that lets new recruits choose their abilities, and an epic fantasy narrative, Dragon Quest III is the definitive NES RPG. ‘Contra’ Image Credit: Konami One look at Contra ’s box art will tell you that it’s going for peak late-Eighties machismo. Equal parts Rambo , Predator , and Aliens , the run and gun side-scrolling shooter pits players as meathead commandos Bill Rizer or Lance Bean (or both in co-op) on a jungle mission to wipe out an alien army. Some stages scroll left-to-right while others move vertically, but the game’s greatest strength is its kinetic set pieces where big enemies arrive at scripted intervals to fuck things up. While many shooters of the era can feel clunky, Contra remains slick, with players easily able to drop between different layers of each level and drop prone to dodge incoming projectiles. Its weapons upgrade system is straightforward, requiring just simple item pickups to suddenly give the commandos spinning flamethrowers and big-balled shotgun blasts. Even though it’s been iterated on countless times, the original Contra is the ultimate form of dumb fun. ‘Metroid’ Image Credit: Nintendo Although Nintendo’s early work was mostly rooted in cheery cartoon aesthetics, one game stood out as something decidedly darker. Heavily influenced by Ridley Scott’s Alien , Metroid dropped players into a desolate world with little direction and even less hope. Players take on the role of Samus Aran, a lethal bounty hunter on the trail of a faction of space pirates who are harboring a mysterious biological weapon (spoiler: it’s a metroid!). Although it might feel like a chore to play for many today, the original Metroid popularized a dizzying amount of video game mechanics and tropes that’re currently employed in games like Hollow Knight and even 3D series like Elden Ring . Samus starts extremely weak, with minimal abilities to traverse the mazelike terrain. Inching along chamber-by-chamber (and hopefully drawing a map), players must find new tools that will open up blocked paths in older areas. While its SNES sequel would perfect these ideas, the first game is no slouch, and is every bit worth revisiting, if only to see an early vision of gaming’s present. ‘Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse’ Image Credit: Konami It’s an odd trend in the NES era where the third entry of certain franchises ends up being chronologically a prequel, as is the case with Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse . While the second game in the series leaned more heavily into RPG elements, Dracula’s Curse reverted to a more straightforward action-heavy approach, letting players explore multiple branching paths but always solving problems with a simple crack of the whip. A first for the series, the game stars multiple protagonists that can be swapped on the fly: vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, sorceress Sypha Belnades, pirate Grant Danasty, and Alucard — the dhampir son of Dracula himself. With a rich gothic atmosphere and moody soundtrack, Castlevania III is among the most aesthetically pleasing titles for the NES, and one of the most rewarding to play. Its story was recently adapted into Netflix’s Castlevania anime series, driving many to go back to explore its 8-bit origins. ‘Ninja Gaiden’ Image Credit: Koei Tecmo During the Seventies and Eighties, ninjas were all the rage. Obviously, the shadowy warriors would inspire waves of video games, among the best of which was the Ninja Gaiden series. Tecmo’s side-scrolling action series was acclaimed at the time for its then-cutting edge cinematic cutscenes, which told the narrative in animated sequences preceding each stage. In action, the game’s action is razor-sharp and its platforming is innovative, letting players cling to walls and bounce between tiers with the agility of a shinobi. Compared to its contemporaries, Ninja Gaiden ’s combat is surgical, allowing the hero Ryu to strike down foes with a single slice, although they continually regenerate and can become quickly overwhelming. It can be extremely tough to best all 20 levels, but for those up to the challenge, Ninja Gaiden is a perfect slice of retro action gaming. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of Nintendo’s most prolific franchises, The Legend of Zelda has a long history of delivering some of the greatest games of all time . But it all began with the NES original, which presented many players with their first experience with a truly open world to explore. Starring the elf-eared hero Link, the game is all about discovery as users trek through the various biomes of Hyrule, stumbling across dungeons and secret chambers that house crucial items to reach new areas and combat enemies. The game’s open-ended environment is miraculous given the limitations of the NES, but it begins to make sense once players figure out the world’s grid-like regions. For many, the only way to solve its mysteries was to use a physical map, scribbling solutions, theories, and X’s to mark each critical spot. The NES was home to a multitude of grandiose fantasy adventures, but none were as legendary as Zelda . ‘Super Mario Bros.’ Image Credit: Nintendo There will never be another game like the first Super Mario Bros . While the NES debuted with a full lineup of bangers, the 1985 platformer blew the lid off the industry when it arrived, quickly being retrofitted as the pack-in title that warranted the purchase of the console itself. It was the Nintendo game, and in many ways, it still is. Designed by the maestro behind most of the company’s early classics, Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario Bros. plucked the playable hero from 1981’s Donkey Kong arcade game and gave him a complete overhaul. Firstly, he got a name (Mario!), as well as a brother (Luigi!), but most importantly, he gained the distinct ability to run and jump with extreme precision. Over the years, most players have completely memorized the various stages of the game to the point where you can see it with eyes closed, but it’s to the game’s credit that even if you (somehow) never tried it, it’s insanely easy to learn. Forty years after its release, Super Mario Bros . plays like a dream, with an incredible sense of momentum and tight control. And on top of inspiring thousands of games throughout decades, it almost singlehandedly saved gaming as the crown jewel of a console whose phenomenal popularity reinvigorated the industry. ‘Mega Man 2’ Image Credit: Capcom There’s something to be said for the value of player choice, and Capcom’s Mega Man series is built on the simple conceit of letting people pick how they want to tackle its challenges. At the start of each attempt, you’re presented with a list of eight levels to choose from, each with their own environmental theme and a special boss at the end. The hitch is that each of the bad guys can be more easily thwarted by another one’s abilities (which Mega Man himself gains after killing them). Which way do you start? What’s the ideal flowchart for beating them all? Sometimes, it just boils down to which ones you’re able to defeat. Mega Man 2 is the series’ best installment, famously perfecting the run and gun gameplay introduced by its predecessor while improving the level design. If Mario lets players rely on twitchy response time and frequently forgiving physics, Mega Man is all about methodical progression. Each level introduces entirely new elements, like conveyer belts of conflicting speeds and opposite trajectories that demand measured timing to traverse while being assailed by robots. The arc of the game is deeply memorable, a Jacob’s Ladder-like ascension through all levels into the endgame, which consists of a sequence of linear stages plus a second round with every one of the previous bosses. It’s a grueling gauntlet, but Mega Man 2 lives at the nexus of stellar action and platforming perfection. ‘Super Mario Bros. 3’ Image Credit: Nintendo How Nintendo managed to one-up its flagship title remains a marvel. The first attempt to create direct sequel to Super Mario Bros. was famously a bust. While the Japanese attempt mostly amounted to a more difficult expansion ( The Lost Levels ), the American one was literally a reskin of an entirely different game with the newly popular characters swapped in. Neither hit the mark, and for the third installment, Nintendo needed to think bigger. Super Mario Bros. 3 took everything the original did so well and exponentially upped the ante. Its levels are compact, dense with increasingly complex physical puzzles of dexterity whose solutions are taught organically in motion. Its visuals are lively; the many regions of the Mushroom Kingdom all feel distinct and packed to the brim with personality. The power-ups, from the Fire Flower to the Tanooki Suit, all give players an edge without making them helpless by losing them. While the 1985 game introduced the characters and world, it was Super Mario Bros 3. that cemented countless staples of the franchise that continue today. The world map lets players choose which routes to take between levels and provided bonus stages to hoarding items. The addition of new powerups let Mario take to the sky with the Super Leaf or throw projectiles in the Hammer Suit. Each of Bowser’s children, the Koopalings, provided a different threat as regional bosses rather than being different flavors of the same old thing. Generations later, gaming doesn’t get much better than Super Mario Bros. 3 . Despite its vintage, it’s a guaranteed joy to pick up and play, no matter how many times you’ve beat it. Although the NES would continue getting new releases well into the early Nineties, it ultimately peaked here. Super Mario Bros. 3 is the embodiment of everything that makes a Nintendo game great, and is easily the best of what the era had to offer.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming-lists/best-nes-games-of-all-time-1235442260,Entertainment,BBC,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NES_2-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,2452de7d2b8ba8741343c656008e604d6fd0529c
cd22c222aff4,"There’s Now a Casino in Everyone’s Pocket. For Some Young Men, It’s a Near-Fatal Gamble",,"F or Andrew Douglas, bottom was seven cops banging on the door of his apartment. He’d sharpened the knife “good,” filled the bathtub with water, and downed a vial of Coumadin to bleed out faster. Had his dad not sensed something and dialed 911, Andrew, a star baseball player turned gambling addict in college, would have quietly checked out at age 33, leaving his twin infant sons, his guilt-crippled parents, and many thousands of dollars in gambling debts behind. For Jonah, bottom wasn’t failing out of college and mulling suicide. Nor was it the month in a Florida rehab, where, for some fool reason, they let him have his cellphone and he bet money he’d stolen from family on four-legged parlay bets. (More on parlays later.) No, for Jonah, a lacrosse player at a powerhouse program, bottom was crossing the last bridge of honor: trading inside info with players at other schools to cover the over/under on games they bet. For the seven mostly young men sitting around this table, bottom was a grave of their own digging — a hole so deep that their cries for help went unheard. “My thoughts were too crazy, I thought that no one would get them,” says Marcus, a mid-twentysomething dressed like a gamer: black glasses, high-top Chucks, and a Playskool-colored sweatshirt. At his bottom, he was staring out the window of his apartment, weighing whether a fall from five flights up would kill or merely maim him. “I got to where suicide sounded sane.” (Excepting Andrew, above, the gamblers in this story spoke in exchange for anonymity.) We’re lunching at a sports bar in a Philadelphia suburb, picking at taste-free wings and waffle fries. It’s a curious place to bring a group of recovering gamblers, but the man at the head of the table has his reasons. Harry Levant has always been a rower against the river: a former criminal-defense attorney who lost his license, and nearly lost his life, to his own gambling jones a decade back; a second-chance crusader and addictions counselor who mainly treats folks gutted by gambling disorders; and a peripatetic opponent of the online gambling behemoths DraftKings and FanDuel , and the other sports-betting operators (hereafter, SBOs). Forty weeks a year, Levant’s somewhere in the air, lecturing state legislators and groups of physicians about the betting apps’ ploys and snares, as well as the harms he says they’ve levied on Gen Z males. That grail of Levant’s reads lonely and self-devouring: the mania of the gambler repurposed for public service. “Every addictive product has regulations,” says Levant. “Why is this the only one without them?” As his clients tell their stories, a loose narrative hangs together. With an exception here and there, most of these guys started gambling as teens, playing lunchroom hold-em and NFL parlays for a buck or two a throw. Then they got to college, rooming and running with older kids. Here, suddenly, everyone seemed to be in action, be it betting stupid sums on esports soccer or throwing 15 bucks at a five-legged parlay that paid out 20 to one but rarely cashed. (A parlay is a combo bet on two or more outcomes; to collect, you must win each outcome, or “leg.” Should you hit on four legs but miss the fifth, you lose whatever money you put down. Oh, and the odds of winning that five-legged parlay? Less than five percent.) Hospitalized after a suicide attempt due to gambling debts, Andrew Douglas says nurses turned on the NBA Finals and handed him his phone: “I gambled away my last $100.” The portals and drivers for much of this action were the giant sports-bet apps. On the party-colored killing floor of online gambling, FanDuel and DraftKings own most of the take, cornering 80 percent of the mobile bet market in this country. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion; by 2028, we’ll have bet — and lost — a trillion dollars since 2018. That was the year the Supreme Court reversed a federal ban on legalized gambling, freeing each state to partner with Big Sports Bet and feed their residents, especially the young ones, to the wolves. FanDuel and DraftKings wasted no time. They’d spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and the better part of a decade, carpet-bombing the airwaves with ads. Now, they paid kings’ ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and branding, and partnered with, or bought up, AI firms to help target their users’ browsing habits, favorite teams, and sports. “DraftKings, for one, bought SimpleBet, the biggest AI firm in this space, to turn data into in-game microbets,” says Levant. “Then they tracked and used their customers’ data to determine which of them preferred making constant, nonstop bets — and pushed those bets their way.” Bombarded by promos for FanDuel and DraftKings — “Get a $1,000 deposit bonus!” reads one DraftKings blast — underage boys pressed their parents to open accounts, often linked to dad’s ID and banking info, critics claim. Or they surreptitiously opened accounts without their parents’ knowledge, as teens have done with verboten vices since the dawn of time. “Young guys have always bonded around sports; it’s wired into their pack behavior,” says Levant. “What the apps do is monetize that pack behavior: Guys bond over sports bets, not sports, now.” Reached for comment on the matter, DraftKings and FanDuel pushed back on the contention that underage gambling is rampant on their apps, pointing to the safeguards they have in place. “DraftKings is committed to providing a legal, regulated, and responsible gaming environment for adults,” wrote a spokesperson for the company. “We employ advanced Know Your Customer (KYC) technology, relied on by the financial industry and law enforcement, to verify the age of our customers. Any use of our platform by minors violates both our Terms of Use and the law, and we actively monitor to detect and report this prohibited activity.” It bears noting that neither SBO agreed to on-the-record interviews for this piece. Instead, they responded with written statements, like the one from FanDuel, as follows: “As a legal, licensed and regulated operator, we ​have focused on the importance of educating college students on the risks associated with gambling. Notably, recovered problem gambler and national TV host Craig Carton brings lived experience and well-documented struggles with gambling to campuses through the FanDuel Responsible Gaming College Tour. Additionally, we have extended our education efforts to reach families by creating the Trusted Voices parent portal which provides tools and resources to talk to young people about gambling, associated risks, how to recognize warning signs and where to go for support.” To be clear, most adults who gamble on sports do so as a harmless time suck, a way to zest their weekend football viewing. And  countless teens put 10 spots on ballgames without getting dragged into addiction . “There are kids with a healthy relationship to money who can gamble casually on sports,” says Jody Bechtold, the CEO and founder of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh and a distinguished lecturer on gambling addiction. “But there are lots of other kids wired differently these days — high anxiety, ADHD, over-immersion in video games — who’re at much higher risk of addiction.” That’s especially so for kids “from affluent families who never learned the value of a dollar. Money’s supposed to hurt when you lose it,” but they were raised on “all things cashless: Venmo, PayPal, you name it.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports — though simple math tells us that the large majority of those bettors likely wouldn’t have been of legal age to do so. Worse, many engaged in a particularly rash form of gaming, making high-speed wagers on in-game action — a pernicious new product called microbetting. Last year, a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average. And who on campus is qualified to treat this gusher of gambling addictions? Essentially no one, per the experts I talked to. “Colleges aren’t set up to treat [six percent] of their students,” says Jim Lange, the executive director of the Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Drug Misuse Prevention and Recovery at Ohio State University. “That isn’t our business model, and never will be.” He added that most schools don’t even know they have a problem: Gambling is scarcely mentioned in the National Collegiate Health Assessment, the standard tool used by schools to track drug and alcohol misuse by students. None of those stats is news to the young men sitting at this table. “When I owed money to every kid I knew and was betting on Chinese ping-pong at 4 a.m., I tried going for counseling on campus,” says Marcus, the gamer kid. “As I’m talking to the counselor, she’s pulling a manual off the shelf, looking up [the definition of] ‘problem gambling.’” FanDuel and DraftKings have paid king’s ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and partnered with AI firms to help target users’ habits. Ron Vesely/Getty Images “In the hospital, where I was hooked up to a bunch of IVs [after his failed suicide bid], they turned the NBA Finals on and gave me my phone; I gambled away my last $100,” says Andrew, the ex-baseball player. Things were no better during his 30-day stay at an addiction clinic in Florida. “They didn’t touch on gambling at all.” So, too, for Jonah, the former lacrosse player, sent to an out-of-state facility at 21. “This place knew nothing about gambling addiction. They gave us two hours of phone time a day, and I set up a VPN to bet in Philly.” I hear a collective intake of breath as Jonah wraps his story. For all the suffering at this table, there’s a redemptive kinship as well, and a recognition that feels like rescue. The six percent of college kids who lose $500 or more in a day? “We used to be those kids,” says Marcus, to grunts and knowing head nods. “This is what it looks like, five years later.” Thousands of dollars stolen from a doting grandma. A bride empaupered months after her wedding. Betrayals so base they can’t be spoken to other people — but with this group, there are no secrets or judgments; only gratitude for the chance to come clean. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion “After all those months and years in the cold, here you’re among friends who know exactly what you’ve gone through,” says Levant. “And all I ask in return from these guys: Don’t make a bet today.” Andrew cuts in here to show me his phone. “Look at that top email, from Caesars,” he says. It reads, Your mystery bonus is here . “Four years since I shut down that app, they’re still tryna get their hooks in me.” “And that,” says Levant, “is why I chose this place.” He points to the flat-panels mounted above the tables, 50 or 60 sets tuned to Fox Sports 1 or the umpteenth rerun of “First Take.” Every last one of them posts a ticker at the bottom: Odds brought to you by either FanDuel or DraftKings. “This is what these guys have to live with,” says Levant. “They can’t run from sports or those fucking apps. All they can do is change their response.” A Caesars Sportsbook logo looms large over the scoreboard at Rate Field in Chicago. Patrick Gorski/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images MALIK BEASLEY, A SIZZLING SCORER and prime free agent, may never see the floor in another game. After nearly $60 million made in the NBA, he’s awash in debt and unwanted by teams after a federal DA poked through his gambling tabs. ( Recently cleared in that probe , he remains unsigned as basketball season approaches.) Emmanuel Clase is one of the best closers in baseball, but he won’t get to throw another pitch until the sport gets done scouring his prop-bet plays. Clase faces a lifetime ban if MLB can prove he engaged in spot-fixing, the practice of shading his own stat lines by intentionally sailing a slider over his catcher’s head. Jontay Porter could be headed to prison shortly: The NBA center copped to conspiracy to commit wire fraud recently for his part in a prop-bet ring. And Ippei Mizuhara is doing fed time already for stealing millions from his famous boss, Shohei Ohtani, to pay off gambling debts. If men who have everything can’t stop betting long enough to save their prized careers, how will we keep a generation of teens from taking a match to their futures? We find ourselves on the cusp of this disaster thanks in part to a petition brought in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey. Murphy and his predecessor, Gov. Chris Christie, filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to decriminalize wagers on sports in their state. They were suing to unleash a product so destructive that in 2013 the doctors and clinicians of the American Psychiatric Association added “gambling disorder” to the list of substance disorders in their revised standard text, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume 5. It was an extraordinary upgrade, says Levant, the first of its kind: warning readers of a “substance” they couldn’t smoke, shoot, or snort, but which was nonetheless “highly addictive” and “similar in nature to heroin, opioids, tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine.” “We reclassified gambling because it shared the symptomology of classic narcotic addiction, “ says Dr. Petros Levounis, past president of the APA. “We’re greatly concerned now because of the rise in sports betting. There’s a striking likeness to the tobacco and opioid industries — and there’s consensus among us that those industries committed crimes that resulted in suffering and death.” (Approached for comment, Murphy sent this boilerplate: “The Murphy Administration is concerned by the growing national epidemic of online sports-betting addiction, particularly among young men. What begins as occasional recreational betting too often spirals into financial instability, anxiety and depression, and high-risk habits. Our Administration is committed to mitigating the risks associated with problem gambling, including expanding treatment options and holding bad operators accountable.”) FanDuel and DraftKings have cornered 80 percent of the mobile sports-bet market in America. Rob Carr/Getty Images Harmful substances, such as alcohol and narcotics, are typically regulated and controlled. But when presented with what some experts call “the biggest public health threat since Big Tobacco,” SCOTUS killed the only law shielding Americans from the corporate bet sharks. That law, called PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), did precisely what its title proposed. It protected pro and college sports leagues from point-shave rings; kept the Mob (and enraged bettors) off the backs of the players; and put so much physical distance between gamblers and casinos that they couldn’t lose their shirts on a passing hunch. To be sure, problem gamblers found their way around it, opening accounts with offshore sportsbooks or a local guy-who-knew-a-guy. But the damage was contained to the vulnerable few, which is about the best you can hope for from a law. What followed, post-PASPA, was so predictable, you couldn’t have gotten odds for it at Vegas. A sanctimonious foe of sportsbooks for decades, the NFL immediately entered talks with FanDuel and DraftKings. For billions in betting revenue, the league leased those firms the rights to its stat packs, metrics, and branding. That proprietary data enabled the apps to launch a brand-new product: live, in-game wagers on practically anything that happened on field. No longer were kids forced to wait hours on an outcome; now, they could bet on every play and every player through AI-brokered props in real time. That phenomenon, called microbetting, forever changed gambling by turbo-boosting the speed of betting behaviors. The effect of microbetting, if not its intent, is to induce a fugue state that keeps users in action. “You lose track of time and space, and next thing you know, you’re betting Indian cricket at 4 a.m.,” says Marcus. “I don’t even know the rules of cricket. Those fuckin’ matches go on for three days!” Every major pro sports league followed football’s lead, selling their data for a slice of the sports-bet pie. The effect on problem gamblers was catastrophic. “I went from betting money lines on baseball games to betting the number of runs scored in every inning,” says Frankie, a client of Levant’s in his late twenties with a South Philly brogue and a shiny widow’s peak. “Any money left at the end of the night, I’m flipping to FanDuel’s casino. Then it’s slots and blackjack till I bust, and now I’m betting Chinese ping-pong at 3 a.m.” A year ago May, Frankie married his sweetheart in a grand Italian wedding. The guests sent them off with a pillowcase full of cash. Behind his wife’s back, Frankie lost all the cash, then defaulted on the mortgage for their house. “I didn’t know where to turn,” he says. “Suicide was my only option till I found Harry.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports Those microbets and parlay packs that hooked Levant’s clients are the SBOs’ profit centers. How do we know this? Because the apps themselves say so: They’re the bets featured in their ads. Kevin Hart, Rob Gronkowski, Tom Brady, LeBron James: You can’t shut them up and make them go away when they’re touting props and parlays in every promo. Nor can you squelch their motormouthed peers on the pods and sports-bet shows: the Bill Simmonses and Charles Barkleys and Scott Van Pelts, who’ve merrily boarded the gravy train as “ambassadors” for the SBOs. (Approached for comment, Simmons, Barkley and Van Pelt declined to speak.) “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product,” says Levant. “They’re accepting enormous sums to push [that] addictive product on an increasingly younger audience.” AFTER THE FALL OF PASPA, states raced one another to the betting window, smelling 10-figure windfalls in new taxes. Thirty-nine states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico passed bills that legalized the sports-bet racket. The ensuing carnage was swift and savage. New callers flooded the toll-free hotlines at 1-800-GAMBLER, and frantically searched the web for help, googling “gambling addiction” online. The state of New Jersey saw a nearly 300 percent spike in hotline calls in the first five years of legal betting. (Around six percent of its residents now suffer from gambling disorders — or three times the national average, per a Rutgers survey .) In Connecticut, the number of hotline calls increased 200 percent in the first two years — and the crisis was most acute among young men. “Forty percent of those calls are coming from twentysomething males,” says Diana Goode, the executive director of the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling, who likens the legalization of gambling to the opioid crisis. “It’s literally the same thing they did with pain pills. These companies hand out free samples [i.e., welcome bonuses] to get [young men] addicted to betting.” Gambling-addiction expert Jody Bechtold says young men are especially susceptible to the dangers of this culture because they’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps. Brett Carlsen/Getty Images I put the obvious question to clinician after clinician: Why are young people, males in particular, so susceptible to sports-bet apps? Bechtold, the founder and director of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh, began with the mile-high view. “This generation was basically bred for addiction, [having been] raised on cellphones inches from their faces.” The feeds on those devices “disrupted their neural wiring,” leaving them anxious, impulsive, and susceptible to “stims that are quick and constant onscreen.” Their online childhoods also robbed them of life skills best learned by leaving the house. Fiscal savvy gained by working part-time jobs. Risk awareness from running the streets, and an acquired sense of consequences from actions. “When these kids go bust, time after time it’s the parents who bail them out,” says Bechtold. “Every family I deal with, I say, ‘Quit giving the kid money!’ And Mom says, ‘Oh, I’m not ready to do that yet.’” Bechtold says these things not to shame her clients, but to name the preconditions that make them targets. They’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps; been chased across the web by their pings and promotions; and been told by the celebrities they trust most to think that betting’s how winners have fun. It normalizes gambling as “something cool to do with your friends,” she says. Now layer on the male-skewing lubricant of sports, and you’ve built “a mass addiction machine,” says Matt Gaskell, the clinical lead for the NHS Northern Gambling Service in England. “These companies engineered a product that exploits the reward pathways” of young brains. “The constant crackle of dopamine keeps them playing” — and then a big bump, equivalent to a “spike of heroin,” is triggered by “a win on their team.” Eventually, though, the wins and losses cease to matter. What keeps these kids in action is “that neurochemical feed that fires the desire centers in the brain.” Gaskell’s had a decade-plus jump on his peers: Britain legalized mobile sports bets in 2005. The fallout has been tragic. “We have an estimated one to two suicides a day in England, and many of the ones I know of are of young men from middle-class families with university training” he says. Rather than confront the SBOs by slapping limits on their ads and promos — “our kids see 1,600 gambling logos in a 90-minute [soccer] match onscreen,” says Gaskell — the British government lamely lists “gambling disorder” as an official cause of death. “This industry has captured our policymakers with its billions, as I expect it’s done with yours. So the warning from over here is, expect disaster.” EVER WONDER WHAT LIFE’S LIKE with a serpent on your shoulder, whispering in your ear to bet the Braves? For Andrew, the ex-third baseman in college, that forked-tongue enticer gave him no quarter, hissing Check the bonus! at 6 a.m. “Between the voice in my head and the texts from the sportsbooks, I wasn’t really sleeping a whole lot,” he says in his honey-maple drawl from the Carolinas. “Every night, I’d tell myself, ‘That’s your last bet.’ Then every morning, I’d get up, see the bonus on my phone, and bet double what I did the day before.” He’s calling from his flat in eastern Pennsylvania, a bachelor pad he’s put through the wringer. There are gashes in the walls he’s just getting around to fixing: holes he made throwing weights and plates after losing thousands of dollars in three hours. “I’ve never hit anyone in my life,” he says. “But I’ve got a hell of an arm.” Between September of 2020, when he moved up from Atlanta to join the mother of his unborn twins in Pennsylvania, and May of 2024, when he placed his last wager, he bet more than a million dollars, he says, on live, long-shot parlays and props. He’s not sure how much of that was lost on the apps, but concedes it was “a lot.” A study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average He says he stole cash from his parents on visits home to Greenville, and guilted them into stopgap loans he knew he’d never repay. On blue-sky weeks when he won more than he lost, he’d go out and buy himself something he cherished — a new titanium driver; a pricey pair of Jordans — then sell them on for half when he went bust. “I’d walk around my place whenever I hit zero, seeing everything I owned as dollar signs.” His beloved baseball glove; the cashmere quarter-zips his grandma bought him for Christmas — anything to raise a hundred bucks and feed the addiction. Andrew got addicted to betting in college, playing — and hitting — his first-ever backdoor cover. “I had Duke in March Madness, and was just about to lose,” he recalls. But then a ref blew the whistle as the buzzer sounded, giving Duke two meaningless free throws while up by four. With a make on the second, Duke won by five, miraculously beating the spread of 4 1/2, per Andrew’s telling. His brain went kablooey on dopamine. “I can’t even describe it — it was the best feeling ever. I thought it was gonna work like that all the time.” Gambling experts talk about the “first-win trap” — a neurochemical surge that swamps the pleasure center, sparking delirium only matched by high-test heroin. “The reward’s beyond anything in our day-to-day lives,” says Gaskell. “It’s literally off the scale we see in” brain scans. “There’s a reason we call gambling a substance disorder,” says Levant. “But the substance isn’t the dough — it’s the dopa.” Andrew gave up baseball, got a degree in health fitness, and earned a good living as a trainer in Atlanta. He was constantly in the hole, though, laying a dozen bets a day with the bookies or the offshore apps. Then he met a girl and moved her into his place. Months later, she was pregnant with their twins. “She’d no idea I gambled; no one did, till finally my parents caught on.” That’s the core difference between gamblers and other addicts. There’s nothing physical that gives them away: no unexplained weight loss; no cocktail-hour slurring. That secrecy, born of shame, can destroy a spouse and family. They don’t find out that their loved one’s stolen from them till the marshals are at the door with eviction papers. In 2023, the Public Health Advocacy Institute filed a class-action consumer-fraud lawsuit against DraftKings. A judge rejected the company’s motion to dismiss. Mark Cunningham/MLB Photos/Getty Images For every person hiding a gambling disorder, six people in their orbit are impacted financially, according to the World Health Organization. The collateral impacts of new gambling addictions are just now being charted by clinicians. Among states that have legalized sports-bet apps, bankruptcies are up by 30,000 a year, per a USC-UCLA study still in progress. A second study, from Northwestern, found that eight percent of the households in legal-gambling states were wagering on SBOs — and that every dollar spent on those apps cost households double in net-worth losses. And so states that took the bait of new-tax windfalls find themselves in a hole. Who’s going to cover the living expenses of families ruined by problem bettors? And who’s going to pay for those bettors’ treatment when, or if, they seek help? (Less than 10 percent of gambling addicts ever come in for counseling, per the National Council on Problem Gambling.) Of all the grim ephemera linked to legal gambling, this fact might be the starkest: For every dollar paid in taxes by SBOs, the states spend, on average, .0009 cents providing therapy for the addicts they’ve helped create, according to theNCPG . WHAT’S A YOUNG MAN TO DO when all the outlets he watches — ESPN, Paramount+, Peacock, Fox Sports — either own or have partnered with a sportsbook? When FanDuel and DraftKings push him their bet boosts while he’s scrolling reels? When SportsCenter plates him up a side of “Bad Beats” to pair with its “Top Ten Plays”? The effect of all that noise is to sell a tautology: that gambling is harmless fun when done in measure. It’s both the message and the method of the SBOs, who affix their buzzwords — “responsible gaming,” or RG — to the toe plate in all their ads. I called their collective trade rep, the American Gaming Association, to get a sense of RG in practice. Joe Maloney, a senior vice president, explained it to me — after expressing shock that kids use the apps. “The prevailing legal age for wagering is 21,” he told me. “We verify identities, we verify ages — and if a parent is opening [an account] for the use of a minor, that’s a violation of our terms of service. And if it’s found to have been done, then those individuals are banned from having accounts at these sites.” “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” I granted the point, and pressed him about RG. Maloney was just getting warm, however. “We have a code of conduct that includes not casting anyone under 21 in our ads, and ensuring that the known audience of paid advertising is believed to be above 73 percent 21 [or older],” he told me. “We ban all university partnerships. We ban all agreements with NIL [Name, Image and Likeness] athletes. There’s no leafletting and pamphlet dropping on college campuses. None of those things are permitted.” He went on like this for 15 minutes, laying out the Four Pillars of RG. “Stick to a budget. Bet legally [i.e., on their apps, not offshore sites]. Know the odds. And keep it fun. Do it in the company of others,” said Maloney. “This is not a wealth-creation exercise [or] an investment vehicle. This is entertainment.” Since grade school, we’ve been trained to blame the addict for addiction: a failure of will and want-to in the weak. Even when the truth emerges, we still default to that warhorse, character, as the root of personal ruin. It’s only when the operators are forced to pay out fortunes that we finally fault the poisoner, not the poisoned. Hundreds of billions recovered from the tobacco companies, not counting the giant verdicts they keep losing. More than seven billion from the Sackler family. In America, the facts must defer to the funds. Our justice is a giant cardboard check. No one knows that lesson better than Dick Daynard, the godfather of tobacco litigation. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he founded a pivotal nonprofit, the Tobacco Products Liability Project, as a young attorney in the Eighties. TPLP became the tip line and database for the lawyers, reporters, and confidential sources who finally beat Big Tobacco in the mid- to late-Nineties. We’re sitting at a table in his offices in Boston, a quarter or so mile from Fenway Park. Joining us is Mark Gottlieb, Daynard’s voluble chief of staff, and the jet-lagged Harry Levant, just back from two symposia in Colorado. It was Levant who approached Daynard with his next crusade: suing the SBOs for the harms done to their users. Daynard, a laconic sort who wouldn’t order a hot dog without due process, tasked his staff to study the matter closely. “The doom loop of addiction?” says Gottlieb. “The losses that last till the customer drops? It wasn’t a tough decision to go forward.” Harry Levant is a longtime foe of the SBOs: “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product.” Thato Dadson/Courtesy of Harry Levant Through TPLP’s successor, the Public Health Advocacy Institute, Daynard’s team brought the first sports-bet lawsuit in Massachusetts in 2023. They picked DraftKings as their opening-round opponent. The complaint they filed was a strategic one: a tautly focused claim of consumer fraud. “Plaintiffs allege that the offer of the $1,000 bonus … was and is unfair and deceptive because, among other things, a new customer would, in order to get a $1,000 bonus, actually need to deposit five times that amount and then, within 90 days, place $25,000 in bets with only certain odds of return,” the suit reads. “In other words, the ‘$1,000 Bonus’ is structured so that it is inordinately expensive to obtain $1,000, and the new user is, instead, statistically likely to lose money by chasing the bonus.” “In what world would anyone call that ‘responsible gaming’?”  Daynard says. He filed the case, a class action, in Massachusetts, a state with stringent consumer-protection laws. DraftKings, for its part, filed a motion to dismiss. Its argument? “No reasonable consumer would have understood the Promotion in the terms that Plaintiffs allege.” That pleading was roundly denied by the judge; last summer, the case proceeded to discovery. Barring a settlement, the case heads to trial in two years. Meantime, Daynard’s colleagues are scouring DraftKings’ files, combing through tranches of court-compelled data to see if they can prove that DraftKings’ allegedly fraudulent ads are “deceptive to its target customers,” per the suit. To be clear: Gottlieb et al. aren’t bucking for prohibition. Legal gambling is here to stay, and they’re … OK with that. “Abolishing it at this point is DOA; there’s too much critical mass to take it down,” says Levant, who recently moved to Boston as the gambling-policy director of PHAI. “All we ask for are common-sense changes to the way these outfits do business.” For a list of those changes, I spoke to John Keenan, a reformer in the Massachusetts Senate. Keenan’s seen this rodeo before: He chaired the Senate’s Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse through the last two waves of the opioids crisis. “When you look at Purdue Pharma, what did they have? A new product they hawked relentlessly — and often falsely,” says Keenan. Same difference with Big Sports Bet, except “their marketing’s an onslaught: They’ve rewritten the book on selling addictive products.” So Keenan’s sponsored a bill called the Bettor Health Act. Besides raising the state-tax rate on SBOs from 20 to 51 percent, it would instantly ban all sports-bet ads during live, in-game broadcasts. Further, it would outlaw player props, i.e., a parlay on Steph Curry to hit more than four threes and exceed eight assists against the Lakers. (Keenan calls those bets “the crack cocaine” of gambling.) The bill would also slap affordability checks on the SBOs: “If [someone] bets more than $1,000 a day, the industry has to check [his] bank account” to be sure he can support that action, says Keenan. But maybe the best thing Keenan’s bill would do is force the apps to share their data with the state. “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” IT’S BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR now since Andrew placed a bet — but he’ll be the first to admit he’s been here before. “I quit cold turkey in 2020,” he says, “when my girlfriend found out she was pregnant.” Months of sobriety later, he rented a U-Haul and trucked their joint possessions to Pennsylvania. But driving across the line into Delaware — the first state, by a nose, to approve the apps — Andrew was beset by FanDuel radio ads and billboards. That night, he opened an account, grabbed the welcome bonus, and promptly lost his mind for four years. “The guy I became — I don’t know who that was,” he says. Depressed and withdrawn, “always snapping at my girl; all I wanted to do was go and hide.” He holed up in the spare room of the place they’d rented, betting like he’d never bet in Georgia. “Those offshore apps — yeah, I liked my parlays, but they just had the basics,” meaning money line, point spread, over/under. But FanDuel? “FanDuel was fuckin’ Disneyland, man. You could build your own parlay off a thousand different props — and the crazier the props, the bigger the payout.” That, he hastens to add, is how to tell you’re an addict: “We only play the long shots. Longer, the better.” Seven months after the couple moved north, Andrew’s girlfriend left him and took their three-month-olds with her. Andrew hasn’t seen his kids, now four, since; he relinquished his parental rights during that four-year spiral, failing to appear at visitations. Though he’s stable enough now to send her child support, he hasn’t pushed his ex for visitation. “I have no moral ground to be in their lives,” he says. “I burned every bridge and ruined every trust with everyone I ever knew. At this point, it’s just about living my life and trying to prove I can do better.” Though we’re speaking by phone, I sense his mood straying, drawn to the shadows of the past. There’s a species of forgetting when you’ve lived apart, a gap that can’t be filled by stepping back into the world. Of all the sunk assets, faith is the dearest: faith that you still matter out there, and still share a language with other people. To reclaim that faith, Andrew’s gone public with his story, telling it to anyone who’ll listen. He’s appeared, under his own name, on CNN and CBS; spent hours on the phone with me to be sure I get it all; and made himself available to the people he hurt, giving a ruthless accounting of his sins. He has no expectation that the truth will set him free, or serve as recompense for the past. “I’m just putting this out there [in hopes] that someone hears it and does something before a bunch of people die. The way these companies play you, chase and harass you till you’re worse than broke and get to thinking, ‘Maybe it would be better if I was gone.’”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mobile-sports-betting-gambling-addiction-fanduel-draftkings-1235444172,Entertainment,BBC,"Paul Solotaroff,Eli Senor",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bet-the-devil-LEAD.jpg?crop=0px%2C1697px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-12T13:00:00+00:00,2eec81bda5622269601c6dcb02515557adfd2b80
4aec03e0ed9c,What You Tell an AI Chatbot Could One Day Be Evidence in a Criminal Trial,,"On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht, who was federally charged for setting the blaze that eventually became the massive and deadly Palisades Fire, which ravaged coastal communities of Los Angeles County throughout the month of January. Authorities mentioned various pieces of evidence that they said supported the case against Rinderknecht, but they spotlighted a particularly novel one : records of his exchanges with ChatGPT . The 29-year-old Florida man allegedly prompted OpenAI ‘s chatbot to create images of cities and forests engulfed in flames, told it about feeling “liberated” after burning a Bible, and, shortly after igniting a brush fire just after midnight on New Year’s Day, asked it, “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes?” Rinderknecht has yet to enter a plea, but if he goes to trial, the case could offer a meaningful glimpse into how the proliferation of AI technology will affect criminal investigations and prosecutions in the future. Users have proven overly trustful of chatbots, treating them as therapists, confidants, and even romantic partners onto which they can unburden intimate secrets. The reality is that they are divulging sensitive information on platforms that offer no legal confidentiality, developed by companies that will readily turn their data over to law enforcement if served with a subpoena, warrant, or court order. A New Frontier All this makes chatbot records a potential bonanza for law enforcement, tech and legal experts tell Rolling Stone , perhaps more valuable than the text messages and social media footprints that currently serve as important areas of focus when authorities scrutinize individuals linked to a crime . Generative AI correspondence, too, is soon to be a regular part of criminal investigations and trials. “There is no doubt that AI chatbot logs are going to take center stage in evidentiary disputes across the nation,” says Kyle A. Valente, an attorney with the law firm Bressler Amery & Ross PC who published a paper on the topic last month. “Civil practitioners will want to obtain chat histories to show intent or motive in cases dealing with fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the like,” he says, while prosecutors are seeking to introduce these files to establish elements of a case such as mens rea , or a suspect’s knowledge of wrongdoing. Though a number of civil lawsuits related to user harm are currently pending against AI firms, criminal prosecutors have hardly begun to explore how they can leverage defendants’ chatbot usage to secure convictions. Valente cites one remarkable early precedent: a man from Roanoke, Virginia, was sentenced in September to 25 years in prison for first-degree murder after prosecutors argued that his messages with Snapchat ‘s My AI bot demonstrated premeditation in a 2023 slaying. Before fatally shooting another man in a petty dispute, the now convicted defendant, 18 years old at the time, told the bot he was going to “fight” and asked it, “What if I shot them if they step on my property with hostile intent?” (The chatbot replied that it could not “condone or encourage any violent or illegal behavior.”) ‘It’s Like Your Diary Times 10’ “DNA residue, fingerprints, everything you watch in all these crime shows pales in comparison to the private data that you have on your phone,” says Rob T. Lee, a digital forensics and AI expert at SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training cooperative. “What happens now with AI, you’re having a full conversation with these chatbots. It is no longer just a search for a topic.” Whereas criminal suspects in this past may have been incriminated by a Google query on, say, how to clean up bloodstains, a more comprehensive, detailed back-and-forth with a tool like ChatGPT gives investigators far more opportunities to prove intent and mindset, Lee explains. “All of that is logged, and it’s all sitting on servers,” he says. “It’s like your diary times 10.” “We saw this with social media, where all of a sudden, law enforcement started to understand that a lot of important, relevant evidence could be gleaned from social media posts and profiles,” says Meetali Jain, a tech and human rights lawyer who serves as director of the Tech Justice Law Project and is representing multiple parents in lawsuits alleging that AI products encouraged their children to commit suicide. “That became a standard part of a criminal investigation. I think we’re going to start to see that in this context too.” The difference, she says, is that this next development concerns “machine-generated outputs,” and there aren’t established rules around how this kind of material can or should be admitted as exhibits in court. “It’s very much a live issue,” Jain says. Valente concurs: “At this early juncture, the bounds are limitless until such a time as courts issue opinions that establish some framework for dealing with this type of evidence,” he says. A Fundamental Difference Vincent Conitzer, director of the Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and head of technical AI engagement at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI, also says that chatbot exchanges fundamentally differ from text messages with another person, who we would expect to take action to prevent a crime if told about it in advance. “Will we have similar expectations of a chatbot?” Conitzer asks. “Already the companies try to have guardrails so that their chatbots do not help someone commit a crime, though those guardrails are still very brittle.” Indeed, an NBC News report this week revealed that ChatGPT can be manipulated into giving directions on the assembly of chemical and biological weapons. And Matthew Livelsberger, the veteran who on New Year’s Day fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck parked in front of the Trump hotel in Las Vegas right before an incendiary device blew up the vehicle, used generative AI to help plan his attack. Lee notes that several AI companies have already indicated their ability to flag user activity that appears to foreshadow a crime. “They’re getting much better at detecting foreign adversaries using these systems for malicious ends, and I can only imagine that they’re doing similar for people [in the U.S.] that may be looking to kill or commit acts of terror,” he says. Human Review OpenAI has said it employs a human review team that is authorized to electively inform law enforcement when they come across content that “involves an imminent threat of serious physical harm to others.” How often they escalate to this level of alarm is unclear. “They’re not doing press releases on it,” Lee says, speculating that they prefer to spotlight efforts to disrupt state-affiliated threat actors in Russia, Iran, and China, “which is much easier to get a pat on the back for.” The major American AI players are much more tight-lipped, Lee says, on their ability to detect a possible school shooter, to take one example. And, as Jain points out, if they are picking up these warning signs, reporting them isn’t mandatory. “I think [the companies] are going to say, ‘Look, we can’t be responsible for what kinds of queries users pose to us through our chatbot, we can’t possibly know what he was going to do,’” Jain predicts. She is struck by the fact that when the Justice Department put forward its claims about how Rinderknecht had used ChatGPT before and during the Palisades Fire, they didn’t mention OpenAI or whether the program could have appeared to encourage “harm to others.” Chatbots are known to validate users’ obsessions and delusions , and most of the litigation around this phenomenon has so far pertained to self-harm, as in the suits Jain has brought against OpenAI and Character Technologies. The question of the role a chatbot might come to play in an episode of outward violence or destructive behavior is murkier still. “​​The focus is going to be on further substantiating the culpability of the individual, at the expense of really looking at how the companies designed their chatbots,” Jain says, likening the issue to entrapment, a scenario in which law enforcement induces someone to commit a crime. She envisions prosecutors homing in on a “gotcha moment” in a defendant’s chatbot logs, “without any sort of understanding of how the machine got to that output.” “I feel like it’s going to be a very one-sided story,” Jain adds. “I can’t imagine that a company is going to stick up for the rights of users.” Nevertheless, it seems there’s little the major AI players can do to avoid being drawn into criminal proceedings in the months and years ahead. Valente, for one, expects that their legal and compliance departments will take a “proactive” approach to the problem. What would that entail? “Revisiting privacy policies and updating terms and conditions,” he says. As always, the devil is in the fine print.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatbot-history-evidence-criminal-case-1235444944,Entertainment,BBC,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ai-chatbot-logs-in-court.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:54:26+00:00,4f82ed3df8908158028a9105a09b133a9ce160f8
a4ae316a5b1b,"Her Father Was a Notorious Serial Killer. Years After His Arrest, She’s Still Searching for Answers",,"For almost 30 years, the city of Wichita, Kansas was terrorized by a serial killer. He called himself BTK , a nickname patterned after the phrase “bind, torture, kill” — the signature way he would leave bodies for police to find. His victims varied, first a young family, then women of varying ages and economic backgrounds — sometimes going years between murders. Investigators were assigned and reassigned to the case, poring over clues and evidence. These included letters from BTK himself, taunting police on being unable to catch him. By 2005, BTK was considered one of the biggest cold cases in the entire state. Kerri Rawson — who had grown up in Wichita — was living in Michigan but hadn’t forgotten the moniker of the wanted murder. But when FBI agents showed up to her door on a snowy morning that February she couldn’t reconcile her knowledge of the serial killer with what the people in front of her were saying. BTK wasn’t a cold case anymore. A suspect had just been arrested, and it was her father, Dennis Rader. In June 2005, Rader pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first degree murder. He is incarcerated in the El Dorado Correctional Facility in El Dorado, Kansas , serving 10 consecutive life sentences. But for Rawson, her father’s secret double life — a religious family man in public and a sadistic serial killer in private — has haunted her since the police’s discovery. Now, she’s trying to reckon the man she knew with the murderer she despises. In the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer, the investigators, media, neighbors walk through their memories of the search for BTK — all while Rawson tries to plan out what her future looks like without him. Here are four things we learned from the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer . Stephen King’s interview about his book A Good Marriage inspired Kerri Rawson to break her family’s year long silence . Even after the FBI informed Rawson of her father’s arrest and history as a serial killer, there was a part of the Kansas native that didn’t believe her father could have done it. While reckoning with the news, neither Rawson nor her mother believed that police had the right person. Following the media storm, Rawson says in the documentary that she turned down major interviews with people like Diane Sawyer and Oprah. “I spent almost 10 years rotting inside after he was arrested. Not being able to speak, not thinking I was allowed to speak,” she says in the documentary. “In the Midwest code, you don’t ever air your dirty laundry publicly. You just keep it inside and you look appropriate on the outside.” But one night, while she was watching television, Rawson caught a 2014 interview with thriller author Stephen King . King was promoting his novella A Good Marriage , about a happy wife whose life is thrown into disarray when she discovers her husband is secretly a serial killer. King said he was inspired in part by Rader’s arrest, more specifically, by his ability to keep his murderous tendencies completely unknown to the rest of his family. Rawson felt like the book was exploitative of her father’s victims, and decided that it was finally time for her to share her own perspective. “I had been silent for so long,” she says. “And there was so much stuff that needed to come out.” Rader was known in his community as a kind and quiet man, but his family said he had a vicious temper. One of the biggest shocks after Rader’s arrest was how long the convicted killer was able to plan and execute serial killings in his own community without being arrested or even suspected. People in his community of Park City, Kansas — a small town outside Wichita — remembered Rader as a quiet, kind, and rule-following man. He worked as a compliance officer for the city, and was known by many people as the official dogcatcher. In addition to being a stickler for city ordinances, Rader was known to participate heavily in outside activities like leading his son’s Cub Scout group and doing administrative tasks at the Christ Lutheran Church. “He didn’t just fool his family,” family friend and neighbor Andrea Rogers says in the documentary. “He fooled a church. He fooled an entire city. He literally fooled everybody.” But even before his family was told about his extracurriculars, Rawson says that she, her mother, and brother were all aware that her father had an angry personality that the rest of the world couldn’t see. In the documentary, Rawson says that the family often left Rader choose everything from their activities to the movies they watched to where the children went in their free time, for fear of upsetting him. And they also knew that even the smallest of mistakes, like leaving their shoes out or someone taking his assigned seat at the kitchen table, could result in massive outbursts. “My father, on the outside, looked like a very well-behaved, mild-mannered man. But there’s these moments of Dad, [where] something will trigger him and he can flip on a dime,” Rawson says in the documentary. “And it can be dangerous.” Rader often used his family life as a cover for his murders . When police interviewed him following his arrest, Rader admitted that he used his family events as helpful cover for his murders, but noted that his busy schedule most likely kept him from killing more people. Though none of his family say they had any idea he was a serial killer, the clues were hidden in plain sight. When police first searched Rader’s house, they found his kill bag — a bag complete with a gun, ropes, and other break-in items — stored prominently in the entryway’s coat closet. In Rader’s office, evidence of his kills including personal items belonging to the victims, were kept accessible in an unlocked filing cabinet. Rader and his family were active and often took vacations and trips in popular tourist destinations like the Grand Canyon and the National Parks . They were also avid fishers, campers, and hikers, with Rawson noting she and her father both loved the outdoors. “He said later on that having kids slowed down his murders,” Rawson says in the documentary. “Dad said he got busy raising kids. I think he got busy chasing me.” One of the last letters of clues Rader sent police before his longest hiatus was mailed on the night of Rawson’s first birthday party. But many of those activities also helped Rader avoid initial suspicion in the murders. On Jan. 18, 1991, Rader went to a  Cub Scout event before sneaking away to kill 62-year-old Dolores Davis. After using his station wagon to store bodies and murder gear, he later gave it to Rawson in high school for her own personal use. “That was not okay,” Rawson says. Rawson helped police name Rader as the suspect for at least one additional murder . After Rawson learned that her father was the BTK killer, she says in the documentary that she went through a very long period of emotional upheaval. Days after Rader’s arrest, she and a large group of her extended family gathered in the same house, eating food and telling stories about their treasured memories while the media circus continued to swarm outside. Rawson says it was like a funeral but she still loved her father. Instead, she focused her anger on the media attention and people who were hounding her family. “Our lives were just gone,” she says in the documentary. “It was upheaval, totally insane. I was just mad at everybody.” After her father was convicted, Rawson reached out to him in prison and tried to continue some aspect of their relationship, letting him know she was always available to talk but that she desperately wanted answers. He didn’t answer her questions, but he did say he loved her and thought of her. Since Rawson and Rader had an open line of communication, police asked Rawson to aid them in finding if there were any more victims then the 10 he had claimed.  Rawson not only went through Rader’s personal notes and diaries, but met with him and asked him point blank about the possibility of other victims. Rader denied being involved. After going through his notes and personal belongings, police named Rader as the prime suspect in the 1976 disappearance of one other woman: 16-year-old Cynthia Kinney from Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Kinney was working at a laundromat when she went missing, a fantasy detailed extensively in one of Rader’s journals. Police have never found Kinney’s body, so any conviction would require stronger evidence linking Rader with Kinney. Rader still denies it. Rawson says she can’t reconcile her father with BTK — and she’s done trying to . According to Rawson, the Kansas native has spent much of her adult life trying to cope with the trauma of learning her father’s real nature. For a while, this was alleviated by trying to help police with their investigations, corresponding with her father, and working with organizations meant to help victims of violent and high profile crimes. In 2019, she wrote A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming , her first memoir. Her second, Breaking Free: Overcoming the Trauma of My Serial Killer Father , was published in 2023. Both of the books were national best sellers. But even after helping the police and victims advocacy groups, Rawson says she still struggled with her own repressed memories from her childhood. In the documentary, she describes having a period of night terrors and fearful periods where she was constantly paranoid of a home invasion. These lasted for months, often resulting in her wetting the bed and crying out for help. Now, Rawson thinks part of that may have been her somehow understanding her father’s actions. “I think my subconscious [has been] trying to get it out of me since I was a little girl,” she says. “Saying, ‘Hey, there’s a bad man in my house.’” Rader kept detailed notes about his victims and killings, but many of them were interspersed among writings about daydreams and fantasies. In one of his notebooks, Rawson found her own name next to a date and his codes for bondage and sex. Rawson confronted her father during a visit to his prison. He denied ever sexually assaulting her or any member of her family — saying he only fantasized about it — but Rawson says she exploded. She berated him about how intertwined his serial killing life and her life were. And when she was done, she left. She says the person sitting across from her at that table wasn’t a father she recognized. So she’s done spending so much time trying to make sense of why her father committed his crimes. Rawson says that she will always continue her work with victim advocacy groups, but for now, she’s exploring what her life, memories, and career look like without her father or his impact. At 80 years old, Rader is still serving consecutive life sentences and will never be released. Rawson doubts she will ever visit him again. “I’ll grieve those memories and that girl and that family. I lost all of it,” she says. “But I just didn’t really want to give him any of me anymore.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kerri-rawson-my-father-btk-serial-killer-kansas-documentary-1235443801,Entertainment,BBC,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/My_Father_The_BTK_Killer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:30:00+00:00,223000a1e29f13b60d46c7cb7b230bded6837439
829c9f4048a8,Allen Iverson on Chilling With Biggie and Getting Way Too High,,"In the following excerpt from Misunderstood : A Memoir , NBA Hall of Famer Allen Iverson recounts how he wrestled with success, fame, and lofty expectations during his rookie season with the Philadelphia 76ers — while also enjoying the hell out of his rising celebrity. I was back in Cleveland for our first game after the All-Star Break. I had vowed I would show that crowd what’s up after they booed me. But I had a terrible game, and they booed me again. I hated the Cleveland fans at that point. That’s how it went for a little while — losses, negativity. For the first time in my life, it almost felt like I had lost my legs. I shot the ball terribly. I tried to distribute, but my teammates weren’t making anything either. It was like we had reentered that period where we lost 23 out of 24. The Sixers fans were getting pissed off at the losing too. The negative stories about me continued. I held a little press gathering a few days later, at a Reebok event, trying to turn the narrative around. I told these guys the same story, that I respected the legends who came before me. But then they switched it up and started asking me about rumors that I owned a gun in my name. I told them that I did, and that I had to protect myself. With that as the new focal point, it became more of Allen Iverson is a bad guy but add guns to the mix. Feeling like talking just made it worse, I told the media I was done with that shit. No more press availability. I remember a couple days later, after we won one against the Clippers, Pat Croce came up to me in the arena, and he was like, Chuck, you got to talk to these guys. So I agreed to do it, but I took one from the Coach Thompson playbook and said I would only answer questions about basketball. And that’s how I handled it for the rest of the season. It wasn’t just me feeling the heat. Johnny Davis’s job was rumored to be in trouble, and as the trade deadline approached, I think some dudes were actually hoping to get traded. All this shit hurt, but my life kept on being this dream. Reebok officially released The Question. The authentic me was front and center in the marketing campaign. Of course all my family and friends were wearing them. I wore them on the court for the rookie game, the red, white, and blue matching my Sixers uniform. Seeing them like that — on my feet, family and friends wearing them — was one thing, but I will never forget witnessing them out in the world for the first time. I was in my car, and a kid had the joints on. Just walking down the city streets. After I passed him in my car, I stopped and put the motherfucker in park. I just kept it there as I looked at the kid in my rearview. Kept my eyes on him until he walked out of sight. It might as well have been me I was looking at. Here I was, exactly a year removed from driving that first Mercedes off the lot. Three years removed from jail. Not even seven years removed from walking up to Bethel High, just hoping my name was on the list. Seven years removed from hustling. Eight, maybe nine years removed from swiping worms from the corner store and lifting loose change from cars in the mall parking lot. Here I was, in my Benz or my Rolls or whatever it was that day, watching my shoes accompanying this anonymous kid down the city streets. In spite of all the losing that season, I was loving my life. Makes me think of a conversation I had with my mom — years later, but I think about it a lot. I said to her, “I’m getting scared.” And she was like, “About what?” I said, “Everything is perfect right now. As good as it could be.” “What do you mean?” So I tried to explain it. “You know, I been with Tawanna, shit, my whole fucking life. If her day ain’t good, my day ain’t good. Everything is great with us, my kids are doing fine, my family is fine. All the money we have coming in. Everything is cool. But I’m scared.” “That don’t make no sense.” “Everything just seems too goddamn perfect. I feel like something bad is going to happen.” She just said, “Don’t you ever live your life like that. That’s a blessing, man, God is blessing you, that’s a part of being blessed: things going well in your life. Don’t get scared of that, don’t fucking jinx yourself to where something bad gotta be happening or feel like you got used to bad shit happening in life. You know, life is supposed to be fucking great. I know life is hard at times. But when it’s going good, that’s a blessing. It don’t always have to be bad.” So I always tried to enjoy the good times. But I admit, I was never confident they would continue. That’s one reason I think I played like I did, and maybe why I partied that way too. Like you never know how long it’s going to last. It seemed like it wasn’t supposed to happen in the first place. The Reebok Questions got released as planned, but they were hard to get your hands on at first. Everybody wanted them. I will never forget when I was in LA, and after a game, I heard I had a visitor. Came out the locker room, and there he was. Biggie. I was just like, “What the fuck you doing here?” He went, “I came to see you. I need to get me the Questions.” I had to act cool, having this idol waiting for me, to ask me for something. I was like, “I got you.” Then we chilled that night. And I made sure we sent them kicks, obviously. Man, when I got to the league, it was like a world opened up to me. When I tell you that I was going out with my friends to clubs, out late into the night, many times it wasn’t just us. I was chilling with the dudes I idolized, who, like I said, provided the soundtrack of my life. It started before the draft even. I had gone to hoop at Rucker Park, in Harlem, because you had to play there back then. You weren’t the real shit unless you did. When I showed up, all kinds of people came to see the show. That’s when I first met Biggie and Lil’ Cease from Junior M.A.F.I.A., dudes who’d already done exactly what we were dreaming of doing, conquering, getting rich, and bringing everyone with them. They’d made records. I was playing basketball. So after that with Biggie, we’d chill when I was in New York, or when he was in the same city I happened to be in. One night earlier that year, when I was in New York, me and some of my friends were invited to his recording studio. It’s one of those times it felt like I was dreaming. Everyone was smoking, chilling. At that particular point, I only smoked here and there, and even then, I only started from when I was at Georgetown. So I smoked a little that night, but then I started tripping. I remember I went to the bathroom, and I was wearing this Janet Jackson shirt, and the reflection just started freaking me out. Then I couldn’t find my way back down the hallway to the recording studio. Turned out what I smoked was some fucking hash. I really didn’t know what I was doing. So eventually I made it back after some worker found my ass and took me. Me and Ra and E were just sitting there, tripping, as we watched Biggie work on a couple tracks from Life After Death . At that point, it had been a minute since his last release, so this was going to be his next big one. That night, Biggie recorded parts of “You’re Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)” and “My Downfall.” Ra and E were imagining making it in that world. I was just a fan watching this genius work, man. Flash forward to March 9, about a month after the All-Star Game, and we had a game in Washington. My mom came to DC to watch my homecoming. Remember, I had missed our first game in DC earlier that year, so now I got to play in front of everyone — the USAir Arena was as close as any NBA basketball arena was to Newport News and Hampton. My mom stayed in my hotel. I went out that night until late. After I had gotten to bed, my mom came and woke my ass up. “They killed your man!” I didn’t know what she was talking about. “Biggie dead.” I got up, shook. I had watched him record, gotten him my shoes. He’d been a model for us as we’d plotted getting out the shit. It was crushing. If anyone had been prepared for death, it was me. From all the dudes I’d seen get killed, Tony Clark and too many others to count, it’s fucked-up to say I was used to it. But I was used to it. Still, when you get the fuck out, like I did, and like Biggie had done before me, and it still goes that way? I thought about that shit all the time after that. And I always remembered when I was a kid, in Glen Gardens, with a barrel pressed to my head. Right before he died, they released “Hypnotize,” the first single off Ready to Die . Then at the end of that month, after his death, the “Hypnotize” video came out. It was so fucking epic, filmed with speedboats and helicopters in Miami Bay. The man had made it, was doing it over the top, just crushing it. Before it all got snatched away. They said he never got to watch the whole video. He definitely never got to see the whole album released. But if you watch that video close, you can see it. He’s wearing the motherfucking Questions.

d5dd7f80877b,‘Battlefield 6’ Is a Throwback Military Fantasy That’s Smart Enough to Play Dumb,,"Brooklyn’s on fire . The intermittent pops of muzzle fire are drowned out as tank treads grind the asphalt down Washington Street toward the East River waterfront, where a 100-year-old carousel lays in ruin. As U.S. forces lay waste to the tourist spots and halal trucks in a deadly skirmish with a fictional paramilitary cell, you can’t help but wince in horror. Thankfully, the scene isn’t something pulled from the daily news, even if it’s nightmarishly close to a future many Americans fear. Instead, the violent upheaval of New York City is just one of the backdrops for EA’s Battlefield 6 (out Oct. 10), where 64 players are competing to be king of the hill in a shockingly realistic first-person shooter. The phrase “realistic” is a little loaded; the sequences depicted aren’t exactly what anyone’s really expecting to see anytime soon. But they still hit close to home, and the heavy plodding of infantry and the high-tech physics of crumbling buildings make everything feel about as real as can be. While other games are trading in cartoonish action and power fantasy, Battlefield 6 ’s harrowing gameplay feels like a back-to-the-basics approach, even if it’s still this over the top. After taking a backseat to the juggernaut success of competitor Call of Duty for the last decade or so, Battlefield is back as arguably the most-anticipated military shooter of 2025. And with a pretty solid single-player campaign and best-in-class multiplayer mode that makes the horrors of war into a digestibly addictive romp, Battlefield 6 is a welcome sight, even if it frequently makes you want to close your eyes. Obama-era military machismo Although it’s tried many times over the years with sub-series like Bad Company , single-player story campaigns have never really been Battlefield ’s forte. The newest one isn’t revolutionary by any means; it’s mostly an excuse to show off high-fidelity, on-rails versions of locations used in multiplayer maps for some neat action set pieces. The paper-thin plot follows a group of U.S. Marines as they bounce around the world aiming to thwart the terrorism of a fictional private army called Pax Armata. The story is wall-to-wall clichés, with the playable bits serving as flashbacks to catch audiences up to the present, where the Marines are interrogating a shady government official about how the world went FUBAR. The core cast are forgettable, but the game pulls tricks from older-era Call of Duty titles like Modern Warfare and Black Ops by saddling players with alternating POVs of the events just long enough to learn someone’s name before you’re forced to live out their demise. Battlefield 6 ‘s character are one-dimensional stands-ins that get the job done. Electronic Arts Mechanically, most encounters are just a series of shooting galleries, which doesn’t really play to Battlefield ’s strengths. While some of the areas are relatively open, the forward momentum of the plot means there’s always a right and wrong way to go — although you’ll only find out which when an on-screen countdown yells to return to the combat zone. The level design occasionally takes inspiration from the multiplayer, where the solution to smoking out a sniper is usually to bring an entire building down. But often, it’s confusing in the main campaign. Players are told to clear out a three-story apartment, but basic rifle bullets are bringing the walls down around you, with unknown enemies appearing like a jump scare. The developers admirably tried to include the class system in the story, where each squad member serves a specific role like medic or engineer, but it mostly means that being shot will leave players laying around waiting for a somewhat dim AI partner to come revive them even while enemies are swarming the body. The speculative fiction plot remains politically neutral — there’s just good guys and bad ones. Electronic Arts The campaign is at its best when it’s showing off gorgeous destruction in scripted sequences. An early game HALO jump sees smoke and condensation caking on the player’s visor as they plummet in freefall toward a warzone in Gibraltar. Another has the squad sneaking through the alleyways of Cairo using night vision goggles while avoiding a protest that’s boiling over into a full-blown riot in the streets. The big selling point from the marketing materials is the Brooklyn-based mayhem that takes up a big chunk of the plot in the game’s first act. Bringing the battle home for players to storm brownstones in Brooklyn Heights or desperately traverse a crumbling Manhattan Bridge is effectively scary — for most people. Despite its very clearly apolitical speculative fiction slant, it’s hard not to see parallels between U.S. Armed Forces occupying a liberal city in a video game and what’s happening daily on CNN. The cognitive dissonance is handwaved by sticking the blame on a made-up, morally compromised private army, but it’s obvious that the experience works both ways regardless of your real-life political leaning. For a certain type of MAGA-minded American, tearing through Grand Army Plaza with a 50-cal is bound to be virtual Viagra. For others, it’s a too-close-to-home horror show, although with a healthy dose of NIMBYism — it’s a relief to jump back to Egypt or Iran to engage in the same level of wanton carnage on foreign soil that pop culture has desensitized. The deft trick is convincing you that, no matter why you like it, it’s okay because you’re the good guy. Domestic warfare leans into shock value, but is effective nonetheless. Electronic Arts At its peak, Battlefield 6 ’s story mode operates on the same wavelength as late-2000s military shooters, where morally gray acts of war are a dime a dozen, punctuated by the shock value of domestic threats played out with an immersive POV. Multi-level multiplayer mayhem Despite its surprisingly competent story campaign, the real draw of Battlefield is the multiplayer — and it’s rarely been better than in this new game. Stripping all the fat and gimmicks from recent entries like Battlefield 2024 (2021) and Battlefield 1 (2016), the gameplay style has gone back to emulate the design of the series’ best installments like Battlefield 3 and 4 (2011 and 2013). Since its earliest entries, the defining factor of Battlefield ’s competitive multiplayer has been its sheer scope. Originally 24, then 32, and now a 64-player assault on the senses, there’s really nothing else like what EA’s military shooter series offers. It’s an experience where users can start a match on foot, racing headfirst into a hailstorm of bullets, only to end up in a jeep, tank, or attack chopper raining fire on the roof of an apartment complex moments later. The single-player set pieces go big, but the multiplayer can match it. Electronic Arts The class-based system encourages teamwork; the only way to successfully take control of a designated zone is to throw bodies at it, but it’s easy to get cut down by sniper and artillery fire. The smartest way forward is to coordinate and play your role — whether that’s Assault, Engineer, Support, or Recon. Each class has its own unique abilities: Assault lets players run point with heavy firepower and improved mobility; Engineers can fix friendly vehicles or do extreme damage to the opposition’s; Support can resupply ammunition and revive fallen allies instantly; Recon allows players to spot and mark enemies for higher field visibility. Unlike Call of Duty , where everyone is essentially their own one-man Rambo, there’s more to Battlefield than just sprinting around endlessly killing foes. There is, of course, basic deathmatch, which is playable in both a classic two team setup or in smaller squads of four where the groups are all racing to rack up 50 kills for the win. But the real Battlefield experience is the tug-of-war around capturing locations in prolonged battles of attrition. Modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Domination are all different variations on this concept with minor tweaks to the ruleset that defines each one. Conquest is a large-scale skirmish where two teams fight to control different flagged points around the map (labeled A to F) where holding each point for an extended period dwindles the opposition’s score until it reaches zero. Domination is the same, except with less points to capture and smaller arenas for more hectic action. The modes aren’t that varied, but the core experience remains unparalleled. Electronic Arts Breakthrough is similar, but rather than having everyone on equal footing bouncing around points on loop, it’s a more direct attacker and defender scenario where one team pushes forward, and the other must hold the line. Rush mode is the same, but smaller, and focuses the push on destroying objectives rather than just flooding the areas to control them. While most of the multiplayer modes are different flavors of the same idea, there’s a perpetually improvisational element that makes Battlefield 6 shine where other shooters falter. If a team is failing to take a point because their infantry is being bottlenecked into doorway that becomes a kill box, you can always just remove the entire wall with an RPG. Suddenly, the levy’s broken and everyone can rush. While the slower speed and emphasis on physics, from the long-distance drop of bullet trajectories to the breakable foundations of structures, are a huge part of Battlefield ’s DNA, there’s also just an inherent silliness to some of the tactics that stir joy. Playing to your class strengths is the key to victory. Electronic Arts Playing as a Support medic means you can gain tons of experience and turn the tide of battle by just sprinting around a crash site defibrillating a dozen downed soldiers with a slap in the face, screaming, “On your feet, soldier!” As an engineer, it’s a thrill to ride shotgun in a helicopter just holding down the repair button as a simple blowtorch keeps the bird alive despite heavy fire turning its walls to Swiss cheese. It’s the balance of realism and gaminess that just neatly threads the needle. Nowadays, everyone’s got a gimmick. In the arms race for audience’s undivided attention, both single-player and competitive games have become their own self-perpetuating ecosystems. Everything is bigger, louder, and packed to the brim with pop culture IP skins just to get people to bite. By comparison, Battlefield 6 practically feels quaint. It’s an all-meat and potatoes action shooter that sticks to a 20-year-old playbook, both in how it plays and how it blindly sidesteps any real point of view on its amoral militaristic jingoism. With how overwhelming the noise in both gaming and reality has become, it’s a frankly welcome distraction.

d819e20fb320,She Got a Terminal Diagnosis. She Turned TikTok Into Her Death Diary,,"It all started with calf tightness. When Brooke Eby started walking funny in 2018, she thought it was a muscle issue. A business development manager then in her early twenties, Brooke was healthy, exercised, and had a pretty average work-life balance. But when her limp became pronounced enough that friends started pointing it out, Eby thought it might be a good time to go to the doctor. What followed was years of doctors visits, tests, and absolutely no concrete answers. “They were throwing things at the wall,” Eby tells Rolling Stone . “One doctor mentioned polio. It was like I was on an episode of House . My whole family and I were like, ‘There’s no way it’s something serious. I probably just have a weird foot.’ In hindsight, we were kind of idiots about it.” Four years later, when Eby’s other foot started acting the same way, she and her family finally got their answer. She had ALS . Also commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, ALS is a degenerative disease that impacts the motor neurons of the brain and spinal cords, with a life expectancy of  two to five years after symptoms first begin. The disease is rare, fatal, and according to Mayo Clinic , typically occurs in people aged 60 and older. Eby was 29. “I went home in a fugue state. I don’t really remember, but it involved eating a lot of M&Ms,” she says. “I was like that for almost two months until my friend’s wedding. I had to show up in front of all my college friends with the same walker as the bride’s grandma — same tennis balls on the bottom and everything. All my friends rallied around me, and we were laughing about it the whole time. That was when I was like, ‘I can still joke about this.’” In the three years since, Eby has combined her dark humor with posts about ALS awareness, building an audience a quarter-million strong on TikTok , where she shares the nitty gritty of life with ALS. For some people, activism looks like funding drives, serious speeches, and heartfelt appeals to people’s sensibilities. And while that’s certainly an aspect of Eby’s work, the creator likes to focus on a more frank approach to teaching people about the disease. Eby posts almost every day, with her videos spanning from medical tests charting her muscle and breathing decline to describing what it’s like to have your elderly parents become your full-time caretakers. But the through line in all of her content is using her personality to get people to think more about ALS. “You could read an infographic about how one in 400 people will get this disease, and you have two to five years to live, but that’s not something that tugs at the heart,” Eby says. “So I was like, ‘I’m just gonna do the ‘show don’t tell’ method.’ I remember at the beginning people being like, ‘You seem so happy,’ and I was like, ‘Just wait.’ This disease is not gonna stop just because I’m young and bubbly.” ALS has a long and storied history with celebrity spokespeople and internet awareness . In 2014, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge went mega-viral online, giving the disease one of its first pushes into the global consciousness since baseball legend Lou Gehrig was diagnosed with the disease in 1939. Stephen Hawking is one of the names most associated with the degenerative illness, but he lived an incredibly rare 55 years after getting diagnosed. Eby’s goal is making sure people know what ALS actually does, and why an increase in funding and research could actually change people’s lives for the better. Because there is no one specific test for ALS — and the initial symptoms vary so wildly — much of the time where experimental treatments could be helpful is spent confirming people have ALS in the first place. These treatments can range from new medication to clinical trials aimed at ALS early symptoms. Eby doesn’t like using the word parasocial, but she does note that her content works because it makes people feel like they know her. When she posts a humorous anecdote about accidentally taking a weed gummy too soon and getting stuck in her lift chair, or a more serious update about her paralyzation progressions, she knows it gets people to stop and listen. And for her, that’s the point. “I think people could glean insights from what I’m saying. But I’m certainly not like ‘Today I’m going to preach about gratitude.’ Because I’m not feeling grateful for shit right now,” Eby says. “I would rather people see and connect with me and that way they have a dog in this fight. I want people to say, ‘Oh this girl I know has ALS,’ even though it’s through a screen. I could be your friend, your sister, your daughter. And so that way as people are tracking my progression, they’ll be pissed at ALS and the lack of [clinical] progress.” It’s been three years since Eby started posting about her diagnosis on TikTok, but the changes have happened swiftly. She is almost fully paralyzed, and calls her thumbs “the only useful things” on her body that can still do part of their original job. Most of her editing and TikTok magic happens through voice commands, and she’s able to use other devices such as laptops with eye tracking software. Her voice has gotten raspier and quieter as the months have gone on, but she hasn’t made any plans about a potential future where it goes entirely. “The fact that my breathing is decreasing at the rate that it is, it’s more likely that the breathing will be what kills me before my voice even goes all the way,” Eby says. “It’s very strange that I’m still talking. All the doctors, they’re like, ‘That’s very unique.’ Okay, thank you, exactly what a patient wants to be told.” But even while she’s joking, Eby says she’s very aware that there’s a day in the future where her TikTok followers will be given an update they don’t want to hear — that she’s gone. Eby describes days where a depression over her future takes hold in a “dark cloud.” But she says when she thinks about her TikTok, she still hasn’t figured out what the account will look like after she passes. She’s too busy having fun on it now. “People are always talking about legacy and whatever. I don’t really care,” Eby says, laughing.”  All I really care that people remember is someone like me could get this disease, and that it took me as quickly as it did. As long as when they hear the word ALs, they can picture a face, whether it’s mine or someone else’s. I can’t be embarrassed once I’m dead.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/brooke-eby-als-activism-tiktok-death-diaries-1235443681,Entertainment,BBC,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brooke-Gehrig-Jersey-Nats-ALS-influencer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-09T14:32:06+00:00,805ef2870edad4dc7a2198336dfe400c8a70e3c7
19833bf44b94,Musk’s AI Is Being Used to Make Hardcore Porn: ‘Grok Is Learning Genitalia Really Fast!’,,"If Silicon Valley is a cutthroat place, the AI industry is currently its most vicious arena. Tech giants developing large language models and text-to-video generators are spending billions on data centers in order to stay one step ahead — and, they hope, to meet exploding demand from users. It seems that each company is only as successful as their last update, and tomorrow can always bring another breakthrough from a competitor, leaving them to play catch-up once again. Just over a week ago, OpenAI rolled out Sora 2, the latest iteration of its video tool, complete with a TikTok -like social app where people can share the clips they create. The release wasn’t without issues (there were notable copyright and disinformation concerns ), though for the moment, it looks as if the company has the edge in this particular race. Not to be outdone, however, Elon Musk then began plugging an update to Grok Imagine, the video feature for his company xAI ‘s chatbot. “Grok Imagine is improving super fast,” he declared in a Sunday post on X, his social media platform. One group that would agree with him is the community at Reddit ‘s r/GrokNSFWs , a forum established in August. There, users have been honing methods for getting Grok Imagine to generate explicit adult content — and the latest update has apparently supercharged their efforts. “The grok AI imagine is learning genitalia really fast!” wrote one participant, posting an AI-created clip of two naked women touching each other on a velvet-textured sheet. “Also bath robes are like the easiest way I can think of to get them nude fast,” he advised other redditors looking to fulfill sexual fantasies with Grok. “Bikinis suck because they take their time and half [the] time it doesn’t even work.” Since its inception, the content on r/GrokNSFWs has grown increasingly graphic as users learn the tricks for circumventing moderation — though at least some of them believe xAI has significantly relaxed those safeguards. “You can basically do anything at this point,” wrote a delighted member of the subreddit. “Wild they are allowing this. Enjoy!” The clip they shared showed a blonde cartoon character resembling Princess Elsa from Disney ‘s Frozen films remove a bra and begin performing oral sex on the realistic-looking penis of a male character with no face in the frame. Other videos in the post showed the same character in a variety of sexual positions. The person who generated this content said they had prompted Grok, in part, with this phrase: “Pixar animation style gorgeous super slutty and voluptuous hourglass figure woman with platinum blond braid wearing nothing fully naked relaxed on a couch in a brothel.” An impressed commenter marveled, “I still can’t believe how unhinged the last update was. Not only the nudity but the motions, boobs bounces more realistically, it’s incredible. “Only thing I’m working on now is cumshots,” they added. “Having troubles making the cum shoot from the tip, it usually just explodes from everywhere.” Other Grok content featured in recent days on r/GrokNSFWs — besides several more examples of Frozen -inspired porn — includes explicit imagery of unclothed women performing cunnilingus on each other, women sitting on dildos, women with what appears to be ejaculate on their faces, men and women having vaginal and anal sex, POV close-ups of vaginas, and nude versions of women modeled on comics characters such as Supergirl and Harley Quinn. Users have also commented that the audio elements of the current version of Grok Imagine have made for improved smut. “It is clear that they trained the AI to porn,” one person claimed . “And even the sounds, moans, I had a generation [where] the girl rode to the rhythm of the music.” Some said they had uploaded photos of real women and successfully animated them removing their shirts. “Man the halcyon days of last weekend when it was hard to get clothes off a model,” joked one redditor. The latest wave of Grok porn was evidently so extreme that on Monday, a moderator on the page had to warn members against posting bestiality content or deepfakes of actual people. The proliferation of Grok-generated adult videos is not wholly surprising. Musk has habitually amplified clips of sexualized female figures made with Grok, along with images of Ani, an anime Grok “companion” character, in skimpy underwear. Ani is programmed with a flirtatious attitude and comes with a “sexy” setting (her conversation can veer into the sexually extreme ), while Grok’s image and video generators can be set to “spicy” mode, which is what the redditors of r/GrokNSFWs use. These design choices have allowed Grok to offer far more risqué outputs than comparable AI products, and experts have warned of the potential for sexual abuse . In September, a dozen employees at xAI — which did  not immediately return a request for comment — told Business Insider that they had encountered sexually explicit Grok material and “user requests for AI-generated child sexual abuse content (CSAM).” The same month, Musk announced on X that training for Grok 5, the new iteration of the chatbot, was to begin in the coming weeks. Whether xAI has deliberately allowed Grok to cook up the sort of pornography that rival chatbots won’t remains unclear. But Musk has taken the line that such content often drives technological innovation and adoption. “I still remember 6th/7th grade debates with classmates about VHS vs Betamax!” he posted in August. “VHS won in the end, in part because they allowed spicy mode,” he explained, referring to the home video market for porn. Musk ended the post with a winking emoji. It’s one strategy, sure. The question is whether Grok can survive the AI race as little more than an NSFW alternative.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-grok-hardcore-porn-1235442715,Entertainment,BBC,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/elon-musk-grok-ai-gooners.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-09T00:00:00+00:00,2781b74226e7fd5dc38e359f1a0b154f8dfdd89c
2ae35157e6de,Suspect in Palisades Fire Allegedly Used ChatGPT to Generate Images of Burning Forests and Cities,,"More than eight months after the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles County was finally contained, the Department of Justice on Wednesday announced that they had made an arrest in connection with the massive January blaze, which killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of structures in coastal communities, becoming one of the most destructive wildfires in California history. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, was apprehended Tuesday near his residence in Melbourne, Florida, and has been federally charged with “destruction of property by means of fire,” acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference on Wednesday. This felony charge, he added, carried a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years in federal prison but is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Rinderknecht was expected to make his first appearance in a federal court in Orlando later that day, Essayli said. Rinderknecht has not yet entered a plea. But more curious than the allegation that a Florida man was responsible for setting a small brush fire on the other side of the country that ultimately ravaged the entire region was the “digital evidence” in the criminal affidavit that Essayli presented to the media. Investigators, he noted, allege that some months prior to the burning of the Pacific Palisades, Rinderknecht had prompted ChatGPT to generate “a dystopian painting showing, in part, a burning forest and a crowd fleeing from it.” A screen at the press conference showed several iterations on such a concept, some including buildings engulfed in flames. It’s not clear whether this is the first time a user’s ChatGPT history has been used as evidence against them in a criminal case, nor whether OpenAI , the tech company that developed it, collaborated with law enforcement in their investigation of Rinderknecht. The AI firm’s policies state that they require “a subpoena, court order, search warrant or equivalent before disclosing requested non-content user information,” and only shares content “in response to a valid warrant or equivalent.” They also provide “only the data specified in the legal process,” the policy states. Sam Altman , OpenAI’s CEO, has warned that ChatGPT offers no legal confidentiality . And the AI for Change Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for ethical AI with enhanced safeguards, has pointed out that court precedents are evolving in this area , with judges in the U.S. and abroad ruling that AI chatbot logs are discoverable records. OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment. Essayli said that in addition to the ChatGPT pictures, the Justice Department’s allegations against Rinderknecht are supported by evidence found on his phone, alleged false statements to authorities, as well as “his behavior during the Lachman Fire,” which he is charged with “maliciously starting” on a hilltop in the Pacific Palisades shortly after midnight on New Year’s Day. The Lachman Fire was suppressed by firefighters — according to the criminal complaint, Rinderknecht called 911 several times to report it and then returned to take video of emergency responders — but continued to smolder in underground root systems until extreme Santa Ana winds, hot and dry, caused it to surface and spread  on Jan. 7, then explode as the Palisades Fire. The same day, the Eaton Fire ignited in the San Gabriel Mountains of east L.A. County. That blaze ultimately killed 19 people. While the official statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office on the case does not mention the ChatGPT images discovered in Rinderknecht’s record of exchanges with the chatbot, Essayli seemed to suggest that they could be used in court as proof of premeditated intent to commit arson. He declined to address the question of possible motive. Rinderknecht had been working as an Uber driver in the area shortly before the Lachman Fire ignited, with two of his passengers from late that evening telling investigators that he appeared angry and agitated during their rides. The legal matter of admitting ChatGPT evidence remains mostly uncharted. It’s likely, however, that attorneys and law enforcement will increasingly regard chatbot logs as forensically relevant to prosecutions in the same way text messages and online communications are. They can provide revealing insights into states of mind and individual preoccupations — fire, for example. One might imagine their secrets safer with an AI program than another person, but, as with all digital information, the data can always be uncovered.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/chatgpt-palisades-fire-suspect-1235443216,Entertainment,BBC,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-arrest.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-08T19:56:16+00:00,76d14edca100922f51a9dc68ced7749f12626a16
1930e5e0e3ff,"To Inflict Pain on Russians, Ukraine’s Drones Zero In on Oil Refineries","russian invasion of ukraine (2022), drones, oil and gasoline, military, refinery, vladimir putin, volodymyr zelensky, donald trump, russia, ukraine","Deep in the Ukrainian countryside, under a dome of stars, soldiers carried out final inspections of drones, each with a 24-foot wingspan and 110 pounds of explosives, and launched them toward Russia. The group’s commander watched through night-vision goggles as they faded into the darkness. “In the morning, you will read that an oil refinery is on fire,” said the commander, identified by only his call sign, Casper, for security reasons. Most nights since August, soldiers like these have wheeled long-range drones into an ever-changing set of open fields and let them fly, targeting refineries and trying to inflict pain on Russia and its oil economy in ways that Western sanctions have not done so far. With Russia gaining ground on the battlefield, Ukrainians hope that this campaign, using weapons and tactics that did not even exist when Russia invaded in 2022, will help persuade President Vladimir V. Putin to end the war at last. “The most effective sanctions, the ones that work the fastest, are the fires at Russia’s oil refineries,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said last month. One recent night, The New York Times had rare access to a long-range drone battalion, on the condition that reporters not disclose even a general region, how many drones took off or how many soldiers tended to them. Though far from the front, the troops worked in full body armor and helmets, knowing that at any moment, if their location were detected, they could be targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. “Russia is hunting us,” Casper said. Analysts say the drone campaign is not a decisive blow to Russia, but it is hurting ordinary Russians, and even an autocrat like Mr. Putin keeps an eye on public opinion. By last month, Ukraine had blown up or damaged refining equipment capable of processing 1.5 million barrels of crude per day, or about 20 percent of the country’s refining capacity, according to Avanpal Sehmi Singh, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. Increasingly severe gasoline shortages have hit multiple regions of Russia and Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory, and the price is up about 40 percent since the beginning of the year. Filling stations have limited purchases to five gallons per driver — and in some cases run out of gasoline entirely, selling only diesel, Russia’s Izvestia newspaper reported. Kommersant, a leading Russian business news outlet, said in late September that half of the stations in Russian-occupied Crimea had stopped selling gasoline. Other news media have reported people waiting overnight in lines at the pump. The government has prohibited exports of gasoline since midsummer to address the problem, but it has not acknowledged any cause for the shortage. Russian forces have hammered at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure — power plants, transmission lines and gas pipelines — on and off since the war began, in an apparent effort to stifle Ukraine’s economy and make life difficult for its people. On Friday, a large attack plunged parts of Kyiv, the capital, and other cities into darkness. As the war has continued, Moscow has ramped up a much bigger drone industry than Ukraine’s and has bombarded Ukraine much more intensively, often striking cities and civilian sites with no apparent military value. With a smaller arsenal, the Ukrainians are forced to be more selective in their targets, and they want to show their Western allies that they are not indiscriminately causing destruction and civilian casualties. Ukraine’s leaders have long argued that Mr. Putin would not seriously consider ending the fighting unless Russia suffered more severe economic pain. But President Trump has so far not ramped up sanctions, despite Mr. Putin’s rebuff of Mr. Trump’s proposal for peace talks with Mr. Zelensky. Some of the most important Western sanctions have tried to restrict Russia’s export of fossil fuels, its main source of revenue to support its government and finance the war. But those exports are mostly crude oil and natural gas. Refined oil products like gasoline and diesel are a much smaller part of the picture. As a result, striking the refineries hits Russian people’s lifestyles and expenses, but does not cut deeply into the flow of money to the Kremlin. Moscow will not allow fuel shortages to affect the military, but hitting refineries is an effective strategy for Ukraine, said Vladislav Inozemtsev, an economist focused on Russia and a founder of the Center for Analysis and Strategies in Europe. Russia does little to protect refineries with air defenses, and they are full of flammable liquids, amplifying the effect. When a military factory is hit, it might be repaired in 10 days, he said, “while oil refineries keep burning all these 10 days.” In addition, repairs are hampered by the inability to import equipment from Europe and the United States. Ukraine’s leaders see drones as both important weapons and powerful signals to its Western backers of its desire and ability to keep fighting. Kyiv has invested heavily in developing its own drone technology and manufacturing, with its output growing rapidly in numbers and ability — both the short-range models that are now ubiquitous on the battlefield, and long-range ones that strike deep behind the lines. Casper launched his first exploding drone — an import — in 2022. It flew 60 miles, a long-distance strike in those days. “At that point,” he said, “I understood that this is the future.” The model, the Liutyi, now used by Casper’s team was developed in Ukraine after the war began. In August, a Ukrainian drone hit one of Russia’s largest refineries, in the Bashkortostan region near the Ural Mountains, 800 miles from the Ukrainian border. Ukraine began targeting Russian oil refineries in March 2024, and then backed away from that strategy under pressure from the Biden administration. Early this year, Mr. Trump, hoping to orchestrate a truce, demanded a moratorium on strikes on energy infrastructure, but it was short-lived. Ukrainian officials and troops have long been frustrated by American concerns that hitting Russia hard would lead to escalation. Washington has grudgingly provided some powerful weapons, but prohibited using them against targets in Russia. Using homegrown weapons gives Ukraine more freedom to act, and the campaign against refineries ramped up sharply in August, when the 14th regiment alone hit 17 sites in Russia. The unit began with 40 people and 10 vehicles — today it is a regiment. Officials would not say how many soldiers it has, but a Ukrainian regiment typically has up to 2,000. While Ukraine’s army struggles to muster enough troops for the front lines, the drone regiment has no problem recruiting. Ukraine’s arms industry, including drone makers, has expanded significantly during the war, but it is not operating at full capacity. The most urgent limitation is no longer the ability to make weapons, but the ability to pay the makers. Ukraine is pressing its Western allies to put up the money to increase its production. “If we had billions more dollars, the course of the war would change very quickly,” Casper said. His soldiers are in constant training. Battlefield changes lead manufacturers to regularly adapt their drones, and soldiers must learn to use the new equipment. Out in the field at night, the soldiers are tense. The mission is an attack on oil refineries hundreds of miles over the horizon. The nightly attacks are coordinated between multiple groups, always on the move, launching from secret sites across Ukraine. Midway through the launch operation by Casper’s group, with some drones still on the ground, an alert warned of a ballistic missile threat from Russia. The troops dropped what they were doing and ran flat-out to a dugout. After jumping in, one soldier, still panting, lit a cigarette and spat out, “Bastards.” It was a false alarm. This time. When the threat had passed, another drone started its propeller engine, accelerated to about 60 miles per hour and rose into the night. The pilot called out the altitude in meters — “10, 15, 30” — then switched the drone to autopilot for the trip into Russia. A few hours later, a Russian Telegram channel for local news in Saratov, hundreds of miles away in the Volga River valley, posted a video of a burning oil refinery. “They wrecked something there,” a male voice said in Russian on the video. “It’s really bad!” Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Berlin, and Nataliia Novosolova and Andrew E. Kramer from Kyiv, Ukraine.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/ukraine-drones-russia-oil-refineries.html,World,BBC,By Maria Varenikova and Brendan Hoffman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13int-ukraine-oil-04-lthc-promo/13int-ukraine-oil-04-lthc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:01:17+00:00,4ad4077fa072e54f5a7caa2b3136ea7254b40585
a018084eebf8,Why Ukraine Is Betting on Strikes Deep Inside Russia,"russian invasion of ukraine (2022), drones, missiles and missile defense, refinery, oil and gasoline, volodymyr zelensky, donald trump, russia, ukraine","Movement on the front lines in Ukraine has largely stalled in a bloody stalemate. The Trump administration’s peace talks haven’t budged since Russia turned down a cease-fire in August. But Ukrainian officials argue that they still have a strategy to end the war: Strike deep inside Russia with missiles and drones. Refineries, factories, ports and railroad lines have already been blown up. Ukraine now has an arsenal capable of hitting much of western Russia, where much of the country’s oil processing industry is concentrated. Kyiv has also announced a new weapon, called the Flamingo, that it says could reach Russia’s industrial heartland in the Ural Mountains. With long-range strikes, Ukraine aims to batter the country’s oil industry and bring the pain of the war home to Russians. The question is whether the strategy will be enough to sway the Kremlin to negotiate in earnest. What is Ukraine’s thinking? The ramping up of the deep-strike campaign is Ukraine’s latest reinvention of its war effort. Ukraine pushed back Russia’s initial invasion with the patriotic fervor of volunteer soldiers. Later, President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied relentlessly for Western heavy weapons to hold the trench lines. Now, long-range strikes aim to force Russia into a settlement by inflicting damage on its already strained economy and by spurring a largely pacified Russian public to begin to agitate against the war. Mr. Zelensky calls the campaign “long-range sanctions” or “drone sanctions,” casting it as a ratcheting up of economic pressure. “Putin has been offered many times to end the war or at least cease fire,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address to Ukrainians on Wednesday, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “He spurned all proposals — ours and America’s. So it’s only fair that Russia bears the war’s full cost.” What weapons are being used? The drones and missiles have colorful names like Neptune, Flamingo, Furious and Beaver. Some emerged from a robust Soviet-legacy arms industry in Ukraine. Others sprang from wartime start-ups. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine had a scrappy tech culture. Notable successes included Ring, the video doorbell company bought by Amazon. When Russia invaded, engineers shifted to making drones. This summer, a Ukrainian company unveiled the Flamingo, a cruise missile with a claimed range of more than 1,800 miles. The Neptune is an anti-ship missile adapted to hit land targets. Mr. Zelensky said in recent days that both had now been used to strike inside Russia. Drones such as the Furious and the Beaver are cobbled together from plastic, carbon fiber, Styrofoam and cardboard. Though relatively small, they can fly about 600 miles — far enough to hit Moscow if they can breach Russian air defenses. Ukraine has promoted its increasing reliance on domestically produced arms to strike Russia. But it is also in talks with the United States to obtain Tomahawk missiles , which could add another long-range weapon to the campaign. Mr. Putin has warned that giving Tomahawks to Kyiv would be “a qualitatively new stage of escalation” by the United States in the war. On Sunday, Mr. Trump hinted that he might try to use the possibility of sending the missiles to Ukraine to pressure Mr. Putin into settling the war. What is being hit? In typical nightly exchanges of fire, the Russian military launches far more drones and missiles into Ukraine than the Ukrainian military aims at Russia. But Ukrainian officials say that if their strikes can cause enough damage and mayhem, they could ultimately negotiate a trade: Kyiv halts attacks if Moscow does the same. Over the course of the war, Ukraine has conducted many long-range strikes on Russian military sites like ammunition depots and logistics hubs. Ukraine’s current focus is on oil refineries, which are particularly prized targets that put pressure both on the economy and on morale. Several regions have faced fuel shortages, prompting many Russians to wait in lines to gas up their cars. And when refineries are attacked, their flammable fluids burn dramatically in ways that can be seen from miles around. While Kyiv says it does not target Russian civilians in strikes, some Ukrainian leaders have spoken of the need to hit war-related sites in Moscow itself to change the Kremlin’s thinking. What is Trump’s response? Ukraine has said that it wants to signal to the United States, in every way possible, that it is compliant with President Trump’s demands in settlement talks — including by giving American companies priority in potential postwar mining deals. Kyiv has framed the strikes on Russia as aiding Mr. Trump’s peace initiative, aiming to show that Ukraine has enough firepower to make Moscow think twice about continuing to fight. Mr. Trump has said he supports the strikes.

Mr. Watkins, 48, was assaulted Saturday morning at the Wakefield Prison, the West Yorkshire Police said in a statement on Saturday that did not identify him by name. He was pronounced dead after officers and emergency responders arrived, the police said. Two of Mr. Watkins’s fellow inmates — Rashid Gedel, 25, and Samuel Dodsworth, 43 — were arrested on suspicion of murder and were taken into police custody, the police said Saturday. The two men appeared in Leeds Magistrates’ Court on Monday morning, the BBC reported . Wakefield, in West Yorkshire County, is a high-security prison for men, including those who have been convicted of sex offenses. In 2013, Mr. Watkins pleaded guilty to 13 charges. His offenses included attempting to rape a baby, sexually touching a 1-year-old, encouraging a fan to abuse her child and making child pornography. Mr. Watkins was sentenced that year to 29 years in prison and six years of probation. In his sentencing remarks, Judge John Royce described Mr. Watkins as a sexual predator who used his power “to induce young female fans” to help satisfy an “apparently insatiable lust and to take part in the sexual abuse of their young children.” Mr. Watkins “plumbed new depths of depravity” with his actions, the judge said. Two other defendants, the mothers of children Mr. Watkins was accused of abusing, were sentenced to 14 and 17 years, according to sentencing documents. They were not publicly identified. Lostprophets, formed in Wales in 1997, found global success in the 2000s with hits including “Burn Burn,” “Last Summer” and “Last Train Home,” which reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Alternative Songs chart in 2004. In 2008, the band jointly headlined the Download Festival, a British rock and metal event. The group’s last record, “Weapons,” was released in 2012. The group disbanded after Mr. Watkins was arrested. “We can no longer continue making or performing music as Lostprophets,” the group wrote on its Facebook page at the time, The Guardian reported .

4246205b38e6,Trump and Egypt’s President Set To Host Sharm el-Sheikh ‘Peace Summit’,"israel gaza war, un, palestinian authority, mahmoud abbas, benjamin netanyahu","President Trump was expected to join a summit of more than 20 world leaders at an “International Peace Summit” in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, a conference that has been billed as an effort to end the war in Gaza. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was expected to attend, as part of an effort by regional leaders to push for the authority’s involvement in stabilizing Gaza. The Egyptian government said on Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel would be joining. But in a statement, Mr. Netanyahu said he could not accept an invitation to attend by President Trump because of the Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret, which would begin that evening. Mr. Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu have rarely met in recent years as the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians stalled. President Trump was scheduled to arrive at the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh after a short visit to Israel in the morning. Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, announced that he would chair the summit along with Mr. Trump. Hamas was not expected to participate in the summit. Egypt said it also expected that the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan would attend. Both countries helped broker the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that took effect on Friday morning. The United States and Egypt also played critical roles in the negotiations. The cease-fire, and the exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners that got underway Monday morning, were the initial steps of a proposal to end the war put forward by Mr. Trump in September. The next phases of any agreement between Israel and Hamas would include thornier issues that the two sides have yet to agree on, including a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and whether Hamas would agree to lay down its weapons. Still, in Sharm el-Sheikh, the roads leading to the city’s conference center, where the summit will be held, were lined with banners celebrating an “agreement to end the war in Gaza.” A plaque outside the center hailed the seaside town as the “City of Peace,” a reference to its role in previous peace talks, including a 2005 summit that ended the Palestinian uprising known as the second intifada. Egypt hopes to revive that legacy with a summit that Mr. el-Sisi’s office said, “aims to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to bring peace and stability to the Middle East, and usher in a new phase of regional security and stability.” It remained far from clear whether such a brief gathering could make serious progress toward a final deal to end the war. But diplomats have privately said that regional leaders expect talks on the sidelines of the event could be critical to shaping the direction of an eventual agreement. The leaders of France, Britain, Germany, and Pakistan were expected to join the conference, among others. The secretary general of the United Nations, the president of the European Council and the head of the Arab League were also expected to attend.

63b02be024b9,Coal Miners With Black Lung Say They Are ‘Cast Aside to Die’ Under Trump,"climate change;global warming, greenhouse gas, mining, coal, black lung disease, regulation and deregulation, hazmat, respiratory disease, national mining assn, labor department, donald trump","When coal miners came to Washington in April, they posed behind President Trump at the White House, wearing their hard hats and thanking him for trying to reinvigorate their struggling industry. But on Tuesday dozens of miners and their families will be in a more unusual position: protesting the Trump administration outside the Labor Department building, arguing it has failed to protect them from black lung disease, an incurable illness caused by inhaling coal and silica dust. They have been waiting months for the government to enforce federal limits on silica dust, a carcinogen that has led to a recent spike in the disease. But mining industry groups have sued to block the rule, and the Trump administration has paused enforcement while the lawsuit plays out. Labor unions, Democrats and a growing number of miners accuse the Trump administration of ignoring workers while using hundreds of millions of dollars in federal subsidies to bolster the companies that operate coal plants and mining operations. “The companies might be getting a handout, but the miners ain’t getting none,” said Gary Hairston, 71, a retired coal miner from West Virginia who is the president of the National Black Lung Association. Mr. Hairston has been living with black lung disease since he was in his 40s. Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that President Trump “cares deeply about unleashing America’s energy potential, as well as standing up for those who fuel our country” like coal miners. “Blue collar Americans played a key role in sending President Trump back to the White House because they know he has their back,” she said, adding that “he is working tirelessly to deliver policies that improve the livelihoods of working families across the nation.” Ms. Kelly did not say whether the administration plans to revise or repeal the silica dust regulation. The federal government has recognized the health threats that coal dust poses since 1969, when Congress passed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, which set health and safety standards for coal mining and required federal inspections and monitoring for black lung disease. But now, after decades of improvements, the disease has made a disturbing resurgence, particularly among younger workers because of their exposure to a different material: silica dust. Experts said that is in part because of changing mining practices. Most of the thick coal seams in places like Appalachia have already been mined, and workers are increasingly cutting through more rock to reach coal, exposing them to silica dust. Composed of tiny crystals that can lodge in lung tissue, silica dust can cause inflammation and scarring when inhaled. It is considered about 20 times more toxic to the lungs than coal dust and can also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. The Biden administration set limits on miners’ exposure to the silica dust that mirrored federal regulations covering construction and other industries in which workers are exposed to the dust. It also required mine operators to take immediate corrective action if exposures exceeded the limit. The administration estimated the rule would prevent at least 1,067 deaths and 3,746 cases of black lung. Andy Martin, 68, a retired miner from Norton, Va., who worked for nearly five decades years in Wyoming and Virginia before being diagnosed with black lung, said the rule is crucial if the work force is going to survive. Once considered a disease of older miners, black lung is now being diagnosed in workers in their 30s and 40s . A 2018 study found that more than 10 percent of coal miners who had been working for at least 25 years had black lung disease. In Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, home to most of the miners who planned to travel to the Tuesday rally, up to 20 percent of veteran miners suffer from lung disease caused by dust. “It’s not the coal that’s getting them, it’s the silica,” said Mr. Martin, who paused to cough and catch his breath every few minutes during a recent interview. “We need to get this done for the younger generation.” Limits on silica exposure were supposed to take effect in April. But the National Sand Stone and Gravel Association, the National Mining Association and other industry groups asked a federal appeals court to block the rule, citing the cost to mine operators. “We are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,” Conor Bernstein, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, said in a statement. But while the regulation requires operators to reduce the concentration of silica inside mines through ventilation systems, dust control devices and other improvements, the association argues the government should also allow for greater use of personal protective equipment to comply with the standards, a position similar to one taken by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Miners’ advocates have criticized respirators as impractical and ineffective. The Trump administration did not defend the rule in court. Instead, it agreed to delay enforcement and has since petitioned the court to prevent labor unions and a lung health association from intervening in the case. This month it asked for another court delay, citing the government shutdown. West Virginia’s senators, Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, both Republicans, declined to comment on the rule and the delays. Democrats and labor unions accused the Trump administration of using coal miners as backdrops for photo opportunities while ignoring their health needs. “The Trump administration was handed tools to protect black lung and they are doing everything in their power to toss those rules in the trash,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of labor unions and environmental organizations. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said abandoning the silica standards “would be a real slap in the face for those who work so hard to power our communities.” Mr. Trump has promoted the coal industry since his first presidential run in 2016, when he campaigned with miners. Since retaking the White House this year, he has expanded the mining and burning of coal, prevented unprofitable coal plants from shutting down, rolled back regulations limiting coal pollution that the industry had opposed, and announced $625 million in subsidies to help coal plants. Coal once generated nearly half of America’s electricity but today produces just 16 percent. Hundreds of coal plants have retired since the mid-2000s as utilities switched to cheaper natural gas, wind and solar power. Judith Riffe, 80, whose husband, Bernard, died in March of complications from black lung disease after working in West Virginia coal mines for more than 40 years, said miners deserve an administration that would fight for them as hard as it fights for the coal companies. “Sure, they talk about how much they care about coal but come down here and look,” Ms. Riffe said from her home in Wyco, a once-thriving coal community in West Virginia. “They’re mining a lot more now, the coal trucks and everything are running, but there’s no benefits for the coal miners coming in,” she said. She added: “The coal miners have supplied this country with electricity, and now they’re just cast aside to die.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/climate/coal-miners-black-lung-protest-trump.html,World,BBC,By Lisa Friedman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13cli-miners-promo-vwzk/13cli-miners-promo-vwzk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T09:02:03+00:00,b6148d89f352d16f5b7bd27eb1090bd2af169c69

Says","gaza strip, humanitarian aid, un, israel, hamas, war;armed conflicts, palestinians","The United Nations said in a statement on Sunday that “real progress” was being made in delivering aid to Gaza as the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas paved the way for humanitarian agencies to scale up their operations in the territory. The United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that its aid efforts were “well underway.” Gaza is in the grips of a deep humanitarian crisis after food supplies and other aid had been sharply curtailed since the conflict began. “The easing of restrictions on movement and access in multiple areas” had allowed the agency to deliver medical and emergency supplies where they were most needed and support displaced families to prepare for winter, the agency said. Cooking oil had entered the territory for the first time since March, and tents, flour, frozen meat, fresh fruit and medicines crossed into Gaza throughout the day on Sunday, the agency said. It added that, alongside its partners, it had distributed hundreds of thousands of hot meals and bread bundles in the north and south of the territory. Humanitarian aid has been one of the most bitter flashpoints of the war. A U.N.-backed panel of food experts said parts of Gaza were officially under famine , and aid groups have accused Israel of imposing onerous rules and restrictions on what items can enter Gaza. Israel has rejected the panel’s findings. Israeli officials have said they allowed enough food into the territory but claimed, without proof , that much of it was systemically stolen by Hamas. The U.N. said in its statement on Sunday that it had also secured Israeli approval for more aid to move forward, including water, shelter, medicine and other supplies. Tom Fletcher, the top U.N. humanitarian official, said last week that almost the entire population of Gaza needed some form of food aid, including 500,000 people who needed treatment to address the effects of famine. The agency had a plan to scale up delivery of aid over the first 60 days of the cease-fire, he said. The U.N. plans to send hundreds of trucks into the territory each day to provide food, increase efforts to provide shelter, establish more health care sites and dispatch emergency medical teams into Gaza, and help repair basic municipal services like clean water, a functioning sewage system and garbage pickups, Mr. Fletcher said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/middleeast/aid-gaza-un.html,World,BBC,By Yan Zhuang,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12gaza-aid-gaza-btlm/12gaza-aid-gaza-btlm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T08:13:50+00:00,8d8858d8121bfc6ccbbe27dacfa3f9d0e2c41779
b1252d1f9bb0,"China Hosts a Summit on Women’s Rights, While Stifling Activism","women's rights;feminism, communist party of china, un, lu pin, mao zedong, xi jinping, china","China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, pledged unwavering support for women’s rights as he stood on a stage in Beijing, against a backdrop of national flags from around the world. He praised the achievements of women in sports, technology and entrepreneurship. He hailed how China had supported them to lift up “half the sky,” as Mao Zedong famously said. Mr. Xi was speaking at the 2025 Global Leaders’ Meeting on Women, an event on Monday marking the 30th anniversary of a groundbreaking United Nations conference on women’s rights that was held in Beijing in 1995. During that conference, representatives of 189 countries promised to end violence against women and promote the participation of women in politics and business. Mr. Xi described Monday’s gathering as a celebration of how China had delivered on those promises. “Chinese women in the new era are participating in the entire process of national and social governance with unprecedented confidence and vigor,” he said. “In China’s new journey of modernization, every woman is a protagonist.” But beneath the pageantry, the fight for women’s rights in China has in some ways become more difficult in recent years, activists say. While the 1995 conference was a landmark moment for Chinese feminists, spurring the creation of new, independent groups working on women’s rights, those groups have largely been decimated as Mr. Xi has overseen a crackdown on civil society. The party sees any independently organized movement as a possible threat to its authority. Women’s issues in particular have shown the potential to mobilize huge numbers of people to both online and even offline action, as recent high-profile incidents of violence against women have shown. Women’s rights activists have been arrested . Feminist social media accounts have been shut down. State media outlets have warned against “extreme feminism” and said that it is a foreign ideology intended to weaken China. Mr. Xi has also repeatedly exhorted women to embrace the value of marriage and childbearing, as the government tries to reverse China’s falling birth rate. Local government officials have embraced increasingly invasive tactics to push women to start families. Monday’s meeting was a testament to the rigidly controlled version of women’s advancement that China has tried to promote instead. In the run-up to the event, Chinese publishers released two books of English translations of speeches and articles by Mr. Xi about women’s issues, in which he exhorted Chinese women’s groups not to blindly subscribe to Western ideas of equality. The government also released a report on China’s achievements on women’s rights, in which it said the first step toward continued progress was “upholding the overall leadership of the Communist Party of China.” (Even within the party’s carefully choreographed hierarchy, though, the rise of women has stalled. There are no women in the current Politburo , the Communist Party’s executive policymaking body, for the first time in two decades.) Lu Pin, an activist who moved to the United States after a prominent online platform for feminist issues that she founded was shut down, said that Monday’s conference showed how little the government was willing to do beyond lip service to women’s rights. After the 1995 conference, activists could take advantage of the government’s rhetoric, and its desire to win global standing, to push for real advances, she said. But as the government had grown more confident in its stature, that was no longer possible. “The party-state is so confident in its legitimacy that it’s unwilling and doesn’t need to justify itself domestically or internationally by granting women rights,” she wrote in a message. “The state has largely closed the door to negotiation.” By many measures, Chinese women are far better off today than three decades ago. In 1995, they made up only a third of university students; now they outnumber men in enrollment. As the country has grown wealthier, the rates of maternal mortality and poverty have fallen steeply. But Chinese feminists said the biggest accomplishment was changing societal attitudes. Divorce, once taboo, has become more accepted. Female authors, comedians and directors have won acclaim by calling out sexism. Those changing attitudes have also translated into legal victories. In 2016, the government enacted a landmark anti-domestic violence law, though enforcement remains spotty . The credit for such achievements lies mostly with Chinese women, who have continued demanding equality despite increasing official pressure against their advocacy, said a Beijing-based feminist activist who also participated in the 1995 conference, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government retaliation. An official from the government-run All-China Women’s Federation made clear the government’s disapproval of certain forms of feminism at a recent news briefing. A reporter from People’s Daily, the party’s official mouthpiece, asked how China should respond to countries that use feminism for “political maneuvering” — the accusation that state media often lobs at critics of China’s record on women’s rights. The official, Guo Ye, said: “I deeply resent these voices and people.” She continued: “Those who wield the banner of feminism, and especially extremism in feminism, their goal is to disrupt this country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/asia/china-womens-rights-feminism.html,World,BBC,By Vivian Wang,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13int-china-women-lmtb/13int-china-women-lmtb-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T07:54:22.580000+00:00,e3245e0666cbf6108fa81cba2334e0ce5879a427

Hours before dawn, the tree-lined concrete plaza started to fill with people anxiously anticipating the release of the 20 remaining hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first stage of a cease-fire deal. They held Israeli flags and posters with the names and faces of the captives. The 200-by-300-foot plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art became the focal point for demonstrations after a sit-in outside Israel’s military headquarters, a block away, in the weeks after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, swelled and needed to be moved. The plaza has hosted art installations about the hostages’ plight, including a long rectangular table set for 234 people that is surrounded by empty chairs to represent the captives. After some of the hostages came home, parts of the table were set with moldy bread and bottles of dirty water, to correspond to the conditions of captivity they described. There have also been dance lessons, yoga classes and impromptu singalongs held in honor of the captives, as well as commemorations for missed birthdays. For relatives of the captives, the plaza became a sort of home, and a place to find company in other people who could understand what they were experiencing. Many set up tents in the plaza, and a steady stream of Israelis and tourists visited to show support. During an earlier cease-fire in February, families of the captives and their supporters went to the plaza each week to watch live broadcasts of hostage releases. On Saturday night, it was where hundreds of thousands of people celebrated the announcement of a new cease-fire deal and a possible end to the war.

4c1d0f3954d8,What Is the Red Cross’s Role in Israel-Hamas Exchanges?,"red cross, hamas, israel","The International Committee of the Red Cross plays a central, highly visible role in the exchanges of hostages in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, transporting and escorting hundreds of people to freedom. But the organization says it also does less visible diplomatic work that underpins crucial aspects of those exchanges. “Reducing the role of the I.C.R.C. as just a transport service really misses the bigger picture of what we do,” says the group’s website. “When we transport those affected by armed conflict, it is never just about moving people from one place to another.” The Red Cross describes itself as a “a neutral, independent organization” that ensures humanitarian protection and help for people affected by armed conflict. Since the war in Gaza began more than two years ago, it has helped to coordinate hostage-prisoner exchanges during two negotiated truces, one in November 2023 and one in January of this year. The group has come under sharp criticism from both Israelis and Palestinians during the war in Gaza. The families of some of the hostages taken from Israel have accused the I.C.R.C. of failing to visit the hostages in captivity to check on their health and provide medications, and of not doing enough to work for their release. The organization long said that it did not know where the hostages were being held and that much of its work was carried out behind the scenes. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

c3ea02fd8dd4,They Helped Topple Roe v. Wade. Now Their Sights Are Set on Britain.,"us politics, separation of church and state, freedom of speech, politics, abortion, us foreign policy, international relations, christianity, conservative party, march for life, reform u.k., republicans, state department, nigel farage, donald trump, j.d. vance, england, britain","For nearly three hours, Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain’s once-fringe populist Reform U.K. Party, commanded an audience in Congress on Sept. 3 as he testified against his own country’s free-speech rules. The presence of Mr. Farage, a longtime Trump ally, as the Republicans’ star witness in Washington was not merely a symbol of his growing political clout or the power of conservative populism. Rather, it was the result of a discreet, monthslong campaign by one of America’s most influential conservative Christian groups, famous for being an architect of the effort that helped overturn Roe v. Wade and end the constitutional right to an abortion. The group, Alliance Defending Freedom, has taken its playbook to Britain and has rapidly established itself as a power broker between the country’s rising populist movement and President Trump’s Washington. They are catalyzing Reform U.K., Britain’s fastest growing political party that is seeking to upend the Conservative Party with an agenda centered on anti-establishment and anti-immigration sentiments. The A.D.F. is guiding its leadership even further to the right, on a conservative Christian agenda similar to the one that is sweeping through the United States. The A.D.F.’s British arm orchestrated Mr. Farage’s appearance in Congress, reaching out to ask if he would like to give evidence on censorship and passing on his interest to the House Judiciary Committee, which formally invited him, according to both a Reform U.K. and a Republican official. An A.D.F. lawyer testified alongside Mr. Farage in the hearing, together building a case against what they saw as growing government censorship in Europe. A.D.F. officials have also quietly arranged briefings in Britain with visiting congressional leaders. They brokered a secret meeting between Mr. Farage and top State Department officials in London. And in private briefings, they have supplied the Trump administration with attack lines that cast the British government as hostile to free speech. In Britain it is highly unusual for advocacy groups to hold influence the way they do in the United States. In a statement, Paul Sapper, a spokesman for A.D.F. International — the global counterpart to its U.S. operation — said that the group is “non-politically partisan” and has “engaged with every major political party in the U.K.” A Labour Party spokesperson, however, said there was no record of the A.D.F. having any contact with the party. Britain is, in many ways, an unlikely place for an American anti-abortion organization to build a base and leverage influence. Abortion rights hold overwhelming cross-partisan support and, unlike in the United States, religion plays little role in national politics. But the A.D.F. believes that British politicians, and the public, can be swayed and wants abortion rights to be rolled back, its lawyers said in an interview. More broadly, the group wants to empower conservative Christianity in Europe, and it sees Britain as a key bridgehead. The A.D.F. has begun its effort with a topic it believes will resonate with British voters: free speech. The group is spearheading an alliance of organizations that argues that Britain’s center-left government is too restrictive on political and religious speech. “What’s emerging in the U.K. is a free-speech alliance of disparate groups who are all, for various reasons, shocked that we’ve ended up in the position we are here now,” Lorcán Price, a lawyer for the A.D.F. who has been at the center of the group’s efforts in Britain, said in an interview. The question of censorship has rocketed to the top of the political agenda in Britain this year. Groups on the right have raised alarms about the arrests of people who posted inflammatory anti-migrant messages online during riots last summer, while those on the left have criticized the arrests of hundreds of peaceful pro-Palestinian protesters under terrorism laws . In the United States, the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk propelled the Trump administration to promise to punish people they accuse of hateful speech . For the A.D.F., freedom of speech is intrinsically tied to religious freedom. Its task force of lawyers in Britain has challenged the prosecutions of Christians who were arrested for praying silently outside abortion clinics, and taken up the case of a student midwife who was suspended after making anti-abortion comments on social media. Abortion “buffer zones” — protected areas around clinics designed to prevent harassment — have been cited by conservative groups like the A.D.F. to declare a free speech crisis in Britain. Despite its growing presence in Britain, the A.D.F. has remained relatively obscure, unlike in America, where it has grown powerful through high-profile Supreme Court cases that have carved out more space for Christianity in public life. The group has represented clients in the United States who are opposed to abortion, gay and transgender rights and contraception coverage in health care. Its allies include Vice President JD Vance and Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, who is a former A.D.F. lawyer. Britain has no similarly prominent political figures who push for the Christian faith to have a central role in government. The A.D.F. has cultivated an unlikely ally in Mr. Farage, who has previously described himself as a supporter of abortion rights and does not attend church, following a high-profile spat with the Church of England, which he described as “woke.” As the A.D.F.’s influence in Britain has grown since Mr. Trump’s re-election, Mr. Farage has suddenly started speaking out against abortion. The New York Times could find no previous record of him campaigning against abortion during his 31-year political career — in fact, in 2019, as the leader of the Brexit Party, Mr. Farage stated he had no official party stance on abortion . In November, he called for British lawmakers to debate rolling back the abortion limit . He went further in May, calling the current limit of 24 weeks “utterly ludicrous.” Until now, public knowledge about the relationship between Reform U.K. and the A.D.F. was limited to a single quote Mr. Farage gave to the group, which they pushed out in a press statement . But the A.D.F. has quietly been courting the party since at least 2024. When asked in a brief phone interview with The Times about his relationship with the A.D.F., Mr. Farage said that his party talks with “all sorts of groups.” He denied speaking against abortion, telling a reporter that she was “talking utter bollocks,” a crude British slang term for nonsense that he repeated six times. He said that abortion was “No. 468” on Reform U.K.’s agenda and noted he had “hardly ever spoken about it in 30 years.” “My point was that the 24-week limit was looking in serious jeopardy given that we actually spend a fortune saving babies at 22 weeks,” he said. “Maybe we need to rethink all of that because there is clearly a legal inconsistency.” The A.D.F. and other American anti-abortion groups used a similar argument — incrementally rolling back the cutoff on abortion from about 24 weeks to earlier gestational limits — to ultimately end the constitutional right to abortion. For the A.D.F., the relationship with Mr. Farage appears to be a pragmatic one, similar to its dynamic with Mr. Trump. A disrupter with no consistent personal stance on abortion, Mr. Trump provided critical support for the A.D.F. and its broader conservative Christian alliance to win their half-century-long campaign to topple Roe v. Wade. “Our primary objective is to try and ensure that the human-rights framework applies as robustly as possible to Christians. And then the wider society,” Mr. Price said. In the United States, the A.D.F. worked with conservative lawmakers and strategically used the courts to eventually overthrow the right to abortion. But in England, abortion access is legislated through Parliament and cannot be overturned through a judicial decision. To succeed in Britain, the A.D.F. would have to adapt its playbook. Shaping Public Opinion Since 2020, the A.D.F. has quietly added more staff to its British operation. It increased the size of its team fourfold to 12 employees and quadrupled the money it sends to its British arm to more than 1 million pounds, or $1.35 million. Its lawyers tried to get officials to notice free speech issues through clients it called “victims of censorship,” but were largely unsuccessful. That changed when Mr. Vance, a Catholic who shares similar values as the A.D.F., became vice president. Almost immediately the organization’s message reached a global audience. At the Munich Security Conference in February, one of the biggest international stages in politics, Mr. Vance used his platform to criticize an ally. “In Britain, and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat,” he said. He highlighted the case of Adam Smith-Connor, an A.D.F. client who had been convicted after silently praying within an abortion clinic buffer zone in southwest England. Mr. Price, the A.D.F. lawyer, privately credited the A.D.F. for getting Mr. Vance to mention the case in his speech, according to two British and U.S. officials he briefed. Mr. Price told the Times that he did not personally speak to anyone from Mr. Vance’s team and was “as surprised as anyone” by the mention in Munich. Such a diplomatic and publicity win was important for the A.D.F. Drawing attention to cases like Mr. Smith-Connor’s is part of a long-term strategy to shift public opinion around abortion. In the United States, more than a decade ago, anti-abortion activists challenged similar buffer-zone laws as part of their long-term strategy to shift political discourse with the goal of rolling back abortion rights. “The debate is in Parliament,” Mr. Price said. “And the parliamentarians are elected by the people, and so their priorities will only change when the public mood changes. And the public mood is changing.” The A.D.F. is also focusing its efforts on raising support on university campuses and social media platforms, like X, which can magnify fringe views. Mr. Price said that Elon Musk, X’s owner, has personally posted about some of A.D.F.’s cases, and that X was amplifying the group’s concerns about Britain and freedom of speech in a “way that probably didn’t attract the same amount of attention in the past.” It has achieved such success through deliberately framing its cases as being about protecting free speech, rather than restricting abortion. A.D.F. employees, who are not registered lobbyists in Britain, don’t lobby but do “offer briefings to anybody who wishes to access it,” Mr. Price said. Until recently, the group was a stakeholder of one of the biggest interest groups of cross-party lawmakers in Westminster, the All-Parliamentary Group on International Freedom of Religion or Belief. It provided the A.D.F. with access to Parliament and politicians like Fiona Bruce, a former Conservative lawmaker who was the prime minister’s special envoy on religion until 2024. The A.D.F. is not focused on Britain only because of its free speech issues. It also recognizes the political and legal influence that Britain holds abroad. “What the U.K. says matters internationally,” Mr. Price said. “If things change for the better here, it has an effect more widely.” By Mr. Price’s telling in the interview, A.D.F. International relies simply on social media and public outrage to amplify its work. He played down his organization’s political influence in both Britain and the United States and rejected the notion that it acts as a power broker. When later asked about briefings and meetings that The Times reported that the A.D.F. had brokered, Mr. Sapper, the spokesman for the group, declined to discuss the matter. “It is our policy to not publicly disclose the details of private conversations or whether they have occurred,” he said. A Secret Meeting A private area for members of the Old Queen Street Cafe, a brasserie steps away from Parliament that’s often abuzz with lunching politicians, was usually closed at 8:15 in the morning. But a manager had been persuaded to open early for a confidential, high-level meeting in March that, messages show, the A.D.F. had brokered. The group’s aim was to get Mr. Farage in a room with Samuel Samson, a young Trump political appointee and senior adviser for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, a U.S. official with knowledge of the events said. Mr. Price wanted the American right to forge its relationship with Britain through Reform U.K., as he believed they were the only credible party taking censorship in Britain seriously, according to the U.S. official and a Reform U.K. source. Mr. Samson was in Britain as part of a State Department delegation he was leading that addressed free speech, following concerns that Mr. Vance raised. The U.S. Embassy in London oversaw the visit, but at that point its diplomats did not have a significant relationship with Reform U.K. Back in March, Mr. Farage’s party did not have a single elected council member in municipalities and also was not yet topping public opinion polls . (Today, it is consistently leading the Labour Party in the polls, had 677 council members elected in May’s local elections, but still has only five elected national lawmakers). Mr. Price suggested the Old Queen Street Cafe meeting and knew exactly whom to contact to make it happen. He was the middleman for the visit, liaising with Mr. Farage’s team and confirming his attendance to U.S. officials, according to messages and two officials with knowledge of the meeting. Over breakfast, Mr. Farage and Mr. Samson discussed abortion buffer zones, censorship cases and online safety laws, according to the officials. Also present were aides and two of the embassy’s top diplomats, who had joined for oversight of the issues, which were high priorities for the new Trump administration, one of the officials said. A State Department official said such a meeting was standard procedure for the department, which said in a statement that it does not comment on the contents of those meetings. A spokesman for the United States Embassy in London said officials regularly meet with those from different faiths and “elements of the political spectrum” in Britain and “anywhere else where freedom of expression is under threat.” The A.D.F. isn’t targeting only Trump-aligned conservatives and populists. Its lawyers are eager to point to supporters it has recruited from different political and religious areas — like Claire Fox, an independent peer in Parliament’s House of Lords and an avid supporter of abortion rights who also shares the A.D.F.’s opposition to buffer zones. “You don’t have to be anti-abortion to oppose buffer zones,” she said. “I despise the people protesting outside abortion clinics, but I don’t agree with banning them,” she added, describing herself as a “free speech absolutist.” But the A.D.F.’s most powerful allies remain in the Trump administration. On two occasions this summer, the A.D.F. was invited to brief senior U.S. officials. In May, they provided the State Department with a private briefing of examples of government efforts to restrict free speech in Britain, communications show. And in June, Mr. Price and a colleague met with Mr. Trump’s new ambassador to Britain, Warren Stephens, a wealthy investment banker from Arkansas with longtime ties to anti-abortion politicians like Mike Huckabee. Shortly afterward, U.S. officials asked for Mr. Price’s help organizing a second meeting between officials and free speech organizations to discuss censorship issues they felt were pertinent for the Trump administration to be pressing the British government on. ‘Under the Radar’ On July 29, the congressional delegation from the House Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican, filed into the Grand Committee Room inside Westminster Hall. The lawmakers were there for a “Civil Society Round Table,” as it was listed on the delegation schedule, as part of their fact-finding mission on free speech and censorship in Europe. But Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, had a surprise as he entered. Sitting on a dais was Mr. Farage, seemingly presiding over the event. “I did not know he was going to be there until I was in the room,” Mr. Raskin said in an interview. Some participants had been told he might pop by, others had no idea. Even U.S. officials who had helped organize the visit were informed only days before that Mr. Farage would be speaking. He was not just participating — he was hosting the event. It was a big moment for the A.D.F., which had secured his participation, according to two officials with knowledge of the event. The group had worked behind the scenes for months to shape the agenda of the Congressional visit, privately briefing the U.S. lawmakers in Brussels just before the London round table, helping organize precursor briefings between congressional staffers and British free speech organizations, and inviting speakers who were presenting arguments alongside Mr. Farage against technology legislation and abortion clinic buffer zones. In his opening remarks, the Reform U.K. leader said that the United States and Britain shared a commitment to not only free speech, but also the promotion of “Judeo-Christian values,” according to six people present. It was a phrase foreign in British politics, but common in the United States, where the Christian right has sought for years to elevate America as a Christian nation. Yet Mr. Farage has occasionally cited a need to return to Judeo-Christian values as a way to promote his populist message. “To be honest I don’t think Farage does religion,” said Bryn Harris, chief legal counsel for the Free Speech Union, who was present. “I think the main thing is that the buffer zone cases have really caught the imagination of some people in the U.S., and therefore when you want to talk about free speech to an American audience, that’s often a good shorthand.” To many present, the A.D.F.’s role as an essential trans-Atlantic conduit was undeniable — as was the developing alliance between the group and Reform U.K. “I had a clear sense that we were also there to help Nigel Farage,” Mr. Raskin said of the trip. “We were there to bolster his political fortunes and to make him the free speech hero of Europe.” But ultimately, Mr. Raskin said, “the political themes and the legal cases that the A.D.F. invoked were the dominant messaging of our entire trip.” “The trip solidified my impression that A.D.F. has been shaping Trump administration and MAGA policy toward Europe,” he said. Two days after testifying to Congress in Washington on Sept. 3, Mr. Farage was back in Britain for his first Reform U.K. party conference as leader, telling a rapturous audience in Birmingham, “We are the party on the rise.” A British MAGA undercurrent ran through the event, as seen in the “Make Britain Great Again” baseball caps, and heard in Mr. Farage’s nationalistic speech , in which he railed against mass immigration, “society breakdown with law and order” and “sky high” taxes. Mr. Farage made no mention of abortion, as he had in Congress, to his British audience. But he did attack the government for doing “everything they can to crush free speech online,” and claimed that Britain refuses “to acknowledge publicly the Judeo-Christian culture and heritage that we have and that underpins everything that we are.” His words signaled that the inroads of the American Christian right are strengthening, both in and out of public view. That same weekend, some 120 miles away in London, A.D.F. staff members took part in the March for Life U.K., an anti-abortion rally led by one their clients. On a stage at the event, Fiona Bruce, the former conservative lawmaker whom the A.D.F. had long courted, introduced one of its lawyers. Perhaps the crowd had never heard of the A.D.F., she said, but that was not all that surprising. “Very often A.D.F. has operated under the radar,” she said, “quite discreetly.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/uk-abortion-farage.html,World,BBC,By Jane Bradley and Elizabeth Dias,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/25/multimedia/00uk-abortion-fzpl/00uk-abortion-fzpl-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T04:01:12+00:00,2ca6ee6f69c335d26241a74f2a1bbb5a8695f0a5
11315cd048b2,Our Correspondents Explain Why a U.S. Anti-Abortion Group Is Eyeing Britain,"abortion, reform party, christianity, separation of church and state, freedom of speech, politics, alliance defending freedom, republicans, donald trump, nigel farage, england","Jane Bradley: Elizabeth, I’ve been covering nationalist right-wing politics in Britain for years, and I have to say I never thought I’d be partnering with our religion correspondent to write about British politics. We just don’t have the same kind of religious identity in politics over here. We have lawmakers who are religious, of course, but they don’t usually talk about Christian values on the campaign trail or see their faith as driving policy. It feels so different from America. Elizabeth Dias : Different is an understatement! I’ve covered religion and politics here for more than 15 years, and conservative Christianity has only gotten more fused with right-wing politics, especially since President Trump’s rise to power. Conservative evangelicals and Catholics have reached such a height of power here, largely by joining forces with Trump, and they are setting their sights abroad. Which brings us to London. Jane : Our article today revealed how a Christian legal group, the Alliance Defending Freedom, is working to change the political discussion around religion and abortion. Its British arm has positioned itself as a power broker between MAGA Republicans and Britain’s rising populist movement — specifically and most influentially, with Nigel Farage and his Reform U.K. Party. A.D.F. frames its mission as being about free speech, which it says is in “crisis” in Britain. But the ultimate goal its lawyers said in an interview with me, is to roll back abortion rights in Britain. That’s ambitious. Almost 90 percent of Brits support a right to abortion , which is legal within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. It has wide cross-party support and Parliament voted in June to stop women from being prosecuted for abortions outside that limit. Although those who help them — like medical staff — still can be. Elizabeth : Politically, Britain has definitely gone in the opposite direction of the United States. But I am fascinated that Brits generally assume that abortion rights will always be protected. The story in America also shows how sustained political pressure and political surprises, like Trump’s 2016 election, can change long-held norms. For example, even though Roe v. Wade was overturned, there’s actually only one state where a majority of adults say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases — Arkansas. So public opinion doesn’t always correlate to political outcome. Jane : Why do you think A.D.F. is focusing on Britain? Besides the political and cultural challenges, the law just works differently. Abortion access in England and Wales is legislated by Parliament. Courts can’t overturn it, so the legal playbook that worked in the United States won’t work in Britain, right? Elizabeth : True, but A.D.F. thinks in terms of making incremental, long-term cultural change. In Britain, that means creating political alliances and bringing abortion into mainstream conversation. Britain has a lot of influence in Europe, so it’s a good target. It’s also part of a trans-Atlantic alliance that is growing during Trump’s second term. Jane : Yep, and at the heart of that alliance is Nigel Farage and his populist Reform U.K. Party. In public, the A.D.F. and Reform have been careful to keep their growing relationship quiet. But we found out that A.D.F. officials have quietly arranged briefings in Britain and invited Farage to speak to visiting congressional leaders. A.D.F. also brokered a secret meeting between Farage and top State Department officials in London. And suddenly, Farage has started calling for abortion limits to be rolled back. Although, I had an interested phone call with Farage who said it was “number 468” on Reform’s agenda and that the party talks with “all sorts of groups.” Elizabeth : I thought it was incredibly telling when we learned that Farage is even using language of the Christian right in the United States — like talking about how the two countries share “Judeo-Christian values.” Jane : I’ve been covering British politics for nearly two decades, and I couldn’t recall a politician ever using that term. When I did some digging, I did see that Farage had started sporadically using it a couple or so years ago, but it’s just not a term you usually hear on the campaign trail. And none of the other British political figures I spoke with understood the significance of the term either. Elizabeth : The Americans we interviewed, though, all understood it. And they see it in the broader context of a movement to elevate the place of Christianity in American public life. Jane : Farage used the term in a speech at the annual Reform Party conference last month. But I noticed he didn’t mention abortion like he did when he testified at a congressional hearing in Washington just a couple of days earlier. So it seems like he knows his audience. For now, though, it seems like the most prominent shared talking point for both A.D.F. and Reform is criticism of the British government’s record on free speech. That topic has obviously been driven to the top of the political agenda after the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Elizabeth : I was at his memorial service in Arizona , where it was clear how tightly conservative Christianity and the government have merged here. The issues about free speech are only escalating, both here and in Britain.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/abortion-farage-takeaways.html,World,BBC,By Elizabeth Dias and Jane Bradley,https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,2025-10-13T04:01:01.999000+00:00,30663182a8ff69105c71fa0a68e5f051d2028fb2
f2cb84fb4907,Windows 10 Is Dead. Upgrade to One of These Great Windows 11 Laptops,"laptops, shopping, windows, computers, microsoft, dell, lenovo, windows pcs, buying guides","You'll want to read our extensive guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop , but for the basics, you'll want to decide what category of laptop you need. Most people should buy a 13-inch or 14-inch laptop, and spending around $750-$1,000 is a good place to start. You should expect a laptop around this price to get good battery life, have a decent screen, perform well enough for basic tasks, and have a comfortable keyboard and touchpad. You should also expect at least 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. Anything more than that gets into premium territory where you're paying for higher specs, more performance, or extra features. If you want something with a discrete GPU for either gaming or creative workflows, you'll need to spend more than this. A laptop like the Dell 14 Plus is the ideal example of what you can get while shopping in this price range. You can even find laptops with OLED panels, up to one terabyte of storage, depending on how good discounts happen to be. I would consider anything under $750 to be a cheap laptop , and will therefore come with some significant compromises, especially around the quality of the panel and the touchpad. Fortunately, laptops that use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip get great battery life, despite often falling under $750 in price. Here's a list of important specs to consider: CPU: For thin and light laptops, I would recommend one of the Snapdragon X, X Plus, or X Elite chips. They get the best battery life and performance for their class of laptop. As an alternative, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is also quite good. GPU: As of now, the Intel's Lunar Lake chips, such as the Core Ultra 7 258V, have the best integrated graphics. For discrete options, you'll want to pick something with one of the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, such as the RTX 5060. The biggest leap in performance there is between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti, which increases VRAM to 12 GB. RAM (or memory): Stick with at least 16 GB if you can. Since the advent of the Copilot+ designation, it ha become the new standard. You'll even find laptops as cheap as $600 that have 16 GB of memory. Gamers and content creators should upgrade to 32 GB if possible. Storage: Similar to memory, many laptops have moved to 512 GB as the new standard, and you'll find lots of affordable laptops with 512 GB as the base configuration. Upgrading to one or two terabytes, where possible, will make your life that much easier, especially since many laptops don't offer expandable storage. Display: Laptops are usually categorized by screen size, with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch being the most common. You'll want to consider size, resolution, refresh rate , and panel type here. Portability: Outside of display size, thickness of the chassis and weight are the primary factors here, determining how portable a laptop is to travel with. Other dimensions are important too, but more often than not, that is determined by the screen size. Ports: Many laptops are limited to just USB-C and headphone jack these days, with some exceptions where USB-A or HDMI are included. Make sure your laptop has what you need, or else you'll need a USB Hub or laptop docking station to get more ports or to increase external display support.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-windows-laptops,Technology,BBC,Luke Larsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e972a9adf8b328300b90b3/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Windows%2010%20Is%20Dead.%20Upgrade%20to%20One%20of%20These%20Great%20Windows%2011%20Laptops.png",2025-10-13T12:00:00+00:00,115f99c504571b96332341be5c52b0a74567deef
4d8b46b6b44a,"Programming in Assembly Is Brutal, Beautiful, and Maybe Even a Path to Better AI","machine readable, coding, programming, computers, software","Rollercoaster Tycoon wasn’t the most fashionable computer game out there in 1999. But if you took a look beneath the pixels—the rickety rides, the crowds of hungry, thirsty, barfing people (and the janitors mopping in their wake)—deep down at the level of the code , you saw craftsmanship so obsessive that it bordered on insane. Chris Sawyer, the game’s sole developer, wrote the whole thing in assembly. Certain programming languages, like Python or Go or C++, are called “high-level” because they work sort of like human language, written in commands and idioms that might fit in at a poetry slam. Generally speaking, a piece of software like a compiler transforms this into what the machine really reads: blocks of 1s and 0s (or maybe hex) that tell actual transistors how to behave. Assembly, the lowest of the “low-level” languages, has a near one-to-one correspondence with the machine’s native tongue. It’s coding straight to metal. To build a complex computer game from assembly is like weaving a tapestry from shedded cat fur. Why would anyone do this? I recently asked Sawyer, who lives in his native Scotland. He told me that efficiency was one reason. In the 1990s, the tools for high-level programming weren’t all there. Compilers were terribly slow. Debuggers sucked. Sawyer could avoid them by doing his own thing in x86 assembly, the lingua franca of Intel chips. We both knew that wasn’t the real reason, though. The real reason was love. Before turning to roller coasters, Sawyer had written another game in assembly, Transport Tycoon . It puts players in charge of a city’s roads, rail stations, runways, and ports. I imagined Sawyer as a model-train hobbyist—laying each stretch of track, hand-sewing artificial turf, each detail a choice and a chore. To move these carefully crafted pixels from bitmaps to display, Sawyer had to coax out the chip’s full potential. “ RollerCoaster Tycoon only came about because I was familiar with the limits of what was possible,” he told me. Working within the limits? A foreign idea, perhaps, in this age of digital abundance, when calling a single function in an AI training algorithm can engage a million GPUs. With assembly, you get one thing and one thing only, and it is the thing you ask for—even, as many a coder has learned the hard way, if it is wrong. Assembly is brutal and beautiful that way. It requires you to say exactly what you mean. I’ve done assembly’s creators a disservice. They wanted things to be easier, not harder. I imagine they were tired of loading up punchcards and flipping switches on their steampunk leviathans. Perhaps they dreamed of a world like ours, where computers can do so much with such minimal guidance.",https://www.wired.com/story/programming-assembly-artificial-intelligence,Technology,BBC,Gregory Barber,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e6c45f693f7ce213ae491f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/MR%20011%20'Assembly%20Codes'.jpg",2025-10-13T11:00:00+00:00,58163628e49b9ee6948c5670e321f73418678b7b
73c3efd70e75,How to Make STEM Funny—and Go Viral Doing It,"stem, comedy","Wait, I saw this. You posted a video of someone in the crowd telling you they were a veterinarian and then you said “ OK, some of this might not be right … ” and then that got a laugh. Yeah, definitely. I normally start shows by saying I have a degree in chemistry, and then asking who else does. If there's anyone in there that has a degree in chemistry of a higher level or from a better university, I'm cooked. What's the worst heckle you've ever gotten? I did a work in progress show last Sunday, and I was doing a joke about exothermic reactions. This is the joke where you ask if the audience wants to hear about exothermic reactions and then say you don’t have the energy . Yeah, and in my head, I swear it's right. But I just hear a little voice that goes, “Actually, I think if you change that to activation energy , it will work much better.” OK, fair, but yours also works, so … I do one joke where I draw a line of best fit . In Edinburgh, I drew it as a straight linear line of best fit and then after the laughter died someone piped up and was like, “Actually, it’s an exponential curve of best fit .” What’s worse is that I’ve done that joke many times and it wasn’t until someone said that that everyone in the audience was like “Yeah, they’re right.” It’s like oh no, I’ve done this joke 20 times … Do you think of your sets as educational? Or at least informative? Maybe a bit. But I'd probably put that energy to other things. Like I'm currently writing a book about the periodic table, and it's like a young adult kids’ book. So it's ages 10 to 15. That is actually genuinely educational where I've divided the book into groups of the periodic table, and then each group is related to their characteristics and their properties as an element, and then I sort of fictionalized them into personalities that match those properties. So that is educational.

7ac2851a2dcc,New Rules Could Force Tesla to Redesign Its Door Handles. That’s Harder Than It Sounds,"electric vehicles, tesla, cars, automobiles, evs and hybrids, manufacturing","The issues could cascade beyond the design. The auto manufacturing industry operates on strict production schedules. Though it builds in time to validate and test whatever new features come in each new model, the sudden intro of a design change late in the process could throw off the delicate timetable. In this decade, China’s auto industry has shocked the world by racing ahead of legacy automakers, quickly developing, with government support, ever newer, cheaper, and more technologically advanced vehicles on shorter production schedules. The country is the world’s largest automotive market; it’s expected to manufacture a full third of the world’s cars by 2030 . Still, quickly complying with new design regulations won’t be easy for domestic Chinese automakers either, says Broglin-Peterson. “Mechncial release requires a mechanical assembly,” she says. “It’s not just, you write some code.” Automaker’s door handle trouble likely won’t end in China. The new rules could lead to cascading responses from other global regulators. It’s a now-familiar pattern: China, once a place with lax protections, has forged ahead of the rest of the world in setting guidelines for electric vehicle battery safety and recycling, and autonomous vehicle tech. “This is a classic example of China setting the guardrails early: protecting consumers while quietly shaping global design standards,” Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based advisory firm, wrote in an email. A Handle on Design For many years, says Raphael Zammit, the chair of the transportation design department at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, flush electronic door handles were the stuff of futuristic concept cars. “The fact that Elon Musk and Tesla put it into production was, frankly, pretty amazing,” he says. Their rise was linked with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles; tucking door handles into the doors of cars was meant to reduce their drag coefficient, leading to increased battery efficiency. Or so the theory went: Back-of-the-envelope math suggests the tweak maybe adds a mile of range. Maybe. Either way, the handles became a “demarcation of luxury,” Zammit says. Indeed, electronic door handles can be found on many luxury vehicles, including some made by Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz.

On the podcast Culture Apothecary, Turning Point USA’s Alex Clark educates women about optimal fertility health and well-being. In an episode of Relatable titled “Be a Godly Woman, Not Just a Trad Wife,” host Allie Beth Stuckey discusses the appropriation of the trad wife trend, saying it “can be a great thing to aspire to” but Christian motherhood is “not just an aesthetic.” More recently, in response to polycule family structures, Stuckey noted that “the sexual revolution is reaching new lows.” Much of what the women discuss—on marriage, faith, and the importance of childbearing—dovetails with the agenda of the Trump administration. On social media, however, where Lacey has more than 1 million followers between TikTok and Instagram, she often straddles her conservatism with a wink and a smile. In one video , Lacey jokes about the consequences of not performing oral sex on your partner. In the next , she’s prancing through a green meadow declaring love for “my bible,” sundresses, and conservative men. Still, as the womanosphere grows louder, its influence is creating a less stigmatized environment for singles who no longer feel the shame of their values. “Of course that trickles down into the dating scene as well,” says right-wing influencer Debra Lea of the cultural shift, who adds that the “the popularity of monogamy, marriage, and starting a family is growing far beyond just the conservative movement.” Though she hasn’t prioritized finding a partner, Lea, 25, has dated a range of conservative men over the last few years. In the post-Biden era of young romance, she’s noticed a key difference; “politics seem to be more commonly discussed both on and before dates.” The hardcore moderates always “bring out my ultraconservative side,” she says. “I would never marry or seriously date somebody unaligned with me politically, but I believe there are many more important factors to align on, such as religion, healthy lifestyle, and hobbies.”",https://www.wired.com/story/the-womanosphere-is-reshaping-the-conservative-dating-landscape,Technology,BBC,Jason Parham,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68d5b99da0b397cb2d09d6e2/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Conservative-OnlyFans-Star-Anya-Lacey-Tradwife-Dating-Site-Culture-IMG_4355.jpg",2025-10-13T09:30:00+00:00,2dcd333cfe4ec7ef7b3a2714748c0a02fa106437
f061c8e5dfa8,More Evidence Emerges That One of Saturn’s Moons Could Harbor Life,"science, space, saturn, extraterrestrial life","A recent study of Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons, has detected several organic compounds that had never been recorded there before. The findings, published this month in Nature Astronomy , provide new clues about the interior chemical composition of this icy world, as well as new hope that it could harbor life. The researchers analyzed data from the Cassini probe, which launched in 1997 and studied Saturn and its moons for years until its destruction in 2017. For Enceladus, Cassini gathered data from ice fragments forcefully ejected from the moon’s subsurface ocean up into space. Enceladus is one of 274 bodies so far discovered in Saturn’s gravitational pull. It measures about 500 kilometers in diameter, making it the planet’s sixth-largest satellite. While this moon does not stand out for its size, it is notable for its cryovolcanoes—geysers at Enceladus’s south pole that spew out water vapor and ice fragments. Plumes of ejected material can extend to nearly 10,000 kilometers in length , which is more than the distance from Mexico to Patagonia, and some of this material rises into space. The outermost of Saturn’s main rings—its E ring—is primarily made up of ice ejected into space by Enceladus. This material is believed to come from a saline water chamber beneath the moon’s icy crust that is connected to its rocky core. It’s possible that chemical reactions are taking place down there, under high pressure and heat. Until now, most chemical analyses of ice from Enceladus were of particles deposited in Saturn’s E ring. But during a high-speed flyby of the moon in 2008, Cassini was fortunate enough to directly sample freshly ejected fragments from a cryovolcano. The new research paper reanalyzed this data, confirming the presence of previously detected organic molecules, as well as revealing compounds that had previously been undetected. “Such compounds are believed to be intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules, which could be potentially biologically relevant. It is important to note, however, that these molecules can be formed abiotically as well,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at Freie Universität Berlin and lead author of the study, told Reuters . The discovery significantly expands the range of confirmed organic molecules on Enceladus. The key is that the compounds appeared in freshly ejected particles, suggesting that they were formed within the moon’s hidden ocean or in contact with its internal interfaces, not during their journey through the E ring or via exposure to the conditions of space. This reinforces the hypothesis that hydrothermal processes beneath Enceladus’s surface could be generating rich organic chemistry. Combining this new research with previous studies, scientists have now found five of the six elements essential for life—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—in the satellite’s ejected material. This itself is not a discovery of life, nor of biosignatures—the signs of life. However, the research confirms that Enceladus has the three basic conditions for life to form: liquid water, an energy source, and essential elements and organics. “Enceladus is, and should be ranked, as the prime target to explore habitability and search whether there is life or not,” Khawaja said.

You can reach Tara on Signal at tarabannow.70. Medicare Advantage has skyrocketed in popularity over the past decade, reeling in new members with zero-dollar premiums and generous benefits. But the rate of growth has slowed in recent years, and in 2026, there’s a decent chance enrollment will contract for the first time in 20 years . It’s happening because private Medicare insurers are increasingly paring back both the number of plans they offer and the benefits within those plans. They say the cuts are necessary because members’ care has gotten more expensive. That means that when Medicare’s annual enrollment period starts Wednesday, beneficiaries will face tough choices and, in many cases, fewer of them. “Those people in Medicare Advantage who have pretty much had a stable, easy way to go through open enrollment? Not this year,” said Diane Omdahl, president and founder of 65 Incorporated, a Medicare consulting firm. STAT+ Exclusive Story Already have an account?

5d2449a42f7c,Drug developers shouldn’t shortchange the autoimmune community,"autoimmune, biotech, chronic disease, clinical trials","My teenage years were ravaged by severe autoimmune disease. In that era, the burdens of treatment for Crohn’s disease rivaled the misery of the affliction. My illness brought searing stomach pain, fatigue, and fistulas. The steroids my physician prescribed caused breakouts of cystic acne all over my body as well as exhausting bouts of hyperactivity, manic mood swings, and a serious case of moon face. Hopelessly trapped between symptoms and side effects, I would have jumped at the chance to participate in a clinical trial. Instead, faced with an impossible choice of excruciating pain vs. mania, lethargy, and disfigurement, I opted for an eight-hour surgical intervention. Forty-six years later, I’m still managing my autoimmune disease, but I’m also a CEO of a biotech company focused on delivering a new kind of cell therapy for people with autoimmune conditions. While biologics transformed what’s possible for people living with Crohn’s, millions of autoimmune patients still manage the side effects, risks, and tradeoffs of lifelong immunosuppressive steroids. As a teenager, I rarely talked about my condition. For so long, stoicism has been the default posture of so many people living with severe, yet often invisible autoimmune diseases. We’re a community that has been taught to cope, not hope. But recently, thanks to biotechnology innovation, what’s medically possible may be changing. In 2022, a German researcher named Georg Schett showed the world that cell therapy could put a subset of young adult lupus patients into prolonged drug-free remission after conducting a small clinical trial. Many leading scientists now see real potential to replicate this success across other autoimmune diseases. Drug developers have initiated studies to test this exhilarating thesis, launching more than 500 clinical trials around the world to evaluate cell therapy approaches to treat different autoimmune conditions. Schett’s eureka moment could be a watershed, helping our health care system finally move from chronic immune suppression to curative “immune reset” therapies for many autoimmune patients. Yet despite this promise, drug developers are discovering that clinical trial enrollment is extremely challenging. Why? Part of the answer is rooted in demographics. In a striking epidemiological pattern, women of childbearing years are the cohort most likely to develop autoimmune diseases. These ailments disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities in incidence and severity. Due to economic disparities in America, the patients who may stand to benefit most from investigative cell therapies are often the most inconvenienced and resource-challenged, struggling to obtain the transportation, lodging, childcare, and the time off work that participation can require. A national study found that prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus is higher among people experiencing poverty, food insecurity, unemployment, or reliance on public insurance. But many autoimmune patients don’t qualify for clinical trials due to stringent U.S. regulatory requirements that they must have failed available advanced therapies, even though they often can’t get these therapies because they’re uninsured or underinsured. It’s a heartbreaking catch-22. As a growing number of major pharmaceutical and small biotech companies enter this field, industry can play a critical role in reducing barriers to clinical trial participation. Instead of asking people with serious diseases to reconstruct their lives around our studies, drug developers should be striving to design our research around their lives. There can be costs involved in research participation. If patients aren’t within reasonable driving distance from a site, sponsors should offer airfare, hotel, meals, and child care to ease the burden of participation. Additionally, companies should offer fair-market compensation to all patients and caregivers for their time and willingness to advance science. A recent open letter signed by 64 leaders in medicine, public health, patient advocacy, and research ethics challenged industry’s historic reticence to fairly remunerate patients for their involvement in clinical research. “Research participation generates immense social value, and generous compensation can reflect this value and serve as an important sign of respect and appreciation for all participants,” they wrote. “There is little empirical evidence that payments at levels commonly used in clinical trials, even those in the range of several thousand dollars, result in undue influence — that is, they do not impair the ability of prospective research participants to rationally assess the risks and benefits of participation nor result in choices that conflict with their values.” Take it from me: Drug developers hear this call. No medically eligible patient should be denied the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial for any reason. Fair-market compensation can make a huge difference for people who wish to enroll but are struggling to make ends meet. A Canadian study of people living with systemic sclerosis found the disease’s average total annual cost per patient was more $18,000 per year. Another study in systemic vasculitis found that more than a quarter of caregivers lost money due to caregiving; their median annual income loss was $3,000. This is why my company fairly compensates clinical trial participants and their care partners. We call on others to do so, too. Companies should also consider mobile phlebotomy and lab testing, which reaches into the communities where patients live instead of expecting them to return each time to clinical trial sites far from home. This service can minimize patient burden and time away from home. Mobile clinical trial units can be prohibitively expensive for cash-constrained companies, but the integration of mobile blood draw and lab testing services can help boost trial enrollment by alleviating anxiety and travel burdens for patients with work and family responsibilities. Drugmakers owe our trial participants more than financial and logistical help. We owe them radical transparency and an honest dialogue about potential risks and benefits. Each new investigational agent comes with trade-offs, and patients should be fully informed by sponsors to make fact-based decisions on what they’re willing — and have every right — to try. In the case of cell therapy, this includes discussion of lymphodepletion regimens and possible impacts on future fertility. No prospective parent challenged with autoimmune disease should be forced to choose between the chance for better health and the chance to start or grow a family. Cell therapy developers should subsidize sperm and egg retrieval and freezing for participants who want to take precautions against fertility risk — and the government must not stand in the way . How a company treats its clinical trial pioneers is a litmus test for corporate social responsibility. If my small biotech company with just over 100 employees can offer expansive services to address barriers for study participants and their care partners, so can every other drug developer in this space. As an industry, we have an opportunity and an obligation to guarantee equitable access to clinical trials, so biomedical innovation leaves no one behind. Paul J.

As a physician in the age of wearables, glancing at a patient’s wrist has become a natural, unspoken part of the physical exam. In most cases, finding an Apple Watch doesn’t mean much. But on occasion, it can offer a glimpse into a patient’s life — a heart rate trend, a sleep pattern, or a measure of activity. So when Apple announced its much-anticipated latest iteration of the Apple Watch , I was intrigued. Two of its new models, the Series 11 and the Ultra 3, offer “hypertension notifications,” a new feature alerting users to trends of high blood pressures over the course of a month. Cleared rapidly by the Food and Drug Administration, the feature has found its way onto the wrists of millions of Apple Watch users in the United States.

f82d0117449d,"Lions' Branch smacks Chiefs' Smith-Schuster, setting off scrum",,"Oct 12, 2025, 11:44 PM ET KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A long, frustrating night for the Detroit Lions inside Arrowhead Stadium ended with safety Brian Branch delivering an open-handed strike to Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster , setting off a brief fight among players from both teams. After Kansas City's 30-17 victory Sunday night, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes tried to give a high-five to Branch as they met near midfield. Branch walked past Mahomes, and Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster took umbrage with the move, walking up to Branch and having a few words with him. Branch responded by striking Smith-Schuster in his facemask, sending him to the ground. ""It was a childish thing, but I'm tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don't catch it,"" Branch said. ""They be trying to bully me out there. I should have never did it. It was childish."" Smith-Schuster leaped to his feet and went after Branch, who played despite an ankle injury that had kept him out of practice most of the week. Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco tried to get between them, but Branch succeeded in ripping Smith-Schuster's helmet off as dozens of players from both teams converged on the scrum. ""He's a great player and he's huge for [their] team,"" Smith-Schuster said of Branch. ""After the game, I expected to shake his hand and say, 'Good game.' But he threw a punch."" Branch said he was blocked in the back by Smith-Schuster toward the end of the game in front of the referees and they didn't respond. ""I could've got hurt off of that play,"" Branch said. ""I still shouldn't have done that."" Asked what he thought prompted Branch's actions, Smith-Schuster replied, ""I mean, me just blocking him."" ""I'm just doing my job,"" Smith-Schuster said. ""I play between the whistles."" Eventually, coaches and players separated the parties, and they finally left the field for the locker room. Branch could be facing another hefty fine -- he was docked $23,186 for face-masking and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties against Green Bay last month -- and perhaps even a suspension. ""I love Brian Branch,"" Lions coach Dan Campbell said, ""but what he did is inexcusable, and it's not going to be accepted here. It's not what we do. It's not what we're about. I apologized to Coach [Andy] Reid and the Chiefs, and Smith-Schuster. That's not OK. That's not what we do here. It's not going to be OK. He knows it. Our team knows it. That's not what we do."" Smith-Schuster came away with a bloody nose. ""The guy came up and hit JuJu for what looked like no reason,"" Reid said. ""That's tough, and he did pretty good damage on JuJu's nose."" Veteran Lions defensive lineman DJ Reader said he planned to talk to Branch once the emotions from Sunday die down. ""We'll have that conversation. It's hard to have that conversation right now because everybody's trying to have the conversation,"" Reader said. ""I'm sure I'll get a chance to talk to him, but it's tough because he's got that stinger for a reason as a player and you don't ever want to take that away, but you also want him to be smart. Not only for us, but also for himself. To protect his money, to protect him."" The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for Detroit, which was trying to pull off a rare feat by winning two consecutive games in Arrowhead Stadium. Instead, the Lions allowed 355 yards of total offense, forced just one punt and didn't make the stops they needed late in the fourth quarter to give their offense a chance to mount a comeback. Jared Goff finished with just 203 yards passing, though he had touchdown throws to Jameson Williams and Sam LaPorta . Amon-Ra St. Brown was held to 45 yards receiving. Jahmyr Gibbs needed 17 carries for 65 yards. ""That's a physical team, and they have a mentality that they come in to play with, and we're going to match that mentality,"" Mahomes said. ""We're not afraid to go up against anybody. That's the mentality Coach Reid brings every single day, and we're going to match the intensity of whoever steps on that field.""

d514adb8ec3c,MLB,,"TORONTO -- Twenty-eight hours before they stole home-field advantage in the American League Championship Series with a 3-1 win against the Blue Jays on Sunday night in Toronto, the Seattle Mariners were stranded at home. After surviving a strenuous 15-inning winner-take-all thriller vs. the Detroit Tigers on Friday night and celebrating into the wee hours, the Mariners were scheduled to leave their home ballpark for the airport at 10 a.m. PT on Saturday. Across the continent, in less than 36 hours, their first appearance in the ALCS in 24 years awaited. But mechanical issues delayed their flight as a plane flew from Los Angeles to shuttle them to Toronto. For more than four hours, the Mariners waited at T-Mobile Park. Finally, at 2:15 p.m., the team began its journey. The Mariners touched down in Toronto at 10:15 p.m. They arrived at their hotel after 11. As the Mariners traveled, the Blue Jays, idle since Wednesday night, held a workout at Rogers Centre. The Mariners took Game 1 anyway behind Bryce Miller 's six-inning gem on short rest, Cal Raleigh 's tying home run and more timely hitting from ALDS Game 5 standout Jorge Polanco . ""We've talked about just how resilient these guys are,"" Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. ""And tonight was one of those instances again."" The difference in convenience was evident in the starting pitching matchup. Blue Jays right-hander Kevin Gausman took the ball more than a week after shutting down the New York Yankees over 5⅔ innings in Game 1 of the ALDS on Oct. 4. Miller took it on just three days' rest after logging 4⅓ innings in Game 4 against the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday in his postseason debut. Early on, the imbalance, as expected, appeared to benefit Toronto. George Springer ambushed Miller and swatted his first pitch -- a 97 mph fastball that barely clipped the outside corner -- over the right-field wall for a leadoff home run . The ball traveled at 109.4 mph. More loud contact ensued. After Nathan Lukes worked a 12-pitch walk -- in the process fouling a pitch off his left knee that forced him to exit the game two innings later -- Vladimir Guerrero Jr. cracked a 107.2 mph line drive. Two batters after that, Daulton Varsho crushed a 102.5 mph line drive. Both balls were caught to end the inning, but the Blue Jays, after scoring 23 runs in their two ALDS games at home, were seemingly revving for another outburst. But one never surfaced as Miller limited the Blue Jays to one run on two hits over six innings, surpassing the four-inning best-case scenario Wilson had envisioned for him. Instead, Miller became the first pitcher since David Price in 2018 to log at least six innings and allow no more than one run in the postseason on three or fewer days' rest. ""They didn't tell me anything, any plan,"" Miller said. ""So I was going out there just letting it rip until they came out and got me."" Miller retired 17 of the final 19 batters he faced, surrendering just a single in the second and a walk in the sixth. His fastball averaged 96.3 mph, the highest of his 76 career starts. He threw 27 pitches in the first inning and just 49 over the next five. It was just the second time Miller has logged six innings in a start this season, one that has included two stints on the injured list because of elbow inflammation and the largest ERA increase from last season (2.94) to this season (5.68) in the majors. ""I can't say enough about Bryce,"" said Matt Brash , one of three Mariners relievers to throw a perfect inning to close the game. ""That was incredible from him."" Gausman had his own trouble early, but the Mariners stranded two runners in the first inning. Gausman then rolled, retiring 15 straight batters until Raleigh stepped into the batter's box for a third encounter. The AL MVP candidate, after singling and striking out in his first two at-bats, choked up with two strikes and two outs and golfed a splitter into the right-field seats to silence the sold-out crowd. ""I thought I was pitching pretty well, and last two guys I faced was a home run and a walk,"" Gausman said. ""So I'm not too happy about that."" Hitters had previously been 0-for-15 with six strikeouts against Gausman's splitter, his signature pitch. For Raleigh, the tying blast was his 12th home run in 27 career games, including the postseason, against the Blue Jays and his fourth career blast off Gausman. ""They didn't tell me anything, any plan,"" said Mariners starter Bryce Miller. ""So I was going out there just letting it rip until they came out and got me."" Mark Blinch/Getty Images ""I was just trying to get bat on ball and really put something in play, maybe find a hole because I didn't want to punch out again,"" said Raleigh, who was booed from pregame introductions through his final plate appearance in the eighth inning. ""I was able to put good wood on it. He's a really tough pitcher."" Gausman then walked Julio Rodriguez to coax Blue Jays manager John Schneider out of the dugout to replace his starter with left-hander Brendon Little . The move to the lefty prompted the blistering Polanco, a switch-hitter with an .888 OPS against lefties during the regular season, to bat right-handed. The decision backfired. After a wild pitch allowed Rodríguez to take second base, Polanco, whose single in the 15th inning Friday kept Seattle's season alive , lined a single to left field to give the Mariners the lead. Two innings later, Polanco doubled the margin with an RBI single to right field on a fastball from right-hander Seranthony Dominguez . ""He's been unbelievable,"" Raleigh said. ""He's been the heart and soul over this last month."" The Blue Jays, meanwhile, finished the game 1-for-28 with three walks after Springer's leadoff home run. Their final 10 batters went down in order. It was a gutsy performance from a drained Mariners group that turned to closer Andres Munoz to shut the door in the ninth inning. He finished the job at 10:52 p.m., less than 24 hours after the Mariners had settled into town. Game 2 awaits on Monday. ""This was just, again,"" Wilson said, ""a good win up and down.""",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46578125/mariners-shut-blue-jays-bats-steal-game-1-alcs,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559486_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,a40466ac69213cf4e40a59e677079b247efa1255
4689cc2ce46d,NFL,,"HIM?! THAT'S THE GUY?! LSU players are in disbelief. This cannot be Jayden Daniels . The Arizona State transfer has just walked into the indoor practice facility for the first time on a March afternoon in 2022. Chatter had spread that the coaches thought Daniels, a fourth-year junior, could be special. But when he shows up, several LSU players and staff members give each other side-eyes. ""No swag whatsoever,"" receiver Malik Nabers says now. ""He looked like a kid on his first day of high school."" At the time, Daniels' official bio lists him at 6-foot-4, 200 pounds, but he is probably an inch shorter and 25 pounds less than that. He has a backpack that hangs lower than cool kids would ever wear it. His hair is a mess. He's wearing glasses as he cross-references his printed class schedule against his phone's calendar. He doesn't say much. He looks so out of place that one of the LSU assistant coaches sneaks a picture when Daniels isn't paying attention. Nabers goes so far as to call Daniels a ""weird nerd"" to his face, after knowing him for all of two minutes. Some teammates pile on, too, laughing and ribbing Daniels. Assistant coach Sherman Wilson, the guy who takes the picture, tells Daniels he looks like a ""bum."" Most of the banter is good-natured ribbing of the rookie. But some of it is a test. LSU has a culture that has long encouraged players put newcomers through the wringer before an SEC season begins, so they know what level of toughness is needed to succeed. His new teammates keep telling Daniels that life and football are different in the SEC, that his California cool better be ready to grind. He is third on the LSU depth chart, and they let him know he's entering into the QB battle of his life. Daniels handles the digs well on the surface, but underneath, he's hurting. Daniels has always had a warm, calm exterior, and he's a better listener than any star quarterback needs to be. But he's at a wobbly point in his life, both as a football player and as a person. His mechanics are a mess -- LSU coaches think his feet and his eyes are doing two different things on most plays, leading him to run when he should throw and throw when he should run. His mindset isn't much better following an ugly public end to his Arizona State career. When he entered the transfer portal in February 2022, a viral video surfaced of his ex-teammates clearing out his locker and dumping on him. Daniels took the high road and responded to the video with kind words of appreciation. But deep down, he lands in Baton Rouge with a wounded soul and time running out on his college career. In his early days at LSU, he makes the conscious decision to kill his new teammates with kindness, absorbing the barbs with a big smile on his face. From the outside, he looks as if he has the perfect amount of thick skin and humility to battle for the starting job. On the inside, he admits later, he feels the sting of being the new kid getting picked on. Players leave the facility that day liking Jayden Daniels, the person. But Nabers and other players wonder, how will this nerd hold up under pressure? Daniels never flinched when he heard about the QB battle in Baton Rouge. ""We didn't offer him any promises,"" LSU coach Brian Kelly says. ""We told him it would be a competitive situation, and he agreed that he had to prove himself."" Rob Schumacher/The Republic, AP Photo/Matthew Hinton LSU BEATS OUT Missouri for Daniels' services. Daniels likes what new coach Brian Kelly and his staff are selling, which is that Baton Rouge is the best place for him to reboot his career. It helps that Joe Burrow , an Ohio State castaway, had just played in the Super Bowl after LSU resuscitated his career two years earlier. LSU coaches are up-front with Daniels; he'll have to win the job in an extremely competitive quarterback room. The team already has Garrett Nussmeier , who showed incredible upside as a freshman but only had four games of mop-up duty under his belt. Senior Myles Brennan has experience, but injury and production problems make him a high-basement, low-ceiling option. A good, healthy QB competition would be a positive thing, coaches think. Daniels says he likes that he'll have to win his spot. But the pressure on a transfer with an expiring play clock on his career can be daunting, something that Burrow says he felt a few years earlier when he was considering his move to LSU. Second chances are everywhere in college football these days. But if Daniels flamed out in Baton Rouge, he might not have found a good third chance elsewhere. LSU is desperate, too. Kelly uses the word ""infusion"" to describe what he thinks the locker room needs. And normally measured offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock has a final videoconference call with Daniels when he's in the portal, where he catches himself blurting out, ""If you come to LSU, we can win the Heisman together."" The coaching staff knows that there is a version of Daniels that can be a superstar, and LSU could use all the help it can get. Kelly and his staff are facing a flood of transfers and decommitments, and all the normal roster turnover after a coaching change. By the time spring practice began, Kelly says the program was down to 39 scholarship players in a sport where the top programs have 85 scholarship guys. By then, Daniels' highlight tape was perplexing. As a freshman at ASU in 2019, Daniels had 17 touchdowns and two interceptions, with flashes of the running ability that eventually made him one of the great breakout rookies in NFL history. However, 2020 was a lost year due to the COVID pandemic, with Arizona State playing only four games in a static 2-2 season. In 2021, Daniels was choppy during a turbulent 8-5 junior season, and all eight wins were vacated because of NCAA violations by coach Herm Edwards and his staff. There were stretches where Daniels tried to do everything for a bad ASU offense, and there were other times when he seemed as if he was suffering from paralysis-by-analysis on dropbacks. He ended the year with 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. On many plays, the top half of his body would be doing one thing and the bottom half would be doing another, leading to airmailed passes and panicked QB scrambles when receivers were running wide open. Daniels entered the portal as a half-scratched lottery ticket running low on belief in himself. At LSU, Daniels fits right in. But his new teammates goof on Daniels with great delight all spring. He tells his closest confidante on the coaching staff, Wilson, the truth, which is that he's gritting his teeth some days to avoid being antagonistic as he catches strays. But his teammates don't see any of that. Then and now, Daniels projects an approachability and curiosity that sometimes appears as if nothing bothers him. In this case, the California cool is helping. But his competitive side comes roaring out sometimes. One day that spring, a bunch of offensive players went to Top Golf. Daniels mentions that he's never been a golfer, and his first swing confirms it. Everybody laughs in disbelief when he unveils a clunky mess of a windup. ""You see him play football, and he is so athletic and fast, and his arm is so crazy, then you see him swing a golf club and go, 'Man, what's going on?'"" says Josh Williams , the former LSU running back. ""You don't expect a golf swing like that."" Daniels is irritated when the other players goof on him, and he vows to work his butt off to improve at golf. Teammates say he made solid progress over the next two years -- ""He got better, but only a little better,"" Williams says. To this day, his first golf swing ranks as an all-time oof moment that players pick on Daniels about. The guys all love seeing that side of him. Before spring ball is even over, Daniels has established himself as a friend, good teammate and strong contender for the QB job. Nobody outworks him -- some players still remember getting to the facility expecting to be the first guy there, only to find Daniels already lifting or in the film room. Other guys recall going home for the day, realizing they forgot something and going back to an almost empty building... and there sat Daniels, still working. Ron Butler, Daniels' agent, says there isn't a bigger Kobe Bryant fan out there: ""If I told him Kobe sucks, I'd hear about it all day. He is ride-or-die for Kobe."" Getty Images But Daniels isn't even close to the clear starter as spring ball winds down. And as well as he feels as if he fits in, he's still not sure if he has friends or frenemies because of the way his teammates pick at him. He mostly bites his tongue at first. But he admits to Wilson that his thick skin act is just that, an act -- he feels every barb as if it's a paper cut. At this point, Daniels is candid about his mindset and how much he needs this new dynamic to work. His once-promising college football career is on the ropes, and he needs to enter the QB competition with the right balance of confidence and humility to get back on track. He still routinely comes across the video of his old ASU teammates flaming him, and now his new teammates are giving him a hard time, too? Daniels feels some panic underneath the calm he shows on the outside. Wilson is the right man at the right time. He's only 33 then, with the official title of director of player retention, which means he does some recruiting, some brand management and some coaching. That often makes him the first one in the door with players, and he often becomes a steadying presence as they try to find their footing at LSU. Players reverently call him Sherm, not Coach Wilson or even Sherman. He has an incredible résumé for such a young guy -- he has worked in the scouting department for the Los Angeles Rams for several years and on the coaching staffs at both Louisiana Tech and Memphis before coming to Baton Rouge. The thing that makes Wilson such a secret weapon at LSU is his ability to challenge players in the most aggressive way that can still be considered friendly. With Daniels, he manages to be both the biggest irritant in his life and also his most trusted adviser. Wilson realizes right away that Daniels responds well to his mild ribbing if he thinks the ribbing is coming from a place of love and support. That's a Wilson specialty -- when he drives LSU players, they often feel as if they want to show him up, rather than rough him up. His tone is that of a caring agitator, such as before the Heisman season in 2023, when Wilson relentlessly began texting Daniels a preseason ranking that had him behind Duke's Riley Leonard. ""No way he's better than me,"" Daniels would say, and that would be the propane in his tank for the day. Eighteen months later, Daniels won the Heisman and should have thanked Riley Leonard. But instead, he shouts out Wilson at the very end of his speech, after his mom and dad, for the way that Wilson pushed him at LSU. ""You might be annoying,"" Daniels says. ""But I love you, dog."" Wilson annoys Daniels -- with love -- from day one at LSU in 2022, when he snapped that photo of Daniels when he wasn't looking. Wilson sees Daniels' scars from the way his Arizona State days ended and can tell that the transfer is putting up a facade to cover that up. His self-confidence passes the smell test with most people who interact with him. But Wilson sees through it. He thinks Daniels is covering up some deep insecurities, that he is focused too much on outside stuff and not focusing enough on the very straightforward idea of just getting better every minute of every day. They find important common ground in an unexpected source: Kobe Bryant . Mamba Mentality had always been Daniels' adopted philosophy, which is essential in understanding why he so fiercely defends Kobe's honor. That first spring at LSU, in 2022, somebody made the mistake of saying that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Then and now, this turns out to be a cheat code to instantly get under Daniels' skin. Daniels is a Southern California kid, through and through, and he will not allow any disparaging of his hero, Bryant. Even now, his old friends love winding him up about Kobe. ""I tell him all the time that Jordan was better,"" says Rachaad White , his former Arizona State teammate. ""Tell him that I said that. Tell him that Rachaad is telling people Kobe wasn't close to MJ."" So, Wilson homes in on the nuances of how Bryant explained Mamba Mentality, which often is watered down to being very competitive. There's more to it than that. Notably, Bryant talked often about the relentless process of greatness, of working extremely hard, often alone, at ridiculous hours. Wilson makes a connection for Daniels that will change his life. ""See, Kobe wanted to be the best to ever play basketball,"" Wilson says. ""But he knew to get there, he had to be the best Kobe Bryant above all else. He raised his level, which made everybody around him try to rise up, too."" It was a lightbulb moment for Daniels. Now, Wilson's Dr. Phil mumbo jumbo makes more sense to him. On the field, Daniels has the best skill set of the LSU quarterbacks -- everything the world saw in last season's NFL playoff run is on full display that spring. He makes an instant connection with Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr. , with stretches of practice where those three look like the most dangerous passing group in college football. On plays when the pocket breaks down and he has to run, Daniels busts loose, and the LSU defense can't tackle him. Denbrock has moments when he thinks, ""I might have been right -- Jayden can win the Heisman."" But there are also way too many times when the coaching staff groans at Daniels' inconsistency. Right after an incredible practice scramble for 40 yards, he'll get trapped in the pocket and sacked three times in a row. He especially struggles with his feet getting synced up with his head and arm -- Kelly and Denbrock keep stressing to him that a good throw begins with his feet and to let his lower body guide the way a play unfolds. But he's not getting it, causing immense frustration for the coaches and also for Daniels. Too often, he's dancing around in the pocket, head rotating from side to side, not secure enough with himself to make a unified decision and go with it. ""Your eyes need to follow your feet, not the other way around,"" they pound into his head. The three quarterbacks battle through March and April, and when the spring game ends on April 22, Kelly sounds more unsure than ever who his best quarterback will be. He even throws in touted QB recruit Walker Howard in the mix with the others. ""I don't know if we cleared up anything,"" Kelly says. But behind closed doors, the entire program thinks Daniels is capable of big things heading into summer 2022. He hasn't yet put it all together for an extended period of time, but his vibe has begun attracting the true believers among his teammates and coaches. Wilson, for one, thinks he will continue to separate himself and eventually win the job. Teammates gravitate toward him, one Kobe argument at a time, and when he starts late-night throwing sessions with his receivers, attendance is strong. By then, he and Nabers are very close. They text each other constantly, and then each of them starts a group chat with another player, and then another player. Nabers considers himself a troll, and he spots a fellow troll in Daniels. As he has gotten more comfortable inside the LSU locker room, Daniels has begun to joke back with his teammates in a way that they respect. Daniels is especially adept at working over his receivers. When Daniels first started throwing workouts with his receivers, he had sporadic participation. But Daniels figures out that he can play guys off each other. Nabers laughs a little, thinking back to how many times he would get home from a full day of classes and workouts, then take a shower and put his feet up. Then his phone would buzz as late as 9 or 10 p.m., with Daniels saying he is going to the indoor facility for throwing work. ""Just got out of the shower,"" Nabers would text back. Daniels: ""Get another shower later."" Nabers: ""Nah, maybe tomorrow."" Daniels: ""OK, I guess I'll just throw with..."" and then he would toss out the name of another receiver. Nabers: ""Be there in 10 minutes."" By the time summer practice kicks off, Daniels has friends all over the locker room. Now, he just has to go win the job as the calendar turns to August. The one thing Daniels isn't ready for? The weather. DANIELS HAD BEEN in Baton Rouge for a few months when he decided to swallow his pride and ask the most pressing question on his mind: What kind of hellish inferno had he transferred into? He had grown up in Southern California, where summer temperatures could get into the high 90s, but the strong Santa Ana winds kept the air dry and manageable. The average rainfall in the summer is just .1 inches per month. When he went off to ASU, he found Tempe to be 10 degrees hotter but just as dry. So, he is absolutely unprepared for a Louisiana summer that feels something like a hot tub inside a sauna, with frequent outbursts from the heavens that can seem like the end times. One day in July 2022, he asks Wilson, ""Does it always sound like this?"" ""What?"" Wilson asks. Daniels points toward the sky. ""The thunder,"" he says. Wilson starts laughing. He gets it. In Louisiana, storms thunder differently. That July, Baton Rouge had a thunderstorm that dropped 2.34 inches of rain in one day, and another that dropped 3.36 inches in the area. All told, on the 62 days of that July and August, there are 48 days with at least one thunderstorm. In just two months, Daniels basically goes through more bad summer weather than the first 21 years of his life combined. In Wilson's office, Daniels has the look of a kid who's thinking about crawling under the covers with his favorite Build-A-Bear. Wilson assures Daniels that the Baton Rouge skies are usually more bark than bite and that there is nothing particularly worrisome about the clouds on this day. In this moment, he feels an incredible bond with the young man growing up in front of him. The weather is unbearable in August as summer practice begins. Even Louisiana-born LSU players shake their heads, thinking back to what was a sizzling month of practice, especially for a newbie such as Daniels. ""That camp was one of the hottest summers I have ever been a part of, and Jayden was definitely feeling it,"" says Thomas, Jr., who grew up 20 minutes outside of Baton Rouge. ""He just kept saying, 'This is too hot. What is this?' But he eventually adjusted."" The summer competition kicks off in early August, with most observers considering it a dead heat between Brennan, Daniels and Nussmeier. But then Brennan, the veteran of the group, announces his retirement on Aug. 15. He's 23, entering his sixth year, with significant injuries to his body, and decides to hang up his helmet. Suddenly, it's down to Nussmeier and Daniels. The coaching staff never tips its hand publicly that month, leading into the Sept. 4 opener against Florida State. Coaches think that Daniels is clearly further along as a quarterback prospect, but they still don't love how often he can go cold for long periods of time. He sometimes has two or three straight practices looking timid and sloppy with his footwork, to the point where momentum swings back toward Nussmeier. As the season opener approaches, LSU coaches are publicly undecided when discussing the quarterback position, waiting until the week of the opener to finally announce... nothing, really. Kelly tells the media he knows who will start on Saturday but won't reveal whether it's Daniels or Nussmeier. ""Here's what I vividly remember,"" Kelly says now. ""Jayden had the position halfway through camp, but then he had a stretch of less-than-stellar practices while Nuss picked it up. Both guys were good enough to be No. 1s. But Jayden finished strong with really strong practices. That settled us into thinking he'd be the starter."" Sure enough, when LSU's offense runs onto the field on Sept. 2, Daniels is in the middle of the huddle. But it's the one play he isn't under center that will change the trajectory of his life forever. Ahead of the 2024 NFL draft, LSU offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock met with Commanders coach Dan Quinn. When Quinn said he was looking for a dual-threat QB who could command a locker room, Denbrock told him, ""You're going to love Jayden Daniels."" Getty Images IN HIS FIRST start at his new school, Daniels and the offense sputter through the first 55 minutes against Florida State. But down 24-10, Daniels comes to life and leads two late scoring drives to pull within 24-23 with no time left on the clock. There is buzz on the sideline about possibly going for two and winning the game outright. But Daniels is cramped up on the bench, trying to get ready for overtime. With Daniels unavailable, the coaches make a quick decision to kick the extra point. But in an unbelievable gut-punch moment, FSU blocks the kick to hang on. Daniels doesn't even see the play -- and yet he'll also never be able to unsee it. He tells teammates and coaches the next week that if they're ever in that situation again, they have to go for two and win the game. Daniels is bothered after the game that LSU let a big opening win slip away. He shares that with Wilson, who isn't hearing any of it. ""We lost because you couldn't sustain,"" he says to Daniels about his cramps. That cuts Daniels deep, but he doesn't disagree. Wilson's directness, along with Nabers & Co. constantly badgering him, has thickened Daniels' skin. He needed the exposure therapy that LSU's difficult, competitive environment provided, and Wilson notices Daniels' growth. Rather than balling up his fists and firing back, he seems as if he has the kind of confidence to absorb criticism without it going directly to his heart. LSU is 0-1, so the results haven't shown up in the standings yet. But somehow it feels as if Daniels 2.0 has arrived. LSU goes 6-1 after the Florida State loss to claw back into the College Football Playoff conversation. Daniels shows off everything he could ever be, and his teammates have rallied behind him. He's their guy, but at practice, he's still showing signs of being an indecisive passer. Kelly and the coaching staff stay on him about making a read, setting his feet and letting the ball fly. Even two months into the season, he occasionally has an hour at practice where he looks jittery and delivers the ball late or to the wrong guy. As far as Daniels can tell, he remains a bad half away from getting benched. Daniels feels immense frustration that he somehow has command of the locker room but not the pocket. The season feels as if it's hanging in the balance. At 6-2, LSU can still technically win the SEC and make a CFP push. But Daniels has been so inconsistent that it's tough to imagine him getting the Tigers' offense on a heater down the stretch. The bad news is that there will be no warmup period -- No. 6 Alabama is coming to Baton Rouge the next weekend. THE TIDE DEFENSE is in Daniels' face all day, sacking him six times. But Daniels is the best player on the field, constantly flummoxing Alabama, then getting sacked, then flummoxing the defense again. LSU has a 24-21 lead late when Bama ties it, forcing overtime. Bama, a two-touchdown favorite, gets the ball first in OT and marches right down to take a 31-24 lead. The entire roster watches as the Tigers' defenders walk off the field looking gassed. There's a general vibe that Alabama can do whatever it wants with the ball on offense, and that Daniels better have a bunch of touchdowns left in him. LSU hasn't beaten Alabama in Baton Rouge since 2010, so the mood at Tiger Stadium is downright despondent. On the first play, Daniels fakes a handoff and poof, he's gone on a 25-yard touchdown. It's one of those silly video game runs that only a handful of players -- Michael Vick, Lamar Jackson , maybe prime Steve Young -- can even think about trying. He prances into the end zone, the crowd goes wild, and the LSU sideline goes silent. Everybody thinks back to the Florida State game. Kick the extra point or go for the win? Kelly is leaning toward kicking the extra point. About half of the coaches agree with him. Half don't. Pretty much every player is yelling to go for it. Thomas Jr., for one, makes the case to kick the extra point. When Daniels gets to the sideline, Kelly can see his quarterback's opinion in his eyes. For two months since the Florida State game, Daniels has been telling anybody who will listen that he'll never lose another game like that again. ""We're going to go for two and win the game,"" Daniels says to Kelly. ""OK, we'll win it then,"" Kelly says, and he puts two fingers in the air. Players go wild on the sideline, and LSU rushes their offense in with a read-option play where Daniels has to decide whether to hand to Josh Williams or keep it. As they set up, Alabama panics and realizes the defense has 12 men on the field. The Tide call a timeout, and LSU has more time to reconsider the decision. For about 10 seconds, Kelly has second thoughts. ""Are we really going to do this?"" he asks his staff. The answer is yes -- they call a rollout where Daniels sprints to the right with Nabers and tight end Mason Taylor as his options. On the sideline, Thomas gets down on one knee and grits his teeth. ""At that point, I did think we were going to get it,"" he says. At the snap, Daniels rolls right but immediately sees that the Bama defense is pinching up toward him, so he zips a throw toward the front corner of the end zone. Taylor catches it and crashes to the ground, and before he even climbs to his feet, fans pour down on the field. Thomas jumps to his feet and starts running out to Daniels but can't get to him through the sea of Tigers students, many of whom were kindergartners the last time LSU beat Bama at home. If Daniels had retired from football on the spot, he would be one of those Tigers legends who will forever drink for free in Baton Rouge. ""There were plays he made that day that I don't think anybody else who plays football, college or NFL, could have made,"" says Denbrock, his offensive coordinator. ""I realized that day that he was ready for more."" This is the moment when the Hollywood version of the Jayden Daniels movie will cut from that day, Nov. 5, 2022, to a montage of him winning the Heisman a year later, then being the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft, then his NFL heroics with Washington in 2024. That montage would skip right past what actually happened next, which is something that his teammates and coaches still just refer to, in sad voices, as ""The Arkansas Game."" At the 2022 LSU-Alabama game, Daniels emerged as the most unstoppable player in the game. ""The lights were bright, and you could see him rise to the moment,"" Kelly says now. ""That's when we knew we had someone special."" Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images THE BAMA WIN is a version of Daniels that is the best Jayden Daniels. Exactly seven days later, ""The Arkansas Game"" is the opposite. All of LSU's 2022 hopes had returned, with the Tigers soaring to No. 7 in the CFP rankings heading into their Nov. 12 game. They're facing a 5-4 Arkansas team that had just been manhandled the previous week by Liberty. To this day, his coaches are baffled by what they saw. Daniels is the spring version of himself, not the guy who just dominated Alabama. He struggles early and lets it snowball. He is hesitant and jittery, finishing with 85 yards passing, 19 yards rushing, a fumble, an interception and seven sacks on 66 snaps. LSU escapes 13-10, but Daniels is back to the drawing board. ""The talent was obviously there,"" Kelly says. ""But Jayden still wasn't able to do it over and over again on a consistent basis. The Arkansas game showed that."" It's an ugly enough performance that chatter immediately picks up around the program that maybe Nussmeier ought to get a chance, that perhaps Daniels isn't the guy after all. Teammates don't really buy it. Daniels doesn't, either. Hell, even Nussmeier knows that Daniels is the man. Kelly describes a scene on Monday morning that he's never had before or since: a call that both quarterbacks were waiting to see him. Nussmeier and Daniels are there to ask his advice on how to answer questions about the quarterback job. They both say their goal is to present a unified front, that the job is Daniels' and they would like guidance on the best way to present that publicly. Kelly sits back in his office chair, a little surprised and a lot impressed. The whole conversation is a testament to both players. Nussmeier seems wise beyond his years for anticipating a pothole where a stray comment or two creates a quarterback controversy. And Daniels' ability to build a strong, friendly relationship with his main competition makes Kelly feel even better about handing the keys to the program to him. Some day, the coaching staff thinks, Daniels is going to reach his final form, and Nussmeier will benefit from it as he makes a rise to stardom, too. The rest of the season has ups and downs. But mostly ups. Daniels gets better and better every week as LSU finishes 9-4, with a berth in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl. Against Purdue, Daniels is unstoppable. He powers LSU to a 35-0 halftime lead en route to a 63-7 blowout. Daniels even catches a touchdown pass from his best friend/constant instigator, Nabers. Daniels and Nabers are pulled in the third quarter and spend the rest of the game on the sidelines, dreaming about limitless, confident futures. ""It showed he could play in the SEC and lead us to big wins,"" Nabers says. ""I think that was the spark for what would come the next year."" During Daniels' 2023 Heisman season, Nabers put up an absurd stat line: 89 catches for 1,569 yards and 15 TDs. Four months later, Washington drafted Daniels at No. 2, and New York selected Nabers at No. 6. Gus Stark/LSU/University Images via Getty Images, Luke Hales/Getty Images WHEN THE 2022 SEASON ends, Daniels heads into an important offseason in which he could be one of the best emerging players in college football. But unbeknownst to most of the world, even now, Daniels is all but gone from Baton Rouge -- he wants to declare for the NFL draft. He turned 22 in December and already has his business communications degree from Arizona State. He tells the LSU coaching staff that he intends to move on, despite feedback projecting him as a fourth- or fifth-round pick. He never saw himself as a Day 3 pick, but he believes the time is now to go pro. Wilson tells him to sit with his decision for a bit and that he will support him no matter what he chooses. But he tells Daniels that he should come back and spend another year trying to become the best version of himself. His inner circle keeps telling him to play one more year. His inner voice keeps telling him to make the jump. The answer ultimately comes from his inner Kobe. After a few weeks, Daniels tells the LSU coaches his decision: He's coming back to Baton Rouge because he is not yet the best version of Jayden Daniels that he can be. The rest is history. Daniels wins the Heisman in 2023 and attends the 2024 NFL draft as a likely high draft pick. He sits in a room with his LSU coaches and his two top receivers, good friends Nabers and Thomas Jr. Those two exploded in that 2023 season, finishing as the most productive wide receiver duo in the country (157 catches for 2,746 yards and 31 touchdowns). All three get picked Thursday night in the first round, led by Daniels at No. 2 to Washington. Nabers is thrilled for Daniels. They had gotten incredibly close and become such good friends that they can say pretty much anything to each other. Nabers is essential to the Jayden Daniels origin story, and Daniels is essential to his. ""He's got some swag now,"" Nabers says. ""But he got all his swag from me, from trying to be like me."" He laughs when he recalls a frequent phone call they started having when they were at LSU together, a phone call that continues to this day. Nabers will dial up Daniels for no real reason other than to check in with his friend. The call goes something like this: Daniels: ""Hey."" Nabers: ""You suck."" Daniels: ""You suck, too."" Nabers: ""You're weird."" Daniels: ""You're weird, too."" Then they hang up and go about their days. They used to have some trepidation about the idea of playing against each other, especially when the mock drafts started showing that Daniels would probably go to the Commanders and the Giants liked Nabers. But that all instantly washes away on draft night, when Nabers is overjoyed to hear Roger Goodell say Daniels' name as the No. 2 pick. Daniels stands up in a crisp, gray suit, with sunglasses on indoors at night, and he hugs his parents and his agent, Ron Butler, before walking toward the stage. Thomas intercepts him first with a hug, and then Daniels walks 10 feet to where Nabers appears in front of him. Nabers has on sunglasses, too, and he balls up his fists and puts them down at his waist. He's literally blocking Daniels from his path to the NFL. Nabers lets out a guttural yell and embraces Daniels. They do a long, aggressive hug where the momentum of the collision has them bouncing from one leg to another and then back again. They go around in a semicircle, swaying in unison, with Nabers ending up off to the side. Nabers spins back toward his seat and waits to be picked. Daniels breaks away toward the stage to be handed a Commanders jersey by Roger Goodell. For them, the day is a beautiful culmination of friendship, love and support through challenging each other. They'll go back to the insults tomorrow.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46554320/jayden-daniels-nfl-washington-commanders-battle,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1009%2Fnfl_jayden%2Ddaniels%2Dorigin_16x9.jpg,,ae1dfe523d509061ff9f2ab5d48482f76ac77e06
bcd7689805c3,NCAAF,,"Oct 13, 2025, 08:00 AM ET Week 7 in college football did not disappoint. There were several blockbuster matchups, and some previously undefeated teams were dealt their first losses. No. 7 Indiana traveled to No. 3 Oregon for a game between two undefeated Big Ten teams and snapped the Ducks' 18-game home winning streak, sending Oregon down five spots in this week's AP Poll . The Hoosiers, on the other hand, have shown they're the real deal and in the hunt for another shot at the national championship after last season's early exit from the College Football Playoff. Meanwhile, in the Cotton Bowl, the return of quarterback John Mateer didn't help No. 6 Oklahoma, which fell from the ranks of the unbeaten at the hands of Texas. And with things going from bad to worse for Penn State after its third straight loss Saturday, the school fired James Franklin on Sunday after 12 seasons as its head coach. What's ahead for the Hoosiers as they chase a first-round bye in the playoff? What's next for the Nittany Lions after their coaching change? And how does Oklahoma bounce back after a rough rivalry loss that may have exposed some issues that need to be addressed? Our college football experts break down key storylines and takeaways from Week 7. Jump to: Indiana's CFP chances | Franklin's future No buyout is too high | Watch out for Washington Here comes Navy | A new star at USC? Oklahoma's offense Indiana is better than last season -- and capable of a deeper playoff run After a big win over Oregon in Eugene Saturday, what's ahead for the Hoosiers this season? Troy Wayrynen-Imagn Images At the midpoint of the season, no team has made a bigger playoff statement than Indiana. The Hoosiers tried to announce their arrival on the national stage with last season's playoff appearance, but doubts lingered after an early exit. They tried to reassert themselves with a historic 63-10 beatdown of Illinois , but the Illini aren't Ohio State or Oregon. And then the Hoosiers beat Oregon -- by double digits -- in Autzen Stadium, where the Ducks hadn't lost in 18 straight games. Indiana forced Heisman Trophy hopeful quarterback Dante Moore into two interceptions and sacked him six times. With the win, the Hoosiers catapulted into the top five and into program lore, positioning themselves not only for a run at the Big Ten title, but for a first-round bye as a top-four playoff team. Indiana doesn't play Ohio State during the regular season, but it can face the Buckeyes in the conference championship game if the Hoosiers keep winning. And if Indiana's only loss this season is to the selection committee's No. 1 team and the Big Ten champs, the Hoosiers could still earn a top-four seed because those spots are no longer reserved for conference champions. If Indiana can beat Oregon, though, it can also beat Ohio State. -- Heather Dinich Franklin's firing marks a first in highly pressurized CFP era Penn State's firing of coach James Franklin on Sunday was an absolute stunner, and also not a stunner. And yeah, still a stunner. The unsurprising part about Franklin's ouster, halfway through his 12th season at Penn State, was how clear the stakes had become this fall. Penn State had to start winning games and ultimately win some type of championship -- Big Ten or national. After bringing back the nucleus of a team that played for the Big Ten title and was a play away from the national championship game, anything less would be a major disappointment. I thought that if Penn State fell short and finished 10-3 or worse, Franklin could possibly look to move on. Things had run their course for him in Happy Valley. He would have gone out with a very good tenure without enough truly notable accomplishments. The still-stunning part is that it came to an outright firing, especially to the tune of nearly $50 million remaining to be paid on his contract. The Oregon loss stung Penn State unlike other big-game defeats under Franklin. The Nittany Lions then looked completely lost against inferior opponents UCLA and Northwestern . The postgame malaise Saturday night suggested Franklin knew the end was coming before he got the news from athletic director Pat Kraft on Sunday. But the finality of it all is still jarring and also indicative of the stakes that exist in the CFP era. As an industry source noted Sunday, Auburn and LSU waited at least a season before firing national-championship-winning coaches Gene Chizik and Ed Orgeron. Coaches can now reach the national semifinal and be fired halfway through the ensuing season. That's wild. What happens next for Franklin and Penn State will be fascinating, but it's clear few coaches are safe in such a big-money, all-in sport. -- Adam Rittenberg No buyout is too high There was a belief, at least among some FBS coaches, that athletic directors and universities would be less likely to fire a coach because the buyouts were going to be too high in the NIL era. ""They want the money for NIL,"" Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin told me earlier this month. ""But also because of the contracts. It's great for coaches, but it's the problem [agent] Jimmy Sexton created. These contracts [have] so much guaranteed money that now they're like, 'Whoa, we want to fire him, but we don't want to pay $50 million.'"" Kiffin, it should be noted, is one of several high-profile coaches represented by Sexton. ""Not only have you got to pay him, you've got to pay his assistants,"" Kiffin continued, ""and then you have to go out and buy another team because everybody's going to transfer within 30 days once the coach is fired, depending on the next coach you get."" Obviously, that's still not the case after Penn State canned Franklin and will pay his buyout of roughly $49 million, which is the second biggest in college football history, behind only the $76 million that Texas A&M doled out to Jimbo Fisher. It's not even November, and there are already seven head coaching openings, and all but one of them at Power 4 conference schools: Arkansas , Oklahoma State , Oregon State , Penn State , Stanford , UCLA and Virginia Tech . Thanks to NIL and the transfer portal, the head coach, even a successful one, is no longer irreplaceable. Will one of those schools finally step up and say, ""Enough is enough?"" -- Mark Schlabach Don't miss Demond Williams Jr. Washington QB Demond Williams Jr. rushed for 136 yards in a win over Rutgers. Jesse Beals/Icon Sportswire One of the best individual performances of the week came late Friday night in Seattle, where Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr . became just the 16th player in FBS history to throw for at least 400 yards and rush for at least 100 yards in the same game. The last Big Ten quarterback to achieve the feat was Northwestern's Zak Kustok in 2001 against Bowling Green . Williams has been outstanding all season. He ranks No. 5 nationally in Total QBR (86.1) with his worst game coming in a 24-6 loss to Ohio State and the country's best defense. And even then, he still completed 18 of 22 passes against the Buckeyes for 173 yards without an interception. With Michigan , Illinois and Oregon still on the schedule, Washington has some chances to make a statement and push for a playoff spot. -- Kyle Bonagura Anchors aweigh, here comes Navy The Midshipmen trailed Temple by a touchdown with less than a minute to play Saturday. They also faced fourth-and-1 at midfield. But then, following a convoy of lead blockers, Navy quarterback Blake Horvath sliced through the middle of the Owls defense for a 51-yard touchdown. He then tossed the winning 2-point conversion with a defender dragging him to the ground, giving Navy its first fourth-quarter comeback victory since 2021. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The Midshipmen are quietly 6-0 with the chance to make some major noise in November. Navy travels to Notre Dame on Nov. 8 before facing South Florida (No. 19) and Memphis (No. 22) in back-to-back tilts that figure to have major American Conference title-game implications. As it stands, the winner of the American will be the heavy favorite to grab the Group of 5 slot in the playoff. If Horvath, who has rushed and passed for 100 yards apiece in three straight games, keeps up this fourth-quarter magic, the Midshipmen could be a surprise playoff contender. -- Jake Trotter USC's new star running back USC RB King Miller was ready for the spotlight, rushing for 158 yards and one touchdown in its win over Michigan Saturday. Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire USC might have stumbled into its new star running back. After Waymond Jordan and Eli Sanders went down with injuries during Saturday's matchup between the Trojans and No. 15 Michigan, Lincoln Riley had no choice but to turn to walk-on King Miller . The redshirt freshman who didn't see any action last season was thrust into the game and did not disappoint. Miller carried the ball 18 times Saturday and totaled 158 rushing yards and a touchdown. Every time he touched the ball, it seemed like he could go for a huge gain. Miller had a total of only 11 carries for 152 yards in three games entering Saturday. This was more than just an unexpected breakout; it was a coming-out party. ""King was huge,"" coach Lincoln Riley said. ""He stepped up and made big plays. That was obviously really important for us with the way it went down. This is just what he does in practice. He's a hard worker. He's a humble guy. He cares about this team a lot. And honestly, hell, we didn't have anyone else. But he was awesome. The moment certainly wasn't too big for him."" Miller's role on this USC team is far from finished. Riley said Sanders' injury ""doesn't look super positive in terms of the rest of the season,"" while Jordan is set to miss 4-6 weeks after undergoing tightrope surgery this week, according to multiple reports. If Saturday's win over Michigan was any indication, the fact that Miller might just turn out to be the Trojans' top option at running back going forward might not be a bad thing. -- Paolo Uggetti Oklahoma's offensive stumble exposes broader concerns Let's start here: For the third time in four Red River Rivalry games under coach Brent Venables, Oklahoma went without a touchdown against Texas in Saturday's 23-6 defeat. The first two occasions came with the Sooners playing a backup quarterback in the 2022 and 2024 editions of the rivalry game. This time, Oklahoma had its starter back with John Mateer under center 17 days after undergoing surgery to repair a broken bone in his right (throwing) hand hand. But Mateer's much-anticipated return at the Cotton Bowl promptly turned into his first flop in 2025, lowlighted by three interceptions and the Heisman Trophy hopeful's least accurate throwing performance (20-of-38) in what has been an otherwise dazzling debut season with the Sooners. ""I was ready to go physically,"" Mateer said afterward. ""Mentally, I just didn't perform. My eyes weren't as good as they needed to be. When your quarterback doesn't play good football, [it's] hard to win in this league. That's what happened."" Mateer's showing in Oklahoma's gut-check defeat prompts both near- and long-term questions. Did the Sooners rush their star passer back against Texas? Would Oklahoma have been better off giving Mateer another week to recover and handing another start to sophomore Michael Hawkins Jr .? Will the physical or mental blows of Saturday impact Mateer beyond Week 7? More broadly, questions have to be asked about whether this Sooners offense is good enough to support an Oklahoma defense that ranks second nationally and the program's CFP hopes in 2025. Even with Mateer at his best, the Sooners are hamstrung by a rushing attack that ranks 106th and a good-not-great receiving corps averaging 1.5 touchdowns per game, 12th best among SEC programs. In three games against power conference opponents this fall, the Sooners have averaged only 23.6 points and 323 yards of total offense. One loss doesn't change much about the ceiling for the Sooners' 2025 season. But any chance of Oklahoma flirting with the 12-team field hinges on finding solutions on offense, well beyond the issues that cropped up in Mateer's disastrous performance against Texas on Saturday. -- Eli Lederman",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/mondaytakeaways101325/2025-college-football-week-7-takeaways-penn-state-indiana,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559534_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,922ab262bbd7a908455039eaf871da9c54245dc1
0ead48d3e16b,College football Power Rankings: How did the Top 25 look in Week 7?,,"Oct 13, 2025, 07:30 AM ET Ohio State allowed a whopping 16 points at Illinois , seven more than it had in any other game this season, and the Buckeyes were ticked off about it. ""Definitely bothers me,"" defensive lineman Kayden McDonald said. ""If we want to be the best defense in the country, we can't let people score."" As the midpoint of the 2025 season arrives, even the most dominant unit on the most dominant team is looking for areas to improve. This has largely been a season of imperfections and invalidated predictions. Don't stare directly at the preseason polls or you'll damage your eyes. Week 7 highlighted some problems, from Oklahoma' s offense to Tennessee's third-down defense (and offense) to LSU' s general sloppiness to Ole Miss' inability to finish drives. And that's just in the SEC. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore looked shaky in a 10-point loss to Indiana , and Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza threw an ugly pick-six in the victory. Michigan 's normally sound defense had no answers for Jayden Maiava , King Miller and USC, which has its own flaws but looked very sharp against the Wolverines. We're at the halfway point, and our latest power rankings examine the biggest obstacles facing the top teams. -- Adam Rittenberg Previous ranking: 1 There's not much to nitpick about the Buckeyes, who are 6-0 and have outscored their opponents 221-41, never facing legitimate danger of a loss. But Ohio State's run game remains a work in progress after losing TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins to the NFL from the national championship team. The Buckeyes averaged just 2.9 yards per carry in Saturday's win at Illinois, with only one rush longer than 10 yards. CJ Donaldson reached the end zone twice, and Ohio State's offensive line generated good movement early on, but the explosive runs didn't come. ""We need to go and look to see: Is it a blocking issue? Is there a personnel issue?"" coach Ryan Day said. ""We've got to look at all those things. But I thought the offensive line was moving people today."" The run game hasn't been awful but remains a work in progress. -- Rittenberg Previous ranking: 2 The Hurricanes will be a favorite in the rest of their games, as no ranked teams remain on their regular-season schedule. They also just had their final open date of the season this past weekend, so Miami will play seven straight games to close out the slate before championship game weekend. The biggest obstacle is making sure the Hurricanes stay as focused on the teams ahead as they were when playing Top 25 teams earlier in the season. Under Mario Cristobal, Miami has lost eight games as a favorite, including two this past season that cost it a spot in the ACC championship game. Miami is the prohibitive favorite now to get to Charlotte and win the ACC. -- Andrea Adelson Indiana joins the top 3 in Week 7 after a big 30-20 road win over Oregon. Soobum Im/Getty Images Previous ranking: 7 After what was a pretty complete performance at Oregon on both sides of the ball to notch a 30-20 win, Indiana doesn't just look like a team that is College Football Playoff-bound for the second straight season; it looks even better and more confident than last year's squad. With more experience, better talent and Curt Cignetti at the helm, the Hoosiers' biggest obstacle might be themselves. As Cignetti pointed out postgame, penalties (specifically false starts) were a major issue. Outside of that, however, it's Ohio State that is their biggest competition in the Big Ten. They avoid each other in the regular season which could set up a potential matchup in the championship game in Indianapolis. Regardless, if Indiana makes it to that game, it's a near certainty that it'll be back in the playoff, where the ghosts of what Notre Dame did to the Hoosiers in the first round this past season await. -- Paolo Uggetti Previous ranking: 5 The Aggies are for real, moving to 6-0 for the first time since 2016 and only the second time in the past 30 years with a win over Florida . But now the real fun starts. They'll roll into Fayetteville to face Arkansas for just the second time since 1990, in Bobby Petrino's first home game as the interim coach on a night in which the Hogs are honoring Darren McFadden. They follow that up with trips to LSU and Missouri, and won't return home until Nov. 15. The A&M defense is bringing back old Wrecking Crew feelings, holding three straight SEC opponents to 100 yards or less and dominating on third down, becoming the first major conference program in the past 20 years to hold three straight teams to one or fewer conversions on third down. The old saying is that defense travels. We're about to find out. -- Dave Wilson Previous ranking: 4 The Rebels are getting ready to face the most difficult part of their schedule, starting with Saturday's SEC road game at Georgia. They'll play at Oklahoma the week after that, followed by a home game against South Carolina on Nov. 1. If Ole Miss is to survive that stretch, it's going to need to eliminate the self-inflicted mistakes it keeps making. The Rebels are the third-most penalized team in the SEC with 73.8 yards per game. They also rank 14th in the league in turnover margin at minus-4, losing three fumbles and throwing five interceptions. In Saturday's 24-21 win against Washington State , the Rebels were penalized eight times for 99 yards. -- Mark Schlabach Previous ranking: 8 The Red Raiders continue to show they're dynamic, malleable and can win however they need. This week, they lost starting quarterback Behren Morton to injury and backup Will Hammond struggled through the air, going 7-of-16 for 42 yards with an interception, yet they won 42-17 over Kansas . Hammond added 61 yards and two scores, but the superstar was running back Cameron Dickey , who piled up 263 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 12.5 yards per carry. Tech has won six straight games by 20 or more points, and it has all been seemingly different. But the one constant is that the Red Raiders have fielded perhaps the best defense in school history. The only concern for Tech right now is the health of Morton, who has left three games this season with an injury, though the Red Raiders have a lot of belief in Hammond, who put on a show in relief against Utah. The schedule looks extremely favorable, with the remaining teams having a 19-18 record, and that includes 6-0 BYU. -- Wilson Previous ranking: 9 The Crimson Tide have reeled off five straight wins since losing the opener to Florida State , but they have done it without a strong run game. Alabama has struggled to consistently move the ball on the ground, and losing Jam Miller to a concussion in the fourth quarter of a 27-24 win over Missouri on Saturday is certainly not the news this team needs headed into the Tennessee game this week. Alabama ranks No. 103 in the nation in rush offense and is averaging just 3.89 yards per rush. Against Missouri, Alabama had 43 carries for just 126 yards. Ty Simpson has been carrying this offense, but at some point, Alabama is going to have to run the ball more consistently than it has this season. -- Adelson Previous ranking: 10 If the Bulldogs are going to stay in the SEC title mix, they're going to have to figure out a way to get opponents off the field on third down. The Bulldogs rank 13th in the league in that area, allowing their opponents to convert 40.2% of the time. By comparison, when Georgia won its second straight CFP national title during the 2022 season, it led the SEC and ranked No. 2 in the FBS at 26.6%. It's the biggest reason why the Bulldogs lost to Alabama 24-21 at home and had to come from behind to survive in their road victories at Tennessee and Auburn . The Crimson Tide converted nine of their 11 third-down plays while building a 24-14 lead in the first half. Auburn had a 75-yard touchdown drive to start the game and controlled the ball for nearly 22 minutes in the first half, converting 8 of 11 third downs along the way. The Bulldogs have made great adjustments at halftime of games, but they need to do better coming out of the gates. -- Schlabach Previous ranking: 3 Since 2022, this Ducks team has run on a very particular kind of energy: success at home in front of a frenzied crowd that had helped them win 18 straight games in a row at Autzen Stadium. But after Indiana came into town and outmatched Oregon to the tune of a 30-20 result, Dan Lanning's team will need to reset and find its groove again. The loss does not deter the Ducks' season-long goals, but it does force them to reevaluate some of their weaknesses, including an inability to match the energy of a team that is as good or better than they are (see: not just Indiana but Ohio State in the playoff last year, too). Throughout this dominant stretch, Lanning has been exceptional at continuing to motivate his team to keep its success going. What will his approach be after Oregon just got punched in the mouth? -- Uggetti Previous ranking: 12 If the concerns surrounding Georgia Tech's close wins to start the season suggested the Yellow Jackets could be susceptible to an upset, it sure didn't seem to be true in Week 7. Georgia Tech jumped out to an early 15-0 lead and never looked back in a 35-20 win over Virginia Tech . Better news, the ground game, which had been dependent on Haynes King 's rushing ability, racked up 268 yards, while King proved he can win with his arm too, completing 20 of 24 passes for 213 yards and a score. That type of offensive balance will be the key to the Jackets staying undefeated moving forward. -- David Hale Previous ranking: 11 Tennessee allowed 16.1 points per game and 4.6 yards per play during last year's College Football Playoff run. This year, the Volunteers are allowing 29.3 points per game and 5.1 yards per play. On Saturday in Knoxville, they needed a 146-yard rushing day from DeSean Bishop and a 109-yard receiving day from Braylon Staley to survive a track meet with Arkansas, 34-31. The win moved the Volunteers to 5-1, and as long as quarterback Joey Aguilar and company can keep the points and yards flowing, they could be fine. But they've allowed 24, 26, 31 and 34 points in four of their wins (and 44 in their loss). Trying to win track meet after track meet is a tough way to remain in the playoff hunt. -- Bill Connelly Previous ranking: 13 It's safe to say that LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier hasn't gotten as much help as he needs this season. The run game has stunk, and he has had to throw short and quick to assure pressure doesn't become an issue. That remains an issue, but there were signs of hope in Saturday's 20-10 win over South Carolina . Thanks in part to a 56-yard burst from Ju'Juan Johnson , LSU rushed for 166 yards, and Nussmeier was able to complete 20 of 33 passes for 254 yards with no sacks. He did throw two interceptions, and LSU turned the ball over twice in the red zone, which allowed the Gamecocks to hang around. But the defense was excellent once again, and the problematic offense appeared to make progress. -- Connelly Previous ranking: 6 John Mateer returned Saturday for the Allstate Red River Rivalry after a hand injury in Week 4. Tim Warner/Getty Images The Sooners' smooth start to the 2025 season struck a pothole in a 23-6 loss to Red River rivals Texas at the Cotton Bowl in Week 7. Away from the struggles of quarterback John Mateer in his return from a hand injury and an uncharacteristically leaky defense, Oklahoma's 106th-ranked run game was the thorn in the Sooners' side for yet another week, and it remains the biggest threat to the program's playoff aspirations in 2025. Oklahoma gained just 48 yards from 30 attempts (1.6 yards per carry) on Saturday, cycling between running backs Tory Blaylock , Xavier Robinson and Jaydn Ott to no avail. Without a meaningful run game, the Sooners' offense has become a worryingly one-dimensional problem not even Mateer's typically outstanding playmaking can overcome. It's an issue that will surely trip Oklahoma up across the back half of the regular season, just as it did against Texas. -- Eli Lederman Previous ranking: 16 The Cougars trailed by 10 at Arizona with less than five minutes to play before finding a way to send the game to overtime, where they won, 33-27. The win kept their undefeated season alive ahead of this week's Holy War game against Utah. Now comes the hard part. BYU's schedule is much more difficult in the second half of the season. It got quarterback Bear Bachmeier the experience he needed but it's concerning how much the Cougars relied on his legs against Arizona (22 carries, 89 yards). They need to be able to throw it more effectively for the winning streak to continue. -- Kyle Bonagura Previous ranking: 14 Mizzou fought hard, tackled well and made life as difficult as possible for Alabama in Columbia on Saturday, but Eli Drinkwitz's Tigers still fell 27-24 because, well, they couldn't pass. Beau Pribula went just 16-for-28 passing for 167 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions; even with Ahmad Hardy and Jamal Roberts combining to average 6.0 yards per carry. After an early touchdown, the Tigers scored just 10 points over a 55-minute period before nearly pulling off a late comeback. With plenty of other excellent defenses coming up on the schedule -- including Auburn's next week -- the Tigers can't afford to become one-dimensional if they want to remain in the playoff race. -- Connelly Previous ranking: 17 Notre Dame dominated NC State , 36-7, behind another stellar performance from QB CJ Carr . More impressively is that a defense, lambasted after an 0-2 start for struggles, particularly in the secondary, dominated, picking off CJ Bailey three times in the win. The ugly start to the season seems like it's fully in the rearview mirror, but those two early losses mean Notre Dame will continue to walk a tightrope in hopes of a playoff berth, and Week 8 could be the moment the Irish tumble to the ground. USC awaits after a big win over Michigan, with a date in South Bend likely to be the defining moment of Notre Dame's season. -- Hale Previous ranking: NR After an impressive 31-13 win over No. 15 Michigan Saturday, the Trojans' biggest obstacle may be something that they can't go back and change: their loss to Illinois two weeks ago in a game that was seemingly in their hands before they let it slip away. The reason that loss may linger for Lincoln Riley's team is the fact that the rest of its schedule is daunting to say the least. USC heads to Notre Dame next before heading to face Nebraska in another tough road environment, then has to deal with pesky teams like Northwestern and Iowa at home. The finishing stretch features a dangerous road trip to play Oregon before getting a suddenly-feisty UCLA team at home. Every game in that stretch is its own tricky obstacle and the Trojans have yet to prove they can play consistent elite football, especially on the road. With their talent, the Trojans are plenty capable. The question is whether they will be able to turn that into results. -- Uggetti Previous ranking: 25 For the first time this fall, Texas finally looked the part of the preseason No. 1 and the national title contender the Longhorns were expected to be in August. With physical line play, a productive run game and error-free football from quarterback Arch Manning , Texas controlled the final 35 minutes at the Cotton Bowl and smoothly dispatched Oklahoma in a 23-6 win that breathed life back into its playoff hopes this fall. The challenge now for the Longhorns will be maintaining that level over the back half of the season with a consistency they simply haven't shown in 2025. If Steve Sarkisian & Co. can replicate Saturday's performance outside of a rivalry game when their backs are against the wall, Texas has a shot to claw back into the CFP hunt with only three ranked matchups remaining on the schedule. -- Lederman Previous ranking: 19 The Hoos were off in Week 7, which gave Tony Elliott & Co. a chance to take stock of all that has transpired. After a deflating Week 2 loss to NC State in what was considered a nonconference game, Virginia has roared back to life behind a stellar running game and the heroics of QB Chandler Morris . It has won four straight, including back-to-back overtime wins against Florida State and Louisville Cardinals . The remaining schedule is accommodating -- Washington State, UNC and Cal are up next -- but the Cavaliers would feel better if the next few W's don't require as much stress as the past two. -- Hale Previous ranking: 20 Vanderbilt QB Diego Pavia will need to focus on not turning over the ball throughout the second half of the season. AP Photo/Vasha Hunt The Commodores got a well-timed bye week following their 30-14 loss at Alabama, giving them a chance to get healthy and dig into how they can fine-tune from their first loss of the year. The defining four-game stretch of their schedule comes next against LSU, Missouri, Texas and Auburn, and they're getting three of those four at home. Clark Lea's squad has proven it can compete with anyone in its conference. Now it takes great precision and poise to pull off these upsets. Quarterback Diego Pavia was excellent through his first five starts but has eight turnover-worthy plays this season, according to Pro Football Focus, after producing just five through 13 games in 2024. -- Max Olson Previous ranking: NR The Bulls cleared one of their few remaining hurdles and secured another résumé-building victory in a 27-point win on the road against previously unbeaten North Texas Friday night. South Florida has now committed 13 turnovers this fall, including three across a messy first quarter against the Mean Green, more than all but four other FBS offenses entering play Saturday. But those turnover troubles haven't kept the Bulls from reaching the back half of the regular season as one of the Group of 5's leading CFP contenders. The biggest obstacle standing in the way of USF's playoff hopes? A Week 9 trip to Memphis on Oct. 25. If the Bulls can land a ranked road win over the Tigers later this month, they'll reach November with pole position in the American title race, and in turn, a clear path to the first-ever CFP appearance in school history. -- Lederman Previous ranking: 21 The 6-0 Tigers had the week off following their 45-7 rout of Tulsa , which gave them a chance to start working ahead on UAB , as well as their much-anticipated Oct. 25 showdown with South Florida, a game with potentially massive College Football Playoff implications. Coach Ryan Silverfield said he'll harp on ball security and how important it is that his team take care of the football over the second half of the season. Quarterback Brendon Lewis has been responsible for six of the Tigers' seven turnovers on the year, and they've been fortunate to only lose two of their six fumbles so far. Memphis' defense has been able to get stops in four of these sudden change situations, but this squad will be in trouble if it's not careful against a USF team that converted five takeaways into 21 points to rout North Texas. -- Olson Previous ranking: NR The Utes dazzled in a 32-point win over then-No. 21 Arizona State , their third-largest win over a ranked opponent in school history, led by Devon Dampier 's three rushing TDs and 120 yards on the ground to go with 104 passing yards. The Utes ended a five-game home losing streak to conference opponents, a shocking stat, but coach Kyle Whittingham said that's over now. The next test is the big one: a nationally televised Holy War game against BYU in Provo, following last year's one-point loss in the rivalry. It's once again predicted to be close: ESPN's FPI gives the Cougars a 51% chance to win. -- Wilson Previous ranking: 24 Coach Scott Satterfield and the Bearcats said they would be better before the season, and they have backed it up, even after an agonizing loss to Nebraska in the opener. The Bearcats won their fifth consecutive game Saturday, their longest win streak since 2022, and are 3-0 in Big 12 play for the first time. They have one of the nation's best offensive lines, quarterback Brendan Sorsby has been fantastic, and their defense has been opportunistic in forcing turnovers, adding their seventh forced fumble against UCF . While the defense took a step in the right direction against UCF, allowing only 11 points, Cincinnati still surrendered 1,480 yards in the three Big 12 games. The Bearcats entered Saturday ranked 121st nationally in pass efficiency defense, an area that must improve with upcoming games against Baylor , Utah and BYU. -- Rittenberg Previous ranking: NR At the halfway point of the season, Nebraska has done enough to get the collective hopes of its fanbase in a rare optimistic position. ESPN's Football Power Index projects the Cornhuskers' most likely finish to be 9-3, which would be the program's best finish since 2016. But the second half of the schedule is full of land mines: There are no easy outs the rest of the way. QB Dylan Raiola has had some incredible moments but his three interceptions against Maryland on Saturday are a bit concerning. -- Bonagura",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46573398/2025-college-football-week-7-power-rankings-top-25,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559314_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,5efc8c7cea01ede239a06642facd7fe6044d9571
922414779ce6,How Bills' Sean McDermott has adapted during quest for Super Bowl,,"ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The accounts from the beginning of the Sean McDermott era in Buffalo always include similar notes. He had many rules to follow -- a strictness that came from establishing a new culture. Video games, billiards and air hockey tables were taken out of the locker room. Explicit music wasn't allowed. Hats were barred from meetings. Players had to dress up for plane rides to away games. Players were announced out of the tunnel all at once before home games -- which some veteran players took issue with. McDermott, now nine seasons in as head coach of the Bills, has built an AFC contender year after year -- led by quarterback Josh Allen for the past eight of those seasons. There have been two AFC Championship Game appearances, five straight division titles and countless records broken. As time has passed, cornhole has become a mainstay in the Bills' locker room. There's a hockey game table in the middle of one section of the locker room across from a small golf putting area and a table for card games. In recent seasons, a DJ was brought in to play music in the locker room. Plane attire varies from player to player. Starters are announced one at a time on game day. These are the elements that McDermott, 51, has let up on. He has passed on some of the expectations of leadership to players who have been in the building for many years. ""He came in and set the foundation that he wanted, and then he got the vets that he wanted to lead the team the way he wanted it, and that was a rite of passage ... like, here you go,"" defensive tackle Jordan Phillips said. ""You guys have earned my respect. I'mma lay off a little bit."" McDermott's background working under then- Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid from 1999-2010 gave an example to McDermott of how to achieve success. He observed Reid not putting himself in the spotlight and wanted to emulate. ""There's coaches that create distractions for their team and then they can't focus, and so, there are already distractions,"" McDermott said. ""You just try and limit those as much as you can. Now, there's a delicate sweet spot in there that I've tried to find lately, because I also saw where you want people to really know the true you, in particular, the team first. And that's a moving target, I think, too."" But the questions mount over the Bills not reaching a Super Bowl during his tenure. The Bills came into this season with the highest of expectations and are off to a 4-1 start ahead of Monday's game at the Atlanta Falcons (7:15 p.m. ET, ESPN). McDermott sat down with ESPN in the summer and discussed, along with those who work alongside him, how his views and mental approach have changed over time, from his coordinators to work-life balance. McDermott has adapted his coaching staff over time, but the mounting questions toward the head coach persist about not having reached a Super Bowl during his tenure. AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson A RECENT MODELING campaign McDermott did with local men's clothing store and tailor BUREAU received attention online. The photos and video campaigns feature McDermott in a variety of outfits, including tailored suits, a professional track suit, a shacket and a collared shirt and baseball hat. Wide receiver Gabe Davis quipped to McDermott that he hopes that he looks like that when he is the coach's age. Left tackle Dion Dawkins , who was part of McDermott's first draft class in 2017, said that he never thought the day would come when McDermott would be comfortable showing himself that way. Linebackers coach Al Holcomb said that McDermott's personality hasn't changed since he met him when both were with the Carolina Panthers , but Holcomb has seen McDermott be a little more flexible as he has grown in his role. Running backs coach Kelly Skipper, who has been with McDermott during his entire tenure in Buffalo, noted how as the head coach, you learn that the role is more about the players. ""You learn the players and how you practice, whether it's sports science, incorporating all that stuff,"" Skipper said. ""It's all encompassing in what you do, how you practice, different things like that. But he's always been very detailed on what he's doing. That hasn't changed."" The players have appreciated the approach, with his recent addition of ""dad joke Fridays"" -- it's agreed that the jokes are terrible and cringy, but beloved at the same time. ""It's definitely not his jokes,"" Allen cracked when asked how McDermott has progressed. ""I just think it's the way that he approaches guys in the locker room and how he talks to people. He's loosened up on some of the rules within the building, the hats, the this, and he lets guys be themselves."" Along with the dad joke Fridays, the Bills also began a tradition of having one member of the offense and one member of the defense play each other for one series in Madden during the weekly meeting -- only playing with the Bills. Multiple players who have been on McDermott's teams over the years noted that he is easier to talk to nowadays. Defensive back Cam Lewis described him as ""looser,"" while Davis went said McDermott is less socially awkward and is now more personable. ""I say some edgy things sometimes to get him kind of riled up, so he tries to find the right response for it,"" Davis said. ""But I feel like I kind of put him in weird situations, so I like messing with him that way."" The culture that McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane have built in Buffalo has been praised but has been far from flawless. There have been missteps along the way and plenty of questions surrounding McDermott from outside the building. On the field, there were potential playoff wins that were in the Bills' grasp -- like the 2021 season divisional-round game that will be remembered as ""13 seconds"" and then the losses to Kansas City in the playoffs the past two seasons. Off the field, there was a miscommunication on former Bill Stefon Diggs ' minicamp availability that led to speculation on the wide receiver's status in 2023. There were also remarks McDermott made during 2019 training camp that resurfaced when he used the Sept. 11 terrorists as an example of group coordination in a message to the team, something he later apologized for. People around the Bills have recently expressed that they feel like they can be themselves more. From McDermott's perspective, that's been part of the culture since he arrived. He emphasized that culture does not guarantee success, but it ""certainly helps in a lot of ways."" ""The journey is grueling at times, and so, you want to be around people that you enjoy working with. You want to be able to be your true self, and I think that's important to people becoming the best version, achieving that level of success,"" McDermott said. ""How do you do it if you can't express your true personality? ... I think that's important for me too. I don't want to be in here and be walking around like a robot."" While the change from a communication perspective is there, there are many signatures of a McDermott-led team that have remained the same. Details are the signature of McDermott's coaching, which is why the penalty-filled, two-turnover first quarter the Bills had in the team's first loss of the season to the New England Patriots last week was out of character. There are certain tenants of McDermott's coaching that have remained constant -- consistency being among them. Others include focusing on what's in front of you, doing your 1/11th, having a defense that is going to fly around, playing smart and taking the ball away. ""Sean McDermott is quiet strength, but Sean McDermott is intense. He has a blue-collar approach to success,"" defensive line coach Marcus West said. ""... We're going to win because we're going to outwork you. We're going to win because we're going to be more physical than you. He carries the persona of quietness, but he's not a guy you want to see in the ring."" Josh Allen has noticed how Sean McDermott has changed: ""... It's the way that he approaches guys in the locker room and how he talks to people. He has loosened up on some of the rules within the building ... and he lets guys be themselves."" Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images IN 2023, McDERMOTT took over playcalling for the defense, a first during his time as head coach. Veteran coach Leslie Frazier, formerly head coach of the Minnesota Vikings , was the defensive coordinator from 2017-22. Calling the defense was something McDermott felt great doing and described as ""a sweet spot"" and something that comes ""naturally."" Years ago, McDermott interviewed multiple NFL head coaches and asked why they were playcallers as well. A message he received was that you're only going to agree with about 30% to 40% of the calls no matter how aligned you are with your staff. One of those coaches was a veteran NFL defensive head coach who wasn't calling plays at first as head coach but later did. ""He's like, 'Well, I just decided that no matter what I tell the defensive coordinator, he's not going to call it like I want it called.' So, he told me, he was like, 'Why don't I just call it and stop, and so there's no like bickering or whatever,'"" McDermott recalled. ""And so, the year I called it, I was like this is, I don't have to, I guess shadow the defensive coordinator. I am the defensive coordinator, but then I'm the head coach also."" That season, the Bills went 11-6 and lost in the divisional round at home to the Kansas City Chiefs . The unit finished fourth in points allowed, ninth in yards allowed and third in takeaways. But McDermott subsequently installed Bobby Babich as defensive coordinator and playcaller in 2024. Babich has worked under McDermott in Buffalo since 2017. So, why the change? ""I have to look our players in the eye and say, 'I'm the best head coach I can be for you guys every day,' and splitting that job up. I don't see that you're able to be exactly the best defensive coordinator in the league, the best head coach in the league,"" McDermott said. ""And I just feel like overall I owe that to them. And so, and more and more, the head coaching job to me is gravitating towards making sure our players are in the right mindset, the right head space every week, every day. And because messaging, my energy, my availability, all of that is what they need the most."" Babich spoke two weeks ago about McDermott having final say on the defense -- being a defensive-minded head coach. McDermott's signature remains on the unit -- playing fast, being clear-minded and ""just go,"" as Holcomb explained. McDermott oversees the operations in all three phases, with Beane in charge of personnel. Players say McDermott has allowed Babich to lead, but that when McDermott does attend a defensive meeting, it tends to mean something is going on. ""He plays a backdrop,"" cornerback backs coach Jahmile Addae said. ""He'll step in and interject when he thinks that, when he sees things that he feels aren't maybe up to par or wants to change, but very few and far between. And it's always in a respectful manner and more of a coaching type, mentorship type of manner."" For McDermott, working with his coordinators provides an opportunity to share what he has learned. The hope is that it will create the best possible overall leadership. ""Iron sharpens iron and sharpens one another, we'll equip [Babich] to be the best defensive coordinator that he can be,"" McDermott said. ""And ideally then, just like [offensive coordinator] Joe Brady, growing Joe Brady and [special teams coordinator Chris Tabor] now, and hey, I learned things from them. They learned things from me. And all of a sudden we have four really strong leaders in our organization that are all aligned, all really good at what they do. Now we got a real chance."" Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, left, and defensive coordinator Bobby Babich. Shawn Dowd/USA TODAY NETWORK THE PRESSURE TO win a Super Bowl is enormous for McDermott and the organization. The Bills are off to a 4-1 start, but the loss to the Patriots showed there is real competition in the division for the future. Allen is in the prime of his career at age 29. The team's ability to take advantage of that and have the team needed around Allen will be paramount. After a loss or when he believes he didn't coach his best, McDermott admits he is hard on himself, and that perfectionism or desire to coach a perfect game is something that can get in the way of moving forward from a personal and team perspective. He said his parents raised him to be the best at whatever he chose to do, which drives him. The coach noted that game results and performance can become how members of the team gauge their self-worth. To avoid that, he learned to find ways to unplug, something that does not come naturally. ""Because it's a performance-driven job and we're at the highest levels, there's a chance you're not going to get that result every week that you're looking for or coach your best game,"" McDermott said. ""And trying to make sure that my worth is yes, this job is important to me, very important to me, but I have to find for my own good and my own health ways to make sure that I stay tied to the bigger picture for myself and for my family. And then hopefully try and model that to my kids as well."" McDermott and his wife, Jamie, have raised three children -- Maddie, Gavin and Kelly -- in Western New York. It was breaking the team's historic 18-year playoff drought in 2017 that made McDermott realize he and his family are ""here for a reason, and it goes well beyond the football field."" McDermott got emotional before the season talking about changing the narrative around the region's championship drought, which he says is probably the No. 1 thing for him. And that absolute main focus is on bringing a Super Bowl to the community, but it goes even beyond that. ""What's most important is how you do the job and you do your best in the life that you're trying to live. Because I think that impact is more lasting than anything, wins and losses,"" McDermott said. ""So I do try and keep things in perspective. That doesn't mean that at all, at all, at all that I don't wake up every day with that on my mind."" Sean McDermott Via BUREAU (Brandon Watson,@brndnwtsn)",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46544274/buffalo-bills-coach-sean-mcdermott-adapt-quest-super-bowl,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1009%2Fr1557968_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,4c08b3d1f6c0cc315cab527f4b1ad69e28f8014e
2c4cd02cc66e,NFL,,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Kaden Elliss was licking his chops going into training camp last year. The Atlanta Falcons ' inside linebacker knew a rookie, first-round pick Michael Penix Jr ., was running the second-team offense. In camp practices, the Falcons typically have the first-team defense face the second-team offense, and vice versa. And for Elliss, Penix would be a sacrificial lamb for the Atlanta defense while he got up to speed on the NFL. ""I was like, 'Yes, I'm about to get my hands on a bunch of interceptions -- I'm about to make a bunch of big plays,'"" Elliss said. Then, something weird happened. Penix operated like a veteran, rarely making errant throws, airing out passes down the field and keeping his interceptions to a minimum. ""I didn't get him once all training camp, and he just didn't do ill-advised things, but he still let his arm talent show every single day,"" Elliss said. ""And there's a lot of guys with amazing arm talent that may be on a couch, that aren't starting in the NFL, that can make every throw ... but who can't blend letting their arm talent shine while also playing smart, and Penix does both in such an amazing way."" The Falcons surprised the league when they drafted Penix at No. 8 in 2024 after already having signed veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins to a $100 million guaranteed contract weeks earlier. But the organization knew it had something in Penix early, and there hasn't been any regret since. Michael Penix Jr. will make his ""Monday Night Football"" debut against the Bills, and the Falcons are confident he's ready for the moment. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Penix took over for a struggling Cousins late last season. There have been ups and downs during his seven career starts, though the main throughline has been his calm under pressure and ability to battle back from adversity. This week, Penix will make his first start on ""Monday Night Football"" against the Buffalo Bills , who are yielding the second-fewest passing yards per game (154.0). He has done nothing to make the Falcons' coaching staff or front office believe he is not up to the task. ""I feel great with Mike in every game,"" Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. ... ""I think these games are huge. ""It's fun to watch, it's fun to be a part of. It's fun to watch these guys grow and develop, and I've got the utmost confidence in Mike."" In Week 3, Penix had his worst performance. He threw two interceptions, including his first career pick-six, in a 30-0 loss to the Carolina Panthers . Penix rebounded in a major way two weeks ago, leading the Falcons to a 34-27 win over the Washington Commanders . He was 20-of-26 passing for a career-high 313 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception. ""That is the telltale sign for quarterbacks: how you respond,"" Morris said. ""It doesn't go your way, it's not absolutely what you want it to look like in the game, and you have to respond and play better -- and obviously, you've got to play better around him -- but how do you respond? ""And I loved his practice response. I loved his verbal response to his team. I loved his response in the game, and I loved his response of knowing it's a process and I love how he reacted to the criticism. I love how he reacted to everything."" PENIX TRANSFERRED TO Tampa Bay Technical High School in the spring of his sophomore year. The football team already had an established starting quarterback, so Penix began as a third-stringer. That lasted ""two-and-a-half, maybe three practices,"" according to Tampa Bay Tech coach Jayson Roberts. ""I think the first time he threw the deep out from the opposite hash to the sideline and it got there on a rope and almost broke the receiver's fingers, we all kind of looked at each other,"" Roberts told ESPN. ""This is different."" Penix led the Washington Huskies to the 2024 CFP National Championship game, where they lost to the Michigan Wolverines. Carmen Mandato/Getty Images Penix has spent almost his entire time in football trying to prove himself and dealing with adversity. In six college seasons, with Indiana and Washington, he had four season-ending injuries, including a pair of torn ACLs. Penix returned as a senior at Washington and took the team to the national championship game. He led the nation in passing yards (4,903) and finished second in Heisman voting, the highest ever for a Huskies player. After he was drafted by the Falcons, he was on the bench again -- behind Cousins -- and it seemed like that was where he would stay for the foreseeable future. Atlanta general manager Terry Fontenot said on draft night that Penix could sit for ""four or five years"" if Cousins was excelling. Penix was supposed to learn from Cousins during those years, then become the starter down the road, a plan the team described as the ""Green Bay model."" As it turned out, the transition came sooner than most thought. After leading the Falcons to a 6-3 start, their best since their 2016 Super Bowl season, Cousins faltered in November and December. Cousins led the NFL in interceptions (16) and fumbles (12, tied with Baker Mayfield ) when he was benched Dec. 16. A five-game stretch with nine interceptions and just one touchdown pass ultimately prompted Morris to sit Cousins and start Penix ""moving forward."" Penix led the Falcons past the New York Giants in his first start and then guided a game-tying, fourth-quarter drive against the Washington Commanders in Week 17. Penix's first career touchdown pass was a laser to tight end Kyle Pitts Sr. on a fourth-and-13 to tie the score with 1:17 left in regulation. Atlanta lost that game in overtime to all but squash its playoff hopes, but Penix put his team in position to win it. ""Poised,"" Falcons wide receiver Darnell Mooney said, describing Penix at the end of regulation. ""Just comfort. Didn't really get stressed at any moment. He was ready."" Penix ran the scout team offense throughout the 2024 season before getting the starting role. During one practice, then-defensive coordinator Jimmy Lake threw an exotic blitz at him. The cornerback pressured from a unique position. Penix, a left-hander, saw it and fired a 15-yard strike outside the numbers for a first down. ""And he looked to the sideline, and he says, 'Oh, don't do that, Coach Lake -- don't do that,'"" Lake said. ... ""He started laughing, and that's a moment that I remember where I was like, 'OK, he can see it.' And obviously the talent, he can rip this ball anywhere across the field."" The arm talent jumps off the page. It's what every scout was talking about heading into the draft. But what Lake noticed was something former Indiana coach Tom Allen saw in Penix from an early age, right out of Tampa Bay Tech. ""We thought we had a special player when we got him and, when he got there, he just had a lot of physical talent, and it showed up early in practice, just being able to make a lot of throws that a lot of guys can't make at that age,"" said Allen, who is now Clemson's defensive coordinator. ""But the thing that impressed me was just processing, and I think that's something that stuck out this whole time with us, and it continues to show strong and that is the ability to analyze defenses, make quick decisions mentally and just really know where to take the ball and read coverages."" Penix's demeanor helps him do that. Morris joked that Penix is ""not going to die from a heart attack."" When Atlanta offensive coordinator Zac Robinson called Penix on Dec. 16, 2024, to tell him he would be the team's starter, Penix was shopping at Costco with his then-girlfriend (and now fiancée) Olivia Carter. Penix said he was about to buy a hot dog, but when he received the news, he wasn't hungry anymore. That's about as much excitement as he shows. Kalen DeBoer, Penix's former coach at Washington and now the coach at Alabama, said that poise comes from the hardships Penix has overcome, including those season-ending injuries. ""Just really steady,"" DeBoer said. ""He was good in the big moments. I think that's a lot of just his personality. I think there's a lot of experiences he went through where he just understands that adversity is going to come and that handling it the right way and kind of predetermining your response and what that's going to be. ""He's learned a lot with everything he's been through."" PENIX PLAYED FOUR sports -- football, basketball, baseball, and track and field -- in high school. He's 6-foot-2 and has a vertical jump of 36½ inches. Tampa Bay Tech went undefeated in the one season Penix played hoops. ""It was a freaking highlight,"" Roberts said. ""We had packed gyms because everybody wanted to see Mike catch alley-oops and dunk on people. ... I think probably the part of his game most underrated is just how much of a freak athlete he is."" Penix, 24, ran a sub-4.6-second 40-yard dash at his pro day in March 2024, and he said he can run one in the 4.4s. But that's a part of Penix's game he'd rather not exhibit.

At the time, Penix was committed to Tennessee, and Roberts told him that coaches from the school were coming to his next game and wanted to see his mobility. Volunteer coaches were coming to the game, but they weren't as concerned about Penix's legs as Roberts made it seem. The talk generated the desired result, though. ""After we kind of put that in his head, I think the first time we dropped back to pass and nobody was immediately open, he pulled it down and went like 80 yards for a touchdown,"" Roberts said. Penix showed in Week 1 this season that he can make plays with his feet when needed. He scrambled twice in the fourth quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on fourth down, once for a first down and the second time for a touchdown that put the Falcons ahead 20-17. Like in the game against the Commanders last season, the Falcons didn't execute down the stretch to get the victory. But that changed in victories over the Vikings and Commanders this season. The only one of Penix's seven starts so far that he hasn't put the Falcons in position to win was against the Panthers in Week 3, a shutout loss that Morris described as ""nasty"" and ""disgusting."" For the first time on an NFL field, Penix was visibly frustrated, slinging the ball into the grass on more than one occasion after a broken play or penalty. His headset audio was going in and out. Nothing went right. The Falcons fired wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard after the brutal loss and moved Zac Robinson to the sideline from the coaching box to call plays. But, more than anything, the criticism was on Penix. Maybe he was not the franchise quarterback the Falcons had hoped for and deemed him to be. Rather than sulking, Penix returned to the team's facility with a swagger in his step the next day. All-Pro safety Jessie Bates III said Penix apologized multiple times to the team's defense. Morris knew immediately that Penix -- and the Falcons -- would be fine. And they were, beating the Commanders thanks to Penix's bounce-back performance. ""We all are here for a reason, and something that [quarterbacks coach] DJ [Williams] told me, it was like, 'Just be yourself,'"" Penix said. ""Don't go out there and feel like you've got to be Superman and try to do everything. At the end of the day, we're all here for a reason, and we just got to believe in that and just go out there, execute and we'll be all good."" The Falcons are more than happy with Penix being himself. That's why they drafted him as high as they did, why they're so confident in his continued development and why Morris has been ""enamored"" with him since he came through the door. ""I don't want to sit here and say I showed other people something about me or about this team, but it is all about us, man,"" Penix said after the Week 4 win. ""It is not always going to be perfect. Like I said, I feel like I showed myself that I deserve to be here and I belong."" Week 6 marks Penix's first start on ""Monday Night Football."" And the Falcons are more than happy to be riding into battle with him under that spotlight against one of the NFL's elite teams. ""I'm so glad he's our quarterback,"" Elliss said, ""and I know he can take us as far as we want to go.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46544795/nfl-michael-penix-jr-falcons-quarterback-mnf,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1009%2Fr1558011_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,9782e63cd5352122697e2f87a09a09aca88e8916
fd00173cf8f4,NFL,,"Oct 13, 2025, 06:14 AM ET When Jayden Daniels embraced Caleb Williams on the field after their Week 8 heartstopper last season, the two quarterbacks couldn't have known how decisively their paths were about to diverge. Daniels, the Washington Commanders star who was drafted No. 2 in 2024, threw the winning Hail Mary and walked into a spotlight that kept getting brighter as he won Offensive Rookie of the Year and led the Commanders to the NFC Championship Game. It was one of the greatest seasons in NFL history for a rookie quarterback. Williams, the top pick in '24, walked into a mess. It was the first of 10 straight losses for the Bears, who would fire head coach Matt Eberflus and offensive coordinator Shane Waldron along the way. Daniels and Williams meet again Monday night (8:15 p.m., ABC) against the backdrop of Washington's 18-15 win last Oct. 27. The Commanders (3-2) are trying to keep pace in the NFC East while the Bears (2-2) have won two in a row and are coming off their bye. ESPN's Bears reporter Courtney Cronin, Commanders reporter John Keim, senior writer Seth Wickersham, NFL draft analyst Jordan Reid, NFL analyst Aaron Schatz, analytics analyst Seth Walder and NFL insider Jeremy Fowler break down the rivalry from various perspectives, including how that one game last year impacted the QBs between then and now. How did last year's game impact Daniels and Williams? Keim : Daniels did not change. Network morning shows reached out to have him on; he declined. Several days later he said he was ""onto the new week."" He showed up to work at the same time each day: around 5:30 a.m. But for others, it created a legend: franchise savior heaves 52-yard scoring pass with a broken rib that knocked him out of the previous game in the first quarter. ""He's unfazed by those things and will do anything to win,"" quarterbacks coach Tavita Pritchard said. Jayden Daniels and Caleb Williams embraced before heading off in different directions on Oct. 27, 2024. Daniels would win Offensive Rookie of the Year while Williams would lost his next nine games. AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough Daniels already was the front-runner for Offensive Rookie of the Year before solidifying his status in that game with a career-high 326 yards. In his six full games before facing the Bears, he'd thrown six touchdown passes and rushed for four. After that game, he threw 18 touchdown passes. But this wasn't about stats. It was about belief. The impact was less on Daniels and much more on those around him. ""Whenever you do something like that,"" said punter Tress Way , the franchise's longest-tenured player, ""coming off some of these incredible performances ... there's just this sense of we always have a shot. We've got him. You never know what he's going to do, and he's in our uniform."" Cronin : Lost in the chaos was what Williams did on the possession before the Commanders' game-winning drive. Chicago took the lead for the first time when Williams led a 10-play, 62-yard touchdown drive capped off by a successful 2-point conversion. It would have gone down as the first fourth-quarter comeback of his NFL career. Instead, the result started a spiral. Four days after the Washington game, Commanders defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. blamed himself for putting the team in position to have to win on a Hail Mary. Williams' father, Carl, quote-tweeted a video clip from Whitt's news conference with the hashtags: #accountability and #realcoach. He quickly deleted the post. Closing out games was a struggle for the Bears throughout Williams' rookie season. Weeks after the Washington loss, Chicago had chances to win in the fourth quarter and overtime in consecutive games against the Green Bay Packers , Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions , and lost them all. Williams struggled to get his team off the mat in back-to-back losses at Arizona and against New England following the Washington game. Williams was sacked a season-high nine times by a Patriots pass rush that was one of the NFL's worst. Cameras caught an awkward interaction between Waldron and Williams on the sideline at the end of the New England game when the offensive coordinator seemed to be smiling while the quarterback looked frustrated. Waldron was fired two days later. Williams ended his season with a walk-off win in Green Bay -- snapping the 10-game skid -- and a declaration for what he wanted in his next head coach. ""A coach that challenges us,"" Williams said. ""A man of his word. A disciplined coach ... Just helping us and finding ways to win."" The Bears hired former Lions OC Ben Johnson to his first head coaching job on Jan. 21. What has worked for Daniels and why has Williams been less consistent? Keim : Washington offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury often repeats one quote to his staff and his players: ""The biggest hindrance to success is not failure, it's boredom."" Those who succeed embrace that boredom -- when it comes to making decisions and how they approach each work day -- which partly explains why Daniels has been consistent. He shows up at the same time each day, goes through the same routines -- whether it's walk-throughs with coaches at 6 a.m. or his pregame routine -- and, despite having flash in his play, is OK making routine throws. ""I like the saying of don't get bored making the right decisions,"" Pritchard said. ""Routines can feel monotonous and ho-hum, but that's what allows you to keep coming back, good bad or indifferent. That's him."" Backup QB Marcus Mariota said the Commanders didn't ask Daniels to be something he wasn't, nor did they want to force leadership on him before he was ready. ""A lot of times when guys are drafted high, they're asked to be formed into maybe a player the staff had previously been with,"" Mariota said. ""More times than not it doesn't work out well. ""This team has done a great job of allowing him to be himself and put him in position where he's comfortable and confident and can go play at a high level."" Cronin : Before the Bears drafted Williams, general manager Ryan Poles described quarterbacks as being either ""artists"" or ""surgeons."" The artists are the creative types who don't ""draw within the lines"" such as Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson , whereas surgeons are the Tom Brady and Peyton Manning types who operate from the pocket and play within structure. Getting Williams to adhere to the surgeon role was a priority for Johnson and his staff during the offseason. ""Now we're asking him to be a little bit more structured in terms of the playcalls,"" Johnson said in July. ""Sometimes there's multiple calls. There's shifts, there's motions, there's a lot more going on mentally than probably there's ever been for him."" Daniels had the best numbers on third and fourth down in the league last year, but they've plummeted this season, although it's a small sample size. Luke Hales/Getty Images Some of Williams' inconsistencies in the early portion of his career were related to being late on throws, often the byproduct of holding onto the ball too long, passing up the checkdown -- all things Williams has acknowledged over the past 18 months. ""It's not perfect yet,"" Johnson said. ""There's still a number of plays where our eyes aren't quite in the right position or we're holding onto the ball just a tick longer than what we're coaching. But I did see tremendous growth in terms of going through the progression."" After back-to-back wins against Dallas and Las Vegas before Chicago's Week 5 bye, Williams noticed improvement. ""I would just say my footwork, and then just being more comfortable with everything that Ben and the guys have thrown at me,"" he said, ""just being able to grasp it all, but also be able to go out there and play a game and play it well for the team."" What stats best reflect where each QB is this season? Walder on Williams : I'll give you two related ones from this season: 23% off-target rate and minus-10% completion percentage over expectation (per NFL Next Gen Stats). Those are both the worst in the league among QBR-qualifying quarterbacks, and they tell the same story -- accuracy problems. Granted, it's a small-ish sample, but both numbers are a step back from where he was a year ago (21% and minus-1%, respectively) during his disappointing rookie campaign. Williams has to sort out his accuracy woes because they are the top factor holding back the passing offense from greatness. I mean that last part sincerely, because Williams is being very well supported. He's getting good pass protection (Bears rank fourth in pass block win rate) and has receivers who are consistently getting open in Johnson's offense. If he could simply get his passes to sail off course only at an average rate, I think the conversation around him would change in a hurry. On Daniels : Whether this is a sign of Daniels' instant growth as a rookie, regression as a sophomore or simply random variance remains to be seen, but a stat I am watching with him is his efficiency on late downs. In his rookie season (including playoffs), Daniels' production on early downs was actually quite pedestrian, with a 53.5 QBR that ranked 15th best. But on late downs, that jumped to 94.9 -- best among all quarterbacks. The latter number drove his overall efficiency numbers to the moon because late downs are where the leverage lies. Which was the true Daniels? Williams won NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his Week 3 performance against the Cowboys, throwing for 298 yards and four touchdowns in a 31-14 win. But his accuracy has resurfaced as an issue this season as he learns a new system. David Banks-Imagn Images On one hand, that split could have been seen as a red flag, since the sample of early-down plays was almost twice as large as the late-down plays. On the other hand, those third and fourth downs are probably a better indicator of skill because they occur when the opponent often knows the quarterback is dropping back to pass. Here's why I bring this all up today: Thus far in a limited three-game sample in 2025, Daniels' early-down numbers are almost identical to what he did a year ago. But third and fourth down? It's flipped the other way. He has a 23.6 QBR on those plays and a massive 36% off-target rate then, too. I don't think we should overreact to those numbers yet; we're talking about literally 39 plays. But it's worth monitoring. What has been the biggest surprise from each compared to your predraft notes? Reid: With Williams, it was how he struggled with his ball placement to start this season. One of his best attributes coming into the 2024 draft was his precise accuracy. Yes, he needed to show more discipline within structure, but when he trusted the process of playing inside of the pocket, his completion percentage was always well above average. Daniels, meanwhile, jumped out to a fast start and still has an early lead as the best QB of the loaded 2024 class. How quickly the poise and calm demeanor of Daniels translated to the NFL came as a major surprise, being that he took the Commanders all the way to the NFC Championship Game as a rookie. It's rare to see a young quarterback not only experience that level of success in the regular season but also continue it into his first-ever postseason. Finding a franchise quarterback had been at the top of the checklist for Washington, and the early success of Daniels has positioned the Commanders as true contenders in the NFC for the foreseeable future. Did the Bears talk to Daniels before the 2024 draft? Fowler : The Bears did ""due diligence"" on Daniels before the draft, according to a source involved in the process. They met with Daniels at the NFL combine. Those interviews are typically 15 minutes in length, during which teams can quiz the prospect on football strategy or get to know him personally.

Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . While Chicago did not fly Daniels to team headquarters for a predraft visit, the front office made calls to Daniels' camp to ask about the player, as is customary in the draft process. ""They were very vocal very early about taking Caleb, but going through the draft process, with the likely No. 2 pick (Daniels) to evaluate, they did their due diligence,"" the source said. Going No. 1 was not a focus for Daniels, the source added, so he didn't stump for Chicago in the process. He liked the Washington situation and was comfortable with his spot in the draft. How good can Daniels be, historically? Schatz : The range of possibilities for Daniels is still very wide. Based on my DYAR (defense-adjusted yards above replacement) metric, Daniels had the fourth-most-valuable rookie quarterback season since 1978. Yr. Player Adj DYAR 2016 Dak Prescott 1556 2012 Russell Wilson 1180 2023 C.J. Stroud 1158 2024 Jayden Daniels 1044 2004 B. Roethlisberger 993 2012 RG III 956 2008 Matt Ryan 927 1983 Dan Marino 853 2011 Cam Newton 801 2020 Justin Herbert 799 1998 Peyton Manning 724 2024 Bo Nix 708 Comparing Daniels to the other players around him on the top-10 list shows how many paths his career could still take. Daniels' passing value as a rookie was roughly equivalent to Peyton Manning's in 1998. Imagine a passer as good as Manning who was also a great mobile scrambler. That's a slim possibility, but it's one end of the range. Daniels' season was also similar to Robert Griffin III's rookie season. There are a lot of variables that could send a player's career off course, including injuries, coaching decisions and roster moves. Griffin suffered torn ligaments in his right knee in the 2012 playoffs, and he believes trying to play through injury altered his career. Or it could be something in the middle, perhaps an inconsistent career like Dak Prescott 's where Daniels is an MVP contender some years and an average starting quarterback in others. What does having Johnson as his coach mean to Williams? Wickersham : I was with Williams shortly after Johnson was hired. We were in Jacksonville. He was doing a light workout, and I was fact-checking material for my book about quarterbacks (""American Kings: A Biography of the Quarterback""). It had been a tough rookie season for him -- fulfilling a premonition of his father, Carl. But if a rookie season for a quarterback is mostly about survival, Caleb had survived indeed. Williams wanted to be coached harder this season, and the Bears obliged by hiring Ben Johnson. AP Photo/Erin Hooley Now, with Johnson in the building, he knew he had a chance to live up to expectations of the team and of himself. He had just undergone minor wrist surgery, but he picked up a football and gently threw with his private quarterback coach, Will Hewlett, and his physical therapist, Tom Gormely. He has a beautiful arm. I thought of the moment most of us saw on draft night in 2024, when the Bears picked Williams. When he was in high school, Caleb decided he was going to be the first pick in the draft, and worked backward from there. Think about the gall it required, the rigorous self-belief and borderline delusion. And yet: He did it. And as he glided onto stage to see Roger Goodell after his name was announced, he let loose a howl that was years in the making. It was pure elation -- rare elation. He said that when Johnson was hired, he howled again. That day, I asked him if it was the same type of scream, same type of feeling, as the one on draft night, pure and rare. ""Yes,"" he said with a smile as he threw. ""It was.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46543456/nfl-bears-commanders-jayden-daniels-caleb-williams-hail-mary,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1009%2Fr1557931_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,1905e6e64c85a1f37b2516fc9a8f4aee5c4f7a93
34d5d10b1bba,NBA,,"The NBA might be in its depth era, but star power still wins the day. In a sport in which only five players take the floor for each team at a time, a concentration of stars has been a clear way to build a championship-level team. But even when a team doesn't have a trio of ready-made stars, looking at the top three players on each roster is a good way to measure both the short- and long-term health of an organization and where a franchise is headed over the next few months and next few years. With that rubric in mind, we not only have laid out the cores of all 30 NBA teams , but also ranked them in comparison to one another. And we've done so by taking into account both the group's present and future value -- along with the likelihood that these players will be with their respective teams for the medium to long term. Jump to a tier: A league of their own | Knocking on the door Best of the East | Ascendant young teams Gap Years | Old stars with big questions Changing the course | Stuck in the middle Starting a rebuild | Rebuilding Tier 1: A league of their own Oklahoma City Thunder : Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Chet Holmgren , Jalen Williams Who else could be atop this list? Not only did the Thunder win 68 games and their first championship last season, but they also did so with one of the youngest title-winning rosters in NBA history. Then, to cap things off, general manager Sam Presti went out this summer and proceeded to lock all three of his young cornerstones into long-term contract extensions -- officially cementing the Thunder as the perennial favorites to lift the Larry O'Brien Trophy for the foreseeable future. Last year: Gilgeous-Alexander, Holmgren, Williams Tier 2: Knocking on the door Denver Nuggets : Aaron Gordon , Nikola Jokic , Jamal Murray Denver is a pair of rough Western Conference semifinal Game 7s -- blowing a 20-point lead at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves two years ago before playing without Gordon against the Thunder last season -- from having a potential chance at ripping off three straight titles. Denver still has the best player in the sport in Nikola Jokic, though, and a pair of co-stars who fit extremely well alongside him in Murray and Gordon. They both have delivered repeatedly in huge playoff moments. Last year: Gordon, Jokic, Murray play 1:20 Is Nikola Jokic the best player in the NBA? The ""NBA Today"" crew discusses a preseason poll naming Nikola Jokic the best player in the NBA. Tier 3: Best of the East Cleveland Cavaliers : Darius Garland , Donovan Mitchell , Evan Mobley The Cavaliers, like the Thunder, have a trio of prime-age or younger stars locked into long-term contracts and a team that won 64 games last season. Unlike the Thunder, however, Cleveland was unable to follow it with playoff success, losing in five games to the Indiana Pacers in the second round. That is why the Cavaliers are placed here and not even higher up this list. A strong playoff run next spring, and that will quickly change. Last year: Garland, Mitchell, Mobley New York Knicks : OG Anunoby , Jalen Brunson , Karl-Anthony Towns New York enters the season having moved on from coach Tom Thibodeau after reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years -- a clear indication that the Knicks believe this group is good enough to finally snap a half-century championship drought. Brunson and Towns are two of the best offensive point guards and centers, respectively, in the league, while Anunoby is as good as any defender on the wing on top of becoming an excellent 3-point shooter, too. Last year: Anunoby, Brunson, Towns Tier 4: Ascendant young teams Atlanta Hawks : Dyson Daniels , Jalen Johnson , Zaccharie Risacher For the second straight season, the Hawks have the same trio leading the way, all while the franchise has undergone a rapid and fascinating reimagining of the roster by newly installed general manager Onsi Saleh. Trae Young remains this team's best player. Kristaps Porzingis could be its second. And yet, both players are able to be unrestricted free agents next summer. Meanwhile Daniels was last season's Most Improved Player, Johnson -- if he can stay healthy -- is a popular breakout candidate and Risacher, although no Cooper Flagg or Victor Wembanyama , had a fine rookie season after Atlanta selected him No. 1 in the 2024 draft. Last year: Daniels, Johnson, Risacher Detroit Pistons : Cade Cunningham , Ron Holland , Ausar Thompson A year ago, there were massive questions about the Pistons' roster. They began with Cunningham, and whether he was capable of being the kind of star leader a franchise needs to become a factor in the playoffs. Cunningham responded with a brilliant campaign, earning All-Star and All-NBA honors for the first time while leading Detroit back to the playoffs for the first time since 2019. Questions remain about the rest of the roster, but there are several intriguing young players such as Holland, Thompson, Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren , who could all fill the remaining core spots around Cunningham. Last year: Cunningham, Holland, Ivey Houston Rockets : Alperen Sengun , Reed Sheppard , Amen Thompson A lot has changed in Houston over the past year. Thompson was a very near miss from inclusion in this group a year ago, and in hindsight that was an obvious mistake. The No. 4 pick in the 2023 NBA draft continues to blossom into a star and has a chance to take another massive leap forward this season due to the unfortunate torn ACL for Fred VanVleet last month during preseason workouts. Although I'm sure you're thinking, ""No Kevin Durant ? Really ?"" remember the purpose of this list. Durant remains -- at least for now -- without a contract extension, and Sheppard could be the team's starting point guard this season and remains a key player for Houston long term. Last year: Sengun, Sheppard, VanVleet play 1:26 Perk: The Rockets are going to be the NBA's best offensive team Kendrick Perkins breaks down his optimism for the Rockets' offense after an impressive performance vs. the Jazz. Minnesota Timberwolves: Anthony Edwards , Jaden McDaniels , Julius Randle After advancing out of the first round of the playoffs once in its first 34 years of existence, Minnesota has now done so in back-to-back seasons, reaching the Western Conference finals before losing to the Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma City Thunder , respectively. The question now is how Minnesota will find a way to advance further -- especially with the Thunder looming over the West moving forward. The answer will begin with continued improvement from Edwards and McDaniels. Randle moves into the core after inking a long-term extension with the franchise this offseason. Last year: Edwards, McDaniels, Rudy Gobert Orlando Magic : Paolo Banchero , Desmond Bane , Franz Wagner Orlando's season going sideways last year when Jalen Suggs suffered a knee injury is a sign of just how important he is -- despite the fact that he, unlike Banchero and Wagner, is not on a max contract. But Orlando paid a king's ransom to land Bane -- a perfect complement to its three young homegrown players -- this summer, and Suggs is still sidelined with the knee injury, so Bane moves into the core for this group. The Magic's season will likely hinge on whether Banchero and Wagner can make improvements in their efficiency this season -- which, if they can, could lead to huge success in a wide-open East. Last year: Banchero, Suggs, Wagner San Antonio Spurs : De'Aaron Fox , Dylan Harper , Victor Wembanyama How do you get picked fourth and win Rookie of the Year, as Stephon Castle did last season, and fall out of a team's core? By that same team trading for an All-Star point guard (Fox) and drafting another (Harper) with the second pick after jumping up in the lottery, as the Spurs did over the past few months. How all of these different players fit around the one certain core player in San Antonio for the foreseeable future, Wembanyama, will be one of the big stories of the upcoming NBA season . Last year: Wembanyama, Castle, Devin Vassell Tier 5: Gap years Boston Celtics : Jaylen Brown , Jayson Tatum , Derrick White A year ago, Boston was coming off raising banner No. 18 to the TD Garden rafters and looked poised to have a real chance at claiming a 19th title. Then came Tatum's unfortunate torn Achilles in May against the Knicks in the conference semifinals. Now, Boston is likely to spend this season spinning its wheels waiting for Tatum to get back and give this group a chance to potentially be back in the title fight again in 2026-27. Until then, though, Brown and White will still remain two of the better wing players in the NBA, and the envy of most of the opponents they'll come up against this season. Last year: Brown, Tatum, White play 2:22 Jayson Tatum: 'I haven't said I'm not playing this season' Jayson Tatum tells Stephen A. Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. Indiana Pacers : Tyrese Haliburton , Andrew Nembhard , Pascal Siakam Entering Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Indiana was likely going to be right near the top of this list after a remarkable playoff run that featured a series of historic comebacks fueled by the style of play coach Rick Carlisle and Haliburton have employed in Indianapolis. But after Haliburton suffered an Achilles tear in that final game of the 2024-25 campaign, the Pacers are also staring at a long 12 months until his likely return at the start of next season. One silver lining? Although Bennedict Mathurin fell out of the team's core thanks to the emergence of Nembhard, who had another brilliant playoff run, Haliburton's absence could give the former lottery pick a chance to reestablish himself with the Pacers. Last year: Haliburton, Siakam, Mathurin Tier 6: Old stars with big questions Dallas Mavericks: Anthony Davis, Cooper Flagg, Kyrie Irving Things are drastically different in Dallas compared to a year ago, when the Mavericks had Luka Doncic and Irving together in a backcourt that was coming off an NBA Finals appearance. Now, Irving has a torn ACL, Doncic is in Los Angeles and -- after a stunning bit of lottery luck -- Flagg is the star of the show, playing alongside Davis in the Mavericks' frontcourt. It's all pretty hard to believe, even months after it all took place. Still, Dallas could have a chance to be a factor this season -- but that will require Flagg to instantly contribute, Davis to remain healthy and Irving to come back from his knee injury ready to go by playoff time. Last year: Irving, Doncic, Dereck Lively Golden State Warriors : Jimmy Butler , Stephen Curry , Draymond Green Last season, the Warriors went 22-5 with Butler and Curry both available after acquiring Butler at the trade deadline from the Miami Heat , and they feel they'd have advanced to the Western Conference finals if they hadn't lost Curry for the rest of the series against the Minnesota Timberwolves with a hamstring injury. There's little doubt this team has a very high ceiling -- if healthy. But given their core is all 35 or older, the ""if healthy"" question is going to follow this group around all season long. Last year: Curry, Green, Brandin Podziemski LA Clippers : James Harden , Kawhi Leonard , Ivica Zubac The Clippers had a very productive offseason, going out and landing John Collins , Brook Lopez , Bradley Beal and Chris Paul , and should get strong seasons from both Harden and Zubac. Questions about Leonard -- both on and off the court -- hang over this team like a lead balloon, however. Can Leonard, who has missed just over 40% of the possible games he could've played for the Clippers over the past six seasons, and played just 37 last season, stay healthy? And, with the investigation into potential cap circumvention ongoing, will that cause any issues for him and the Clippers? Only time will tell on both fronts. Last year: Harden, Leonard, Zubac Los Angeles Lakers : Luka Doncic , LeBron James , Austin Reaves The Lakers -- fairly -- believe a team led by Doncic and James can contend with anyone. However, that requires both players to be healthy. And with James already dealing with a sciatica problem that threatens the start of his season for the first time in his remarkable career -- plus his status as the league's oldest player, who is approaching his 41st birthday -- health is going to be a constant question. And that's before the potential shooting issues, as well as the perimeter and interior defensive concerns for this team. Last year: James, Reaves, Anthony Davis Milwaukee Bucks : Giannis Antetokounmpo , Bobby Portis , Myles Turner As ESPN's Shams Charania reported last week , Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee is a much-discussed -- and planned-for -- topic around the NBA. But as the season approaches, he remains a Buck, and he should be an MVP candidate this season if he remains healthy given how much he's going to have the ball in his hands. Although Turner slots in for Brook Lopez as the floor-spacing center in the core, the drop-off from Damian Lillard -- now back in Portland -- to Portis (or Kyle Kuzma or AJ Green or whomever you choose for the third person to be) is massive and shows why it could be a challenging year in Milwaukee, even with a healthy Antetokounmpo terrorizing opponents. Last year: Antetokounmpo, Lillard, Lopez Tier 7: Changing the course Memphis Grizzlies : Cedric Coward , Jaren Jackson Jr ., Ja Morant Here's all you need to know about the state of things in Memphis: Jackson is recovering from offseason surgery; Morant is now likely to miss the start of the season with an ankle sprain ; Zach Edey is also recovering from offseason surgery; and both Jaylen Wells , No. 3 in last season's Rookie of the Year balloting, and Coward, whom Memphis leapt up in the draft to take at No. 11 this past June, ended last season hurt. The Desmond Bane trade reconstituted the Grizzlies' roster -- Memphis subsequently placed a big bet on Coward -- but this team can still go only as far as Morant and Jackson can take it. This is also another reminder of how fast things can change in the NBA, as it wasn't long ago that Morant-Jackson-Bane was seen as one of the elite, young cornerstone foundations in the league. Last year: Morant, Jackson, Bane Philadelphia 76ers : VJ Edgecombe , Joel Embiid , Tyrese Maxey Questions? In Philadelphia? Never! Jokes aside, obviously the elephant in the room is the health of Embiid, let alone that of Paul George . If the two of them can stay on the court this season, Philadelphia could be a factor in the East. But there's no certainty of when, or how often, we will see the two 76ers stars out there. George, meanwhile, is in the second year of a max extension that he signed as a free agent last summer, but he falls out of the core this season in favor of Edgecombe, the third pick in June's draft. Last year: Embiid, Maxey, George play 1:35 Shams Charania expects Erik Spoelstra to coach Team USA for multiple cycles Shams Charania joins ""The Pat McAfee Show"" to discuss Erik Spoelstra being named the head coach for Team USA men's basketball. Tier 8: Stuck in the middle Chicago Bulls : Matas Buzelis , Noa Essengue , Josh Giddey This is a franchise perpetually stuck in the mud. One could argue the Bulls should be in a lower tier than this -- but that would be saying the Bulls are definitely going to be committed to bottoming out and rebuilding. History suggests they will win 38 or 39 games and be in the play-in -- which, in this season's East, is very possible. After signing a long-term deal this offseason , Giddey is a core player. Coby White , although the team's best player, is not as he enters the season on an expiring deal. Instead, the No. 12 pick in this year's draft, Essengue, is one alongside Buzelis, last year's No. 11 pick. Last year: Giddey, White, Patrick Williams Miami Heat: Bam Adebayo , Tyler Herro , Kel'el Ware The Heat are not a team accustomed to being stuck anywhere, but that's where they seem to be after yet another play-in finish last season. With Butler now having decamped to Golden State, the Heat are officially on the hunt for their next long-term star to pair with Adebayo. Perhaps that player is Herro, if he can make another big leap after a great season earned him his first All-Star berth. Ware, too, has a lot of promise as a super-active, long defensive big. But this team needs more if it's going to leap out of the doldrums -- even in the East. Last year: Adebayo, Herro, Jimmy Butler Sacramento Kings : Zach LaVine , Keegan Murray , Domantas Sabonis The seven-game series against the Warriors in the first round of the 2023 playoffs feels like a decade ago now. De'Aaron Fox is now in San Antonio, Mike Brown is now in New York, and the Kings have morphed into a bizarro version of the Chicago Bulls with LaVine and DeMar DeRozan back together again. Murray is likely to get an extension done with Sacramento in the coming days, but he's the one long-term bright spot on this roster despite missing the first several weeks of the upcoming season with a thumb injury. The rest? Either in their prime or aging out of it, and it's unclear what path this team will take from here. Last year: Murray, Sabonis, Fox Toronto Raptors : Scottie Barnes , Brandon Ingram , Collin Murray-Boyles Barnes was guaranteed to be a part of this core after agreeing to a massive max contract extension, but who would be alongside him? It turns out, it's last season's big trade deadline acquisition, Ingram, and Toronto's big offseason acquisition, Murray-Boyles, the No. 9 pick in June's NBA draft. Still, it's hard to see the long-term upside of this group to be anything more than what the tail end of the previous Raptors playoff team was: one good enough to make it and lose in a competitive first-round series. Last year: Barnes, Gradey Dick , Immanuel Quickley Tier 9: Starting a rebuild Charlotte Hornets : LaMelo Ball , Kon Knueppel , Brandon Miller The Hornets, now in their second full season under general manager Jeff Peterson and coach Charles Lee, will hope to see their collection of interesting young talent on the court far more often this season, after a number of injuries -- including to Ball and Miller -- precluded it last season. What the injury woes did do, however, was give the Hornets the chance to land Knueppel with the fourth pick in June's draft. He should be a perfect complement alongside Ball and Miller on the wings. The questions, though, are inside, where Charlotte is back to square one after sending Mark Williams , a core member last season, to Phoenix in June after the failed trade to the Lakers back in February. Last year: Ball, Miller, Williams New Orleans Pelicans : Jeremiah Fears , Derik Queen , Zion Williamson Williamson showed up for training camp in great shape for New Orleans, and the Pelicans hope that finally translates into sustained health and high-level play from him this season. But although Dejounte Murray and Trey Murphy remain in New Orleans, the man who traded for Murray and drafted and extended Murphy -- David Griffin -- is not. So, instead, the two lottery picks from the new front office, Fears and Queen, become core members for the Pelicans going forward. Queen will be fascinating to watch given all the attention around the trade the Pelicans made to acquire him, which included giving up an unprotected pick in next year's loaded draft to Atlanta. Last year: Williamson, Murray, Murphy Phoenix Suns : Devin Booker , Ryan Dunn , Khaman Maluach What a difference a year makes. Last year at this time, the Suns had a wildly expensive roster built around three big stars -- Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal. Now, Durant and Beal are gone, Booker remains, and the Suns -- who have dead money on their books for the rest of the decade and none of their own draft picks under their control for the same time period -- are starting a rebuild. There are some interesting young players, led by Dunn and Maluach, but it's going to take time for Phoenix to turn this around -- and the Suns are going to need to show more patience than they have at any point since Mat Ishbia bought the team two-plus years ago. Last year: Booker, Beal, Durant Tier 10: Rebuilding Brooklyn Nets : Nic Claxton , Egor Demin , Nolan Traore If you need any hint to the direction of the Nets, look no further than June's NBA draft, when Brooklyn had five first-round picks -- and kept all of them, drafting Demin, Traore, guards Drake Powell and Ben Saraf , and big man Danny Wolf . They, along with Noah Clowney , a first-round pick two years ago, are the future in Brooklyn -- along with whomever the Nets land in the 2026 draft. Claxton remains a core member because he's on a long-term deal and, given he's in his mid-20s, should still be able to rediscover his prior form. Cam Thomas , on the other hand, is not, after he signed the one-year qualifying offer this offseason. Last year: Claxton, Clowney, Thomas Portland Trail Blazers : Toumani Camara , Donovan Clingan , Shaedon Sharpe There are few teams harder to parse in terms of their direction than Portland. The Blazers have a roster full of interesting young talents, such as Clingan, Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Yang Hansen . But then they went out this offseason and traded for Jrue Holiday and re-signed Lillard, who won't play all season. Will Jerami Grant start? Will Henderson when he comes back from a hamstring injury? Where does Deni Advija, who was arguably the team's best player last year, fit in the starting five - or does he? There's just so much noise here that it's hard to know exactly what Portland's goals are -- which will make for a very fascinating season. Last year: Clingan, Henderson, Sharpe Utah Jazz : Ace Bailey , Walter Clayton , Lauri Markkanen The Jazz, once again, kept the dubious distinction of having never moved up once in the NBA's draft lottery, causing them to land the fifth pick after having the league's worst record. Still, they wound up drafting Bailey, who spent all season as a consensus top-three selection, as the first move of Austin Ainge's tenure as the team's president of basketball operations. He quickly followed it up by landing Clayton, the national championship-winning point guard, with the No. 18 pick to make him a core player, as well. Walker Kessler , without a contract extension, isn't one, and Markkanen will look to get back to the form he showed two years ago. Last year: Markkanen, Keyonte George , Kessler Washington Wizards : Bilal Coulibaly , Tre Johnson , Alex Sarr Another team that had its high lottery hopes dashed in the lottery, the Wizards are once again committed to playing and developing their young talent. That's why Coulibaly, Sarr and Johnson -- their top picks in each of the past three drafts, respectively -- remain the top three players in Washington's core. This season, though, will be about continuing to see who can emerge from the many young players the Wizards have assembled, as they're now up to 10 players on first-round rookie contracts on their roster. Last year: Coulibaly, Sarr, Bub Carrington",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46554832/nba-roster-tiers-ranking-all-30-teams-top-trio-players,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559142_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,0defc189778dd4a99b25f00d2da970c668a97f49
d68f9ec1a3e5,Why the NBA should still be afraid of the Warriors,,"A decade after winning the first of four titles to start a dynasty, the Golden State Warriors have seemingly been passed by the rest of the Western Conference. According to ESPN BET , the Warriors have just the seventh-best odds to win the West this season, behind the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder , Denver Nuggets , Houston Rockets , Los Angeles Lakers , Minnesota Timberwolves and LA Clippers . That placement makes some sense. Golden State was the No. 7 seed last season, bowed out in five games in the second round and could boast the oldest starting lineup in NBA history this season. If Buddy Hield joins Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler III , Draymond Green and Al Horford in the starting lineup after Hield's birthday on Dec. 17, the Warriors would be the first team to start five players 33 or older in a game, according to ESPN Research. But that quick, pessimistic summary severely underrates Golden State's potential. In contrast, the Warriors profile as one of the most dangerous teams in the West, even in their dotage, and they might even be able to compete with the omnipotent Thunder. The NBA's last repeat champion could be a sleeper that stops the newest candidate from repeating. Are the Warriors being underestimated this season? Troy Taormina-Imagn Images A full season with Curry and Butler Projections from ESPN's Kevin Pelton place the Warriors second in the entire NBA, with a forecast of 56 wins -- closer to the top of the West than to the play-in portion of the standings. What explains the discrepancy between that projection and the general perception that the Warriors' window has closed? Here's the simple explanation: In half a season with Butler, the Warriors were one of the best teams in the league, and they improved in the offseason. By that logic, they should be a contender again this season. Golden State upset the second-seeded Rockets in the first round and took Game 1 against the Timberwolves before running out of steam without Curry, who suffered a hamstring strain 13 minutes into the series. There's no shame in losing that way, as any contender would expect to struggle without its best player. Don't let the 2024-25 Warriors' meek playoff exit mask their remarkable in-season turnaround, though. Before the Butler trade, Golden State was 25-26 with a minus-0.4 net rating. But from Butler's debut through the end of the regular season, it ranked first in defensive rating and third in net, at plus-9.2 per 100 possessions. The team's 23-8 record in that span -- which extrapolates to 61 wins over a full season -- wasn't a fluke. With Curry back and Butler on board for a full season, there's no reason to think Golden State will be any worse this season. The Warriors should benefit from incredible continuity. Twelve of their top 13 players in 2024-25 postseason minutes will return in 2025-26, and they upgraded on the one departure ( Kevon Looney ) with Horford, who left the Boston Celtics in free agency. Al Horford's arrival in Golden State is crucial and provides Curry a big man he can rely on. Photo by Brian Fluharty/Getty Images Horford's impact Horford's arrival in Golden State is crucial , as Curry has never played with a big man like the 39-year-old NBA champion before. Among Warriors centers since Curry's breakout season (2012-13), the leaders in total 3-point makes are Dario Saric , who made 74 3s as a backup center in 2023-24, and Quinten Post , who sank 73 as a rookie last season. By comparison, Horford has made triple-digit 3s in each of the past three seasons, and his 40.9% 3-point mark over that span is the best among all centers with at least 100 makes, narrowly ahead of Karl-Anthony Towns' 40.8%. His ability to stretch the floor will provide important balance next to Butler and Green, who can both be reluctant shooters. Horford is also a far superior defender and creator to Saric and Post, making him a better all-around fit for the Warriors' lineup. There is tremendous defensive potential in a frontcourt featuring Butler, Green and Horford, who have a combined 15 All-Defensive Team appearances in their careers. A strong defense, after all, is just as central to the Warriors' winning identity as Curry's deep 3s. In 2021-22, their last title season, the Warriors finished second in defensive rating versus just 16th on offense. And last year, Golden State led the league in defensive rating after Butler's arrival -- even without Horford, and even with their opponents making an unsustainably high percentage of their 3-point tries. A well-rounded roster Golden State should also be better on the other end this season. In 2024-25, the offense hummed as long as Curry was on the floor but fell apart when he rested; lineups without Curry or Butler placed in just the 5th percentile in offensive rating, per Cleaning the Glass. Butler stabilized those groups, though, and the Warriors ended up looking solid as long as one of those stars was on the floor. Warriors in 2024-25 Split Net Rating Curry on, Butler on +7.0 Curry on, Butler off +5.4 Curry off, Butler on +12.8 Curry off, Butler off -7.0 Age and availability could get in the way of that plan. Curry has missed an average of 15 games per season since sitting out nearly all of 2019-20, while Butler hasn't reached the 65-game threshold for NBA awards since 2018-19. The Warriors will likely struggle once again when Curry goes to the bench in games that Butler misses. Jonathan Kuminga , who is still a Warrior for now after a protracted restricted free agency , could play an important role as the best scoring option in no-Curry, no-Butler minutes; he averaged 24.3 points on 55% shooting in the Warriors' final four playoff games last season. Or Kuminga could improve the team by helping to facilitate a midseason trade. Kuminga is the only Warriors player with a cap hit between $12 million and $25 million this season, meaning he'd provide the necessary matching salary to get Golden State another sizable deal at the deadline. For now, though, it's unclear at what position the Warriors would need to improve. As the season approaches, they're operating with an enviable combination of star power and depth. Five different Warriors -- Curry, Butler, Green, Horford and Brandin Podziemski -- rank among the top 10% most impactful players in the league on a per-possession basis, according to the advanced stat xRAPM, which blends play-by-play and on/off data. The only other teams with more than three such players are the Thunder, Rockets and Cleveland Cavaliers . And behind that quintet, the Warriors have a mishmash of role players on the perimeter -- Hield, Kuminga, Gary Payton II , Moses Moody , De'Anthony Melton -- with various strengths, plus Post and Trayce Jackson-Davis to offer different looks as bigs off the bench. As Pelton notes about his projections, the Warriors ""have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team."" The rest of the West Ultimately, the Warriors' greatest problem might not be anything about their roster specifically, but rather the context around them: The top of the West is much better than it was in 2022, when Golden State beat the injury-ravaged Nuggets, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks en route to the Finals. But even with that change, there are still major concerns for every team in the conference behind Oklahoma City and Denver. Fred VanVleet 's ACL tear should lower Houston's ceiling, perhaps by a considerable amount. Minnesota is relying on a number of rapidly aging veterans (38-year-old Mike Conley and 33-year-old Rudy Gobert ) and unproven youngsters ( Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr .) to support Anthony Edwards . The Lakers have a thin rotation and a potentially disastrous defense, and they're already dealing with a LeBron James injury. The Clippers face the same age questions as the Warriors, plus the possible ramifications of the Kawhi Leonard /Aspiration investigation . Even the Thunder, who don't even have any minor concerns, let alone major ones, could struggle to dispatch Golden State in a potential playoff matchup. The Warriors have consistently played this version of the Thunder tough. Over the last two seasons, Golden State is 3-4 against Oklahoma City; two of those losses came in overtime, and Curry didn't play in the other two. Butler wasn't on the roster for any of those contests. The Warriors wouldn't ever be favored to knock off the Thunder, of course, and they would need to navigate a minefield -- one of talented competition and their own age hurdles -- to get the chance. But it's not an entirely unrealistic proposition, and at this stage in their competitive timeline, a chance is all the Warriors can ask for. With James Wiseman gone and Kuminga halfway out the door, the Warriors' ""two timelines"" plan has been scuttled. It's all about the present timeline now, and maximizing Curry's remaining opportunities to add to his trophy case.",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46545448/nba-season-2025-2026-golden-state-warriors-western-conference-champions-oklahoma-city-thunder,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1009%2Fr1558050_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,c9128b157a6cb3021368dd94962c2b180d6a0d0c
1bc3e865eb7e,MLB,,"The winner of the National League Championship Series could determine if Major League Baseball is played in 2027. This might sound far-fetched. It is not. What looks like a best-of-seven baseball series, which starts Monday as the Milwaukee Brewers host the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1, will play out as a proxy of the coming labor war between MLB and the MLB Players Association. Owners across the game want a salary cap -- and if the Dodgers, with their record $500 million-plus payroll, win back-to-back World Series, it would only embolden the league's push to regulate salaries. The Brewers, consistently a bottom-third payroll team, emerging triumphant would serve as the latest evidence that winners can germinate even in the game's smallest markets and that the failures of other low-revenue teams have less to do with spending than execution. The truth, of course, exists somewhere in between. But in between is not where the two parties stake out their negotiating positions in what many expect to be a brutal fight to determine the future of the game's economics. And that is why whoever comes out victorious likely will be used as a cudgel when formal negotiations begin next spring for a collective bargaining agreement that expires Dec. 1, 2026. If it's the Dodgers, MLB owners -- who already were vocal publicly and even more so privately about Los Angeles spending as much as the bottom six teams in payroll combined this year -- will likely cry foul even louder. Already, MLB is expected to lock out players upon the agreement's expiration. Back-to-back championships by the Dodgers could embolden MLB and add to a chorus of fans who see a cap as a panacea for the plague of big-money teams monopolizing championships over the past decade. Best possible World Series matchups Never-before-seen history? A battle of villains?! Here are the best remaining showdowns for every type of fan. David Schoenfield » Such a scenario would not scare the union off its half-century-old anti-cap stance. The MLBPA has no intention of negotiating if a cap remains on the table, and considering MLB was on the cusp of losing games in 2022 because of a negotiation that didn't include a cap, players already have spoken among themselves about how to weather missing time in 2027. Certainly, the Brewers winning wouldn't ensure avoiding that, but if in any argument about the necessity of a cap, the union can counter that the juggernaut Dodgers lost to a team of self-proclaimed Average Joes with a payroll a quarter of the size, it reinforces the point that team-building acumen can exist regardless of financial might. The Brewers have joined the Tampa Bay Rays and Cleveland Guardians as vanguards of low-revenue success in this decade. Over the past eight years, Milwaukee has won five NL Central titles and made the playoffs seven times. At 97-65 this year, the Brewers owned the best record in baseball. And they did so with a unique blend of players. Of the 26 players on Milwaukee's NLCS roster, 15 came via trade, according to ESPN Research, including a majority of its best players (slugger Christian Yelich , catcher William Contreras , ace Freddy Peralta and Trevor Megill , the closer for most of the season). The Brewers drafted four ( Brice Turang , Jacob Misiorowski , Sal Frelick and Aaron Ashby , all major contributors), signed three as minor league free agents, brought in two via international amateur free agency (their best player, Jackson Chourio , and closer Abner Uribe ) and snagged one in the minor league portion of the offseason Rule 5 draft. How the Dodgers fixed Roki Sasaki After a disastrous MLB debut, L.A.'s new ninth-inning man has unleashed jaw-dropping stuff in October. Jeff Passan » That leaves one major league free agent. One. And it was left-hander Jose Quintana , who signed a one-year, $4 million deal in March. Think about that: The MLBPA, which has fought for free agency since its inception, would be heralding a team that does not spend on free agents. Strange bedfellows, yes, but it strengthens the union's position: If the current system is beyond repair because of money, how did a team that doesn't spend win a championship? The Dodgers, on the other hand, are not nearly as free-agent-heavy as might be assumed. They've acquired the most players via trade, too, though it's only nine, and several of them -- from Mookie Betts to Tyler Glasnow to Tommy Edman to Alex Vesia -- play a significant role on the team. Los Angeles signed five major league free agents (including Shohei Ohtani , Freddie Freeman and Blake Snell ), plus two professional international free agents ( Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Hyeseong Kim ), two amateur international free agents ( Roki Sasaki and Andy Pages ) and two minor league free agents ( Max Muncy and Justin Dean ). They drafted five of their players -- one more than the Brewers, whose development system is regarded as one of baseball's best -- and rounded out their roster with Jack Dreyer , an undrafted free agent. Dreyer highlights what the Dodgers and Brewers do exceptionally well: extract talent from players through systems that value a combination of scouting, analytics and superior coaching. It doesn't matter whether you spend half a billion dollars or the $115 million or so currently on the Brewers' books. If you can become an organization that gets the best out of players, winning will follow. One-stop shop for 2025 MLB playoffs We have everything you need to keep up with all the action this October. Schedule, bracket, more » Perhaps if they weren't so terminally parked at opposite ends of the continuum, the league and union could agree that staking an argument around one playoff series is foolhardy. Both sides should understand that, in the grand scheme, a seven-game series says very little, particularly when it comes to the complicated economic system of 30 billion-dollar corporations competing in the same space. But this battle is as much about narrative as it is reality, and if MLB is going to push for a salary cap, it needs as much evidence as possible, and the Dodgers becoming the first team in a quarter-century to win back-to-back World Series would provide another nugget on top of the reams the league already cites. The last team to do that was the New York Yankees -- and the competitive-balance tax, the proto-cap that currently penalizes high-spending teams, came into existence specifically to check what other owners believed the Yankees' runaway spending. The Dodgers are the new Yankees, more moneyed and willing to spend than anyone. They've won the NL West 12 of the past 13 years and captured championships in 2020 and 2024. And despite their seeming inevitability, baseball is not suffering in most areas important to the league. Television ratings are up. Attendance has increased. The implementation of the pitch clock before the 2024 season modernized the game and is now almost universally beloved. The addition of an automated ball-strike challenge system next year will only add to the game's appeal. This NLCS is baseball at its best. A well-oiled machine of superstars, peaking at the right time, looking to become baseball's first back-to-back champions since 2000, against a team that plays a delightful brand of baseball, is wildly likable and always seems to succeed, too. The Brewers haven't won a championship yet -- not just in this recent run of excellence but in their 57-year history -- and derailing the Dodgers en route to doing so would make the tale of triumph that much greater. And, yes, despite the higher win total, the Brewers enter this series as the underdog, and it's a fair designation. Even if they swept the Dodgers in the six games they played in July. Even if their bullpen is filled with fireballing nastiness. Even if they have whacked as many home runs this postseason as Los Angeles, despite the Dodgers hitting 78 more during the regular season. There will be a lot of great baseball played in Milwaukee and Los Angeles over the next week-plus, fans' cups running over with the sorts of matchups that make October the most special month of the year. Ohtani, Betts and Freeman trying to catch up to Misiorowski's fastball and read his slider. Chourio, Contreras and Turang trying to solve Snell, Yamamoto, Glasnow and Ohtani. The Brewers' terrifying bullpen, with five relievers throwing 97 mph-plus, against the team that hit high-octane fastballs better than anyone this year. The Dodgers trying to figure out if they can rely on any reliever other than Sasaki, and the Brewers, who were the fifth-toughest team to strike out this season, trying to get to Los Angeles' bullpen with a barrage of balls in play. While the baseball itself will be indisputable, this NLCS is bigger than the game. Its tentacles will reach into the future, with an unwitting but undeniable place in something far more consequential. It's just one series, yes. But it's so much more.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46576425/mlb-playoffs-2025-dodgers-brewers-nlcs-world-series-passan-labor-battle,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559415_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,517cf4514ca0daac58ca7fedfd62e476a8ea3db2
97e4a658839a,"Fantasy Football Buzz: Nacua, Egbuka and other injuries to monitor coming out of Week 6",,"Oct 13, 2025, 02:25 AM ET Everything that happens in the NFL has some additional context when viewed from a fantasy football perspective. From position battles to injuries and so much more, the news cycle will constantly affect player values in fantasy football. Our Fantasy Football Buzz file, with contributions from our ESPN fantasy writers and our NFL Nation reporters, aims to provide fantasy managers with the intel they need as news breaks around the NFL. Key links: Fantasy depth charts | Weekly rankings Scoring leaders | Projections | The Playbook Injuries to monitor coming out of Week 6 By Stephania Bell Puka Nacua , WR, Rams (ankle): Nacua appeared to injure his left leg on an attempted leaping catch in the end zone early in the second quarter. He landed awkwardly on his left forefoot with the majority of his weight coming down on the left side along with the weight of a defender. In obvious discomfort afterward, Nacua reached for his lower shin just above the ankle. He was eventually assisted off the field and into the tunnel by the medical staff, with his arms around them for support. After the half, Nacua returned to the sideline and eventually reentered the game but didn't touch the ball again. After the game, coach Sean McVay told reporters Nacua would undergo further testing when the team returned to the facility, adding that Nacua's status for Week 7 (in London) was uncertain. With Nacua reentering the game, it might seem unusual that he would then be held out a week later. It's not unusual, however, for injuries to declare themselves to a greater degree within 24-48 hours postgame, whether it be symptomatic (pain/stiffness), swelling/bruising or additional information that emerges via imaging or other testing. Marvin Harrison Jr ., WR, Cardinals (concussion): In the second quarter of Sunday's game against the Colts, Harrison's head took a hard hit to the ground as he was tackled following a 21-yard reception. He was taken inside the blue tent for evaluation, as is common for an initial concussion screen; the results indicated further testing was warranted and Harrison was taken to the locker room. The Cardinals eventually announced he would not return because of a concussion. Harrison is now in the concussion protocol and must not only pass the progressive phases to return to action, but also must be cleared by the team physician and an independent neurological consultant. While it is often the case that athletes miss at least one game following a concussion, it is not a time-based protocol but rather criterion-based. Emeka Egbuka , WR, Buccaneers (hamstring): Egbuka, in his first game serving as the No. 1 wide receiver with Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin Jr . (fibula) out, exited the game against San Francisco in the second quarter with a hamstring strain. It didn't take long for the team to rule out his return. After the game, coach Todd Bowles told reporters Egbuka was still being evaluated. An MRI is often used to better evaluate the specific size, location and depth of the injury, which helps shape rehab timeframes and treatment. There is no prognosis yet on the timeline for Egbuka, but if the injury is truly not serious, it could range from no missed time to 1-3 weeks. Calvin Ridley , WR, Titans (hamstring): Just when Ridley seemed to have found his groove with a strong Week 5 performance, he suffered a hamstring injury Sunday after just one catch for 18 yards. According to coach Brian Callahan, Ridley had ""a hamstring that popped up early and [he] couldn't get through, couldn't open up and run."" It is unclear what the severity of Ridley's injury is, but more details will hopefully be forthcoming after he undergoes additional evaluation at the start of the week. Early Week 6 takeaways: Is red-hot Dowdle in line to leapfrog Hubbard in Panthers' backfield? Rico Dowdle made it back-to-back huge weeks while filling in for the injured Chuba Hubbard. Cory Knowlton-Imagn Images By Liz Loza Bullet points Rico Dowdle stays hot in Week 6 Dowdle found the end zone and rumbled his way to triple-digit yardage serving as the replacement for Chuba Hubbard for the second consecutive week. The former Dallas Cowboy touched the ball 34 times, logging 239 scrimmage yards and a receiving touchdown while facing his old team. Dowdle has now cleared 22 rushing attempts and collected at least three balls in back-to-back outings. Carolina will travel to the Meadowlands in Week 7, taking on a Jets defense that gave up 78 rushing yards on 26 attempts versus the Broncos in London. Assuming Hubbard remains sidelined, Dowdle projects as a top-15 fantasy play at the position. He might have very well gained control of the backfield's top spot even if Hubbard is healthy enough to suit up. Kimani Vidal leads the Chargers backfield Omarion Hampton 's absence created a flurry of speculation as to which backup would take charge of the Bolts' rushing opportunities. Vidal came away the clear winner, registering 18 carries for 124 rushing yards while converting three of four targets for 14 receiving yards. With volume on his side, the second-year RB took advantage of a plus matchup against Miami's bottom-ranked run defense, posting 22.8 fantasy points in Week 6. He'll take on an above-average Indianapolis Colts squad in Week 7. Derrick Henry regains his crown Despite being stuffed at the goal line in the game's first half, Henry rebounded Sunday. The Ravens fed the vet early and often, helping him reach 90 rushing yards before halftime. Despite the Ravens falling to the Rams 17-3, Henry averaged 5.1 YPC, clearing 100 rushing yards for the first time since Week 1. Baltimore goes on bye in Week 7, but Henry's production should continue to pick up from there, especially if Lamar Jackson returns in Week 8. Marvin Harrison Jr . exits early Harrison suffered what was being reported as concussion-like symptoms in the first half of Arizona's game at Indianapolis. Jacoby Brissett (who was starting in the stead of Kyler Murray ) focused the bulk of his efforts on Trey McBride (8-72-1), Zay Jones (5-79) and Michael Wilson (4-44). Fantasy managers should brace for both Harrison and Murray sitting out next Sunday's tilt versus Green Bay. Spring forward Drake Maye continues to produce Maye posted more than 20 fantasy points for the third time in five weeks this past Sunday. The second-year signal-caller led his team to a third straight victory, throwing for 261 yards, 3 TDs and 0 INTs while the Patriots beat the Saints 25-19. Maye also buoyed his fantasy stock on the ground, taking off nine times for 28 rushing yards. He has now managed at least 25 rushing yards and/or found the end zone in four of his past five outings. He'll offer virtual investors top-10 positional appeal in another solid matchup at Tennessee (70.2 COMP% allowed) in Week 7. Oct. 11: Cardinals' Kyler Murray's foot injury to keep him out Week 6 Kyler Murray is dealing with a foot injury and got in his first limited practice this week Friday. Brooke Sutton/Getty Images By Stephania Bell While he has yet to be officially ruled out, Adam Schefter is reporting that Kyler Murray will not play Sunday, with Jacoby Brissett getting the start under center. The Arizona QB suffered a foot injury late in the third quarter of the Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans , but he was able to return to the game after a visit to the locker room. He did not practice Wednesday or Thursday but was listed as a limited participant Friday. A foot injury to a mobile quarterback is problematic. Even without details on the specifics of the injury, the known is that even a mild injury can turn into something more severe, particularly if it changes the athlete's mechanics. And if a quarterback's mobility is compromised, he is at greater risk for injury if he can't protect himself. Perhaps the toughest part of an injury like this for Murray is if he feels like he could play, but the potential for a bigger problem exists if he does. Given his limitation to only one partial practice and the fact that he remains questionable, it certainly appears he will be at less than full health even if he does go. Ja'Marr Chase added to injury report due to illness Cincinnati Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase landed on the injury report after missing Friday's practice due to an illness, though reporter Ben Baby relayed via social media that Chase was seen participating in the team walk-through. The Bengals play the Packers at 4:25 p.m. ET with inactives due 90 minutes before kickoff. If Chase can't go, Tee Higgins will assume WR1 duties with Andrei Iosivas as the No. 2 receiver for ""new"" quarterback Joe Flacco . Mike Gesicki and Noah Fant could also get more involved, though none of them inspire confidence. Oct. 10: Cam Skattebo-Jaxson Dart party continues on TNF Cam Skattebo and Jaxson Dart found the end zone four times with their legs on Thursday against the Eagles, with Skattebo scoring three times and Dart also adding a passing score. Kathryn Riley/Getty Images By Eric Moody Cam Skattebo is still the de facto Giants RB1 after converting 21 touches into 31 fantasy points, powered by three rushing touchdowns. Even with Tyrone Tracy Jr . active, Skattebo led the Giants backfield in snaps, routes, touches and fantasy points. Given that usage, it's hard to imagine the trend reversing. Skattebo remains firmly on the RB2 radar with upside whenever the Giants play in neutral or positive game scripts. Jaxson Dart delivered another strong fantasy performance against the Eagles. He has scored at least 19 fantasy points in two of his last three games, fueled by his rushing ability, a huge asset in fantasy. Dart joined Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson as the only QBs in the Super Bowl era (since 1966) to rush for at least 50 yards in each of their first three NFL starts. He's quickly pushing into QB1 territory. Wan'Dale Robinson finished with seven targets and 20.4 fantasy points against the Eagles. He led all New York pass catchers in snaps, routes run and receiving yards. With Malik Nabers out for the season, Robinson has seen seven targets in back-to-back games and is clearly Dart's top option in the passing game. He profiles as a solid flex option with upside heading into Week 7 against the Broncos. One thing fantasy managers with Giants players should keep in mind is that their rest-of-season schedule for quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers gets tougher moving forward. Eagles notes: Dallas Goedert finished with a team-high 26.0 fantasy points. He led the Eagles in targets, receptions and receiving yards. Goedert also played nearly as many snaps and ran almost as many routes as A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith . The veteran tight end has stockpiled 20 targets over the last two games and currently is showing more chemistry with Hurts than either Brown or Smith. Goedert remains firmly on the TE1 radar in Week 7 against the Vikings. He was started in only 37.8% of ESPN leagues; that number should be higher. Saquon Barkley showed flashes against the Giants, gaining 31 yards on the Eagles' first two carries, but he finished with just 58 rushing and nine receiving yards, failing to surpass 60 rushing yards for the fourth straight game. He averaged over 4.5 yards per carry in the last two games, up from under 4.0 in the first four. The bigger concern for managers is that Barkley has had just 23 total touches over the last two games due to game flow and Philadelphia's offensive struggles. Oct. 10: Warren likely to resume lead role for Steelers Jaylen Warren had 132 yards rushing and 142 yards receiving with a touchdown through the first three games before being ruled Out for Week 4 and getting a bye in Week 5. Evan Bernstein/Getty Images By Stephania Bell Jaylen Warren , RB, Pittsburgh Steelers (knee): Remember when Warren was a bit of a surprise inactive in an early morning game for the Steelers? It was just two weeks ago when the Steelers were in London that Warren -- whose knee did not respond as well as the team had hoped coming into the game -- was replaced by Kenneth Gainwell who merely posted 99 yards rushing and two touchdowns while adding six receptions for 35 yards. With the Steelers on a bye immediately afterward, it was hard to know what to anticipate about the length of Warren's absence, especially with limited information in advance of the Week 4 game. On the first official injury report of the week Warren was listed as a full participant which would suggest he is on track to resume his lead back role on Sunday against the Browns.

76e1953eddc6,Soccer,,"The U.S. men's and women's senior national teams will play 25 home friendly matches combined in 2025, and each game requires two simple ingredients: an opponent and a host venue. How are those opponents scheduled, and how do cities and stadiums ultimately host those games? As U.S. Soccer's managing director of administration, and vice president of events, respectively, Tom King and John Terry (not that John Terry) are primarily responsible for those answers. Their combined task is less a single jigsaw puzzle and more a game of speed dating. As they move from one conversation to the next, they hope to find a match -- multiple, simultaneous matches, in fact, as they work on opponents and venues for several future games at once -- before they lose their potential partners. ""The relationship side of it is so important,"" King told ESPN. ""In some ways, it can be almost a sales job where you've got a chance of getting an opponent, and you just chase that down like the last bus at night until you get 'em closed."" For King, that could mean waking up at 3 a.m. to call colleagues in Europe. Terry works in tandem to find an appropriate venue. Neither the opponent nor the venue can be finalized without the other -- and without either, there is no game. Ideally, they try to secure the best possible opponents for the USMNT and USWNT, in addition to extended and youth national teams, while placing games all over the United States. But the hoops they must jump through can make it difficult. ""To the extent possible, we want to get our team to different parts of the country,"" Terry told ESPN. One of his guiding questions is: ""How do we spread our national team and get as many people watching as possible?"" Fans see the results -- the opponent, the city and the venue -- and, at times, the patterns of games can appear counterintuitive to U.S. Soccer's stated goals. Why are they playing in California, Connecticut or Orlando again when they haven't played in other parts of the country, like the Pacific Northwest, in years? Why is the U.S. playing another game against the same opponent? And tickets cost how much ? U.S. Soccer's decision-makers took ESPN behind the scenes to answer how -- and why -- opponents get scheduled, why venues get selected and how that affects ticket prices. - Predicting the USMNT's 2026 World Cup strikers - Pochettino's USMNT squad comes into focus - Alex Morgan aims to match USWNT success in business How the friendly sausage is made U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes and U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino have their own wish lists for opponents that they communicate regularly to U.S. Soccer officials. From there, King evaluates who is available and begins his sales pitch to other federations, and Terry works on finding the right venue. Everything is interdependent. U.S. Soccer considers a handful of factors in selecting hosts for games, from the climate and the city's historical fan support, to quality of hotels and training facilities and broadcast constraints -- including for the opponent. Venue-specific challenges are as basic as capacity and availability. Scheduling the USWNT against another top-10 team in the world like Brazil at the 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium, as U.S. Soccer did in April, might be a risk worth taking, for example, but a game against lower-tier Portugal makes more sense at an 18,000-seat stadium. The stadium requirements can be as granular as needing a venue with four locker rooms for a four-team SheBelieves Cup event, for example. There are moments, Terry said, when he must call venues and press for a quick answer on locking in a date, or U.S. Soccer risks losing a prospective opponent. Sometimes, a venue operator is only interested in hosting a game if the opponent is appealing enough. Lead time is ""golden,"" King said. It means venues are more likely to be available, and it allows U.S. Soccer to better promote the game. Crisis management, however, is part of their jobs, and sometimes U.S. Soccer works for months on plans that never come to fruition. ""We've had a top-five team that we had all the economic conditions sorted, we had the venue sorted, we had the [federation] president on board, we had everything done and dusted to sign a contract to host this team,"" King said. ""And lo and behold, there's a change to the coach, and the coach wants to play a different confederation team between now and the 2026 World Cup on the men's side. So, everything that had been done for the previous 10 months goes out the window, and you start from scratch again."" The USMNT hosted Turkey at Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford, Connecticut, earlier this year, in front of a non-sellout crowd of 34,023. John Dorton/ISI Photos/Getty Images for USSF Other times, the venue is what needs to change. The U.S. women's national team will end 2025 with a pair of games against Italy in soccer-specific stadiums in Florida, but the original plan for the international window called for a different European opponent in a baseball stadium 2,500 miles away. King had agreed to terms with the other opponent for the U.S. women's national team back in the spring. Terry worked through the usual autumn availability problems with American football and soccer stadiums -- MLS playoff dates are not set until the fall -- by coming up with a unique solution: playing the game on Black Friday with the roof closed at T-Mobile Park, the home of MLB's Seattle Mariners. The baseball season would be over by late November, and U.S. Soccer would have time to lay grass over the baseball infield. The roof solved any fear around bad weather; then the opponent's schedule changed for an official competition, and they were unavailable to play a friendly in November and December. The next team on Hayes' wish list was Euro 2025 semifinalist Italy, but Italian officials did not want to fly their players to the West Coast of the United States in the middle of a European season. Thus, the grand idea of a unique event in Seattle, where the USWNT has not played since 2017, was dead. Each contract for a friendly match is unique, but they all start with what the opponent needs, King said. Successful, popular teams often command an appearance fee to play on the road, and some might also require bonuses based on the commercial success of the game. (King declined to specify those costs due to the sensitivity of negotiations.) Other visiting teams might agree to get a stipend or ask to have certain expenses covered for a delegation of 30-50 people. ""We're very agile; we're not bureaucratic,"" King said. ""When we have an opponent to go after, we go after it. We don't have multiple layers of approval to court a certain team."" They are playing who? Where? Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford is a perfect case study for how a myriad of factors can lead to what looks like a result antithetical to the federation's desire to spread out games. When the USWNT hosts Portugal there on Oct. 26, it will mark the 19th game for the U.S. men and women combined at the stadium since it opened in 2003. The USMNT just played there in June, in addition to their high-profile game against Germany two years ago. That's a high frequency of national team games for a utilitarian college football stadium in a mid-sized city -- but it is not without reason. Cost is a factor in all scheduling, of course. MLS stadiums (which generally seat around 20,000 people) might cost around $200,000 to rent, while larger NFL stadiums could range from around $500,000 to roughly $1 million for a game, Terry said. Bigger markets are also more expensive because everything costs more, from utilities to turn on the lights to wages for security, ticket scanners, and every other stadium worker. Only about half of NFL stadiums have grass fields, which is the preferred surface for the U.S. national teams and most opponents. Terry said that if U.S. Soccer needs to lay down temporary grass, that adds at least $500,000 in expenses. play 1:15 Alex Morgan looks back on her first-ever USWNT goal Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China. Cost is only part of the equation for any game, Terry said. ""The first litmus test is: Is it available to us?"" Which explains how the USMNT ended up hosting four-time World Cup champion Germany in East Hartford in October 2023. U.S. Soccer officials had no doubt that the game would be in great demand among fans no matter where they played it. The problem was finding a place to play. Germany was keen to play on the East Coast for more favorable travel and for a better kickoff time back home, Terry said. U.S. Soccer staff looked everywhere on the East Coast for a grass field in a large stadium on a Saturday in October, the heart of the American football season, and couldn't find one. UConn football, Pratt & Whitney Stadium's primary tenant, happened to have a bye week preceded by a road game on the date of the eventual game. Terry booked the 36,000-seat stadium, and the game sold out. Orlando has also become a frequent stop for the men's and women's national teams for its mix of warm weather and accessibility to both Europe and South America. Driven by the anomaly of the COVID-19 pandemic, Exploria Stadium (as it was called then) hosted five straight USWNT games in January and February 2021. The USMNT played there between those games and returned in March of each of the next two years for official matches. ""In a perfect world, we're not going back to the same venue within a year,"" Terry said. ""It's an inexact science; it happens because there are other factors that require it."" The cost of being a fan All the aforementioned factors for opponents and venues affect the cost to the fan. Rising ticket prices have become endemic across the sports and entertainment industries. Soccer -- with high-profile events including next year's Men's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico -- is not immune. While CONMEBOL's Copa America last year and FIFA's Club World Cup this summer -- both hosted in the United States -- sparked controversy and sparse crowds due to high ticket prices, U.S. Soccer has no influence on setting prices for those games. Still, they certainly hear the complaints -- including the grievances aimed at their own events. Terry told ESPN that the federation is intentional about making sure that the ""get-in price"" of a game -- the cheapest ticket -- is affordable. He said that the starting price for a U.S. national team game is often cheaper than that of an MLS game or a soccer game run by other promoters in the same city. Those numbers vary greatly by city, event and ticket tier, but a U.S. Soccer ticket is typically 25-30% cheaper than tickets for the home team in that same venue, a federation spokesperson said. The USWNT hosted Brazil earlier this year at SoFi Stadium in Southern California in front of a non-sellout crowd of 32,303. Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images for USSF Two factors complicate that position. For a start, the resale market -- which neither U.S. Soccer nor event organizers control -- is where prices balloon. A front-row seat to the USMNT vs. Ecuador friendly in Austin last week cost as low as $84 before fees (which can add up quickly) roughly a week before the game. At the same time, a front-row resale ticket just a few sections away cost $297.50. Dynamic pricing, which means costs fluctuate based on demand, is also a factor. The starting price for a ticket to the USWNT's game against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium this month was $45, Terry said. But the 11,500-seat stadium has sold out every Kansas City Current NWSL game to date, and high demand for the uniquely small venue choice means that current prices trend higher. Terry said that U.S. Soccer's pricing model rewards fans who purchase early, and he argues U.S. Soccer games are ""more accessible than many other sporting entities in this country."" U.S. Soccer recently announced that it would cap tickets sold to the American Outlaws, the largest supporters' group for the U.S. national teams, at $45 plus fees for all games hosted by the federation through October 2026. ""We've always believed soccer should be for everyone,"" American Outlaws co-founder Justin Brunken said in July. ""This partnership with U.S. Soccer helps eliminate one of the biggest barriers -- cost -- and makes it possible for more passionate fans to stand, sing and support together."" Still, that partnership is limited to American Outlaws members and not the wider public. U.S. Soccer is experimenting with free parking for everyone at this month's USWNT game in Hartford. The federation worked with sponsor Coca-Cola for discounted concessions earlier this year at a men's national team game in Nashville. play 0:36 Pochettino: We must be more clinical USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino believes his side need to be more ""clinical"" after their 1-1 draw against Ecuador. U.S. Soccer doesn't have a home stadium where the federation can control food and beverage or parking costs, which leaves those prices to be set by the venue. At the USWNT's game in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this year, U.S. Soccer spent nearly $38,000 to offset concession costs and create a $2 menu for hot dogs, popcorn, nachos and water. The idea came based on direct feedback from U.S. Soccer's Fan Council, which was established in 2018 as a bridge of communication between fans and the federation. The five members of the Fan Council attend as many national team games as possible and gather fan feedback on-site both informally and formally, in addition to the input they get from fans online. They identify common themes that they then bring to U.S. Soccer in quarterly in-person meetings and monthly virtual meetings. ""Much of the feedback focuses on ticketing prices, game atmosphere and the overall matchday experience,"" Lauralynn Stephen, a vice chair of the council, told ESPN. ""I can say that over the past year, we've seen some really exciting, tangible changes that reflect fan feedback."" Stephen said that fans communicated a desire for better concession prices after experiencing them at a game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, which is known for its affordable food and beverages as low as $2. She personally raised the topic with U.S. Soccer in one of their meetings with the Fan Council. Stephen said that communication around gameday from the federation has improved in simple ways, like a ""Know Before You Go"" website page detailing parking and other logistics. ""The culture's improving; the communication, the collaboration is absolutely there; it's in place,"" Stephen said. ""The future's looking very bright for future council members and fans in general, because U.S. Soccer is very actively engaging, and they're very interested in what fans are feeling for the matchday experience."" What lies ahead Scheduling strong, diverse opponents -- especially from Europe -- is increasingly a challenge for U.S. Soccer. FIFA has set the international calendars for men's and women's play through 2029 and 2030 for the women and men, respectively. European men's opponents are available for friendlies in March and June next year ahead of the World Cup, but those windows are not replicated in the three years that follow. The same issue is now true in the women's game. ""The biggest challenge really is the advent of the Nations League for women,"" King said. Twelve of the top 20 women's teams in the world are from Europe. Of the 10 international windows between now and the 2027 Women's World Cup, six of them are being utilized by UEFA for World Cup qualifying and playoffs, in addition to more Nations League programming. The USWNT won't be able to schedule a European opponent in 2026 until next October, and even then, they won't be able to play teams participating in the World Cup qualifying playoffs. King said he already has ""feelers"" out to six potential European teams for that window. The need for the four-time World Cup champion USWNT to play strong teams, along with the Europe's crowded official schedule, has led to the U.S. women more frequently playing Australia , Brazil , Canada , Japan and South Korea as opponents in recent years. STREAM FUTBOL W ON ESPN+ Ali Krieger, Cristina Alexander and Jeff Kassouf debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights from women's soccer in the Americas. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only) Among U.S. Soccer's solutions for scheduling challenges is collaboration with Mexico's federation, the FMF, which gives those visiting teams two different high-quality opponents in relatively close locations. (Mexico frequently ""hosts"" games in the U.S., which creates its own challenges to find four venues in a week). Four days after Ecuador plays the USMNT in Austin this month, Ecuador will play Mexico in Guadalajara. New Zealand's women's team will play Mexico twice before traveling to Kansas City for a game against the USWNT this month. There are also venue challenges that go beyond cost and location. Particularly on the men's side, the United States often faces a partisan crowd for the visitors despite playing on home soil. An overtly pro-Korean crowd for a recent USMNT friendly at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, was the latest reminder of that. Last year, the U.S. lost 5-1 to Colombia in front of a pro-Colombian crowd of 55,494 in Maryland. Terry views the challenge as an opportunity. ""The cool part about the United States is that we have people from all over the world who live here, and regardless of what jersey they wear when they come to one of our games, they're in our ecosystem, and they might be a future coach,"" Terry said. ""Their kids might be future players. They might be a player. And they could be a referees. And so, I think it's on us to figure out: How can we be in service to them? Not just in the stadium but in the other 364 days a year. It's an opportunity to connect with a lot of people and bring them under our umbrella. Our ultimate goal here is grow the sport of soccer in the country."" There is one important addendum: That entire approach of spreading out games applies to friendly matches. ""The flip side of that is, for an official game -- a Nations League qualifier or World Cup qualifier -- we're doing the complete opposite,"" King said. For those official matches, winning -- and qualifying -- trumps all, which helps explain why Columbus, Ohio, has hosted multiple USMNT vs. Mexico World Cup qualifying games in February, the dead of winter. There was a climate advantage for the USMNT, but Columbus was also a location that U.S. Soccer felt it could guarantee a pro-U.S. crowd, which isn't the case in many areas of the U.S. for a USA-Mexico game. King said the federation worked with former USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter in the 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle ""to make sure that the guiding principle on that was putting our team in the best possible light to win by having a raucous home crowd."" Three of the USMNT's qualifying games in that cycle were played in cold months in Ohio (including a 2-0 win over Mexico in Cincinnati) and another in Minnesota. Those locations were selected both for guaranteeing pro-U.S. crowds and for weather ostensibly more suited to American players. The USMNT has dealt with stifling heat and flooded fields for road qualifying games across Concacaf. ""It wasn't a surprise for us to play on a Saturday at noon in Azteca Stadium in June [against Mexico for World Cup qualifying],"" King said. ""And we're also not looking for reciprocity and being spiteful. But at the same time, how can we put our players in the best possible environment to win, when the majority of them are playing in northern climates, whether that's MLS teams or in Europe? We're used to the cold. It's also not uncommon for us to go to Honduras and play midweek at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. These are things that the home team gets the choice to do."" U.S. Soccer's meticulous planning is not the norm everywhere. There are confederations who are comfortable with scheduling games on less than two months' notice. ""That's untenable for us,"" King said. ""The further out that we can get these games on the books is just a huge source of satisfaction with regards to knowing what we're doing, knowing where we're going from a commercial standpoint. You've got a much longer runway to be able to promote the games."" King said that U.S. Soccer intentionally has not scheduled June's men's games yet so that they can book an opponent in reaction to December's World Cup Draw. Beyond that variable, however, U.S. Soccer is already planning as far out as June 2027.

6c3b9fe0fec6,Racing,,"Oct 12, 2025, 09:56 PM ET LAS VEGAS -- With tears in his eyes and needing a moment to compose himself, Denny Hamlin collected his sixth checkered flag and reflected on everything it meant. The victory Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was the 60th of his career -- a lifetime goal he dedicated to his ailing father -- and it gave him the first of the four spots in NASCAR's winner-take-all championship finale. Hamlin, 44, a three-time Daytona 500 winner considered the greatest driver to never win a Cup Series title, is back in the championship race for the first time since 2021. He's Joe Gibbs Racing's winningest driver and now Toyota's as well. The Virginia driver is tied for 10th on NASCAR's career victories list with Kevin Harvick . Hamlin couldn't hold back the tears after a frantic final 10-lap drive to run down Kyle Larson and then JGR teammate Chase Briscoe . Two weeks ago, he thought he had his 60th win locked up at Kansas Speedway and was bitterly disappointed to come up short and mentioned letting down his ailing father. He made good on it two weeks later at Las Vegas in what might be the most important win of his career. He said the win was for his 75-year-old father, who also was rooting for his son to hit the 60-win mark. ""You know, he's just not doing well, you know, he's the one that got me into racing and took me to a racetrack when I was 5,"" Hamlin said. ""Then made all the sacrifices financially to keep me going, sold everything we had, we almost lost our house a couple times to just try to keep it going. ""I'm glad he was able to see 60. That was so important to me."" Hamlin took four tires on the final restart and restarted in fifth before slicing his way through traffic. He first got past Joey Logano , who had only two new tires, needed a few laps to run down Larson on the inside, and then finally took the lead from Briscoe, who was also on only two tires. This is the deepest in the playoffs new crew chief Chris Gayle has ever advanced, and Hamlin credited adjustments on the final pit stop for getting him his seventh win of the season -- his most since 2020. ""Just putting down all the factors, I just can't imagine there's a win bigger for me than this one,"" Hamlin said. Joe Gibbs, who lost both his sons before they turned 50, was touched by Hamlin's dedication. ""I know one of the things he shared there was his dad. That was emotional for everybody,"" Gibbs said. Larson, seeking to end a 20-race losing streak, was second in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports. JGR drivers Christopher Bell and Briscoe were third and fourth, Tyler Reddick who drives for Hamlin at 23XI Racing was fifth, and reigning Cup Series champion Logano was sixth. Five of the top six -- only Reddick -- are still in the playoff field. The others are Chase Elliott , who finished 18th; Daytona 500 winner William Byron was 36th and Ryan Blaney was last in 38th. Byron was out front and then wiggled out of the groove with 35 laps remaining, saved his Chevrolet from crashing, but teammate Larson sailed past him for the lead. Minutes later he was involved in a race-ending crash when he drilled into the back of Ty Dillon , unaware that Dillon was slowing to head to pit road. ""I never saw him wave, I had no indication he was pitting,"" Byron said. ""I had zero idea. I am just devastated. Obviously, I wouldn't have driven full speed into him."" The bottom four drivers in the playoff standings with two races remaining in this round are Byron, Elliott, Logano and Blaney. Bad day for Blaney Blaney, second in points at the start of the race, saw his title hopes take a severe hit when a tire issue caused him to crash into the wall with nine laps remaining in the first stage. His race immediately ended, he finished 38th and dropped to the bottom of the eight-driver playoff round. Blaney is the 2023 Cup Series champion, with teammate Joey Logano winning titles in 2022 and 2024 to give Team Penske three straight. The upside is Blaney races next at Talladega Superspeedway, where he's a three-time winner and considers himself to be in a must-win situation. ""You've got to be optimistic. I'm not very happy right now, but tomorrow morning I'll be optimistic to go to the next race,"" Blaney said. ""We've had good success at the next two events, so hopefully we can come and bring the speed and try to overcome the hole we put ourselves in."" Reddick's son Reddick, who was eliminated from the playoffs last weekend, is still racing despite serious health complications facing his infant son. Rookie Reddick, the second son born to Tyler and Alexa Reddick in May, has a ""tumor that's 'choking' the renal vein & renal artery. Telling the heart 'Hey I'm not getting enough blood... pump harder,'"" Alexa Reddick wrote in an update last week. She said it had caused an enlarged heart and the 4-month-old will need a kidney removed because doctors determined it is no longer functioning. Alexa Reddick posted on social media ahead of Sunday's race at Las Vegas that Rookie will have surgery Tuesday and will be moved to a unit to ""monitor his heart and BP while his renin slowly drops."" Edwards makes his NASCAR debut Rob Edwards, the longtime team principal of the Andretti Global IndyCar program, made his NASCAR debut this weekend in his new role with the overall ownership group. Edwards will transition into the role of chief performance officer for TWG Motorsports, the Dan Towriss-led organization that owns teams in NASCAR, IndyCar, IMSA, Formula E and will launch the new Cadillac F1 team next season. Edwards as part of his new role will be part of all of TWG's properties -- a move he told The Associated Press on Sunday he was excited for as it's a new challenge after nearly three decades in IndyCar. He anticipates attending about a half-dozen NASCAR races next year with Spire Motorsports, where Towriss is now the majority owner.

35ad6c1218d5,"Betting recap: The Flacco effect? Bettors back Bengals, get cover vs. Packers",,"Doug Greenberg David Purdum Close David Purdum ESPN Staff Writer Joined ESPN in 2014 Journalist covering gambling industry since 2008 Oct 12, 2025, 09:51 PM ET As a general rule each week, public bettors tend to back favorites -- both on the spread and in moneyline parlays -- and the sportsbooks, in turn, cheer for the underdogs to cover or even win outright. When large spreads come around, it can be divisive to bettors, forcing them to choose between a blowout victory or a more competitive game, no matter how large the skill gap between the teams. This week, the Cincinnati Bengals were catching around two touchdowns at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers . For most of the week, the Bengals were 14.5-point underdogs, but they took a somewhat surprising amount of action, with BetMGM reporting 75% of wagers and 72% of handle behind the Bengals on Sunday morning. ESPN BET had a small majority of its spread handle for the game backing Cincinnati, but then dropped the line to 13.5 on Sunday morning. That could have led to some buyback, as Green Bay finished with a small majority of the handle leading into the opening kickoff. It's not entirely clear why the public was on Cincy early in the week, but it could be the Joe Flacco effect. The Bengals traded for Flacco earlier in the week, and the veteran quarterback led the Cleveland Browns to a victory over the Pack as 7.5-point underdogs in Week 3, the second-largest outright upset of the year. Caesars Sportsbook head of football Joey Feazel believes the change at QB could have attracted big-money bettors, though he notes that many of the public wagers were still backing Green Bay to cover the big number. ""We did see an uptick in wagers on the Bengals moneyline, which I think could be attributed to Flacco taking control of this offense over Jake Browning ,"" Feazel said over email. ""On the spread side of things, we saw the public mostly on the Packers and the sharps on the Bengals +14.5 and +14. With the total being that low, sharps would rarely be laying the points in that situation."" While the Packers led the game wire-to-wire, the Bengals drove down the field and scored a touchdown with four minutes to go for a final score of 27-18, giving Green Bay the win and Cincinnati the cover. The reaction from sportsbooks varied based on the action that came in: As Feazel implied, the Packers' public support meant a good result for the book, while the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas felt the pain from support on the Bengals, as with BetMGM. ""Packers game really hurt us,"" John Murray, vice president of Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas, told ESPN. ""That final score was about as bad as it could get for us between teasers to Packers, straight bets on Bengals, and the game somehow going over the total."" Many entrants in survivor contests were likely sweating a little whenever the Bengals got close to evening the score. The Packers were by far the most selected team in the $1,000 entry Circa Survivor contest, racking up 54.4% of the entries this week. NFL odds & ends All of ESPN. All in one place.

College football odds & ends Penn State entered the season ranked No. 2, had the third-best title odds (+650), behind only Ohio State and Texas, and was a -350 favorite to make the College Football Playoff at ESPN BET. As of last Monday, more money had been bet on the Nittany Lions to win the national championship than had been wagered on Ohio State at BetMGM. It appears Penn State will come up short. The Nittany Lions have lost three in a row, their quarterback Drew Allar is out for the season and they fired coach James Franklin on Sunday. They also made dubious history by becoming the first team to lose back-to-back games as favorite of 20+ since the 1978 FBS-FCS split. The Nittany Lions lost to Northwestern as 21-point favorites on Saturday, a week after they were upset by UCLA as 25-point favorites. Penn State has been on the losing end of the two biggest upsets of the season. The point spread on the Red River Rivalry between Oklahoma and Texas saw up-and-down line movement all week. Texas opened as around a 3-point favorite, but the line started to move toward the underdog Sooners as news surfaced that quarterback John Mateer could play. Mateer had surgery on a broken thumb in mid-September, but somewhat unexpectedly returned in time for the Texas game. On Friday, Oklahoma became the favorite, but the line flipped again ahead of Saturday's kickoff. ""The line swung back to Texas being favored, mostly because people started questioning how effective Mateer could really be just two weeks removed from surgery,"" Feazel of Caesars Sportsbook said. "" So, a lot of the movement was tied to Mateer, but there was also some sharper Texas money that came in late once the market started to overreact a bit."" Mateer started, but Texas cruised to a 23-6 win. Miami QB Carson Beck moved into the role of Heisman Trophy favorite at +360 at ESPN BET. Alabama QB Ty Simpson is the second choice at +370, followed by Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza (+550).",https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/46576918/nfl-betting-week-6-cincinnati-bengals-joe-flacco-texas-longhorns-oklahoma-sooners-heisman,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559422_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e032398d604c3dbfc92a1976294491f42257b451

Each of England's 20 top-tier clubs have now played seven league games. The Premier League table is beginning to point to a competitive title race and a relegation battle in which all three promoted teams -- Burnley , Leeds United and Sunderland -- have genuine hopes of avoiding the drop. Meanwhile, the pressure is growing on struggling managers Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou, big-money summer signings such as Florian Wirtz and Matheus Cunha have yet to have a major impact at their new clubs, and Bournemouth and Crystal Palace are offering signs that they could push for UEFA Champions League qualification. So with four Premier League matchdays scheduled before the November international break, what are the big issues that could come to a head over the next month? - How to fix Man Utd in 4 steps by copying Liverpool, Arsenal, City - What's wrong with Liverpool: Transfers? Salah? Fixtures? - Soccer's wildest 2025-26 kits: From unorthodox to unhinged Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou are the two managers under the most pressure in the Premier League. Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images Will Amorim and Ange last until November? Ruben Amorim was given the public backing of Sir Jim Ratcliffe last week; the Manchester United minority owner said Amorim could not be judged in his role as manager until he has had three years in the post . But despite the vote of confidence, Amorim is still -- by some distance -- statistically the worst United manager of the Premier League era. United have not won back-to-back league games since the Portuguese coach took charge in November 2024, and their last away win came against relegated Leicester City in March. So far this season, United have beaten two promoted teams and a Chelsea side reduced to 10 players for virtually the entire game, so Sunday's trip to Liverpool threatens to be a major test of Amorim and his players. And while Ratcliffe's supportive words will be welcomed by Amorim, it's worth remembering that he called Erik ten Hag a ""very good coach"" just three weeks before firing him last season. Despite Amorim's difficulties, he is not the manager in most peril right now. That title goes to Nottingham Forest 's Ange Postecoglou, who is under intense pressure after seven winless games in charge at the City Ground. The former Tottenham Hotspur manager replaced Nuno Espirito Santo last month after being hand-picked by ultra-demanding Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis. But Forest have nosedived under Postecoglou, and the fans have already turned on the former Australia coach. Marinakis has shown himself to be a ruthless owner many times in the past, so Big Ange is already in big trouble. play 1:35 Nicol: Mo Salah is lacking in confidence Steve Nicol believes Mo Salah could be facing a crisis in confidence this season as his struggles continued vs Chelsea. Is Salah a fading force? Mohamed Salah is now fourth on the list of all-time Premier League goal scorers and will become only the third player -- after Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane -- to break the 200-goal barrier if he scores just 12 more times for Liverpool. But will Salah hit that target this season, or are we beginning to see signs that the 33-year-old is a fading force? Since the beginning of February, Salah has scored 14 goals for Liverpool in all competitions; six of those have been penalties. So far this season, he has managed just two goals and two assists for the champions in seven league games. With an Africa Cup of Nations campaign with Egypt looming in December, Salah could be away from Liverpool for six weeks this winter. In addition, summer signings Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike are ready to usurp him as Liverpool's main goal threat. So with age catching up with Salah and international commitments -- Egypt have also qualified for next year's FIFA World Cup -- set to distract his focus, this season could be a difficult one. It could also be his last at Anfield if his declining output continues. But here's the good news. Next up for Salah is Manchester United on Sunday, and no team has conceded more goals against the forward than United (16). Will everything click into gear this weekend? play 1:06 Nagelsmann backs Wirtz for Liverpool success Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann fully expects Florian Wirtz to be successful at Liverpool following his big-money move from Bayer Leverkusen this summer. Time for big signings to deliver Every signing needs time to adapt to a new club. Some do it more quickly than others, but eventually, a star player has to deliver. That's the issue facing the likes of Florian Wirtz, Matheus Cunha, Alexander Isak and Eberechi Eze after over two months of Premier League action for their new teams. Wirtz is the one with the most to do after making little to no impact for Liverpool since arriving in a deal worth up to £116 million from Bayer Leverkusen this summer. In seven league games so far, Wirtz has registered no goals and no assists, and the pace of the English top-flight has been too hot to handle for the Germany international. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Liverpool teammate Isak, who arrived on deadline day of the summer transfer window for a fee worth up to £130 million, has managed only one assist in three Premier League appearances since his move from Newcastle United , though he's still getting up to speed after missing the entire preseason due to his desire to force a transfer. Wirtz and Isak have been signed as investments in Liverpool's long term, but both need to offer more than they have done so far. Cunha, meanwhile, was signed by United to boost their attacking threat after the side scored just 44 league goals last season, but the £62.5 million arrival from Wolverhampton Wanderers has yet to score or register an assist in six appearances with Amorim's team. Fellow new arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko are both already off the mark with goals for United, so Cunha needs to step up. The same applies to Arsenal 's Eze, who has contributed just two assists in six appearances since completing a £67.5 million transfer from Crystal Palace last month. Eze contributed eight goals and eight assists in his final season at Palace and also played a central role in the Eagles' first FA Cup triumph, scoring the winner in the final against Manchester City . But the 27-year-old is still finding his feet at the Emirates. Can Bournemouth and Palace keep pace at the top? Bournemouth and Crystal Palace have two of the most sought-after coaches in the game in Andoni Iraola and Oliver Glasner, respectively, and both sides are raising hopes of a top-four finish this season. Iraola's side is just two points behind leaders Arsenal, while Palace are two points further back after becoming the last team to lose its unbeaten record with a defeat at Everton going into this international break. But can both sides maintain their early form? And with that, can they also hold on to their highly rated coaches long enough for the first question to be answered? The two teams meet at Selhurst Park on Saturday, and both sides have players who have made outstanding starts to the season. Antoine Semenyo has scored six goals and registered three assists so far this season for Bournemouth, while left back Adrien Truffert has replaced Milos Kerkez (now with Liverpool) and appears to be an absolute bargain in a deal worth up to £14 million from Rennes. Palace's Adam Wharton , Marc Guéhi , Daniel Muñoz , Daichi Kamada and Jean-Phillippe Mateta have all built on last season's performances to excel this time around, so Glasner's side has strength throughout the roster. Palace look to have the greater depth to ensure a challenge for the top four, but Bournemouth have real quality, too. Are winless Wolves doomed already? The prospects for Wolves are already looking bleak, with Vitor Pereira's side anchored to the bottom of the table without a win so far this season. But their record of just two points from seven games is one point better than at the same stage last season, so there will be hope that they can turn the situation around at Molineux. However, with key players Cunha and Rayan Aït-Nouri leaving during the summer for Manchester United and Manchester City, respectively, Wolves would seem to have an even bigger mountain to climb this time around. Sheffield United hold the record for the longest wait for a first Premier League win after going 17 games at the start of the 2020-21 season, and the Blades were relegated at the end of that campaign. But Wolves had to wait until their 11th league game for a win last season and still ended up avoiding relegation. Their next two league games look to be crucial if they are to get their season up and running, though. With promoted teams Sunderland (away) and Burnley (home) next up for Wolves, they simply have to get a win from one of those.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46580418/premier-league-big-issues-amorim-ange-last-salah-fading,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559517_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,256b12c9fdfc912e777d3afa2c4798405f9127af
56d05989c2bd,Di María shows Neymar that a triumphant return is possible,,"When Carlo Ancelotti called up his Brazil squad for the trip to South Korea and Japan , Neymar was not even mentioned at the news conference. This would have been unthinkable a few weeks before. There were always questions about Neymar and his possible role at previous call-ups. So why not this time? The answer is that his comeback -- so far at least -- is not going to plan. It was on Oct. 12, 2023 that he had a serious left knee injury playing for Brazil against Uruguay in the early rounds of World Cup qualification . The subsequent two years have brought no evidence that the 33-year-old is still capable of tipping the balance at the highest level. Immediate expectations were almost certainly too high. He was greeted as a savior at the start of the year when he moved back to Santos , a famous old name that have fallen on hard times. Some imagined that the acquisition of Neymar would be sufficient to transform a newly promoted club into trophy challengers. Instead, Santos hover just above the relegation zone . And when he has been on the field, Neymar has yet to stand out. There have been flashes of quality, such as striking a dead ball or slipping through a cunning pass. But he is not gliding past opponents as he once did with such flourish. After such a long time out of action, muscular problems were inevitable. But Neymar has run into a series of other injury problems. There are hopes that he might be back at the start of next month, which leaves very little time to prove himself before November's FIFA dates. And after that, there are only the international matches in March before Ancelotti's 2026 World Cup squad is named. - Vickery: Strong national team, strong league? Not in Argentina and Brazil - 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it - The evolution of the World Cup ball as 2026's Trionda is unveiled If Neymar's ambition is really to round off his career with a star display in 2026, then he is now in a race against time. An old teammate, meanwhile, will only be missing from the tournament because he has chosen not to be there. If the homecoming of Neymar has not lived up to its billing, then the return of Ángel Di María has been a sensation. The Argentina winger left Rosario Central in 2007, and came back home in July after an 18-year European tour which started and ended at Benfica , and in the meantime took in Real Madrid , Manchester United , Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus . The only disappointment was at Man United -- which almost certainly says more about the club than it does about the player. Central are certainly delighted to welcome him back. Eleven games in and both Di María and the club are flying. They are sitting third in the table , unbeaten and putting together an impressive sequence of results. The homecoming king hit the ground running, slotting in penalties in both of his first two games. That was only the warmup. He scored the only goal in the local derby against Newell's Old Boys , one of the most fiercely contested on the planet, added an Olimpico against Boca Juniors , and orchestrated a famous 2-1 win over River Plate in Central's recent home match. The stadium is rocking. The Gigante de Arroyito ground is famous for its fiery atmosphere; it is where the Argentina national team shrugged off a disappointing start and picked up momentum on the way to the 1978 World Cup win. And now the fans are flocking in to pay homage to the local hero. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now But what makes Di María -- known as El Fideo by his fans -- so special? The 37-year-old is a genuine world-class star, without an ego to match. Did he insist on taking the No. 10 shirt upon his return to Rosario? No, he most certainly did not. That jersey is in the more than capable hands of the experienced Ignacio Malcorra , a fine representative of Argentina's excellent tradition of playmakers. With the No. 11 on his back, Di Maria -- as he has always done everywhere -- has found the best way to make himself useful in the collective context. His return has not cramped Malcorra's style. Rather, the two of them work together. Malcorra might have to work a little deeper in midfield, while young Gaspar de Jesus uses his lung power down the right flank to open up space for Di María. But the result is Di Maria adding quality to a team that has been well crafted by Ariel Holan, a fascinating coach with a background in field hockey. Central could well be contenders for the Argentine league title. And in his own understated way, the career of Di María is not only synonymous with titles -- it is also the case that, time and time again, he was the man to come up big on the special occasion when the silverware was won. He was man of the match when Real Madrid won the UEFA Champions League in 2014, and did it again and again for his country. In 2007 he was World Under-20 Champion, and a year later added an Olympic gold medal to his haul, scoring the only goal in the final against Nigeria . A full 13 years later he scored the only goal in the 2021 Copa América decider against Brazil that brought Argentina their first senior title since 1993. Everyone ran to Lionel Messi at the final whistle, but Di María did not to mind. The claims made for Messi being the greatest of all time have been massively bolstered by the spate of recent triumphs, and Di María has been key to all of them. He took the French defense to pieces in the final of the 2022 World Cup, and came up big again in the final of last year's Copa América against Colombia -- his 145th and last game for his country. His choice. He stepped away from the international game. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni would love to have him back. For all their playmaking riches, Argentina lack a winger with the incisive one-on-one play of Di Maria. And in all of world football it would be tough to find a player with such star quality but apparently without star ego. In this sense, Di María is something of an opposite to Neymar, with more big titles and much less hullabaloo. The pair were teammates for a few seasons at PSG, and it would seem fair to conclude that before Luis Enrique, in all the years of the star-driven project, the best and most solid version of the French giants was the one with Di María working to balance out the side. And so, while Santos are struggling in Brazil, Rosario Central are riding high in Argentina. Neymar may still be hoping that a shot at glory will come his way in 2026, but there is no doubt that the prize of best South American homecoming of 2025 goes to Di María.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46567833/di-maria-shows-neymar-triumphant-return-possible,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559012_1295x729_16%2D9.png,,62370154290549c1e96b550300dd617437b47311

6e0835c34ce1,Palestinians See Little to Celebrate Even Though the Bombs Have Stopped,"israel gaza war, food aid, palestinians, humanitarian aid, hamas, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, internal-open-access-from-nl","Palestinians in Gaza expressed relief on Monday that Israel had halted its two-year military offensive in the territory, and that hostages and prisoners had been exchanged. Still, many felt there was little to celebrate. Two years of war left the enclave in ruins, its cities reduced to rubble, tens of thousands dead and the health system devastated. Despair and hopelessness are pervasive and many no longer see a future. “It’s important that the bombing has stopped, but there’s nothing to be happy about,” said Saed Abu Aita, 44, who is displaced in central Gaza. “My two daughters were killed, my home was destroyed and my health has deteriorated.” Israel’s military campaign against Hamas killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials. Their tolls do not specify the number of combatants, but they say thousands were children. Some in Gaza said they do not see the release on Monday of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners — one of Hamas’s stated reasons for launching the war in the first place — as an achievement worth the cost. Hamas secured the exchange by trading the remaining hostages out of the some 250 seized during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war. Mr. Abu Aita said that a fragment of shrapnel penetrated his rib cage when an Israeli airstrike hit his hometown, Jabaliya, in northern Gaza in October 2023, soon after the war began. For more than a year, he said, he has not been able to find a doctor who could remove the fragment. He said he hoped that the return of the last 20 living hostages to Israel on Monday — a crucial element of the cease-fire that went into effect last week — would pave the way to an end to the war. “They needed to go home a long time ago,” he said. “Holding them in Gaza gave Israel a pretext to continue its bombing.” Palestinians in Gaza have lived through hunger, fear and bombardment. With a cease-fire now in effect, aid groups say they are attempting to scale up relief as much as possible to blunt the humanitarian catastrophe and allow people to rebuild their shattered lives. Many relief officials blamed Israeli restrictions for shortages that led to hunger and malnutrition throughout the enclave. While Israel blocked all supplies entering Gaza for nearly three months earlier in 2025, Israeli officials have recently said they were no longer limiting the amount of aid that can go into the territory. Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel committed to allowing a surge of desperately needed supplies into the enclave. On Sunday, the United Nations said it was working to boost its aid to Gaza, including by bringing in cooking gas for the first time since March. Many in Gaza have had to resort to making bread with firewood, because there was little gas or electricity available. “For two years, we’ve dreamed of this moment,” said Amani Nasir, 30. “We’ve had enough of tents, fire, displacement and thirst.” Under the deal, at least 600 trucks of supplies will enter Gaza per day, and Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt will be reopened. Abdel Nasser al-Ajrami, the head of Gaza’s Bakers’ Union, which works with the World Food Program to distribute subsidized bread, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza has been steadily improving since the announcement of the cease-fire last week. “Today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow will hopefully be better,” he said, adding that 17 bakeries were now operating across central and southern Gaza. But there is some skepticism that the cease-fire will hold. The deal clinched last week by U.S., Qatari, Turkish and Egyptian mediators did not resolve some of the toughest sticking points between the warring sides and left Hamas still armed and the dominant force in parts of Gaza for the time being. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said his government will not agree to end the war until Hamas’s government and military wing in Gaza are dismantled. While Hamas has expressed willingness to hand civilian rule over Gaza to another Palestinian entity, it has not committed to giving up its weapons. Since Israel halted its military offensive and pulled back from parts of Gaza in the past few days, Hamas has begun reasserting itself on the streets of the territory. Witnesses in Gaza said they had begun to see small groups of Hamas’s internal security fighters standing guard at some intersections. On Sunday night, Hamas fighters clashed in Gaza City with a rival gang of gunmen and attempted to capture its members, according to the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. During a visit to Israel on Monday to coincide with the hostage release, President Trump was asked by a reporter what he thought about the possibility of Hamas reasserting itself as a police force and shooting rivals. He replied that this was because “they do want to stop the problems” and suggested the United States was not opposed, temporarily. “They’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump’s ambitious vision for Gaza includes bringing in a postwar security force to stabilize the enclave, as well as training a new Palestinian police force to maintain law and order. But that prospect will be difficult should Hamas insist on continuing to play a dominant role in the enclave. Abdullah Shehab, 32, said he was worried that the respite in fighting would only be temporary because Hamas had not agreed to Israel’s conditions for ending the war. In recent days, Mr. Shehab said, Hamas was trying to show that it “hasn’t given up its rule” in Gaza. On Sunday, he said, masked gunmen who he believed were members of Hamas stopped him on the way to the dentist and inspected his car. “The situation is very fragile,” he said. “The weak party, Hamas, hasn’t been convinced to accept the strong party’s demands.” Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/gazans-ceasefire-relief-gloom.html,World,BBC,"By Adam Rasgon, Bilal Shbair, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad and Saher Alghorra",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13int-gaza-ceasefire-promo/13int-gaza-ceasefire-jltz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T18:25:00+00:00,872a7af046e222ede2b550a8025af87888d5dea1
765734aac48d,A Divided Israel Unites in Joy as Hostages Come Home,"military, israel gaza war, kidnapping and hostages, hamas, maccabi tel aviv, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, hadar goldin, einav zangauker","Many of them had become household names, their faces familiar from posters all over the country: Israelis snatched two years ago from their homes in pastoral border villages, from a music festival rave and from army bases and then secreted into Hamas’s tunnels deep under Gaza. When they finally emerged on Monday as part of a cease-fire deal reached between Israel and Hamas, they were thinner, wan, but alive and on their feet. And Israelis basked in a joyous moment of unifying national redemption after years of agonizing, polarizing war. The 20 living hostages who had remained in Gaza, along with the remains of 28 deceased ones, remained an open wound, with the fate of the hostages tearing at the country’s soul. A majority of Israelis had long wanted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize their release with a deal to end the war, polls showed . But Mr. Netanyahu accused protesters of “hardening Hamas’s stance” while critics of the prime minister accused him, in turn, of prolonging the war to appease his far-right political allies on whose support he relies to stay in power. Now, many Israelis said, with an open-ended cease-fire in place and all the living hostages back home, it was time for the country to heal. “This is a momentous day, a day of great joy,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an address in the Knesset, or Israeli Parliament, on Monday alongside President Trump. Quoting from the biblical Book of Ecclesiastes, which Jews traditionally read this week, Mr. Netanyahu said there was a time for war and a time for peace. “The last two years have been a time of war,” he added. “The coming years will hopefully be a time for peace — peace inside Israel and peace outside Israel.” People began packing Hostages Square in Tel Aviv early Monday morning to watch the release unfold on giant screens. They lined the road, waving Israeli flags outside the Re’im military base in southern Israel, the first stop for the returnees after they crossed into Israeli territory. And they ran onto balconies and rooftops to cheer as helicopters brought the former captives to hospitals. The military released footage of emotional reunions between the hostages and their family members, as well as extraordinary encounters among the former captives themselves. Gali and Ziv Berman, 28, twins who were kidnapped on Oct. 7, 2023, together with their neighbor, Emily Damari , from Kfar Aza, a rural community, were separated by their captors on their first day in Gaza, according to Ms. Damari, who was released during a brief cease-fire in January. On Monday they hugged. The twins, who had lived close by and worked together before their abduction, were transferred to a hospital wearing matching yellow shirts of their favorite soccer team, Maccabi Tel Aviv. They were flown over the Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv, where fans had gathered to cheer them. Another pair of brothers, Ariel Cunio, 28, and David Cunio, 35, were released and reunited with their partners in Israel, both former captives themselves. Ariel Cunio had been kidnapped with his partner, Arbel Yehud, from their home in Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border that was ravaged in the Hamas assault. Ms. Yehud was released in January. “My Ariel is home, and I am overwhelmed with emotion and joy,” Ms. Yehud said in a statement. “From the moment of my release, I devoted everything I had to the struggle to bring my Ariel home, to bring David home, and to bring all the hostages back,” she added. “Now that Ariel and David are home, we can focus on our long journey of healing and recovery together as a couple and as a family.” David Cunio was kidnapped from Nir Oz with his wife, Sharon Cunio, and their twin daughters, Yuli and Emma, 5, who were returned in November 2023. And the brothers Eitan Horn and Iair Horn let out cries of joy as they embraced. Taken from Nir Oz, they spent time in the tunnels together until Iair was released in February, with Eitan left behind. The 20 living hostages released on Monday were exchanged for nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. There are no more living captives in Gaza, but Israel was still waiting for Hamas to return the remains of 28 deceased ones. The Israeli military said it had received four coffins later Monday and that the authorities would work to identify the remains. The government has said that locating some of the bodies might take some time. “We do not forget them for a moment,” Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, said. Israeli officials said about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and 251 others were abducted to Gaza during the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023 that ignited the war. Hamas had already been holding two Israeli civilians for almost a decade and the remains of two soldiers killed in ambushes in Gaza in 2014. Four women were released early on in October 2023, and a female soldier was rescued in a military operation that month. During two temporary cease-fires, in November 2023 and early this year, a total of 135 hostages were freed, according to government data. The Trump administration negotiated the release of an Israeli-American soldier in May. Seven more hostages were rescued alive by the Israeli military. The remains of 59 captives who did not survive were returned to Israel for burial before Monday’s exchange, according to the Israeli government. More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel’s two-year counteroffensive in Gaza, according to local health officials, whose data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but includes thousands of children. The drill on Monday was similar in some ways to past releases. The living hostages were handed over to Red Cross representatives in Gaza, who transferred them to Israeli forces near the border. From there, they were taken in military convoys to the Re’im army base in southern Israel for initial checks and reunions with close family members and were then flown to hospitals in the Tel Aviv area. But this time was also different. For the first time in years there were no living hostages left in Gaza, allowing for a large degree of closure. Moreover, Mr. Trump, who brokered the deal, has made clear it signals not another temporary pause, but the end of the war. The hostages returned smiling and at least on the surface, in better condition than many Israelis had feared. Hamas had released gruesome videos of some of the captives looking skeletal and pleading for their lives. Former hostages have described how some were abused and kept in chains. But this time, there were no humiliating handover ceremonies in Gaza, like during some past releases, when masked gunmen instructed those being released, sometimes weak and emaciated, to wave at crowds from a stage and make speeches thanking captors. Instead, Israelis glued to their televisions on Monday were surprised to see some hostages still in Hamas custody speaking to their parents via video calls from Gaza while masked gunmen could be seen in the background. Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, 25, and one of the most vocal activists of the struggle for the hostages’ release, was filmed speaking on a video call with her son in Gaza for the first time since his abduction two years ago. “There’s no war; it’s over,” she told him, sitting in a car on the way to the Re’im army base. “You are coming home!”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-gaza.html,World,BBC,By Isabel Kershner,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/14/multimedia/14israel-hostages-ledeall-1/14israel-hostages-ledeall-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T19:31:11+00:00,e317e19e59a0cde1468fd087a3ed26ac1842ce8c

Mr. Macron’s public comments on the turmoil were the first since Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu, a centrist and close ally of Mr. Macron, resigned a week ago — only to be reappointed by the French president just days later, on Friday. That move, which capped a week of chaos, infuriated Mr. Macron’s opponents, heralding even more instability as France struggles to pass a deficit-cutting budget by the end of the year. “It is everyone’s duty to work toward stability, not to bet on instability,” Mr. Macron told reporters after landing in Egypt, where he was attending a summit on the peace process for Gaza , adding that he wanted France to “move forward in peace, stability, seriousness.” That will be challenging. Two parties — the National Rally, on the far right, and France Unbowed, on the far left — have already said they will file no-confidence motions against Mr. Lecornu, who is expected to deliver a key policy speech on Tuesday in the 577-seat lower house of Parliament. Other opposition parties have suggested support for such motions, bringing Mr. Lecornu dangerously close to the 288 votes currently required to topple him. The lower house is deadlocked among three main blocs: a collection of left-wing parties; a mix of conservatives and centrists; and a nationalist, anti-immigration far right. Lawmakers are expected to vote on no-confidence motions as early as this week. If they pass, Mr. Lecornu and his cabinet will have to resign and Mr. Macron will come under even more pressure to call snap parliamentary elections or to step down himself. Mr. Lecornu’s last cabinet imploded over partisan turmoil after a record 836 minutes. “Only by returning to the people will it be possible to make the major political decisions needed to overcome these multiple crises,” the National Rally said in a statement . Polls have shown that the National Rally would be the party most likely to benefit if elections were held now. But Mr. Macron, who has ruled out resigning or calling new elections, accused French political parties of squabbling at a critical moment. Even if Mr. Lecornu survives the immediate threat of being ousted, he will be hard-pressed to get a budget passed to reduce France’s rising debt by the end of the year. “Many of those who have fueled division and speculation have not been up to the task of the current situation in France and of the French people’s expectations,” Mr. Macron said, adding that those who had “destabilized” Mr. Lecornu were “solely responsible for this disorder.” “I ensure continuity and stability, and I will continue to do so,” he added. Critics — including in his own party — accuse Mr. Macron of prolonging the crisis. His centrist alliance lost badly in snap elections last year, yet he has appointed a succession of unstable, center-right minority governments instead of an opposition prime minister. “Has Macron realized that he must step back from his own second term, at least regarding domestic policy, to salvage what remains?” the newspaper Le Monde asked in its editorial on Monday. Under France’s Constitution, the president chooses the prime minister and appoints cabinet members on the prime minister’s recommendation. Prime ministers are formally in charge of domestic policy and run the country on a day-to-day basis. The cabinet appointed on Sunday, mixing members of Mr. Macron’s centrist coalition, conservatives and outsiders, did not differ radically from the previous one . Several key ministers stayed on, like Jean-Noël Barrot, a centrist who has been foreign minister for a year, and Roland Lescure, a member of Mr. Macron’s Renaissance party who is economy minister. Bruno Le Maire, a former economy minister whose appointment as defense minister last week was widely criticized, did not return. Six of the cabinet’s 34 ministers came from the Republicans, France’s mainstream conservative party. Bruno Retailleau, the party’s leader and the departing interior minister, said all six would now be excluded from the party, reflecting a growing rift over whether to work with Mr. Macron. Mr. Retailleau was replaced by Laurent Nuñez, the Paris police chief, who has also directed France’s counterterrorism and intelligence services. Jean-Pierre Farandou, the head of France’s national rail company, became labor minister, and Monique Barbut, a former head of the World Wildlife Fund in France, was appointed environment minister. Mr. Lecornu had also insisted on the need for fresh faces who were “disconnected” from ambitions for the 2027 presidential elections. He told his first meeting of cabinet members on Monday that their sole mission was “to overcome this political crisis in which we find ourselves and that has stunned some of our fellow citizens.” First, they will have to survive the week. “A word of advice to newcomers,” Mathilde Panot, a top France Unbowed lawmaker in the lower house, quipped on Sunday . “Don’t unpack your boxes too quickly.” Ségolène Le Stradic contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/macron-france-government.html,World,BBC,By Aurelien Breeden,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13int-france-politics-mthc/13int-france-politics-mthc-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T14:12:06+00:00,443a7cc40e0a44a8d26a94486b6b9a1c2eda7318

At least 38 people survived, according to an official in the northeastern province of Limpopo, where the accident happened, and a search continued for any other survivors. The passengers were mostly from Zimbabwe and Malawi and were traveling back to their home countries, according to transportation officials from Limpopo. The crash happened about 55 miles from the Zimbabwe border on the N1 highway, a route regularly used by cross-border buses carrying migrant workers and their families. President Cyril Ramaphosa described the crash as a tragedy for South Africa and “our sister states of Zimbabwe and Malawi.” “This is compounded by the fact that this incident has taken place during our annual Transport Month, where we place a special focus on the importance of safety on our roads,” Mr. Ramaphosa said. The bus operator, DNC Coaches, extended its condolences to the families of the passengers who died. Limpopo Transport Minister Violet Mathye said the cause of the crash was being investigated.

3365205d58c6,"Trump Touts ‘Very Important Signing,’ but Details Are Few","donald trump, israel gaza war, sharm el sheikh, abdel fattah el-sisi, recep tayyip erdogan, tamim bin hamad al- thani","At a high-profile conference of world leaders in Egypt about ending the war in the Gaza Strip, President Trump and the leaders of three other nations made a big production out of what he called “a very important signing,” characterizing it as a major breakthrough in the decades-long search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. But what is actually demanded from its signatories in the document they signed remains unclear, despite the very public ceremony. “We’re going to be signing a document that’s going to spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things,” Mr. Trump said just before the signing. “It’s very comprehensive.” Mr. Trump offered no insight on the substance of their agreement and he barely mentioned the two warring parties, Israel and Hamas. Neither were represented at the conference. The signatories were the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, all of whom played a role in brokering a cease-fire and hostage-for-prisoners exchange last week. “We’ve already signed documents in the Middle East having to do with Israel and Hamas and just about everything else,” Mr. Trump said. Seated at a table along with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan; and the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Mr. Trump was effusive in his praise of these leaders and their efforts to broker a truce in the two-year war in Gaza. Behind the table with the signers sat other world leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and his Canadian counterpart, Mark Carney. Green folders with the document had been placed in front of the heads of state at the table, and a hush fell over the room. Momentarily, only the sound of pens on paper could be heard. When Mr. Trump held up his folder showing the signed document, the audience applauded. By zooming in on the page that Mr. Trump held up, it’s possible to see what is written above the world leaders’ signatures. It appears to be a general declaration of principles. “We welcome the progress achieved in establishing comprehensive and durable peace arrangements in the Gaza Strip, as well as the friendly and mutually beneficial relationship between Israel and its regional neighbors,” the document states. The leaders pledged to “work collectively” to implement and sustain peace for future generations. There was no indication of how precisely they intend to accomplish these goals, leaving observers with little more than they had when Mr. Trump late last month unveiled a 20-point plan to end the conflict in Gaza. Israel and Hamas last week agreed to the initial phases of that plan, including the current cease-fire and an exchange of the last Israeli hostages for Palestinian detainees, which occurred on Monday. But there are unresolved points to be negotiated later. It’s unclear, for instance, if Hamas will ever accept Mr. Trump’s demand for it to disarm and not have a future role in governing the Gaza Strip. Another question is whether the cease-fire will hold. Mr. Trump told the summit attendees that the deal was progressing into the next phases. “It’s being worked on right now as we speak, and we’re actually in stage three and four,” he said. He also mentioned, without much explanation, that “we can take them out of order in a positive way,” referring to the phases. Despite the many questions, leader after leader stepped up to praise Mr. Trump and the peace plan. The White House, later on Monday, released a document entitled “The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity,” that appeared to be a full version of the document, though not one with substantive details. “We, the undersigned, welcome the truly historic commitment and implementation by all parties to the Trump Peace Agreement, ending more than two years of profound suffering and loss — opening a new chapter for the region defined by hope, security, and a shared vision for peace and prosperity,” it began.

adde1e2d274d,Trump and Abbas Share Moment of Rapprochement in Egypt,"mahmoud abbas, donald trump, massad boulos, palestinians, international relations, palestinian authority, un general assembly, gaza strip, sharm el sheikh, israel gaza war, west bank, tiffany trump","More than 20 world leaders met in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for a summit to end the war in Gaza on Monday, but one of the most remarkable public exchanges there was the greeting between President Trump and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abbas shook hands warmly and at length, chatting intensely all the while. As the two men posed for the camera at the end of their hushed chat, Mr. Trump took Mr. Abbas’s hand, patting it twice as the Palestinian leader smiled. Mr. Trump gave a thumbs-up sign and presented his own big smile. It was not the first time that Mr. Abbas and Mr. Trump had shaken hands, and their conversation could not be heard. But their body language suggested that they had reached some kind of rapprochement in what has at times been a tense and strained relationship. Just recently, Mr. Abbas was denied a U.S. visa , preventing him from traveling to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. That meant he had to address the assembly by video link, and he missed a conference on Palestinian statehood hosted by France and Saudi Arabia — and about a dozen nations’ recognition of the state of Palestine . The Trump administration cited national security concerns in denying Mr. Abbas and his delegation visas. The State Department, in its announcement of the denials, said it acted on the ground that the Palestinian Authority was “undermining the prospects for peace.” It accused the group of waging “international lawfare campaigns” by filing cases against Israel at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice and of trying to bypass negotiations for peace with “efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state.” Those tensions were not in evidence in the exchange between Mr. Abbas and Mr. Trump on Monday, or in the American president’s address to leaders at the summit in Egypt. As Mr. Trump spoke at Sharm el-Sheikh, he pointed to Mr. Abbas and noted his presence at the summit, drawing a round of applause from the audience. “It’s good to have you,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Abbas has made a concerted effort to repair his relationship with Mr. Trump, which frayed during the U.S. president’s first term in the White House. In that period, Mr. Trump advanced policies that infuriated the Palestinian Authority, which Hamas forced out of Gaza in 2007 but still administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , cut off aid to the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees, presented a peace plan that favored Israel and helped forge agreements between Israel and Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords , that sidestepped Palestinian ambitions to establish an independent state. Mr. Abbas barred senior Palestinian officials from contact with the first Trump administration. But he took steps to sway Mr. Trump in the run-up to his re-election last year. Massad Boulos, a Lebanese-American businessman and the father-in-law of Mr. Trump’s daughter Tiffany Trump, had served as an unofficial emissary of the 2024 Trump campaign to Arab American voters. Mr. Boulos helped Mr. Abbas communicate with Mr. Trump in the months before the election, as did Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian American Trump backer, according to people involved in those contacts. Mr. Boulos and Mr. Bahbah said they helped facilitate the delivery of a letter from Mr. Abbas to Mr. Trump in July, in which the Palestinian leader condemned an assassination attempt against Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump posted the letter on his social media platform . In the letter, Mr. Abbas expressed “grave concern” about the assassination attempt, condemned “acts of violence” and called for differences to be resolved through communication. Mr. Trump replied on the posted letter itself, in his distinctive handwriting with a thick black Sharpie marker, addressing Mr. Abbas by his first name, saying the letter was “so nice” and declaring that “everything will be good.” A 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza that Mr. Trump unveiled last month calls on the Palestinian Authority, which has been accused of corruption, to undergo a period of reform before it can play a role in governing the enclave. The plan does not guarantee the establishment of a Palestinian state. It says only that as the rebuilding of Gaza advances and reforms to the Palestinian Authority are carried out, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.” Adam Rasgon, Charles Homans and Erika Solomon contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/middleeast/trump-abbas-handshake-egypt.html,World,BBC,By Ephrat Livni,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12gaza-abbass-trump1-pwtk/12gaza-abbass-trump1-pwtk-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T21:53:32.067000+00:00,8a0af614762c010178d5dd2e74f32666fb33f1c1
c10dbe42ac40,Cuban Dissident Leader Leaves Prison for Exile in the U.S.,"jose daniel ferrer, cuba, political prisoner, us foreign policy, politics","One of Cuba’s most prominent dissidents, José Daniel Ferrer, who has challenged his country’s Communist regime for years, was released from prison on Monday and immediately left the island for exile in the United States with his family. The Cuban foreign ministry said Mr. Ferrer had been freed because of a formal request from the U.S. government following a letter made public this month in which Mr. Ferrer said he wanted to leave the country because of harsh prison conditions and threats against his family. “The dictatorship’s cruelty against me has surpassed all limits,” he wrote last month. “I have suffered beatings, torture, humiliation, threats and extreme conditions.” Mr. Ferrer’s departure represents a blow to Cuba’s opposition at a time when the country is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades and many younger Cubans are abandoning the country. But his arrival in Miami was welcomed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is the son of Cuban exile parents. Mr. Ferrer’s “leadership and tireless advocacy for the Cuban people was a threat to the regime, which repeatedly imprisoned and tortured him,’’ Mr. Rubio said in a statement. “We are glad that Ferrer is now free from the regime’s oppression.’’ Mr. Ferrer, 55, has been at the forefront of the Cuban opposition movement for two decades. While most opposition leaders were based in Havana, the capital, Mr. Ferrer’s movement was centered in Santiago de Cuba, the country’s second-largest city, in the eastern part of the country. He was arrested during a protest there that was part of island-wide demonstrations in July 2021 that rattled the government and were brutally put down. Mr. Ferrer had been in prison before, one of a group of 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 and considered “prisoners of conscience” by international human rights groups. Cuba denies that it holds political prisoners, citing laws that prohibit anti-government activities. Mr. Ferrer was released in 2015 along with 52 other prisoners as part of a landmark agreement between Cuba and the United States under President Barack Obama. That agreement led to a fleeting moment of hope that the relations between the two countries might be on the mend after decades of hostility. But the détente was short-lived and hostilities have ratcheted back up. After Mr. Ferrer joined mass anti-government protests in 2021, he was quickly arrested and ordered to prison for four years. He was released in January in a deal brokered by the Vatican, as part of a last-minute agreement in the final days of the Biden administration to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism. That deal was torn up immediately after Mr. Trump took office. Cuba was put back on the terrorism list and Mr. Ferrer was sent back to prison, where his health is reported to have suffered. Mr. Ferrer had been one of the few remaining opposition figures not in exile. “It is a sad day for all Cubans when the only solution to political problems is exiting the country,” said Joe Garcia, a Cuban American and former member of Congress from Miami. But few will begrudge Mr. Ferrer his decision after so much personal sacrifice, Mr. Garcia said. “You can’t blame him. It’s the product of impossible expectations and overwhelming pressure.” Though Mr. Ferrer was long considered resolute in his determination to never abandon Cuba, his decision to leave was not entirely unexpected. It follows a steady stream of dissidents and journalists who have chosen the same path, as well as an exodus of several million ordinary people since Communist rule was established following the Cuban revolution in 1959. Migration has surged to it highest levels in recent years as the country’s economy has cratered. Among those still detained and considered political prisoners are Maykel Castillo, a rapper who featured in an opposition anthem, “Patria y Vida” — “Homeland and Life’’ — and Luis Manuel Otero, an artist and activist who has publicly denounced the government. Mr. Ferrer, in a letter to family and friends from prison last year, complained of being held in solitary confinement for long stretches and not being permitted family visits or telephone communication for over a year and a half. “The dictatorship has buried me alive; they want to silence me at all costs,” he wrote. “I hope I am wrong, but when so many flee from terror and horror, those who remain suffer serious consequences.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/americas/jose-daniel-ferrer-cuba.html,World,BBC,By David C.

fdc6d0c81538,A Reality Check on Peace,"us foreign policy, israel gaza war, donald trump, israel, peace process","How close is peace in the Middle East? President Trump was effusive in his assessment of the cease-fire deal that, so far, has brought 20 hostages back to Israel and freed some 2,000 Palestinians from Israeli prisons: “ It’s peace in the Middle East .” When Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it “one of the most important days for world peace in 50 years,” Trump retorted, “Only 50?” “Maybe 100,” Rubio said. The reality on the ground is a little more complicated. I wanted to understand how close the hostage-prisoner exchange has brought the region to a lasting peace. (After all, we’ve seen something like this before .) So I called up my colleague David Halbfinger, who is in Jerusalem and covering the cease-fire closely. Is everything going according to Trump’s plan so far? Everything has happened according to plan in Phase 1. But Phase 1 is really the low-hanging fruit of this plan. There’s a good chance that this could be the high-water mark of this whole process. What are the potential sticking points in the next phase? Hamas has said it wants a full Israeli withdrawal. The Israelis are saying they’re not pulling out until they get everything that was in the Trump plan. So we have the ingredients for a standoff. Israel and Trump both want Gaza to be run by someone other than Hamas. But Hamas hasn’t agreed to lay down its weapons. So who steps into that breach? Israel refuses to entertain the idea of letting the Palestinian Authority go into Gaza. But then where will the Palestinian technocrats who are supposed to take charge under Trump’s plan come from? What is the security situation in Gaza at the moment? Who is maintaining order? We’ve seen what looks like Hamas beginning to reassert itself on the ground in Gaza. I think they’re trying very hard to show that there is no vacuum. What about this idea of international troops securing the cease-fire? That is one of the most interesting ideas in the Trump plan: bringing in an international stabilization force from a number of countries, including from the Arab world. We’ve heard of everybody from the Emiratis to the Indonesians, the Turks, even the E.U., being willing to take part. But will any of those countries want to come in and have to play the role of getting Hamas to turn over its weapons? Or are they going to wait for disarmament before they step in? And, how long will it take to train up this kind of force? Everywhere you turn, there are these unresolved issues . And yet some people describe this as the best hope for peace since the Oslo accords . The fact that you have so many countries in the Arab and Muslim world backing the U.S. and its push not just for a cease-fire, but for a greater peace, is enormously promising. So there’s reason to see this as a promising moment. It’s just, again, easier to see this running into great difficulty than it is to see it accelerating from here. All parties have a way to claim victory from this deal. Does that help improve the chance that it holds? You’re right, everybody is declaring victory. Hamas certainly is. They’ve claimed they put the issue of Palestinian statehood back at the top of the international agenda, that Israel is isolated, that they have survived the war, that they returned nearly 2,000 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. And all of those things are true. Israel can point to the fact that it has brought home the hostages and severely weakened Hamas. I don’t know how much Israel’s isolation on the world stage is also motivating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do what he’s doing. But when the U.S., which is perhaps its last and certainly its most important ally, applied pressure, Israel came to the table. And if the fighting pauses and worldwide attention turns elsewhere, I think Israelis will have a chance to assess just how much damage has been done to their country’s reputation. And they’re going to want to address that isolation. I mean, you heard Netanyahu talk about making peace in a way he hasn’t ordinarily done. So some cause for hope? Yes, some cause for hope.

Officials said Monday that 64 people had been killed and 65 were missing across five affected states near the Gulf of Mexico. The toll is expected to increase in the coming days as search and rescue teams continue to reach areas cut off by landslides. President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday morning that her administration estimated that roughly 100,000 homes were affected by flooding and landslides. Dozens of communities remained isolated, and the president said food and water would need to be flown in. “There were no scientific or meteorological conditions that could have indicated to us that the rainfall would be of this magnitude,” Ms. Sheinbaum told reporters, adding that the government’s eyes were mostly on the Pacific, where two storms, Priscilla and Raymond , had formed off western Mexico last week. But it was in the central and eastern parts of the country — in the states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro and Puebla — where extremely intense and localized downpours caused the most destruction, overflowing rivers and setting off landslides. Some towns saw around 20 inches of rain dumped in just four days, government figures show. Ms. Sheinbaum is facing pressure to provide quick relief to the victims, a task hampered by recent budget cuts to climate-change mitigation efforts and the loss of a special disaster relief fund that was dissolved by her predecessor and mentor over corruption claims. (No cases of corruption directly linked to the fund have been legally proven). Research has found that the fund — once considered one of the world’s most advanced financial instruments for disaster relief — saved lives and aided in restoring access to vital services. But Ms. Sheinbaum vowed her administration would spare no expense to support those affected by the heavy rains. “There are sufficient resources. There will be no skimping on that,” she said, adding that her administration still had $867 million this year to allocate to disaster relief. But in some of the hardest hit places, desperation has been growing. On Sunday, during a visit to Veracruz — where an overflowing river displaced thousands and had claimed at least 29 lives — Ms. Sheinbaum was met by crowds of angry residents in the town of Poza Rica. “Where are they?” they shouted, holding up cellphone photos of the missing. A young student rebuked the president as she tried to settle people down, speaking from the back of a pickup truck. Three of his university classmates, the man said, had been missing for three days, while locals responded on their own to the disaster. “We have been here for three days, cleaning up,” he shouted, with emotion. “What good is it to have you here?” Ms. Sheinbaum repeatedly asked the crowd to shush and listen to her, pressing her finger on her lips. “We are going to help everyone,” she said. “Nothing will be hidden.” Asked about Sunday’s encounter, she said Monday that the university authorities told her that two students had died but they had not yet confirmed whether any others were missing. Ms. Sheinbaum has also pointed to a “unique” factor that Mexico has heavily relied on in recent years: its armed forces. In the absence of a special disaster fund, the Mexican Army, Air Force and Navy have played an expanding role in disaster relief efforts. The results have received mixed reviews. In the aftermath of Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 storm that left a trail of destruction and death in Acapulco in 2023, the military was praised for its rapid deployment of aid and personnel. But recovery efforts were hindered, critics say, by a lack of local knowledge and initial neglect of poorer neighborhoods and outlying communities . The financial impact of repairs, social assistance and direct cash transfers on Mexico’s public funds has been substantial. Just like her administration has been doing in Acapulco, Ms. Sheinbaum said on Monday, she would give instructions to dredge rivers, build embankments, rebuild bridges and raise pumping stations for flood control in the recently affected states. So far, more than 7,300 Army soldiers and National Guard members have been deployed to help rescue and evacuate people. Health officials have also been deployed to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue. The rains also interrupted the power supply, leaving more than a quarter million people without electricity, though Mexico’s national power company said by Monday that power had largely been restored.

9584ece0c21d,Madagascar’s President Goes Into Hiding,"madagascar, politics, andry rajoelina, africa, appointments and executive changes, coups d'etat, internal-open-access-from-nl","President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar said in a speech published online Monday that he was sheltering in an undisclosed location because of threats on his life after weeks of bloody protests over corruption and his government’s failure to improve the quality of life. Despite growing calls for him to resign from both the public and some members of the country’s security forces, Mr. Rajoelina insisted that he was staying in power to save the deeply impoverished southern African island nation. The defiant stance threatened to further inflame the tens of thousands of demonstrators who have flooded the streets nationwide. When Mr. Rajoelina, 51, announced Monday morning that he would address the nation later that evening, thousands gathered in a festive rally in the capital, Antananarivo, anticipating that he was going to step down. Now, the mineral-rich country of 32 million people, gripped by chaos, faces an uncertain path forward. Military leaders who have broken from the president have been careful not to actively seize power, seemingly to avoid the appearance of a coup. Such a move would likely draw condemnation from the international community, and Madagascar, which is heavily reliant on foreign aid, could ill afford such isolation. It is unclear what steps the breakaway security forces will take now. Speculation is rampant that Mr. Rajoelina is no longer in Madagascar, but he has refused to give any indication of his whereabouts. He was forced into a corner in recent days when some members of the security forces, which initially engaged in a violent crackdown on the protests, joined the youth-led demonstrators and said they would no longer take orders from their superiors. Mr. Rajoelina’s speech on Monday was delayed several hours because some of the dissident military forces tried to take over the state-run television station that was supposed to broadcast his remarks, according to a post on the presidency’s Facebook page. During the day, thousands gathered at May 13 Square, a center of protest in front of City Hall, where vendors peddled fruit, grilled meat and ice cream. The crowd waved Malagasy flags and chanted songs, including one that used an expletive to call for Mr. Rajoelina to step down. Next to the stage hung a large banner with the anime skull and bones that has become a symbol of Gen Z protests worldwide. Speakers from student groups, workers unions and other activists rallied the crowd. When the coffin of a protester who was shot and killed on Saturday was paraded past the square on top of a van, the crowd fell quiet as people raised their hands in respect. “I’m happy and confident of a better future in Madagascar,” said Fenosoa Hanitriniaina, a 29-year-old law student, believing that the president would be ousted from office. “I’m happy and confident of a better future in Madagascar.” As security forces defected on Sunday, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, a former army general appointed prime minister by Mr. Rajoelina last week, said he would speak with them. “I am a soldier first and foremost,” he said in a text message to The New York Times. “The most important and urgent thing for me is to have frank discussions with my brothers in arms. We have one thing in common, which is a deep love for our country. I remain confident about that.” The protests in Madagascar began more than two weeks ago, spurred by anger over the government’s failure to reliably deliver electricity and water. They have since grown to include broader grievances about corruption and the economy. The majority of Madagascar’s residents live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and both extreme drought and flooding from cyclones have threatened its critical agricultural production in recent years. Many of the protesters said they lost faith in Mr. Rajoelina’s ability to fix the nation’s problems. Mr. Rajoelina, who is in his third term, came to power after leading a coup in 2009. He lost an election in 2013, but regained the presidency in 2018. He was re-elected in 2023, though his opponents argue that the process was rigged. Despite coming to power in a coup, Mr. Rajoelina has warned against another one, saying recently that it would further destabilize the country. He fired his entire cabinet this month, a change he said he made in response to the protests. But calls for his resignation only grew louder. During the protests, Madagascar’s security forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators. The United Nations has said that nearly two dozen people have been killed, a figure the government disputed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/africa/madagascar-president-rajoelina.html,World,BBC,By John Eligon,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13int-madagascar-coup-bhmz/13int-madagascar-coup-bhmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T21:12:28+00:00,417cebe37ca5a51a686898dabe5ebb9b97d057a0
e9117db7882e,"As Hostages and Prisoners Return Home, Trump Declares ‘New Dawn’ in Mideast","israel gaza war, kidnapping and hostages, donald trump, benjamin netanyahu, israel, gaza strip, hamas, palestinian authority, international relations, palestinians, internal-open-access-from-nl","After two years of mass carnage and destruction, Israel and Hamas took major steps on Monday toward ending the war in Gaza, exchanging hostages for prisoners as President Trump arrived in the Middle East, basking in the adulation of world leaders who credited him for pushing through a plan for peace. “This is the end of the age of terror and death,” President Trump said in an address to the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, where he received a standing ovation and repeated, rapturous applause. Mr. Trump proclaimed “the end of the war” in Gaza. And deploying a line presidents before him have reached for, only to be later disappointed, Mr. Trump declared a new era for the region. “This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East,” he said. By the end of the day, Hamas had freed 20 living hostages and Israel had released some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, part of the 20-point peace plan announced by the Trump administration after weeks of cajoling and courting major players in the Middle East, and the mediation of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. The guns and artillery in Gaza were silent on Monday and the aerial bombings that have killed so many thousands of Gazans had ceased. And for the first time since the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on Israel, Hamas no longer held any living Israeli captives. “Our nightmare is finally over. He’s almost here,” said Ilan Gilboa-Dalal, the father of Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. “I’m going to tell him: ‘My son, the nightmare is over,” Ilan said by telephone after the news of his son’s release. “You’re finally safe, you’re with us. We’re never leaving you again.” In the West Bank city of Ramallah, families broke into trills as buses carrying scores of released prisoners and detainees approached, with people rushing forward to greet the men as they stepped off. “This feeling is indescribable,” said Nasser Shehadeh, who was released after serving three years of a 17-year sentence for a car ramming attack on two soldiers, who survived. He was told he would be freed three days ago, and said the news came as a surprise. “I haven’t slept since that moment,” he said. Yet even as Israelis and Palestinians reveled in split-screen scenes of tearful reunions with pale and frail-looking loved ones, many pitfalls and questions remained over the future of the Gaza Strip and the tenuous ties between Israel and its neighbors. For all of the superlatives that Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, heaped on Mr. Trump on Monday — “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the State of Israel has ever had in the White House,” he said with the American president at his side — Mr. Netanyahu did not join Mr. Trump in declaring that the war in Gaza was over. Mr. Netanyahu was also absent from a high-level regional summit in Egypt that was meant to discuss the future of Gaza. In attendance were Mr. Trump and more than 20 leaders from across Europe and the Middle East and the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. The Egyptian government had earlier said that both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas would participate. But in a statement late on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said he could not accept the invitation to attend because of the Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret, which begins on Monday evening. Mr. Netanyahu said he had thanked Mr. Trump for the invitation to the conference. Members of Mr. Netanyahu’s government also expressed their anger that the remains of many Israeli hostages were not handed over on Monday. The agreement between Hamas and Israel calls for Hamas to turn over the bodies of at least 26 other hostages. But Hamas said it would deliver only four coffins of remains on Monday. Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, wrote on social media that Hamas’s announcement was “a violation of its commitments.” “Each delay or intentional avoidance will be considered a blunt violation of the agreement and will be answered accordingly,” he wrote. In Gaza, where 24 months of war set off a humanitarian catastrophe and widespread hunger, Palestinians expressed relief that the Israeli military had halted its two-year military offensive. But they said there was little to celebrate. The war has left Gaza in ruins: cities reduced to rubble, tens of thousands killed and the health system devastated. “It’s important the bombing has stopped, but there’s nothing to be happy about,” said Saed Abu Aita, 44, who is displaced in central Gaza. “My two daughters were killed, my home was destroyed and my health has deteriorated.” About 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and about 250 people taken hostage. Israel’s devastating military response has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, including civilians and combatants, according to the Gaza health ministry. Palestinians in Gaza said they hoped the cease-fire would bring desperately needed food. The United Nations said on Sunday that “ real progress ” was being made in delivering aid to Gaza. An Israeli military official said that, starting on Sunday, about 600 humanitarian aid trucks operated by the United Nations would be allowed to enter Gaza every day. That would be about twice as many trucks entering daily as in previous weeks, the official said. Footage from Gaza on Sunday showed men storming a moving truck and stripping boxes of supplies, scenes of desperation that have been common throughout the war. One crucial question that remains is the future of Hamas. In agreeing to release the hostages, the militant group gave up much of the leverage it has had with Israel. But for Mr. Trump’s full peace plan to work, diplomats and negotiators will probably need to resolve whether Hamas agrees to give up its weapons. Mr. Netanyahu long insisted that he would not accept an agreement in which Hamas refused to disarm. Hamas publicly rejected his demands that it do so. But for the families of Israeli hostages who returned home alive, Monday was a day of jubilation. All 20 hostages released were men — women, children and elderly hostages had come home during previous cease-fire deals. Those released on Monday included Alon Ohel, 24, a pianist from northern Israel, who was seized from a roadside bomb shelter after fleeing the Nova music festival; Avinatan Or, 32, abducted alongside his partner, Noa Argamani, who was rescued in Gaza by Israeli forces in June 2024; and Matan Angrest, 22, a soldier in the Israeli Army who was taken captive from his tank during a battle with Hamas fighters near the Gaza border. Videos circulated on social media of mothers and fathers reunited with grown children they had not been able to embrace for two years. “You are coming home!” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, 25, said on a video call with her son in Gaza, their first conversation since he was abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

de31a6429058,Trump Calls for Israel’s President to Pardon Netanyahu. Could it Happen?,"gaza strip, israel, isaac herzog, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, us politics, us foreign policy, israel gaza war","President Trump was addressing a grateful Israeli Parliament on Monday, after the first of 20 hostages were released by Hamas in a deal he helped broker, when he made an unexpected suggestion: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, currently on trial for corruption, should be pardoned. “Hey, I have an idea,” Mr. Trump said to the holder of Israel’s largely ceremonial presidency, Isaac Herzog. “Mr. President, why don’t you give him a pardon?” Since 2020, Mr. Netanyahu has been on trial for corruption in three separate but related cases. He is accused of receiving cigars, Champagne, bracelets, bags and luxury clothes; disrupting investigative and judicial proceedings; and demanding fawning coverage by two leading Israeli news outlets . He has long denied the charges. But legal experts in Israel questioned whether Mr. Netanyahu could actually be pardoned at this stage in his trial. While Israel’s president clearly has the power to pardon someone convicted of a crime, the country has seen just one notable case of a pre-emptive pardon, in 1986, and its value as precedent is uncertain. “That was a very unusual case,” said Suzie Navot, a constitutional law expert and the vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute. The case, Barzilai v. Government of Israel, stemmed from a cover-up by Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security agency, after its agents executed two Palestinian militants involved in a 1984 bus hijacking . The security forces originally claimed that all four of the hijackers were killed in a takeover of the bus, but it later emerged that two of the hijackers had been taken alive and were then beaten to death . That prompted a scandal, much public turmoil and widespread calls for investigations in Israel, Ms. Navot said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Mr. Trump seized on the moment to tell the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, that this is “not only the end of a war, this is the end of the age of terror and death.” Using a line that other presidents have reached for — and often been disappointed — he added: “This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.” He then traveled to Egypt, where dozens of world leaders awaited his arrival for a “peace summit” that offered the pomp and circumstance Mr. Trump is known to enjoy. Banners adorned with his face were dotted along the streets of a Red Sea resort. “From the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, the will of the people meets the resolve of world leaders to end the war in Gaza,” President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said. “They all carry a single message to mankind: Enough war. Welcome to peace.” But at the Egypt summit, neither Israel nor Hamas were participants, and no one could explain what, exactly, was in the document that the countries that did attend signed. Rarely has an American president, particularly one as divisive at home as Mr. Trump is, been met with such adulation abroad. In Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, tens of thousands yelled, “Trump, Trump,” and in the Knesset some members wore red MAGA-style hats. Mr. Netanyahu, whose name was booed in the same square on Saturday night, declared the president was “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.” There was more talk of nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize and the Israel Prize. And Mr. Trump himself surprised Israeli lawmakers when he twice made an offer to Iran — a country that Israel and the United States bombed only four months ago — to enter talks that could end decades of enmity and isolation. “You know what would be great, if we could make a peace deal with them,” he said. “Would you be happy with that?” He added, “I think they’re tired,” but the offer did not elicit an enthusiastic response. There was more enthusiastic applause when Mr. Trump described Israel’s assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists during the 12-day bombing of the country, or when he detailed the number of B-2 bombers, re-fuelers and support aircraft that dropped bunker-busters on Fordo, Natanz and Esfahan, the major Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. And just beneath the surface, there were obvious differences over the future of Gaza, and even over whether the cease-fire that is finally allowing food and medicine to flow into the territory would necessarily leading to a lasting peace. “The war is over,” Mr. Trump told reporters, both on Air Force One and in the hallways of the Knesset. Mr. Netanyahu was far more cautious, welcoming the release of the hostages, and the fact that no living Israelis were being held in Gaza for the first time in years, while refusing to discuss whether Israel would resume hostilities if Hamas does not disarm or leave the territory. Hamas never agreed to that part of Mr. Trump’s 20-point plan, and its militias were already moving into neighborhoods from which Israel had withdrawn in recent days. And even while Mr. Trump was in Jerusalem, Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, declared that Hamas had released the remains of only four out of 28 hostages who had died in captivity. “Each delay or intentional avoidance will be considered a blunt violations of the agreement and will be answered accordingly,’’ he posted on X. Mr. Trump chose to ignore the possible roadblocks ahead. In his speech to the Knesset, he wandered off text to assess Mr. Netanyahu’s personality: “He’s not the easiest guy to deal with, but that’s what makes him great.” He talked at length about the hours of conversation his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, held earlier this year with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Witkoff, a real estate investor from New York, was described by Mr. Trump as “Henry Kissinger who doesn’t leak.” Mr. Kissinger, the national security adviser and then secretary of state under Nixon and Ford, was a master of the self-serving Washington leak. Except for brief references, Mr. Trump did not talk about what it would take to rebuild Gaza, or the future of the Palestinian people, or the trade-offs between creating a Palestinian state and its alternatives. In fact, there was almost no public discussion of the implementation of his 20-point plan at all, save for the fact that he was meeting wealthy Arab states and European governments to form an international stabilization force or fund the rebuilding of the devastated territory. In that regard, elements of Mr. Trump’s speech gave another glimpse of his foreign policy. He praised countries for their military strength, especially Israel, which he said emerged “stronger, more respected” than before. Two years of conflict with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran certainly did prove that Israel was the strongest power in the region. But Mr. Trump did not discuss its diplomatic isolation, as European powers embraced the idea of a separate Palestinian state partly because of the huge civilian casualties caused by Israeli attacks. As usual, Mr. Trump argued that countries would make decisions based on their economic interests — that joining the Abraham accords, for example, would enhance trade. But of course the Middle East is filled with nations, religious groups and terror organizations that have gone to war even when it risks all economic progress. Russia did the same in invading Ukraine. There were departures from the norm. Mr. Trump is not known for nurturing alliances, but he expressed gratitude “for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas.” Yet he said little about how to build on the momentum of that new cooperation. In Sharm el-Sheikh, Mr. Trump marveled at just how quickly the hastily planned summit came together, and how many people had come: Leaders from more than 20 nations flocked to join him on a stage adorned with the words PEACE 2025. “These people all came in like 20 minutes notice,” Mr. Trump said. Most of the summit consisted of Mr. Trump effusively praising the other world leaders in attendance. Mr. Trump signed a document at a table alongside the leaders of the three other mediating countries — Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey — though the content of the document was not immediately clear. Before signing the paper, Mr. Trump said it was “going to spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things,” he said. “It’s very comprehensive.” There were scattered protests in Israel against Mr. Trump’s visit, and two left-wing lawmakers belonging to a joint Palestinian-Israeli political party were escorted out of the Knesset for displaying signs that said “Recognize Palestine!” They were quickly seized, and Mr. Trump pursed his lips before saying: “That was very efficient.” Ayman Odeh, one of the two lawmakers, wrote on social media that the speeches in the Knesset would not absolve Mr. Netanyahu “of the crimes against humanity committed in Gaza.” He later added: “There are two peoples here, and neither one of them is leaving.” Trump made the argument that if he had not destroyed Iran’s three major nuclear sites , the agreement to get the hostages out of Gaza would not have been possible. Arab states would not have taken the risk of pressuring Hamas, an Iranian proxy. “We took a big cloud off of the Middle East and off of Israel,” he said, rejecting predictions that Iran would try to restart its nuclear program. “The last thing they want to do is start digging holes again in mountains that just got blown up. They are not doing that. They want to survive.” But there were signs of stumbling blocks ahead. Arab leaders have been particularly wary about the commitment of Mr. Netanyahu, who told Israelis this week that the military campaign in Gaza is “not over.” Mr. Netanyahu underscored their anxieties with a last-minute plan to attend the peace summit. Egypt’s presidency quickly announced what would have been a major symbolic moment for the event. But it was then forced to backtrack shortly after, when Mr. Netanyahu canceled his plans, citing a Jewish holiday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/middleeast/trump-victory-lap-whats-next.html,World,BBC,By David E.

32e02b0df3e3,W.H.O. Warns of Sharp Increase in Drug-Resistant Infections,"fatalities;casualties, antibacterial, std, disease rates, e coli, disesases;health;illness;medicine, bacteria, developing countries, drug resistance, pharmaceuticals;prescription drugs, who","Across the world, the spread of dangerous infections that do not respond to antibiotics has been increasing by as much as 15 percent a year, affecting treatment for urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, E. coli and other pathogens that kill millions of people annually, according to a report released Monday by the World Health Organization. The report documents how countries are grappling with the challenge of so-called antimicrobial resistance. It found that one in six infections in 2023 was resistant to the current roster of antibiotic drugs. The drug resistance involves 40 percent of the most common antibiotics used against these infections. Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean had the highest rates of resistance, with one in three infections resistant to antibiotics. That is roughly double the worldwide average and more three times the rates in Europe and the Western Pacific. Overall, antimicrobial resistance was more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, especially those with weak health care systems. “Antibiotic resistance is widespread and threatening the future of modern medicine,” Dr. Yvan Hutin, director of the W.H.O.’s department of antimicrobial resistance, said in a news conference announcing the surveillance results. “Simply put, the less people have access to quality care, the more they’re likely to suffer from drug-resistant infection.” Drug-resistant bacterial and fungal infections kill more than one million people around the world each year and contribute to the deaths of nearly five million others, according to the health agency’s estimates. A study published in The Lancet estimated that more than 39 million people would die from antibiotic-resistant infections in the next 25 years. In many ways, antimicrobial resistance, or A.M.R., is unavoidable. Over time, pathogens can evolve to outsmart the drugs created to kill them. Excessive use of antimicrobials, however, accelerates the process. At the same time, the pipeline for new drugs has largely dried up, the result of a broken marketplace for antimicrobials that has driven the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies from the field. Companies that have tried to make new antibiotics have been unable to make money from them. “For many of these threats, the consequences are real — harder-to-treat infection, rising costs and lives lost,” Dr. Hutin said. The report sounded the alarm on so-called gram-negative bacteria, which pose additional challenges because of a protective outer membrane that can be tough for antibiotics to penetrate. Gram-negative bacteria include Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are often implicated in severe infections that lead to sepsis and death. In Africa, resistance to cephalosporins, a class of antibiotics and the first choice treatment for such infections, can exceed 70 percent. Without meaningful action, the effects of this death toll on the global economy could be staggering. A report published last year by the Center for Global Development estimated that drug-resistant infections could lead to a $1.7 trillion reduction in economic output by 2050, much of it driven by lost productivity or the early deaths of family breadwinners. The report did offer some hope. Nearly 140 countries have joined the agency’s antimicrobial resistance surveillance system since its creation in 2015, and 100 of those countries contributed antimicrobial resistance data to the current report, a four-fold increase. Dr. Silvia Bertagnolio, who leads the agency’s efforts to strengthen antimicrobial resistance surveillance and diagnostics, said she was encouraged by the growing global awareness about drug-resistant infections and by the increasing number of countries willing to share data. But she also noted that nearly half of all countries did not submit data last year, and among those that did, half lacked the capacity to provide reliable data.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/health/who-antibiotic-drug-resistance.html,World,BBC,By Andrew Jacobs,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12hs-antibiotics-mlzq/12hs-antibiotics-mlzq-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T17:07:18.699000+00:00,829f9c28311c4621355fee7b82c8fd6816eb186e

The moment carried strong echoes of another speech that Mr. Trump gave in 2020, announcing the Abraham Accords — a series of diplomatic deals that saw Israel establish relations with several Arab countries. On Monday, Mr. Trump praised the accords, saying that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, “did something very special” when he helped to broker them. He also hinted at his longstanding wish to expand them, suggesting that Israel could even make a deal with Iran, its archenemy in the region. Though a comprehensive end to the war between Israel and Hamas has yet to be hammered out , Mr. Trump said the cease-fire meant “the historic dawn of a new Middle East.” What are the Abraham Accords? Signed in 2020 on the White House lawn, the first of the deals known as the Abraham Accords established diplomatic ties between Israel and two Gulf Arab states, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. A similar agreement with Morocco soon followed. Until then, the only Arab states that had formally recognized Israel were Egypt and Jordan. Most others had pledged not to do so until the creation of a Palestinian state. The lack of diplomatic relations meant that citizens of Israel could not travel to those countries, and vice versa. It also forced any trade and security cooperation under the table. Until the Abraham Accords, even direct phone calls to Israel were blocked in several Arab countries, including the Emirates. President Trump has described the Abraham agreements as the crowning foreign policy achievement of his first term, and they have received bipartisan support from U.S. lawmakers. At the White House signing ceremony in 2020, Mr. Trump said that they marked “the dawn of a new Middle East,” speaking of a future in which “people of all faiths and backgrounds live together in peace and prosperity.” What impact have the deals had? The Abraham Accords have created an opportunity for expanded trade, security cooperation and tourism between the countries that signed them. Israeli tourists and investors have poured into Dubai, the biggest city in the Emirates, and technology and energy companies have signed new deals. In 2024, trade between the two countries exceeded $3 billion, and regular flights continue to ferry travelers between the Emirates and Tel Aviv. Morocco has also seen an influx of Israeli tourists. And to sweeten its incentives to sign the deal, the United States agreed to recognize the disputed Western Sahara territory as a sovereign part of Morocco. The impact in Bahrain has been more modest, and protests against the accords have become a regular occurrence in the Gulf nation. The accords have done nothing to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel’s occupation of the West Bank has deepened , rather than eased, contrary to the hopes of Emirati officials when they signed the deal . The current prospects for a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza — a longstanding goal of Arab leaders — appear dim, even though several European countries have recently recognized Palestine. Is this a peace deal? Over the five years since the Abraham Accords were signed, Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, along with other American and Israeli officials, have repeatedly referred to the agreements as a “peace deal.” “The blessings of the peace we make today will be enormous,” Mr. Netanyahu declared from a White House balcony when the accords were announced in 2020. “Ultimately, it can end the Arab-Israeli conflict once and for all.” Scholars of the region say that is merely a turn of phrase , belying the fact that there has never been a war between Israel and the U.A.E. or Bahrain. Morocco has also largely stayed out of the Arab-Israeli conflicts, aside from sending a token force to a 1973 war, more than 50 years ago. In effect, the deals bypassed the central conflict, between Israel and the Palestinians, declaring harmony between parties that were not fighting. Will the Abraham Accords expand? American and Israeli officials have frequently stated their desires, and expectations, for other countries to sign the accords. So far, that has fallen flat. The biggest prize for supporters of the accords would be Saudi Arabia, the powerful, oil-rich kingdom that hosts the two holiest sites in Islam. But years of overtures to persuade Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel have so far failed. The Biden administration took up that mantle fervently, pursuing a deal that was predicated on the United States granting major benefits to the kingdom . Analysts say that Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza, with the immense suffering of Palestinian civilians, has made joining the accords a much harder sell for Arab nations. Saudi officials have insisted recently that they would be unable to recognize Israel without the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel insists that it will never cede East Jerusalem, which it seized in the 1967 war and formally annexed in 1980. Even if the war in Gaza ends permanently, the views of Saudi citizens toward dealing with Israel are overwhelmingly negative . That limits the space that the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has to maneuver for a deal. David E.

The conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, is not scheduled to last long — only two hours — but Egypt’s presidency has portrayed it as offering an “agreement to end the war in Gaza.” Beyond those lofty ambitions, a messier reality lies ahead. When Mr. Trump jets away from the Middle East on Monday, after lightning stops in Israel and Egypt, regional powers will be left to resolve the thornier details — not least whether Hamas will disarm, and whether Israel will fully withdraw from Gaza. Settling those issues will be critical to ensuring that Mr. Trump’s initial peace proposal, presented in September, leads to a sustainable end to the war, which has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians. The war was ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 abducted. “The world finally got something they have long wanted: U.S. buy-in,” said Aziz Alghashian, a lecturer with Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “But how to keep the American weight there, while they try to work out the details, is the harder part. There hasn’t seemed to be any longer-term planning taking place.” Arab diplomats regard this summit as an opportunity to persuade Mr. Trump to understand the concerns of regional countries, who he will rely on to ensure that the cease-fire deal holds. Egypt, for instance, is crucial to carrying out Mr. Trump’s 20-point peace plan, which envisions the reopening of Gaza’s border with Egypt to allow in crucial aid, and an exit for those who seek it. But Egypt does not want a huge influx of refugees across its borders. Egyptian officials have long feared such a mass flight of people, for a number of reasons. For one, they do not want to be accused of helping Israel to displace Palestinians. But domestic security concerns are just as critical. If Hamas militants managed to cross the border with refugees, it could provoke an Israeli attack on Egyptian soil. “The challenges are not really in the first stage of the agreement,” said Aymen Abdel Wahab, deputy director of the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, a think tank in Cairo. “Egypt will see more challenges in the second stage, as it works on the security sector and maintaining the peace.” The Gulf countries will also want to be heard, with bilateral meetings expected on the summit’s sidelines. Those countries are likely to play a leading role in bankrolling the rebuilding of Gaza, but they have been wary of comments made this week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who said that the military campaign in Gaza was “not over.” The Gulf countries fear a situation in which they are effectively funding Gaza’s reconstruction even as Israeli operations continue, said Mr. Alghashian. They have also been focused on getting Mr. Trump to embrace a role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, something that Israel has rejected. The authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and considers itself the rightful government of any future Palestinian state, and Saudi Arabia, in particular, feels it needs an invitation from the authority to support efforts to stabilize or rebuild Gaza. “This is really necessary to elicit support from Arab and Muslim states,” said Mr. Alghashian. “Otherwise it looks like they are funding a new form of occupation — and that is exactly what they don’t want.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/world/europe/egypt-summit-negotiations-gaza-israel.html,World,BBC,By Erika Solomon and Rania Khaled,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13gaza-mideast-summit-wmkt/13gaza-mideast-summit-wmkt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2025-10-13T13:39:18+00:00,7a82d26feaf8022d138491614ca4875e3cf7d4c8

Buses transported Palestinians freed from Israel prisons home to the West Bank. For Israeli and Palestinians alike, it was a moment to breathe a sigh of relief that was long in coming. The cease-fire , which brought the prisoner and hostage exchange, has raised hopes — if cautions ones — that the war might come to an end. In Israel, friends and families of the freed hostages hugged their loved ones, or at least got to hear and see them in phone and video calls. Palestinian mothers reunited with sons once held in Israeli prisons. And thousands of displaced Gaza residents were returning north to Gaza City, though much of it is in ruins.

After all, the researchers restricted their experiment to only off-the-shelf satellite hardware: a $185 satellite dish, a $140 roof mount with a $195 motor, and a $230 tuner card, totaling less than $800. “This was not NSA-level resources. This was DirecTV-user-level resources. The barrier to entry for this sort of attack is extremely low,” says Matt Blaze, a computer scientist and cryptographer at Georgetown University and law professor at Georgetown Law. “By the week after next, we will have hundreds or perhaps thousands of people, many of whom won’t tell us what they’re doing, replicating this work and seeing what they can find up there in the sky.” One of the only barriers to replicating their work, the researchers say, would likely be the hundreds of hours they spent on the roof adjusting their satellite. As for the in-depth, highly technical analysis of obscure data protocols they obtained, that may now be easier to replicate, too: The researchers are releasing their own open-source software tool for interpreting satellite data, also titled “Don’t Look Up,” on Github. The researchers’ work may, they acknowledge, enable others with less benevolent intentions to pull the same highly sensitive data from space. But they argue it will also push more of the owners of that satellite communications data to encrypt that data, to protect themselves and their customers. “As long as we’re on the side of finding things that are insecure and securing them, we feel very good about it,” says Schulman. There’s little doubt, they say, that intelligence agencies with vastly superior satellite receiver hardware have been analyzing the same unencrypted data for years. In fact, they point out that the US National Security Agency warned in a 2022 security advisory about the lack of encryption for satellite communications. At the same time, they assume that the NSA—and every other intelligence agency from Russia to China—has set up satellite dishes around the world to exploit that same lack of protection. (The NSA did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment). “If they aren't already doing this,” jokes UCSD cryptography professor Nadia Heninger, who co-led the study, “then where are my tax dollars going?” Heninger compares their study’s revelation—the sheer scale of the unprotected satellite data available for the taking—to some of the revelations of Edward Snowden that showed how the NSA and Britain’s GCHQ were obtaining telecom and internet data on an enormous scale, often by secretly tapping directly into communications infrastructure. “The threat model that everybody had in mind was that we need to be encrypting everything, because there are governments that are tapping undersea fiber optic cables or coercing telecom companies into letting them have access to the data,” Heninger says. “And now what we're seeing is, this same kind of data is just being broadcast to a large fraction of the planet.”",https://www.wired.com/story/satellites-are-leaking-the-worlds-secrets-calls-texts-military-and-corporate-data,Technology,BBC,Andy Greenberg,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e961a8dc203222538eb046/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/security_satellites_leak_data.jpg",2025-10-14T01:00:00+00:00,0a6ed9ce64198d0de4450d23e2d8c9412bd856e1
8009715800da,Our Favorite Computer Monitor Is $75 Off,"deals, shopping, pcs, monitors, dell","If you're tired of staring a tiny laptop screen while working from home, consider scooping up our favorite desktop monitor for almost 25 percent off its normal price. The Dell 27 Plus 4K (8/10, WIRED Reivew) is currently marked down to just $228 on Amazon , the lowest we've seen yet for this smart and practical 4K screen. Dell 27 Plus 4K Monitor (S2725QS) You might be worried about poor panel quality or scarce features, considering the price point, but the Dell S2725QS is surprisingly well equipped for under $300. It has an IPS panel, which is one of the better non-OLED options, with thin bezels and a minimal stand that will fit right into any desk setup. It has 100 percent sRGB coverage, and 79 percent AdobeRGB, with good color accuracy to match, making it a nice choice for light creative work as well. It also has a 120-Hz refresh rate, so while you may want to consider a dedicated screen for gaming, you can certainly jam some weekend Fortnite rounds. AMD FreeSync Premium will help keep things smooth, since reaching frame rates that high will be tough for most systems. You might find that even scrolling the web is much better with a higher refresh rate, though. I know I have trouble going back to 60 Hz. Although it's a little short on ports, lacking any USB in particular, it is VESA compatible if you want to mount it or put it on a stand. It has internal speakers too, and our reviewer, Luke Larsen, was impressed with how they stack up against most built-in monitor speakers. That's not too tough considering they can often be thin and tinny, but it's a nice benefit for anyone lacking the desk space for a nicer, dedicated option. Overall, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is an excellent value, which makes it easy to overlook some of the smaller inconveniences. If you want to spend more for something nicer, make sure to check out the full roundup of our favorite desktop monitors , but most people just looking for a second screen for their work laptop will be exceedingly happy with this Dell.",https://www.wired.com/story/dell-27-plus-deal-1025,Technology,BBC,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed359505c586ea21db5bed/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Save%20Almost%20$75%20on%20our%20Favorite%20Computer%20Monitor.png",2025-10-13T20:35:08.255000+00:00,11b3edaa54ddfdb8c070ca4890fca641073be8c4
d4f78cb22d7f,Our Favorite Smart Displays for Controlling Your Home,"buying guides, shopping, alexa, google, assistant, smart home","Comparing Our Favorite Smart Displays More Smart Displays We Like Echo Hub for $180 : The Echo Hub isn't exactly a smart display. It lacks powerful speaker capabilities and doesn't have a camera for calls or Amazon's Drop-In video call feature. Instead, it focuses entirely on being a smart home dashboard with built-in Alexa, plus features like widgets and the photo frame. I think it takes the best, most easily used features of a smart display and cuts out the rest. But if you want a good speaker, don't choose this one. Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023) for $90 : The smaller and cheaper third-gen Echo Show 5 has a 5.5-inch screen that works best on a desk or a bedside table. We think it's a bit too small for the kitchen or living room, but that depends on how you plan to use it. Echo Show 15 for $300 : This is the largest of them all, with a 15.6-inch display, and it has customizable widgets so you can have smart-home device controls and calendar reminders available whenever. It's made to be mounted on your wall like a TV (a stand is sold separately), and the Show 15 pairs with a Fire TV remote (you can use the app) to use the streaming features. With the new Alexa+ I've found myself liking it a lot more, and it's much less distracting than the rotating slideshows you get on smaller Echo Shows. It's a splurge, though, and I still wish the streaming capabilities were better. Google Nest Hub for $100 : Google’s second-gen Nest Hub is a great option if you don't need a camera and don’t mind a smaller 7-inch screen. It has a wake-up alarm that emulates the rising sun for gentler mornings, though it's not bright enough to qualify as a sunrise alarm clock. It also has sleep-tracking tech to track your sleep quality, though the quality of the results isn't great. It also supports gestures—like playing or pausing a video with a hand movement —by using unique radar tech . Google Pixel Tablet for $499 : This tablet doubles as a smart speaker when placed on its speaker dock. It works well, but it's not currently slated to get Google's new assistant, Gemini for Home. If that changes, we'll go back to recommending it. But we're not sure it will: availability has been limited for the speaker base, and could point to this device being discontinued altogether. Smart Displays to Skip We don't like every smart display. Here are the ones we're skipping after trying them out. Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen, 2021) for $250 : This smart display is situated on top of a large cylindrical speaker, which makes it sound great. The screen physically swivels to follow you around the room as you use it, keeping you in frame while you video chat or keeping your streamed workout video in your line of sight as you move about. Because the screen moves around so much, you may have trouble positioning it in tighter spaces—especially in corners. It's a unique model, and is still out of stock like it was this summer. I suspect the upcoming new Echo Show 11 ($220) might replace it, since it has a similar design (but leaves out the movement gimmick). Third-Party Google Displays: Google is no longer updating software for some of the third-party smart displays we used to recommend in this guide. If you have one, it will still work, but some features will likely suffer or disappear entirely as time passes. This seems to be the fate of most third-party Google smart displays, which is why we don't recommend them anymore. Google did say they'll be working with partners to bring Gemini for Home to third-party devices, so we'll see how that pans out. What About Alexa+ and the New Echo Shows? Amazon has been randomly rolling out its new version of Alexa, named Alexa+ , in early access since the spring. This second generation of the Alexa voice assistant is more conversational, able to execute complex tasks and learn new information, and can be much more personalized. That'll be due to its being powered by generative AI. Check out our hands-on with early access Alexa+ for more more about our experience. Unlike the current Alexa, once it's fully available, it'll cost $20 a month or be free if you have an Amazon Prime membership. This is a big jump from the free assistant, but you can keep the current Alexa for free if you don't wish for another subscription or have an Amazon Prime membership. Right now, it's also only available in early access for Echo Show devices. You can sign up here for the wait list. Alexa+ will be immediately available on its newest devices coming this fall, however. There will be two new smart displays, the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11 , and two new smart speakers, the Echo Dot Max and Echo Studio (2nd Gen) . We're curious how the new models will compare to our current favorites, and we will update this guide once we test them. It's also important to note that Alexa+ has forced a privacy change for all Echo devices. Echo devices used to be able to process voice recordings locally on your device, but the “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” privacy feature was killed in March. Now all voice recordings will be sent to Amazon to be processed in order to make Alexa+ function, but even if you don't end up using Alexa+, the feature is gone. What About Gemini for Home and Google’s Smart Displays? Amazon isn't the only one rolling out a new version of its assistant. Gemini for Home is Google's similarly AI-powered smart assistant that will replace Google Assistant in just about all of its available speakers. Unlike Amazon's new assistant, Gemini for Home will be free, but Google is changing its Nest Aware subscription to become a subscription that's both for video storage and for more powerful assistant features. Google is also rolling out a new speaker in the spring, but no new smart display is slated yet. The new assistant will come to all of Google's existing lineup except for the Google Pixel Tablet, which we no longer recommend since it's not currently planned to get support with the new assistant. Google did say they plan to work with third-party partners to bring Gemini for Home to more devices, so we might see new third-party displays that we can recommend again. We'll update this guide as we learn more, but for now, Google's Nest Hub Max and Nest Hub are the best smart displays to purchase if you want access to Google's new assistant. FAQs Do You Need a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton Smart displays are helpful, acting as hubs for your smart home devices, walking you through recipes while you chop away in the kitchen, and in some cases allowing you to video chat hands-free too. But we're not sure how long they'll be worth it, or even exist, in their current form. Companies have been experimenting and doing away with smart displays again and again; Meta discontinued its Portal devices, Google might be discontinuing the Pixel Tablet we favored, and Apple still has yet to even make a smart display. Amazon has continued to make new smart displays, even after losing $10 billion in 2022 thanks to failures around the Alexa voice assistant. The Alexa team was reportedly hit hard by layoffs in 2022 and 2023, but new smart displays continued to come out since then and more are slated to come out later this fall: the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11. The future of these smart home devices isn't clear right now , but if you're going to get one, we suggest sticking with devices directly from the brand whose voice assistant you prefer. Otherwise, consider one of our favorite tablets instead. Does Apple Have a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton So far, Apple has yet to launch its own dedicated smart display. Apple iPhones have a StandBy Mode included in iOS that activates when an iPhone is on its side and charging, using stands like this one from Twelve South . I had hoped this feature would feel similar to a smart display , but StandBy Mode is limited to customizable clock faces, showing your photos, and having your texts pop up in large text that fills the screen. It doesn't scratch the itch of all the features you get in a smart display and instead feels like a fancy alarm clock . What About Digital Calendars? AccordionItemContainerButton There’s a growing market of digital calendars that look a bit like smart displays, but instead of being able to respond to voice commands and stream a video call, these digital screens are designed to have one shared calendar for the entire family to see and view. Skylight, a maker of one of our favorite digital photo frames, makes the Skylight Calendar (starting at $170) that comes in 10 inches, 15 inches, and 27 inches, while I tested the Hearth Display ($699) that comes exclusively in a 27-inch size. Cozyla also makes the Cozyla Calendar+ that starts at 15 inches but goes all the way up to a 36-inch screen. There are some differences in these calendars, but you'll find a similar roadblock to them: memberships. Hearth Display encourages using the display to create routines with your family, specifically kids, though you'll want a kid older than my 2-year-old to use it properly (though the Hearth does have icons designed for kids who can't read yet), and to sign up for the Family Membership. The Skylight touts a photo screensaver and meal planning tools if you sign up for the monthly Plus Plan. You could find these devices are for you, but it's either another device for one parent to manage or something you'll have to teach your entire family to make into a habit to really get the most out of. You're likely better off just teaching everyone in your family to share their Google Calendar. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

fbc5cabf758a,Polanco keeps rolling as Mariners take both games in Toronto,,"Oct 13, 2025, 08:48 PM ET TORONTO -- Julio Rodriguez and Jorge Polanco hit three-run homers, Josh Naylor added a two-run drive and the Seattle Mariners took a 2-0 AL Championship Series lead by routing the Toronto Blue Jays 10-3 on Monday. Seattle, the only big league team never make a World Series, headed home for Wednesday's Game 3 needing two more wins in the best-of-seven series to end that drought. Toronto had just six hits, only one after the second inning, and had eight hits in the first two games. Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr . was 0 for 3 with a walk and is hitless in the series. Rodriguez homered for a 3-0 lead three batters in against rookie Trey Yesavage , a 22-year-old making just his fifth big league start. Nathan Lukes and Alejandro Kirk had RBI singles in the bottom half off Logan Gilbert , and Lukes' run-scoring single tied the score in the second. Polanco's three-run homer off Louis Varland put Seattle back ahead 6-3 in the fifth. J.P Crawford added an RBI single in the sixth and Naylor had a two-run homer in the seventh against Braydon Fisher . Six of Polanco's first seven hits this postseason drove in runs. He had the game-ending single in the 15th inning of Friday's Division Series clincher against Detroit and went 2 for 4 with two RBIs in Seattle's 3-1 opening ALCS win. Polanco's two previous home runs this October both came off Detroit's Tarik Skubal , the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner. The roof was open on a breezy 62-degree day on the Canadian Thanksgiving holiday, but the sellout crowd of 44,814 had little to celebrate. Seattle's bullpen has combined for nine scoreless innings in the series, allowing just one hit. Winner Eduard Bazardo , Carlos Vargas and Emerson Hancock each pitched two innings. Naylor, born in Mississauga, Ontario, fouled a ball his right foot in the first inning and looked uncomfortable in the batter's box in the fifth, prompting manager Dan Wilson to come out and check on him. With Miles Mastrobuoni getting ready to come into the game if needed, Naylor convinced Wilson to leave him in and homered in the seventh. Yesavage, who took the loss, gave up three runs and four hits in four-plus innings. He set a Blue Jays postseason record by striking out 11 Yankees in 5 ⅓ hitless innings in ALDS Game 2 but had just two swings and misses on his splitter, down from 11 against New York. Blue Jays outfielder Anthony Santander was scratched from the lineup because of a sore lower back. Davis Schneider replaced him and went 0 for 3 with a walk.

""Your aggressive, non-football act was entirely unwarranted, posed a serious risk of injury, and clearly violated the standards of conduct and sportsmanship expected of NFL players,"" NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan wrote in a letter to Branch. ""Your conduct reflected poorly on the NFL and has no place in our game."" Branch plans to appeal the suspension, a source confirmed to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The appeal would be heard by a hearing officer jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association. Branch is set to miss the Lions' game next Monday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and will be eligible to return to the active roster the following day. After Detroit's 30-17 loss at Kansas City on Sunday night, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes tried to give Branch a high-five as they met near midfield. Branch walked past Mahomes, and Smith-Schuster took umbrage with the move, walking up to Branch and having a few words with him. Branch responded by striking Smith-Schuster in his facemask, sending him to the ground. Smith-Schuster leaped to his feet and went after Branch. Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco tried to get between them, but Branch succeeded in ripping off Smith-Schuster's helmet as dozens of players from both teams converged on the scrum. Eventually, coaches and players separated the parties, and they finally left the field for the locker room. ""It was a childish thing, but I'm tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don't catch it,"" Branch said after the game. ""They be trying to bully me out there. I should have never did it. It was childish."" Branch also was fined $23,186 for facemask and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties against the Green Bay Packers last month. Branch's plan to appeal the suspension was first reported by NFL Network.

Callahan finishes with a 4-19 record as the Titans' coach, including 1-5 this season with 2025 first overall pick Cam Ward as the team's starting quarterback. ""After extended conversations with our owner and general manager, we met with Brian Callahan this morning to tell him we are making a change at head coach,"" president of football operations Chad Brinker said in a statement. ""These decisions are never easy, and they become more difficult when they involve people of great character.

Our players, fans, and community deserve a football team that achieves a standard we are not currently meeting, and we are committed to making the hard decisions necessary to reach and maintain that standard."" Senior offensive assistant Mike McCoy will take over as interim coach, the team announced. McCoy previously was the head coach of the San Diego Chargers from 2013 to 2016. He had a 27-37 record, making the playoffs in his first season. The Titans were 3-14 in Callahan's first season, finishing with the No. 1 pick and selecting Ward. With Callahan's firing, the past four quarterbacks drafted No. 1 overall and six of the past eight have seen their head coaches fired during their rookie seasons, according to ESPN Research. Only Ken Whisenhunt (3-20) had a worse record as a head coach in Titans/Houston Oilers franchise history. The Titans' offense has scored only 83 points through six games this season, which is the franchise's fewest through six games since 1985, according to ESPN Research. The frustration boiled over in Week 3 at Nissan Stadium during a 41-20 loss to the Indianapolis Colts . Fans booed the Titans as they went into the locker room at halftime and chanted ""Fire Callahan"" at various times during the game. Callahan turned playcalling duties over to quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree last month. But Callahan's seat got even hotter after a 26-0 loss to the AFC South division rival Houston Texans in a battle of winless teams in Week 4. The Titans failed to reach the red zone, and Ward vented his frustration after the game, saying, ""If we keeping it a buck right now, we're ass."" Callahan notched his first win of the season last week with a 22-21 win over the Cardinals in which Arizona blew a 21-3 lead. However, a frustrating 20-10 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday sealed his fate. It was the Titans' fourth loss by at least 10 points this season, the most by any team. The Titans hired Callahan in 2023 after controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk fired former coach Mike Vrabel, who led the team to two AFC South division titles. Vrabel returns to Nissan Stadium this Sunday for a showdown between the Titans and the New England Patriots .

345e055818a9,NBA,,"Bobby Marks Baxter Holmes Close Baxter Holmes ESPN Senior Writer Baxter Holmes ( @Baxter ) is a senior writer for ESPN Digital and Print, focusing on the NBA. He has covered the Lakers, the Celtics and previously worked for The Boston Globe and Los Angeles Times. Oct 13, 2025, 02:39 PM ET The NBA vetted and approved a $300 million sponsorship deal between the LA Clippers and Aspiration in 2021, months before the green banking company signed a separate deal with star Kawhi Leonard that has triggered a salary cap-circumvention investigation by the league, multiple sources told ESPN. Two sources with direct knowledge of the arrangement said the Clippers submitted the 23-year agreement to the NBA for approval before it was announced in September 2021, as required under league rules because it contained a jersey patch component, the sources said. The agreement also included signage in the team's yet-to-be-completed arena in Inglewood, the sources said. In April 2022, Aspiration reportedly signed a separate, $28 million sponsorship deal with Leonard that was not subject to NBA review, per the league's collective bargaining agreement. The NBA is investigating whether the Clippers and owner Steve Ballmer violated league rules by circumventing the salary cap to compensate Leonard. Following reports of the allegations, NBA commissioner Adam Silver initially said he had ""never heard of the company Aspiration before,"" then later revised his comments to say he was ""aware of the brand."" The NBA does not require teams to submit all sponsorship agreements for review. But some types of sponsorships, including jersey patches and signage that is viewable on television broadcasts, are subject to heightened rules or approval by the league. Sponsorships with companies tied to cannabis, gaming and energy drinks are also subject to league review. ""Teams vet their own sponsorship partners and negotiate their own sponsorship agreements,"" NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said in a statement to ESPN. ""Given the jersey patch's inclusion on player jerseys and its level of exposure across game telecasts, the league reviews and approves jersey patch arrangements pursuant to league rules that are intended to avoid potential brand issues or conflicts with league partnerships."" A Clippers spokesperson referred questions about the league's process to the NBA. A sponsorship deal for a team's jersey patch requires explicit approval of the NBA, according to official league documents obtained by ESPN. The 2021-22 league operations manual specifies that a team ""must notify, and obtain the approval of, the NBA"" before entering into such an arrangement and that ""a team cannot announce any Patch arrangement unless the applicable Patch Sponsorship Agreement, Jersey Patch and announcement have been approved in advance by the NBA."" The manual devotes roughly four pages to policies regarding patch sponsorship arrangements. It states that teams must submit such terms to the NBA in advance of any announcement. The manual even dictates a patch's size and location on the uniform, stating, ""The dimensions of the Jersey Patch may be adjusted slightly, as approved by the NBA."" The manual also specifies provisions that must be included in a contract between a team and patch sponsor. One of those provisions states that the league or the team can terminate the deal if the sponsor ""becomes involved in any controversy or scandal that has or may have a negative effect on the business, reputation or the public's perception of [the team] or the NBA."" In September 2021, the same month that the Clippers announced their deal with Aspiration , Ballmer invested $50 million in the California-based company, according to podcaster and journalist Pablo Torre. In April 2022, Aspiration reached a four-year, $28 million endorsement deal with Leonard, an agreement that an unnamed employee who purportedly worked for the banking company told Torre ""was to circumvent the salary cap."" In an interview with ESPN , Ballmer denied that he had knowledge of the endorsement contract that Aspiration eventually signed with Leonard or that he directed the company to do so. NBA rules do not prohibit teams from introducing team sponsors or companies to players, but teams aren't allowed to be involved in subsequent negotiations. Per the collective bargaining agreement, the league does not review sponsorship deals with players. The Aspiration logo was scheduled to be on the Clippers' jerseys at the start of the 2023-24 season after the team's deal with Honey expired, but it didn't appear. In January 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Aspiration was the subject of a Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation into whether the company misled customers. At the time, the Clippers told Bloomberg that the team had terminated its sponsorship agreement with Aspiration ""last season."" Aspiration filed for bankruptcy this March with a reported debt of $170 million. The company said at the time that it owed the Clippers $30 million, the most of all its creditors. In August, Aspiration co-founder Joe Sanberg pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors said Sanberg defrauded investors and lenders out of $248 million by fraudulently obtaining loans, falsifying bank and brokerage statements, and concealing that he was the source of some revenue booked by the company. Ballmer told ESPN that he had been reviewing his interaction with Aspiration as part of his and the team's cooperation with the DOJ investigation into the company. ""These were guys who committed fraud,"" he said. ""Look, they conned me. They conned me. I made an investment in these guys thinking it was on the up-and-up, and they conned me at this stage."" Multiple sources familiar with the league's sponsorship-vetting process said the review centers on the credibility of the company and its ability to deliver on its financial commitments. It's unclear whether the league conducted any further reviews of the Clippers-Aspiration agreement after approving the initial deal. The league has hired law firm Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz to investigate whether the Clippers circumvented salary cap rules. People familiar with the process suggested the probe could take months, perhaps not concluding until after the 2026 NBA playoffs. But those same people also noted that, per the terms of the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, Silver is not solely responsible for deciding whether the Clippers will be punished, depending on the findings. Rather, Wachtell Lipton will present its findings to the league office, and Silver will have to decide, based on those findings -- or lack thereof -- whether to bring any potential evidence to a neutral arbitrator appointed by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, the people said. The arbitrator would then examine what Silver brought forth and decide the next step. The arbitrator could either grant Silver the authority to punish the Clippers or decide that there isn't enough evidence to merit any discipline and deny him the ability to levy penalties against the team. ""The burden is on the league if we're going to discipline a team, an owner, a player or any constituent members of the league,"" Silver told reporters following the league's board of governors meetings in Midtown Manhattan in mid-September. ""I think as with any process that requires a fundamental sense of fairness, the burden should be on the party that is, in essence, bringing those charges.""",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46584143/sources-nba-approved-clippers-sponsorship-deal-aspiration-2021,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559685_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,9848bbb902061c46eb7a290b4cc4a43391ab14fa
e17e9c0daca2,Dolphins' McDaniel: Tagovailoa picked wrong forum for comments,,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said that quarterback Tua Tagovailoa 's comments after Sunday's game were ""misguided"" and that his postgame news conference was ""not the forum"" to air his concerns. Speaking in the minutes following Miami's 29-27 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers , Tagovailoa was asked how players will refrain from feeling sorry for themselves moving forward. He responded that the solution starts with the team's player leadership before revealing that some teammates were late for players-only meetings. McDaniel was asked about Tagovailoa's comments a few minutes later and said the quarterback was ""sending a message,"" but the coach had a more detailed reaction Monday after actually hearing what the quarterback said. ""You guys caught me before I heard them [yesterday],"" McDaniel said. ""I think regardless of intent and what was on Tua's mind after a loss, as the franchise quarterback, that's not the forum to displace that. I think he knows that. Now, I do honestly believe there was no ill intention, but you're talking about, I think, a misguided representation of player-orchestrated film sessions. ""The bottom line is no one's going to be happy and [people] always are looking for reasons for failure to succeed. So you're trying to look for reasons that you can attribute to losses, and heavy is the crown of being a franchise quarterback."" McDaniel said Tagovailoa has ""directly communicated"" with his teammates since Sunday night and will ""live and learn"" from the experience. Dolphins offensive linemen Aaron Brewer and Patrick Paul both declined to comment on what Tagovailoa said, adding that team matters should remain ""in-house."" McDaniel noted that Tagovailoa's comments pertained only to players-only meetings. Though tardiness and attendance at team-mandated meetings was an issue in previous seasons, McDaniel said that has not been the case this year. He added that he doesn't believe it will spiral into a larger issue; at 1-5, the Dolphins' focus needs to remain on their game Sunday against the Cleveland Browns . ""I've got a lot of things to worry about and one of them is not those comments and where our team is lying after that,"" McDaniel said. ""We've just had meetings about the [Chargers] game itself, the factual successes and failures that led to the ultimate result, and that's where people's focus needs to be. ""We are all very motivated to fix our problems and find a way to win.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46585082/dolphins-mcdaniel-tagovailoa-picked-wrong-forum-comments,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559721_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e9017667c21f21efd03b64378ffe82d2f5e7a2ae
02cd359dec8f,NCAAF,,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- After a week of chaos surrounding the North Carolina football program and Bill Belichick's future in Chapel Hill, the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach denied rumors he was looking for an exit and doubled down on his belief that his ""process"" eventually will lead to a winning team. ""Reports about my looking for a buyout or trying to leave here is categorically false,"" Belichick said. ""There's zero truth to any of that. I'm glad I'm here. We're working toward our goals. We believe very much in the process. We need to just keep working and grinding away, and that's exactly what we're doing."" Belichick said there were ""things we could've done better"" but widely praised embattled general manager Michael Lombardi as having ""done a good job,"" reiterated that the timing of his hire put North Carolina behind other schools in terms of talent acquisition, and said that, regardless of the on-field results for the 2-3 team, UNC has made major strides in its performance. ""It's a learning curve,"" Belichick said. ""We're all in it together. But we're making a lot of progress, and the process will eventually produce the results we want like they have everywhere else I've been."" Belichick's Monday media session was attended by university chancellor Lee Roberts, athletics director Bubba Cunningham and a host of other high-level administrators, as well as Lombardi -- something unique for a midseason news conference. Cunningham said the school continues to support Belichick's vision for the program, but he admitted the disappointing results have led to a lot of frustration. ""There's a steeper learning curve than we all anticipated,"" Cunningham said. ""The gap between expectations and performance is more severe than what we expected, and that's what creates a lot of attention."" Two weeks ago, Lombardi sent a letter to donors preaching patience during a ""rebuilding"" process, a terminology several players pushed back on. ""It's Coach Belichick's first year, so I'm not surprised he's wanting to rebuild it,"" Boise State transfer Andrew Simpson said. ""Wanting to grow and be better, that's what I focus on. Just because it's a rebuild doesn't mean we can't win games now. We have seven more games, and that's what I focus on."" Belichick downplayed any concerns about the on-field results, saying he doesn't ""have expectations other than achieving what we want to achieve every day"" and reiterating he has the support of the administration. Reports of internal strife in the locker room were also dismissed by Belichick and multiple players made available to the media Monday, with Belichick saying Lombardi, in particular, maintains close conversations with players. Among other controversies last week, Belichick refused to comment on the suspension of assistant coach Armond Hawkins for recruiting violations, but he said a planned Hulu documentary, which had reportedly been scrapped amid the team's bad start, would still happen in some form. ""It's still a work in progress, and we're working through a few logistics,"" Belichick said. ""But there will be something."" North Carolina is coming off its second open date in the past three weeks and heads to Cal for the team's first ACC road trip Friday. Belichick said he expects an improved performance with the additional week of practice time, despite a woeful defeat against Clemson following the last open date. ""Everybody's most interested in the final score, and I'm at the top of that list,"" he said. ""But it's a process. You build a culture, you build a program, and eventually the results will come. When will that happen? Hopefully as soon as possible.

b7ed7f6991f6,Tomlin on Browns trading Flacco to Bengals: 'Doesn't make sense',,"PITTSBURGH -- In an unusual move, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin openly questioned the Cleveland Browns and general manager Andrew Berry for the decision to execute a midseason trade sending quarterback Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals . ""To be honest, it was shocking to me,"" Tomlin said Monday. ""Andrew Berry must be a lot smarter than me or us because it doesn't make sense to me to trade a quarterback that you think enough of to make your opening-day starter to a division opponent that's hurting in that area, but that's just my personal feelings."" Tomlin doesn't often question or criticize other teams or their personnel in his news conferences, making his response to a question about Flacco's trade surprising. Tomlin's comments come a day after the Steelers (4-1) beat the Browns and rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel 23-9 and just three days before facing the Bengals in a primetime game in Cincinnati on Thursday night. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said Monday that it was ""shocking"" to him that the Browns would trade Joe Flacco to the AFC North rival Bengals. Larry Radloff/Icon Sportswire The Browns traded the 40-year-old Flacco, who started the first four games of the season for Cleveland after signing a one-year contract as a free agent in the offseason, and a 2026 sixth-round pick to Cincinnati for a 2026 fifth-round pick on Oct. 7. The Browns were left with a pair of rookies at quarterback in Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders . The Bengals added Flacco to take over for Jake Browning , who struggled with six touchdowns to eight interceptions since taking over for Joe Burrow following Burrow's Week 2 turf toe injury. Although Tomlin questioned the trade from Cleveland's perspective, when asked if Flacco fits with what Bengals coach Zac Taylor wants to on offense, the Steelers coach acknowledged it was a good move by Cincinnati. ""It certainly made sense from Cincinnati's perspective,"" Tomlin said. ""... He can throw the football, and he's always been able to throw the football -- arm strength, arm accuracy, anticipatory passer, fluid movement through progressions. That's always been his game."" Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said he had no comment when asked Monday about Tomlin's comments. Not everyone in Pittsburgh was stunned by the trade. ""I'm being honest, I wasn't surprised about the Flacco move,"" Brown-turned-Steeler Juan Thornhill said after Sunday's win. ""They took him out of there, they benched him, so I felt like it was next man up. They were kind of done with him. I've been over there before. I've seen that picture before. Once they bench you, you're not getting back in there, and I felt like they had an opportunity maybe to get something out of Flacco, so they sent him to Cincinnati. ""I'm excited to play Flacco, man. He's a great guy."" Tomlin most recently faced Flacco last season when the veteran took over for injured Indianapolis Colts starter Anthony Richardson Sr . in the first quarter and went on to beat the Steelers 27-24. Flacco completed 16 of 26 attempts for 168 yards and two touchdowns. In his assessment of veteran quarterback Carson Wentz taking over for the inexperienced J.J. McCarthy ahead of Pittsburgh facing the Minnesota Vikings in Week 4, Tomlin recalled the fits Flacco gave them when he came into the game last season. ""We were in a similar situation a year ago,"" Tomlin said on Sept. 23. ""We were playing in Indianapolis, and I commented to the guys to keep [Anthony] Richardson upright. Don't put [Joe] Flacco in the game, and Flacco ended up in the game. I think that's oftentimes some of the things that you can run into when you run into a veteran guy, at least from a short-term perspective."" On Monday, Tomlin was complimentary of Flacco following his first outing as a Bengal where he threw for 219 yards and two touchdowns and no interceptions in the 27-18 loss to the Green Bay Packers . That game marked the first time in five starts this season Flacco threw multiple touchdowns and didn't have an interception. Flacco posted a season-best QBR of 68.6 in the loss, significantly higher than his 13.9 against the Detroit Lions in Week 4 and 29.8 in his first game against the Packers as a member of the Browns in Week 3. ""On the offensive side, the story is Joe Flacco, and it is reasonable to expect him to be significantly better in Week 2 [as a Bengal],"" Tomlin said. ""... I would imagine they worked hard a week ago on developing timing and cohesion. I'd imagine it's taken a significant step after having done so under some live football circumstances. I saw him make some anticipatory throws even last week, and so I thought he was significantly better as the game wore on. ""Certainly, we got a full week's work ahead of us in terms of minimizing a veteran savvy, talented thrower like him coupled with the eligibles that they have, and so that certainly has our attention."" Asked about the challenge of preparing to play two games in short succession as a starting quarterback for a new team in midseason, Tomlin again complimented Flacco. ""Doesn't appear to be hard for Joe Flacco,"" he said. Flacco is 10-11 as a starter against Tomlin with a 59.3 QBR and has completed 61% of his passes with 25 passing touchdowns to 12 interceptions. according to ESPN Research. As a starter, he's also been sacked 56 times by Tomlin's defenses.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46583801/tomlin-browns-trading-flacco-bengals-make-sense,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559649_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,4c05532a96d59e13e56e07e19e404816c907f502

2f2e5db2af9d,Titans fire coach Brian Callahan: What's next for Tennessee?,,"Oct 13, 2025, 03:58 PM ET NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- When the Tennessee Titans hired Brian Callahan to be their coach last year, there was a belief that he would help modernize the offense and turn the franchise around, but that didn't happen, and on Monday, Tennessee fired Callahan six games into the season. The Titans hired the former Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator in January 2024 in hopes of history repeating itself with his track record with quarterbacks. Callahan worked with the likes of Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, Matthew Stafford , Derek Carr and, most recently, Joe Burrow . Stafford, Manning and Burrow all led their teams to Super Bowls, with Manning and Stafford taking home Vince Lombardi Trophies. Callahan finished with a 3-14 record in his first season with second-year quarterback Will Levis -- who passed for 2,091 yards to go along with 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in an injury-plagued first year as the Day 1 starter. The coach was brought in before the 2024 season to help develop Levis, but that fell short. As a result, the Titans were awarded the No. 1 pick and drafted current starter Cam Ward , but even that got off to a rocky start. After going 0-4, the Titans got their first win this season -- an improbable 22-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals . But that seemed to have bought Callahan only an extra week. After a 4-19 record with Tennessee, that hope has fizzled. Now the Titans are once again in search of their next coach with their previous one, Mike Vrabel, coming to town leading the 4-2 New England Patriots . The Tennessee Titans fired second-year coach Brian Callahan after starting the season with a 1-5 record. David J. Phillip/AP Our experts weighed in on what could be up next for the Titans and what to make of the move: What does this mean for the Titans? The Titans have parted ways with two head coaches and two general managers in four straight seasons. Entering this season, the future looked bright with Ward leading the way after setting the NCAA career touchdown passing record with 156 at Miami. But Ward has gotten off to a slow start, having only completed 55% of his passes for 1,101 passing yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions. Now the organization has to pick up the pieces. General manager Mike Borgonzi and president of football operations Chad Brinker have to find someone who can get things back on track as the franchise is starving for positive momentum leading up to February 2027, when the new stadium is set to open. -- Turron Davenport Why now? The Titans' front office needed to see improvement in Callahan's second season, not necessarily with a wins-and-losses goal in mind but with overall style of play, toughness, discipline and efficiency -- the factors that contribute to winning. The Titans were declining in those areas. That expedited the process. As one team source put it, the ""writing was on the wall"" when Callahan relinquished playcalling duties three weeks into the season. That was considered a troubling sign for some of the coaches, putting them on high alert for potential change as early as Week 5. Defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons , the team's best player, told reporters after Sunday's 20-10 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders that the past week was ""probably one of our worst weeks of practice."" Such words from a star player carry weight. -- Jeremy Fowler How does this affect Ward? Ward has lobbied for stability since training camp. ""You see it with the best quarterbacks out there,"" Ward, 23, said in August. ""I think a lot of guys who have stability in the NFL can succeed long term. That's what we need in Tennessee. We haven't had that in a very long time."" Having a new coach one year into Ward's career is the opposite of stability. Ward will now have to learn a new scheme and establish a connection with the new coach. Ward's development could be stunted if the next coach doesn't find ways to get him in a position to make an impact. Callahan was hired to develop the Titans' next franchise quarterback, and Ward has certainly shown he's capable of being that player. Now, another coach will get a crack at making the development process successful. -- Davenport play 1:03 Who Dan Orlovsky would like to see as next Titans coach Dan Orlovsky lists five coaches who could develop Cam Ward and the Titans following the firing of Brian Callahan. Will the Titans look to move players at the trade deadline? They're obviously in rebuild mode now around a rookie quarterback and could always use more draft picks. So if the offers are right, the Titans could absolutely consider moving on from guys who aren't part of their future. Players who could interest teams include 35-year-old guard Kevin Zeitler and 33-year-old wide receiver Tyler Lockett , who are both on one-year contracts. Edge rusher Dre'Mont Jones isn't signed beyond this season, and neither is cornerback Roger McCreary , who was a second-round pick in 2022 -- which now feels like three or four Titans administrations ago. Keep an eye on all those guys as we near the Nov. 4 trade deadline. -- Dan Graziano How attractive will this job be in the winter? The Titans job has selling points. Many evaluators are high on Ward despite his sluggish start. Brinker and Borgonzi want to build through the draft, which requires patience. They likely will show more of that with the next coach, since both will have a heavy influence on the hiring. Tennessee plays in a thriving city (Nashville), and the AFC South has been among the league's weaker divisions in past years. But the rampant turnover under owner Amy Adams Strunk since December 2022 could dissuade some candidates. The next coach would be prudent to ask hard questions about how Tennessee plans to shed the dysfunction label. -- Fowler What could the Titans do in the draft with another top pick? The Titans are projected to pick No. 2 by ESPN's Football Power Index , and they have to look at building an offense around Ward. The scheme needs to change, and that will come with a new coach, but what Ward really needs is dependable playmakers and much better protection. The wide receiver class doesn't have an elite top-5 type, but it has a good mix of players that I call ""professional route runners"" -- guys like Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State), Germie Bernard (Alabama) and even Carnell Tate (Ohio State). Protecting Ward is going to be just as important, and despite spending heavy draft capital along the offensive line in recent drafts, the Titans still struggle to protect the passer. That's why I like Miami's Francis Mauigoa as an option. He has right tackle experience, but some scouts think he could be an elite guard if he kicks inside. But regardless of whether he plays inside or outside, he would boost a bad offensive line. -- Matt Miller",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46583914/tennessee-titans-fire-brian-callahan-mean-cam-ward,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559663_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e7240c144470a35b46056cc3bd1c65f090add40c
47411488c86a,"WNBA's CBA negotiations: Biggest issues, lockout potential, more",,"Oct 13, 2025, 09:11 AM ET The 2025 season is in the books. A new champion has been crowned. But as the offseason starts, the focus shifts squarely back on collective bargaining negotiations. The current collective bargaining agreement expires on Oct. 31. Both commissioner Cathy Engelbert and the WNBA Players Association (WNBPA) have said their goal is a ""transformational"" CBA, but the two sides reportedly remain far apart in negotiations on the biggest issues. What are those priorities? What happens if a new CBA isn't reached by the deadline? How realistic is a lockout? Here's a run through everything to know. What are the players' biggest priorities? Increased player salaries is a key issue, but the most important is revenue sharing: how it's determined and whether the percentage will be allowed to grow during the course of the CBA instead of a fixed number for the duration of the deal. ""The players are still adamant that we get a percentage of revenue that grows with the business, which perhaps includes team revenue, and that's just a part of the conversation,"" WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike told ESPN in early August. Phoenix Mercury forward Satou Sabally said a recent proposal from the WNBA makes the players feel as if ""we're not part of the growth of the league."" ""If we continued with this CBA, we would, percentage-wise, go down on our [compensation],"" Sabally said last week during the WNBA Finals. In the NBA, fans are used to salary caps for teams being set based on a percentage of what the CBA describes as ""basketball-related income,"" or BRI. By contrast, the WNBA's current CBA defined the cap for each season ahead of time with modest 3% annual raises. A mechanism in the CBA that would increase the cap based on revenue was effectively invalidated by the timing of the deal. Because the current CBA began in 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue targets were set based on the previous campaign (2019) and made cumulative over the life of the deal. The league made no money off ticket sales during the abbreviated 2020 season, played in a bubble on the IMG Academy campus in Bradenton, Florida, and attendance was also limited in 2021 by local restrictions. That made it unrealistic for the targets to be met despite the league's increased attendance over the past two seasons. In August, Ogwumike said an offer from the WNBA dramatically increased the salary cap and maximum base salaries -- the supermax is $249,244 -- but followed the same model as the current CBA. ""It's basically the same system that we exist in right now,"" Ogwumike said. ""They're proposing a system that includes revenue that would grow with the business. When you approach it from the perspective of their response to our proposal, yes, money is more, but ultimately if you look at the growth of the business, the money relative to the percentage of everything is virtually staying the same."" A report Friday from Front Office Sports cited sources estimating a supermax salary around $850,000, with the veteran minimum around $300,000. ""There's a potential lockout. I promise you we aren't going to play until they give us what we deserve."" Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham The players see the astonishing leap in franchise valuations in the past couple of years and question if they are getting their proper share of that growth. The Las Vegas Aces , for example, were purchased for $2 million in 2021 but are now valued at $310 million, and the New York Liberty were purchased for between $10 million and $14 million after being for sale for more than a year and now have an estimated valuation of around $450 million. On its face, that's a reasonable thing to ask. But what about the NBA's claims for years of subsidizing WNBA losses? Will the NBA say the new money is in part backfilling past deficits? Could it prove that? One of the most difficult parts of following the WNBA's labor negotiations all these years has been getting firm numbers from the league's side of things. The players have said they don't always feel like they get that. By the same token, the side we do hear much more from -- during every CBA -- is the players and their union. There has been dramatic change in the WNBA -- and what that indicates for the future -- in a short period of time after many years that seemed stagnant. The popularity of 2024 No. 1 draft pick Caitlin Clark has been an enormous boost for a league that had clearly started to turn the corner toward real growth over the past five years. If that growth continues as expected, it's understandable the players are concerned about how their part of the pie grows, too. ""We're seeing expansion, and the players are just saying, 'Hey, let us have our fair share of that,'"" Ogwumike said. ""Sometimes that means proposing something new that makes sense for the time. Not really new -- new to us, not to other leagues."" Prioritization is another issue that the players agreed to in the 2020 deal that they are expected to push back on more in these negotiations. Since the WNBA's launch, players have been allowed to play in other leagues -- mostly overseas -- even if that meant missing training camp or a few early-season WNBA games. New rules were put in place in the last CBA that required players to prioritize the WNBA. While there are built-in exceptions for younger players and time spent with players' national teams, prioritization has kept some players out of the WNBA for an entire season. Sabally said that players are in so many different situations based on where they are in their careers, how much money they make and if they are returning from injuries that she doesn't think it is beneficial to put restrictions on them playing in other leagues. But it seems unlikely the WNBA owners will completely back away from prioritization. Sabally also said she has talked with athletes in other basketball leagues, in other sports and in other countries about their own labor negotiations. ""It's interesting to hear about the flow of negotiations,"" she said. ""Sometimes you want results right away, but it does take time for both parties to come to the table and really agree on certain things."" What impact does the WNBA's broadcast rights deal have on negotiations? Last year, the league announced an 11-year deal -- which begins in 2026 -- with Disney, Amazon Prime Video and new rights holder NBCUniversal. The deal is valued at about $2.2 billion, a source told ESPN, but future agreements with additional partners could bring the league's overall media deals closer to $3 billion. According to sources, the agreement can be revisited after three years. The players see that money, along with the greatly increased expansion fees, and want to make sure they are getting what they think is a fair cut of it. Under the deal, Disney (using ABC and the ESPN networks) will telecast eight semifinals series and five Finals, while Prime and NBCU each will show seven semifinals and three Finals. WNBA players seem to have lost faith in Cathy Engelbert, who was booed by fans during the WNBA Finals trophy presentation. The support of Adam Silver and WNBA owners could ultimately determine whether she remains commissioner. AP Photo/John Locher How might the recent criticism of Engelbert impact negotiations? Engelbert was loudly booed by fans Friday in Phoenix when she presented the championship trophy to the Aces and the WNBA Finals MVP award to A'ja Wilson . Commissioners hearing fans' wrath in these situations is not new in pro sports -- the NHL's Gary Bettman and MLB's Rob Manfred have experienced the same treatment as recent examples -- but it has raised the issue of how the fractured relationship between Engelbert and the players will affect CBA negotiations. During a four-minute statement to open her exit interview on Sept. 30, Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier said the WNBA had the ""worst leadership in the world ,"" accusing Engelbert of being ""negligent"" in her governance. Collier said the league has failed to sufficiently address issues with officiating, compensation for players and the state of the overall product. She also alleged that Engelbert told her in a private conversation in February that Clark and other young standouts ""should be on their knees"" in gratitude for the platform the league has given them. Three days later, the commissioner said there were ""a lot of inaccuracies"" in Collier's statement and vehemently denied saying the remarks about Clark. ""I did not make those comments,"" Engelbert said Oct. 3 at her annual news conference ahead of Game 1 of the WNBA Finals on Friday. Collier then canceled a meeting she and Engelbert had tentatively planned for the following week, sources told ESPN. Engelbert's assertion that Collier's depiction of the private conversation between them was filled with inaccuracies has ""pretty much pushed the relationship beyond repair,"" a source said. ""Sometimes you want results right away, but it does take time for both parties to come to the table and really agree on certain things."" Phoenix Mercury forward Satou Sabally On Oct. 6, as the Las Vegas Aces had taken a 2-0 lead over the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA Finals, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said a new collective bargaining agreement with WNBA players will be reached but acknowledged relationship issues must be repaired following. ""There's no question that the WNBA is going through growing pains, and it's unfortunate that it's coming just as their most important games and their Finals are on right now,"" Silver said Monday. ""We've had two fantastic games so far, and we want to celebrate the game at the moment, and then we've got to sit down with the players and negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement."" Many WNBA players, including Ogwumike, have said they support Collier, but she didn't inform Ogwumike or the union about her statement before making it. It came at a difficult time for Collier, after she had suffered a season-ending injury in Game 3 of the semifinals, followed by the top-seeded Lynx being upset in the series by Phoenix. Whether the relationship between Engelbert and the players can be repaired would take a good faith effort from both sides, which might be even harder to make happen during CBA negotiations when tensions are always high. Ultimately, the support of Silver and the owners that Engelbert is representing in CBA talks is of utmost importance for her to stay in her position. What happens if a new deal isn't reached by Oct. 31? How realistic is a lockout? Failing to reach agreement by Halloween wouldn't necessarily translate into a lockout. Prior to the 2020 collective bargaining agreement, for example, the two sides extended the term of the previous CBA until they completed negotiations in mid-January on the eve of free agency. A work stoppage would be unprecedented in WNBA history. During exit interviews following the Indiana Fever's playoff elimination earlier this month, guard Sophie Cunningham said it is a possibility.

I promise you we aren't going to play until they give us what we deserve,"" she said. ""That's kind of where it's headed, unfortunately, which would be the dumbest basketball decision, business-wise, ever, considering the momentum the W has."" The WNBA might have more urgency this year because of everything that must be accomplished this offseason. With the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo set to begin play in 2026 (and expansion to 18 teams by 2030), the league will need to hold an expansion draft and the draft lottery. Last year's Golden State Valkyries expansion draft was held Dec. 7, which gave the team time to prepare for free agency and players to promote their inaugural season. Although an offseason lockout would be disruptive, most notably by preventing players from utilizing team facilities to work out -- something that's more of an issue now than in 2020 with multiple teams building dedicated practice facilities that are available to players year-round -- the real concern is missing games. That's not in anyone's best interest. Specifically, owners have more at stake now that franchise valuations have escalated. Most explicitly in 2003, when negotiations on the WNBA's second CBA took until April to complete, players have always had to deal with the possibility that owners could withdraw their support for the league. With fierce competition for expansion teams, the WNBA is no longer at risk of going anywhere. That's increased player resolve to make a deal on their terms -- however long that means. ""I don't think anyone wants to see a lockout,"" Ogwumike told ESPN shortly after the All-Star Game. ""That's not something that we're advocating for. We just want to make sure that this is a deal that's done the right way and using whatever time it takes for us to be able to have both sides agree on something."" Key dates to know Something to watch is how the WNBA adjusts its timeline of key offseason events if the two sides mutually agree to an extension for CBA negotiations. A look at when events were held last offseason leading into the 2025 season: November and December: Expansion draft and draft lottery Last year's draft lottery was held Nov. 17. With Toronto and Portland joining the WNBA for 2026, the league will need to hold an expansion draft for a second consecutive year. In 2024, the WNBA held the Valkyries' expansion draft on Dec. 6. January to March: Unrivaled's second season Unrivaled doesn't have a direct impact on the WNBA, and its stakeholders have said they don't view it as competition for the WNBA. But Unrivaled -- the 3-on-3 league co-founded by Collier and Breanna Stewart -- will be a focal point for women's basketball this offseason. The amenities, quality of play and continued interest level in the league -- which will tip off its second season on Jan. 5, again based in Miami -- will be under a microscope. It will be a hub for free agents, general managers and agents during the offseason. January and February: WNBA free agency A mammoth free agency is expected this offseason as almost every player not currently on a rookie contract will be a free agent for the 2026 season. Earlier this year, WNBA free agency ran from Jan. 11 to Feb. 1: Jan. 11-20: Teams sent qualifying offers to designated players, making them either restricted free agents or core players. Jan. 21: The negotiation period for unrestricted free agents began. During this window, restricted free agents also negotiated with other teams during this time, with the original team having the right to match any offer. Feb. 1: Players officially signed contracts and free agent signings were announced. April: WNBA draft and training camps open The 2025 WNBA draft was held on April 14. WNBA training camps opened on April 27. May: WNBA season opens The 2025 season opened May 16.",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46578464/wnba-2025-collective-bargaining-agreement-cba-negotiations-salaries-rev-shares-lockout-engelbert,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559484_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,56ba2cb20cca90b171bcc77342602811e5bcc80f

edcc79fab003,"NFL hot seats: Mike McDaniel, Justin Fields, John Harbaugh",,"The NFL typically overshadows most other sports stories on Sunday afternoons during the fall, but Penn State's decision to fire coach James Franklin was an exception to that rule. Fifteen days ago, Franklin's Nittany Lions were the No. 3-ranked team in college football. But after three straight losses, the university decided that it was better off paying Franklin a buyout of about $50 million and hiring someone else to run the football program. With UAB coach Trent Dilfer also getting fired on Sunday, the college football hot seat has officially been turned on. The same is true for the NFL, where the vast majority of the league's teams are now six games into the season. It's tougher for a coach, player or executive to treat a slow start or a rough patch of form like it's a temporary concern this far into the season. Subscribe: 'The Bill Barnwell Show' Let's talk today about the NFL hot seat. Should time be up for embattled coaches or overwhelmed quarterbacks? What needs to change for them to turn things around? I'll run through some of the most tenuous positions around the league, starting in Miami, where the players are even arguing in public that they need more leadership. (Update: Brian Callahan was fired by the Titans following their Week 6 loss. The section on him was written before Tennessee's move.) Jump to: McDaniel | Fields | Karty | Ringo Harbaugh | Hubbard Week 6: Lost 29-27 to the Chargers, dropping the Dolphins to 1-5. For a moment there, it looked like the Dolphins might get out alive. Reeling after a 17-point third quarter opened the game up for the Chargers, the Dolphins fought back. De'Von Achane 's second touchdown of the game made it 26-20 with eight minutes to go, and after the Chargers went four-and-out, the Dolphins drove downfield and scored another touchdown with 52 seconds left, taking a 27-26 lead. All McDaniel needed was one stop from his defense to seal up a home victory over a team leading the AFC West. That stop didn't come. On the second play of the ensuing drive, Jaelan Phillips and Chop Robinson immediately beat the right side of the Chargers' line, but Justin Herbert simply refused to go down and found Ladd McConkey on a shallow route. The only Dolphins player in the area was rookie safety Dante Trader Jr ., who couldn't even get close enough to miss a tackle attempt on McConkey. While the Chargers wideout inexplicably finished the play out of bounds, the 44 yards McConkey picked up put the Chargers in field goal range, from which they sealed a 29-27 victory. If the loss felt crushing, what happened after the game might have been even more painful. Tua Tagovailoa criticized the team's leadership for not clearly articulating expectations and added that members of the team have been late or have not shown up at all for players-only meetings. McDaniel noted that those meetings are outside his purview and felt like players were accountable to him, but that seems to be up for debate. ESPN's Marcel Louis-Jacques reported , per one former Dolphins player, that players were regularly late to meetings and practices throughout McDaniel's tenure with the team, only for those concerns to be ignored as the Dolphins won football games. Of course, when it comes to leadership and accountability, it's difficult to ignore what happened in Week 18 a little less than a year ago, when Tyreek Hill refused to enter a game against the Jets and hinted he was open to leaving the team afterward. The Dolphins essentially memory-holed that afternoon, not punishing Hill for what would be regarded as a potential career-ending act for a lesser player. (Note that nobody signed linebacker De'Vondre Campbell this offseason after he refused to enter a game for the 49ers last season.) It's not uncommon for teams to have different rules for star players, but if that situation wasn't going to have any repercussions, why would any of this team's notable players feel any concern about being late to a meeting? Hill's tenure with the team is likely done after the wide receiver sustained a severe knee injury while also facing allegations of domestic abuse , but the problems remain. And while the Dolphins were able to overcome whatever discipline or defensive problems they had in the past by thriving on offense, they haven't been able to put together a complete performance all season. Ironically, this was comfortably the best performance of the season for the much-maligned run game, with Achane running for 128 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries, including a 49-yard scamper in the first quarter. Tagovailoa and the passing game weren't consistent. He threw three picks, though one was bobbled by Jaylen Waddle and another was picked at the beginning of what would likely be an attempted gadget or trick play with five seconds to go. Waddle made a spectacular juggling catch along the sideline for 45 yards, but he seemed to expect a pass over one shoulder and got it over the other. When pressured, Tagovailoa was 1-of-6 for 10 yards and an interception. Herbert was 7-of-13 for 105 yards in those spots, including the game-sealing throw to McConkey. That was the difference in the game. It's difficult to separate McDaniel's imprint on the offense from his players. The Miami offense has actually been a little better than you might think this season, with the Dolphins currently 12th in EPA per play on that side of the ball, just behind the Rams. That's with Hill sidelined for the year and the Dolphins getting one game from right tackle Austin Jackson , who serves as the team's blindside protector for its lefty quarterback. But an offense that used to look like it was ahead of the curve and perennially inventing new concepts for the rest of the league might have grown a bit stale. McDaniel is revered around the league for his run game and play design, but the Dolphins ran for just 19 yards against the Panthers in Week 5. The fury of run-pass options and in-breakers that created so many quick, safe completions for Tagovailoa haven't been as easy to find, and he is averaging 2.7 seconds before his pass attempts, which is the 11th-fastest rate in the league. Tagovailoa got rid of the ball at the fastest rate in the NFL in 2023 (2.36 seconds) and 2024 (2.42 seconds), but those windows aren't open as rapidly anymore. Tagovailoa is having to work harder for worse results. While I put this side of the problem more on general manager Chris Grier than McDaniel, there has been a general mismanagement of the draft picks the Dolphins had to work with after the Laremy Tunsil and Trey Lance deals. The Dolphins traded picks to acquire guys such as Hill, Bradley Chubb and Jalen Ramsey , with only the Hill deal standing out as a success. Miami guaranteed two years of Ramsey's contract as part of his trade , gave him a new deal the following season, and then traded him before that extension even kicked in. Meanwhile, the Dolphins let young cornerstone players such as Robert Hunt , Christian Wilkins and Jevon Holland leave in free agency. They brought in Vic Fangio and then fired the lauded defensive coordinator after one season. While Anthony Weaver has done a solid job since joining Miami, Fangio went to the Eagles and won a Super Bowl, completely turning around Philly's defense along the way. This version of the Dolphins doesn't look great on paper and hasn't played great in reality. The McDaniel case does remind me a little bit of what Baker Mayfield said last week. Asked about how perceptions have changed as he has grown in the league, Mayfield noted that he has always been the same person, but that the narratives surrounding him changed as his play improved and declined. When Mayfield was struggling, he was called cocky and immature, but when he is playing well, those character traits are reframed as positives. He's not wrong. It seems the same thing is happening with McDaniel. He was always an offensive-first coach who was hired because of his ability to get Tagovailoa going after the quarterback's slow start under former coach Brian Flores. That worked. McDaniel is the same guy, but it seems like Dolphins fans have either realized or decided, depending on who you ask, that he's not capable of doing anything more than getting their beloved team to the wild-card round. play 1:13 Why Justin Fields and the Jets should stay on fantasy sidelines Tristan Cockcroft explains why Justin Fields remains a matchup-driven option after his lowest fantasy output of the season. Per ESPN's Football Power Index, Miami's playoff odds fell to 2.0% after the loss, and history would tell us that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross wouldn't look kindly on anything short of a stunning turnaround. Since Ross bought the team in 2008, no Dolphins head coach has made it through four full seasons in the job. Tony Sparano was fired after starting 4-9 in Year 4, while Joe Philbin went down after a 1-3 opening to his fourth season. Adam Gase and Flores were each fired after three seasons in charge. With the reports of a lack of player discipline and visible sections of empty seats at home in Miami, the clock has to be ticking on McDaniel's tenure. The good news? The Dolphins are about to leave town for a two-game road trip with winnable games against the Browns and Falcons . Then again, winnable games against the Jets and Panthers were supposed to get the Dolphins back on track. But after beating the Jets , the Dolphins lost to the Panthers and fell at home to a banged-up Chargers team. It doesn't feel like things are safe for the 42-year-old coach. Week 6: Went 9-of-17 for 45 yards with nine sacks in a 13-11 loss to the Broncos. Minus-10 net passing yards . While Fields threw for 45 yards in London on Sunday, the nine sacks he took at the hands of a brutally efficient Broncos defense set the Jets backward. Leaving his scrambles aside, Fields generated minus-0.4 yards per dropback as a passer. It's the first time any quarterback has generated negative net yards on a day with 20 dropbacks or more since Jay Cutler did it against the Giants in 2010 . The Jets would have been better off spiking the ball 26 times, a move that would have offered more entertainment value than what they actually did on offense. The Jets won't be handed many better opportunities to win a game than what they saw Sunday. Facing a Broncos team that might have been lulled to sleep by Sean Payton telling them stories about his time at quarterback for the Leicester Panthers , the Jets were handed two short fields to start the game thanks to a Denver fumble and a 72-yard kick return. Those drives produced a total of 4 net yards and two field goals. The Jets' defense, which had been the league's worst in a 17-game sample since firing Robert Saleh by both EPA per play and points per drive, held the Broncos to 13 points on 11 meaningful drives. The unit even contributed two points by drawing a safety on a holding call in the end zone. play 1:33 What is the biggest issue with the Eagles' offense? Harry Douglas explains the biggest issues with the Eagles' offense after Philadelphia lost its second straight game. Yet Fields and the offense could do absolutely nothing to take advantage of those opportunities. Seven of their 12 possessions failed to produce first downs, and the Jets had just two drives produce 20 or more net yards. Most of that came on the ground, where Breece Hall gritted through 22 carries for 59 yards. Fields added seven carries for 31 yards. I normally wouldn't treat a backfield averaging 3.0 yards per carry as a mark of success, but the running game looked like prime Adrian Peterson and LaDainian Tomlinson compared to what the dropback passing game did for the Jets. It's fair to note that this posed a particularly tough matchup for the Jets. The Broncos are one of the league's best defenses, full stop. They have a superstar CB1 in Pat Surtain II . But teams do find plenty of success throwing against Riley Moss and Denver's other defensive backs. Vance Joseph's linebackers can also struggle in coverage, and the Eagles were able to exploit them last week , most notably on a 47-yard touchdown catch by Saquon Barkley . Well, the Jets didn't have those solutions. Garrett Wilson went up against Surtain on 62% of his routes, catching one pass for 4 yards. The only running back to catch a pass was Isaiah Davis , who turned his one target into minus-1 yard. Hall was so promising as a receiver that this offseason Aaron Glenn called him the kind of guy who ""you can split out wide and let him run the route tree, because he can run it like a receiver."" He had zero targets on 14 routes. (Hall has run a total of three routes split out wide in six games. When a coach tells you over the summer that his running back is going to split out wide and run a full route tree, just know that that coach is likely either lying to you or himself, and you'll find out which soon enough.) With his one star receiver blanketed by the opposing team's star cornerback, Fields wasn't able to find answers. Doing the broadcast, Kurt Warner repeatedly noted that Fields was late throwing out-breaking routes, even when Surtain was in coverage. Whether that's on Fields (for being nervous about throwing to the sideline or throwing with anticipation) or on Jets offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand (for dialing up speed outs that Fields wouldn't be willing to throw) is hard to say, but the Jets weren't in position to turn down anything in the passing game Sunday. While nine sacks sound like the work of a dominant pass rush, I would say that only one or two of those sacks really erased the play before Fields had a chance to do anything. Every one of Fields' sacks came five seconds or more after the snap. And the two sacks on the final drive were both problematic. Fields actually had two receivers coming open on a first-and-10 sack in Denver territory with 1:56 to go, but he turned down an out to the sideline and then didn't have time to get to the backside of the play. Then, facing fourth-and-8 with the game on the line, Tyler Johnson had a step on Ja'Quan McMillian and an angle to the sideline, but Fields didn't throw the ball with anticipation. And when he held the ball, Jonathon Cooper 's rush through Mason Taylor blew up the play. Fields was excellent in Week 1 against the Steelers , but his only effective passing work since then has come while trailing against the Cowboys . Since Week 2, if we just look at plays that took place with a win expectancy of 20% or more, Fields' 10.7 QBR is the worst mark in the league. The average Fields dropback in those situations has generated 2.1 yards, a figure that includes both sacks and scrambles. It's clear that Glenn doesn't trust his quarterback. The Jets coach bungled a pair of fourth-down situations out of fear that he might have to rely on his offense, including a brutal process on a fourth-and-1 while the Jets were clinging on to a one-point lead in the fourth quarter. I was optimistic about Fields after the Steelers game in the opener, but he looked completely lost in this game against the Broncos. The problem for the winless Jets in potentially benching their starter, unfortunately, is there's not much to gain. Fields is already owed $10 million in guarantees next year as part of the $30 million he locked down in his deal with the Jets, so there are economic reasons to hope that he can turn things around. The backup here is Tyrod Taylor , who is 36 years old. I'm as big of a Taylor fan as anyone, but in 16 starts over the past seven years since leaving the Bills, Taylor has posted a 43.3 QBR, which ranks 63rd out of the 72 quarterbacks with 500 dropbacks or more over that span. (Fields' 47.4 mark is 47th.) Taylor would likely do a better job running the offense and making some of the throws that are available, but that would come at the expense of the explosiveness and big-play ability that Fields offers with his legs. The Jets would be trading a low-floor, high-ceiling quarterback for one a decade older with a moderate floor and virtually no ceiling. I wouldn't like that swap, but the Jets also probably win this game if Taylor is at quarterback. And after starting 0-6, the idea of being in position to win anything might appeal to Glenn and the Jets. Week 6: Went 1-for-2 on field goals (missing a 26-yarder) in a 17-3 win over the Ravens. It's rare to have a kicker make it into back-to-back Monday columns, but this is quickly becoming a topic of concern for the Rams. In what might be Matthew Stafford 's final NFL season, it's clear that Sean McVay's team has championship aspirations. While Sunday wasn't Stafford's best game, the 37-year-old has been up to that level for most of the 2025 season. The Rams have a pair of great receivers and a young, imposing defensive line. It's becoming clear, though, that their kicking operation is not up to the same standard. This has been a topsy-turvy year for Karty, who has played a key role in each of Los Angeles' losses this season. The second-year kicker had two field goals blocked in what ended up being a fateful loss to the Eagles . While I wouldn't necessarily pin that on Karty, he then missed a 53-yarder against the 49ers last week before having an extra point blocked and placing his overtime kickoff short of the end zone, handing San Francisco a short field on its drive for the game-winning field goal. In what were admittedly rainy, windy conditions in Baltimore on Sunday, Karty appeared to wear out his welcome. After Stafford missed Davante Adams twice in a row for potential touchdowns on the opening drive of the game, Karty lined up for a chip shot from 26 yards out, only for the wind to push his kick into the right upright. Kickers just don't miss in that range anymore, and unlike the Eagles game, there was no pressure or penetration from the Ravens' defense to hurry the kick. The Rams seemed to lean away from the kicking game after that point. Karty did kick a 36-yard field goal on the next drive, but it was on a fourth-and-11 in the red zone. McVay was more aggressive than usual as the game went along. The Rams attempted a fourth-and-2 on the Baltimore 33-yard line on their opening drive of the third quarter and a fourth-and-3 from the Baltimore 6-yard line early in the fourth. As is often the case when coaches are forced to be more aggressive than they would like, the results were actually slightly positive! The fourth-and-2 in the third quarter produced a 30-yard completion to Kyren Williams , who then punched in the first touchdown of the game on the next snap. The fourth-and-3 failed when Stafford was sacked, but the touchdown more than offset what the Rams would've gotten had they kicked field goals in both spots. Could McVay have been concerned about the weather in making his kicking game decisions? Potentially. After the game, though, it was telling that he offered a comment without even being asked a question by the assembled media. ""Obviously, you guys are going to ask me about about the field goal,"" McVay said . ""I thought the protection was good, [but] we have to make the kick."" McVay then went on to criticize the operation on the subsequent made field goal, which implies that he places the blame for the initial miss solely on his kicker. The Rams were 20th in the league in performance on field goal and extra point tries last season, per the FTN Football Almanac . They're unsurprisingly last in EPA per attempt and win probability on those kicks in 2025. Some of that doesn't fall on Karty's shoulders given the blocks, but nothing about his performance so far as a pro suggests that the Rams are dealing with a championship-caliber kicker. I also wonder whether McVay is looking over at his friends and rivals in San Francisco. Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers were keeping the faith in a kicker they drafted in the third round in 2023, sticking with Jake Moody into the start of the 2025 season even after a disappointing 2024 campaign. Once Moody went 1-of-3 on field goal attempts in the opener, though, the 49ers cut him and replaced him with Eddy Pineiro . The journeyman has proceeded to go 15-of-15 on field goal tries since, including four kicks from 50-plus yards -- most notably the 59-yarder that gave the 49ers a lead late in the fourth quarter over the Rams last week. Week 6: Allowed three catches for 69 yards as the nearest defender in coverage in a 34-17 loss to the Giants, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Howie Roseman's draft philosophy over the past few years has been brutally effective: Find a Georgia Bulldogs defender, draft him and profit . The Eagles' general manager has cleaned up on Georgia players, adding Jalen Carter , Jordan Davis , Nakobe Dean and Nolan Smith Jr . to one of the league's best young defensive front sevens. He even signed Azeez Ojulari away from the Giants in free agency, adding a fifth former Bulldog to the defense. All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The one who hasn't quite worked out is Ringo. Roseman traded a 2024 third-round pick to acquire Ringo in the fourth round of the 2023 draft, the sort of impatient move the veteran GM usually prefers to be on the other side of making. Ringo wasn't involved on defense in 2023 until the late-season collapse, and with Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean emerging as stars in 2024, he averaged about four defensive snaps per game outside of a rest day for the starters in Week 18. After trading Darius Slay away during the offseason, the Eagles have flirted with different options on the outside at cornerback. Ringo was torched by Ja'Marr Chase in the preseason , which might have steered Vic Fangio to start Adoree' Jackson in the opener . After three games, Jackson was pulled for Ringo, who started each of the next two weeks. (Jackson was brought back into the fold when Mitchell went down injured Thursday against the Giants .) Ringo didn't have the best performance against the Giants. Early in the game, with New York facing a third-and-12, Ringo was outjumped on a 50-50 ball by Lil'Jordan Humphrey , who picked up 34 yards on the play. Wan'Dale Robinson ran away from Ringo on a crosser for 26 yards. An illegal contact penalty handed the Giants a free first down on a drive that eventually ended in a touchdown. And a 20-yard pass interference call against Ringo set the Giants up with a first-and-goal on the 1-yard line, which Cam Skattebo pounded in for another touchdown. After the pass interference call, the Eagles kept Ringo off the field for most of the fourth quarter, with the third-year pro coming back onto the field for only the final four snaps of the game, three of which were kneel-downs. Ringo himself admitted after the game that he didn't perform well enough, saying that he ""didn't play to my standard entirely."" The Eagles can keep the faith with Ringo. They can turn back to Jackson, who was run through on a touchdown by Skattebo and has already essentially been benched once this season. They could eventually look toward Jakorian Bennett , though the summer trade acquisition played just 24 defensive snaps in three games before being placed on injured reserve with a pectoral injury and doesn't have a clear timeframe for returning. To bring it full circle, though, this is Roseman's team. If there's one thing he's known for besides drafting Georgia defenders, it's making plenty of trades. With the deadline just weeks away and that outside cornerback role across from Mitchell and DeJean continuing to be a liability, would anyone be surprised if the Eagles made a move for a veteran cornerback who could step into the lineup at midseason? I'd expect Roseman to be hitting the phones in search of CB help between now and Nov. 4, which would squeeze Ringo out of a starting role. play 0:16 Byron Young drops Tyler Huntley for late sack Bryon Young chases Tyler Huntley down and sacks him for the Rams late in the 4th. Week 6: Lost 17-3 to the Rams, dropping the Ravens to 1-5. Even the league's best coaches have seen many of their legendary tenures come to ignominious ends. Andy Reid was run out of town in Philadelphia by Eagles fans who were convinced their veteran coach would never get them over the Super Bowl hump. Bill Belichick was fired after winning six Super Bowls in New England. Any coach who doesn't win a Super Bowl over a 12-year span in the same job is going to inspire some grumbling here and there, and every fan base fires its coach on social media after every loss. But Sunday was really the point where frustrations about Harbaugh came to the surface in Baltimore. After a Zay Flowers fumble and a quick touchdown drive by the Rams put the visitors up 17-3 in the third quarter, a notable portion of the crowd launched into a chant that hasn't been heard very often over the past two decades: ""Fire Harbaugh."" Of course, I recognize that Ravens fans didn't suddenly decide that they're frustrated with Harbaugh after five losses before the end of October. This is partly about the frustrations of the Lamar Jackson era, where the Ravens have been the best team in football during the regular season and made it past the divisional round only once in seven tries. It is about trying to find something to change about a team that felt as if it was inevitably going to come up short when things mattered most, even before their previously lofty floor collapsed amid a brutal run of injuries. It is also somewhat about the fact that Harbaugh is one of the league's CEO coaches, which means it's more difficult to tie his performance to one particular side of the ball. If Harbaugh had a background as an offensive or defensive assistant and called plays, it would be easy to marry his job performance to the performance of that unit. With Todd Monken in charge of the offense and Zach Orr running the defense, Harbaugh's most visible when it comes to making fourth-down decisions. And while I agreed with his decisions Sunday, the Ravens failed on four of their six fourth-down attempts against the Rams, including a goal-to-go sequence that ended with Derrick Henry getting stuffed for a loss. That's not going to thrill fans. play 0:35 Quentin Lake picks off Cooper Rush Quentin Lake jumps in front of Cooper Rush's throw for the Rams INT. Having said all that: I believe Harbaugh is a really good coach. The Ravens are 1-5 out of some combination of tough close-game luck against very good competition and a horrific run of injuries. If a pass doesn't deflect into Keon Coleman 's hands or Henry doesn't fumble down the stretch in Week 1 , is Harbaugh a better coach? Baltimore's rookie class isn't off to a great start, but the Ravens have brought through young talent for many years under Harbaugh with a lot of success. That has to mean something. Is there something innately lacking in Harbaugh that prevents the Ravens from winning a Super Bowl? I'm not sure I loved that argument with Reid in Philadelphia or with any other consistent playoff-visiting coach who came up short of the Super Bowl without Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes at quarterback. Regardless, it certainly shouldn't apply to Harbaugh, who actually did win a Super Bowl. And unlike Reid, who started winning them after he landed a future Hall of Famer at quarterback, Harbaugh won his title with something less than the best version of those Ravens teams. His 10-6 squad ran through the AFC as the fourth seed, winning road games in Denver and New England along the way. I would argue the Ravens and Harbaugh can be a little slow to recognize the need for some changes. Remember the last time Harbaugh's job security was in question? It was 2018, when the Ravens had missed the playoffs in three consecutive seasons and were seemingly about to do so for a fourth consecutive year. Harbaugh had stuck by struggling starter Joe Flacco all season and refused to even publicly consider inserting Jackson, but when Flacco suffered a hip injury , Harbaugh was left with no choice. The 4-5 Ravens went 6-1 the rest of the way with Jackson under center and haven't looked back. The Ravens should get Jackson back from his hamstring injury after the bye, which should help the offense dramatically. The team has turned the ball over six times in two games after turning it over just 11 times all season in 2024. Monken's offense was operating at a high level before the injury. While the run game needs to get more consistent and Jackson needs to stop taking sacks at triple the rate he did a year ago, I'm not concerned about the offense. Can the defense get back on track? Harbaugh has already said that he doesn't plan on firing Orr, which means the change will have to come from within. With Kyle Hamilton and Marlon Humphrey returning to the lineup, this Baltimore defense was much improved on what we saw last week against Houston , albeit with the help of some missed passes, difficult weather and a midgame injury to Puka Nacua . If anything, we could see minor changes. The Ravens swapped Odafe Oweh for Alohi Gilman last week, a reflection on the reality that they just needed responsible adults in the secondary. Gilman played 82% of the snaps in his Ravens debut, which meant much less T.J. Tampa and Keyon Martin . Roquan Smith will be back after the bye and take over for Trenton Simpson . I wouldn't be shocked if the Ravens looked to add a veteran or two off the waiver wire or on the bottom of another team's roster to upgrade their thin defensive line. play 0:33 Devin White's strip-sack fumble is recovered by Raiders Devin White forces Cam Ward to fumble, giving the Raiders possession at the goal line. The biggest reason things should get better, though, is that the schedule is about to get much easier. After the bye, the Ravens play their next six games against teams that are a combined 9-24. They'll face at least one backup quarterback in Flacco of the Bengals, and it would hardly be a surprise if they faced a couple more along the way owing to likely benchings. There will be a lot of winnable contests ahead. But if the Ravens lose a bunch of these games to the likes of the Browns, Jets and Dolphins over the next two months? That's a different story. Until then, though, I don't think that Harbaugh's job should be in question. And frankly, as the crowd chanted ""Fire Harbaugh"" on Sunday, I suspect that there were a few owners and executives around the league who were quietly joining in, hoping that one of the best coaches in football might come available for them to hire. Week 6: Did not play in a 30-27 win over the Cowboys. I'm finishing up by including a player who is on this list by no fault of his own. Everyone else on the hot seat had a rough Week 6. Hubbard didn't even play, as he sat out his second consecutive game with a calf injury . Hubbard was averaging 4.1 yards per carry before the injury and had a pair of touchdowns in the passing game earlier this season. Hubbard's four-year, $33 million extension in November 2024 -- along with the ACL injury suffered by Jonathon Brooks -- suggested he would be the starter in Carolina for the 2025 campaign. Instead, that's now up in the air, and it has nothing to do with Hubbard. Rico Dowdle has simply taken over this backfield. One week after running for 206 yards in a win over the Dolphins , Dowdle went back to work in a self-described revenge game against his former employer, the Cowboys. Dowdle ran 30 times for 183 yards and added a team-high 56 receiving yards. Dowdle became the first player since Dalvin Cook in 2020 to rack up 200 yards from scrimmage in consecutive games, a feat that has happened only 31 times in NFL history. And while the massive game against the Dolphins was fueled by a handful of huge gains, Dowdle's longest run on Sunday went for 15 yards. He simply gashed the Cowboys for meaningful yardage drive after drive, with 20 of Dowdle's 30 rush attempts being deemed successful by the NFL Next Gen Stats model. Over the past five years, just three other backs have posted a higher success rate in a game where they carried the ball at least 25 times. What's even more impressive is that Dowdle is doing this without the sort of help other great runners have around the league. The Panthers are down to bare bones up front. The entire right side of their line was missing Sunday. Center Austin Corbett and right guard Robert Hunt are on injured reserve , while right tackle Taylor Moton was inactive with an elbow injury. The Cowboys aren't a great defense by any stretch of the imagination, but they were 18th in the league in EPA per play against designed runs before Sunday. The Panthers did a great job of creating running lanes for Dowdle, but he also did a great job of making decisive cuts and getting the most out of what was blocked. He also added three first downs as a receiver, including a 36-yard touchdown on a blown coverage from Dallas' oft-frustrating linebackers. Dowdle ran by struggling Cowboys linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr . for a 13-yard catch and a first down earlier in the game. He is not Christian McCaffrey or Alvin Kamara , but Dowdle has made a meaningful impact in the receiving game over the past two weeks. While Hubbard is expected to return from his injury shortly, I'm not sure how the Panthers can go back to the prior status quo, when Hubbard was the lead back and Dowdle the backup. Dowdle was already getting about 10 carries per game before his sudden star turn, but he has earned the lion's share of the work at running back now, even if that's through no fault of Hubbard's own. Week 6: Lost 20-10 to the Raiders, dropping the Titans to 1-5. UPDATE: Callahan was fired Monday . Last Sunday's win was supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel. Yes, the Cardinals essentially regurgitated their fourth-quarter lead and handed a victory to the previously winless Titans in Week 5. No, it would be foolish to assume that every team was going to be as indifferent to the football as Arizona was near the end zone. On a day where the Titans' defense slowed down the Cardinals for three quarters and Cam Ward hit a number of big-time throws to Calvin Ridley in key moments, though, Callahan could credibly go to his locker room and say that Titans at least had something to build upon, even if it was built on something resembling a house of cards. It's still very dark in Nashville. After their dramatic victory, how did the Titans respond? Jeffery Simmons admitted to ESPN's Turron Davenport after the game that the team had one of its worst weeks of practice . They came to Las Vegas to face a reeling Raiders team and went down 17-0 before responding. With Ridley sidelined early on by a hamstring injury , the Titans racked up just 22 net yards on their first five drives before a sixth drive at the end of the second quarter ended with a brutal interception from Ward, who held the ball too long and had his pass tipped.

Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The offensive line was supposed to be the strength of this team, both by virtue of coaching (legendary coach Bill Callahan, Brian's father, arrived along with his son in 2024) and investment. The Titans used consecutive first-round picks on Peter Skoronski and JC Latham and spent big to sign Lloyd Cushenberry III , Kevin Zeitler and Dan Moore Jr . in free agency. Latham has been out since the opener, and replacement John Ojukwu was arguably playing like the worst player in the league before being benched himself. Still, Latham's return to the lineup was supposed to solidify things Sunday. Instead, Latham allowed two sacks and six pressures. He appeared to be at fault on a brutal strip sack of Ward in the second quarter, when nobody blocked Devin White as the linebacker rushed through the B-gap, handing the Raiders a short field that led to a touchdown. Playing against Maxx Crosby is tough, but the Titans took Latham with the seventh pick in the draft. They rely on him. He struggled badly in pass protection at left tackle a year ago and has now allowed three sacks in two games on the right side this season. And Moore leads the NFL with six sacks allowed, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Some of that is on Ward, but the Titans can't be too shocked, given that Moore also led the league in sacks allowed last season. The tough part for Brian Callahan is that he has already ceded responsibilities. His father presumably plays a big role in designing the run game, which ranks 28th in the league in EPA per play on designed runs. He also handed over playcalling duties to Bo Hardegree at 0-3. The offense didn't move much; it was 32nd in EPA per play with Callahan calling the plays and jumped all the way to 30th after the shift, though that's mostly been a product of the Browns and Ravens changing quarterbacks below them. In terms of game management, it's hard to argue that Callahan has been up to the task. He was involved in a bizarre controversy in Week 1 , where he neglected to challenge an incomplete pass call on Titans receiver Elic Ayomanor because he had only an elbow inbounds. (One elbow, as you probably know, equals two feet.) In Week 2 , the Titans were lined up for a 57-yard field goal, only for Callahan's indecisiveness to lead to a delay of game penalty, with the ensuing 62-yarder getting blocked. In Week 4 , while trailing 26-0 to the Texans and inside his own 5-yard line with 1:50 to go, Callahan handed the ball to Tony Pollard three consecutive times, putting unnecessary hits on the 28-year-old's body. Callahan's role is likely dependent on how he does developing Ward. Six games isn't an entire picture, but so far, Ward's 25.0 QBR ranks last in the league by a comfortable margin. The guys directly ahead of him have either been benched ( Jake Browning , Russell Wilson or Joe Flacco) or seem to be in real danger of losing their job ( Geno Smith , Justin Fields ). Ward has a talented arm, and he has made some excellent throws this season, but the Titans haven't done enough to insist that their young QB get the ball out quickly. That has led to pick-sixes, strip sacks and unnecessary hits. Some of Ward's most successful plays have been wildly dangerous passes across his body. Those are fun, but there's no consistency to the Titans' offense. Ward is taking sacks on nearly 11% of his dropbacks, which was supposed to be an area where the Titans would improve after Will Levis was taken down on 12% of his dropbacks in 2024. play 1:35 Is Rico Dowdle's fantasy production sustainable? Tristan H. Cockcroft breaks down whether Rico Dowdle can maintain his current fantasy output. All of the easy buttons the Titans should be able to hit for their young quarterback aren't working. They're last in the league in EPA per play on screens at an almost-unbelieveable minus-0.42 mark. On Sunday, their five screens picked up a total of 8 yards. On four of those five screens, there was at least one blown block or major blocking mistake that led to the play not succeeding. Those plays all look good on paper, and the Titans had blocking advantages on a number of them. If the players repeatedly can't or don't execute, is that on them or the coaching staff? I can see the argument for not forcing a change. Bad organizations get caught in a cycle of swapping out coaches at the first sign of struggles from their young quarterbacks, resulting in a steady stream of new voices, new concepts and unfamiliar rules. Callahan came from Cincinnati, where Zac Taylor was 10-29-1 at the bye of his third season with the team. The Bengals went 5-3 down the stretch, got hot in the postseason and made it to the Super Bowl. They made it to the AFC Championship Game the following season. What has happened since suggests that Taylor probably isn't as good as he looked in 2021 and 2022, but he also wasn't as overmatched as he seemed in 2019 and 2020, either. Without arguing that the Titans should fire Callahan, though, there needs to be some consistent signs of improvement. The offensive line needs to look as if they can reliably pass-block. There needs to be some semblance of a run game. Ward needs to look as if he is improving. The game management can't be a major drag on operations. Since hiring Callahan, the Titans have changed the quarterback, the running back, their top two wide receivers and four of the five starters along the offensive line. They're the worst offense in the NFL. If Callahan is part of the solution moving forward, that has to change.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46573291/2025-nfl-week-6-hot-seat-watch-coaches-players-mcdaniel-fields-harbaugh-callahan,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559424_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,13e85c98a94890117c4dd92995b2dd94654d900a

Myanmar's Lwin Moe Aung scored the very first goal in a 5-1 win over Macau. All confederations are drawing to a close, but we're still a long way from discovering the full list of 45 nations that will join hosts United States , Mexico and Canada to make up the field of 48. Japan were the very first country to qualify on March 20. QUALIFIED (19/45): Japan, New Zealand, Iran, Argentina, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Australia, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, Cape Verde What can be decided in October? Europe and Concacaf: Qualifying doesn't end until November, but we could see the first few European countries book their places. Africa: The final two rounds of the group stage take place in October, when we will discover the seven nations that will join Morocco and Tunisia, plus the interconfederation playoff contenders. Asia: The fourth round is played in October, when we will find out the final two automatic qualifiers, along with the two interconfederation playoff contenders. South America and Oceania: Qualification complete. Roberto Lopes, left, and Garry Rodrigues of Cape Verde celebrate their side's qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Cristiano Barbosa/Sportsfile via Getty Images There were 54 FIFA-affiliated nations in the draw. However, Eritrea subsequently withdrew. Round 1: The teams are in eight groups of six nations, and one group of five (with Eritrea removed). The nine group winners qualify for the World Cup. This stage began in November 2023 and will be completed with two rounds to be played in October. QUALIFIED (6/9): Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, Cape Verde World Cup groups - Africa Group A Egypt Burkina Faso Guinea-Bissau Sierra Leone Ethiopia Djibouti Group B Senegal DR Congo Mauritania Togo Sudan South Sudan Group C Nigeria South Africa Benin Zimbabwe Rwanda Lesotho Group D Cameroon Cape Verde Angola Libya Eswatini Mauritius Group E Morocco Zambia Congo Tanzania Niger Eritrea Group F Ivory Coast Gabon Kenya Gambia Burundi Seychelles Group G Algeria Guinea Uganda Mozambique Botswana Somalia Group H Tunisia Equatorial Guinea Namibia Malawi Liberia São Tomé Group I Mali Ghana Madagascar Cent African Rep Comoros Chad How teams can qualify as the group stage ends this week NB: To determine the best second-place teams, the results of the team to finish sixth in the six-team groups are removed. SUNDAY Group A: EGYPT (23) qualified with a 3-0 win over rock-bottom Djibouti (1) on Wednesday, on the back of two goals from Mohamed Salah. On Sunday, Burkina Faso (21) put themselves in with a very strong chance of one of the playoff spots with a 3-1 win over Ethiopia. Egypt became the third African nation to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Wednesday. ABDEL MAJID BZIOUAT/AFP via Getty Images Group E: MOROCCO (21) have qualified. Niger (15) confirmed second place by winning in Zambia on Sunday, and they must now wait to see if they have enough points for a playoff. Group I: GHANA (25) won 1-0 at home to Comoros (15) to become the 18th team to qualify. Madagascar (19) suffered a damaging 4-1 defeat to Mali (15), which all but leaves them out of contention for a best runners-up spot. MONDAY Group D: CAPE VERDE ISLANDS (23) eased to a debut World Cup appearance by winning 3-0 at home to Eswatini (3) on Monday. Cameroon could only draw 0-0 at home to Angola, but their goal difference effectively ensures they will be in round two in November. Group H: TUNISIA (28) have qualified. Namibia (15) took second place but they have the worst record of all the runners-up and will not be in the playoffs. TUESDAY Group B: Qualification is in Senegal's (21) hands ahead of a favorable fixture at home to Mauritania (7) on Tuesday, and victory will guarantee a place in the finals. Second-placed DR Congo (19) host Sudan (13) and must win while hoping Senegal lose to take first place. DR Congo are just inside the top four for the best runners-up, so also need a victory to rubber-stamp a playoff. Only those two countries are in contention. Group C: The group was blown wide open after South Africa (15, +3) saw their 2-0 victory over Lesotho (9) become a 3-0 defeat because they fielded an ineligible player . The punishment dropped South Africa into second place behind Benin (17, +5). A 1-0 win for Benin 1-0 in Rwanda (11) on Friday ended the home side's challenge, and means Benin will qualify for the World Cup if they win in Nigeria (14) on Tuesday. South Africa could only draw 0-0 in Zimbabwe, a hugely damaging result. If Benin draw, that will be enough if South Africa draw or lose at home to Rwanda. If Benin draw and South Africa win, it will come down to group goal difference, and that will be level if South Africa win by two goals. If South Africa win 2-0 and Benin draw 2-2, records would be identical and South Africa would qualify on head to head, having won both meetings. So, if South Africa win by one goal they have to hope Benin lose. If South Africa win by two goals and Benin draw that should be enough, as Benin would need to be involved in a score draw of at least 3-3. If South Africa win by three or more goals and Benin draw, South Africa qualify as group winners. But the most complicated of groups has another complication: Nigeria are very much still in the picture and if they beat Benin the two teams will have 17 points; if South Africa win, Nigeria and Benin are level for second; if South Africa draw or lose, Nigeria and Benin are level for first. If Nigeria win by one goal, the two teams are guaranteed to have identical records, so it then goes to head to head. If Nigeria win 1-0, Nigeria finish higher due to their away goal in Benin; If Nigeria win 2-1 (same score as the first meeting), positions will be decided on red and yellow cards; If Nigeria win 3-2 or higher scoring, Benin finish higher with those two away goals. If Nigeria win by two or more goals, they finish higher. And there's a twist. If Nigeria win 2-1, and disciplinary record is identical, FIFA will hold a random draw to determine their positions in the table. Going into the final game, Benin have 14 yellows, Nigeria have 13, with no red cards for either. Neither Benin or South Africa can now qualify for round two as best runners-up. Group F: Ivory Coast (23) head into Tuesday's final game at home to Kenya (12) knowing a victory will send them to the World Cup. Any shock slipup opens the door for Gabon (22), who can then top the group if they win at home to Burundi (10). Gabon are guaranteed to finish no lower than second and are sure of at least a playoff route. Group G: ALGERIA (22) qualified with a 3-0 win over Somalia (1) on Thursday. The race for second has been all but sealed too, as Mozambique (15, -4) losing 2-1 to Guinea means they need a win and a goal-difference swing of 10 to overtake Uganda (18, +6). On Tuesday, it's Somalia vs. Mozambique and Algeria vs. Uganda -- so, Uganda do have a tough game, and Mozambique play a team who have conceded 19 goals, but it's still highly improbable. However, as it stands Uganda are outside the top four runners-up, so need a positive result in Algeria to increase their points. Current ranking of second-placed teams: 1 Gabon -- Played 7, Points 16 (GD +4) 2 Cameroon -- 8, 15 (+9) 3 Burkina Faso -- 8, 15 (+6) 4 Niger -- 8, 15 (+1) ---------- 5 DR Congo -- 7, 13 (+4) 6 Madagascar -- 8, 13 (-1) 7 Uganda -- 7, 12 (+3) 8 South Africa -- 7, 11 (+1) 9 Namibia -- 8, 9 (-2) - ELIMINATED - Check out the latest fixtures and results here | Latest tables Round 2: The four best runners-up will enter CAF playoffs (two semifinals and a final) to decide which one country will go to the interconfederation playoffs.

The fixtures will be created using the FIFA World Ranking released at the end of October, with the highest rank playing the lowest rank, and second facing third. The winners of those two ties will then meet to move on to the March playoffs. There are 55 European nations, although 54 will compete as Russia remain suspended due to the invasion of Ukraine.

Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in UEFA Nations League (UNL) action played their first matches. QUALIFIED (0/12): What can be decided in October? The teams that were in the UNL finals only played their first games in September so we're still a way off from discovering the qualifiers -- but a few could come in October. SUNDAY Group C: Denmark (10, +11) and Scotland (10, +5) are the only two teams left in contention. On Nov. 15, it's Denmark vs. Belarus so Scotland will surely have to win in Greece to stay in the hunt for automatic qualification. If that does happen, the group is set up for a decider between Scotland and Denmark in Glasgow on Nov. 18; that looks like being must-win for Scotland as their goal difference is not as good. Greece and Belarus are eliminated. Group G: Netherlands (16, +19) sit top ahead of Poland (13, +4), who do still have to host Netherlands on Nov. 14 but their goal difference is 13 worse right now -- so the Dutch know they can afford to lose that and as long as they win at home to Lithuania (3) on Nov. 17 they'll still top the group. With a game in hand on Finland (10, -5) and far superior goal difference, it looks like Poland will be in the playoffs. Lithuania and Malta are out. Group H: A surprise win for Romania (10) at home to Austria (15) has reignited the group, but Austria remain favourites to top it. Nov. 15: Austria will qualify with a win in Cyprus (8) if Bosnia and Herzegovina (13) lose at home to Romania, who must at least avoid defeat to stay in contention for a playoff spot (though they will get a route as a UEFA Nations League group winner regardless). Romania finish up at home to San Marino, so if they can beat Bosnia they will be odds-on to finish at least second, and that would benefit San Marino through the Nations League route. Nov. 18: If Bosnia and Austria both win (or results to keep the two teams in touch), then they meet each other in Vienna to decide who qualifies automatically. Cyprus are out and San Marino have only slim hope of a playoff through the Nations League route. Group L: Croatia (16, +19) now look locked for the World Cup and need just one point from games in November at home to Faroe Islands (12) and away to Montenegro (6). Even if they lost both matches, their goal difference is far better than that of Czechia (13, +4). A shock win for the Faroes at home to Czechia on Sunday is unlikely to mean they can gatecrash the playoff place, because Czechia's last remaining game is at home to Gibraltar on Nov. 17. Faroe Islands are away to Croatia on Nov. 14, and Czechia will be assured of second if the Faroes lose. Montenegro and Gibraltar are eliminated. MONDAY Group A: Germany (9, +5) and Slovakia (9, +3) are in the box seat, and Northern Ireland (6, +1) will surely have to win in Slovakia on Nov. 14 to stay in contention. The final group game between Germany and Slovakia in Leipzig on Nov. 17 looks like being the decider, though. If Northern Ireland miss out on the top two, they are almost certain to get a playoff through the Nations League route. Luxembourg (0) are out. Group B: Switzerland (10, +9) hold a lead over Kosovo (7, -1) and their goal difference is worth an extra point. In effect, it means the Swiss will have qualified in all but name if they win at home to Sweden (1) on Nov. 15. If they don't, it could open the door to Kosovo, who are away to Slovenia (3) before hosting Switzerland on Nov. 18. Slovenia must beat Kosovo to keep alive their hopes of a playoff. Sweden are all but out of it but are set to get a playoff route through the Nations League. Group D: France (10, +6) still have work to do to hold off Ukraine (7, +1) in second. On Nov. 13, it's France vs. Ukraine and Les Bleus will qualify with a victory. Even if France lose, goal difference means they are in strong position with a home game against Azerbaijan (1, -9) to finish up on Nov. 16. Iceland (4, +2) will hope that France get the win, as if they beat Azerbaijan they will move into the playoff place on goal difference. And that sets up a huge final day-game between Ukraine and Iceland in Warsaw. Azerbaijan have only a mathematical chance of a playoff. Group J: Belgium (14, +15), who moved back to the top of the table with a 4-2 win in Wales on Monday, finish up against two eliminated teams -- away to Kazakhstan (7) on Nov. 15 and at home to Liechtenstein (0). As North Macedonia have only one fixture to play, Belgium need three points to qualify, so they will do it by beating Kazakhstan -- though the game against Liechtenstein means it's effectively a formality. North Macedonia (13, +9) will look to hold off Wales (10, +3) for second. Wales go to Liechtenstein first up, before a huge game against North Macedonia in Cardiff. Wales need to win by six goals in the first game to go into the head to head in second on goal difference, which would mean a draw would be enough. While both North Macedonia and Wales are guaranteed a playoff route through the Nations League, finishing in second gives a better seeding. TUESDAY Group E: Spain (9) are top with a 100% record but after Saturday's results they cannot qualify in October. On Tuesday, Spain are at home to Bulgaria (0) and nearest-challengers Turkey (6) host Georgia (3). Spain already have a goal difference advantage of 11 over Turkey, so it's hard to see them missing out from here. Group F: Portugal (9) have won all three matches and are close to qualification. If Portugal win at home to Hungary (4) on Tuesday, they will be over the line as long as Armenia (3) draw or lose in Republic of Ireland (1). It's a close battle for the runners-up place. Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal could qualify for the World Cup this week. Hrach Khachatryan/ MB Media/Getty Images Group I: Norway (18) are in control ahead of Italy (12) and Israel (9). Norway's vastly superior goal difference over Italy (+26 vs. +7) means a win at home to Estonia (3) in November should effectively do the job, even if Italy win at home to Israel and away to Moldova (0). On the final day, it's Italy vs. Norway, so Italy (who have one game in hand) know they must go all out for goals in their next two games, but it's looking like they will be in the playoffs. Group K: England (15) have dominated the group, winning all five matches without conceding a goal. After Serbia (7) lost 1-0 at home to Albania (11) on Saturday, England will qualify with a win in Latvia (5) on Tuesday. Serbia and Albania both play England in November, and as Albania's other game is vs. Andorra (1) it's odds-on they finish second and Serbia won't be at the finals. - Check out the latest fixtures and results here | Tables PLAYOFFS The final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL, who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. This creates four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. The priority order for the four World Cup playoff places through the UNL is: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, England, Norway, Wales, Czechia, Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova, San Marino. Of the 14 teams to win their UNL groups, 10 of those were in Pot 1 or 2 for the World Cup qualifying draw -- so on ranking would finish in the top two of their group. If that comes to pass, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova and San Marino would get a playoff place. However, that now appears unlikely with Romania and Sweden struggling to finish in the top two. Seeding: Pot 1: Four World Cup qualifying group runners-up with the best FIFA World Ranking Pot 2: As above, teams fifth to eighth in the FIFA World Ranking list order Pot 3: As above, teams ninth to 12th in the FIFA World Ranking list order Pot 4: UEFA Nations League teams Semifinals: Pot 1 vs. Pot 4 Pot 2 vs. Pot 3 The World Cup Trophy on display in New York during the official Trophy Tour around host cities. Mike Stobe - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images Usually, Concacaf would have six automatic places in qualifying -- but for the 2026 finals three of the six are taken up by the hosts. That leaves three places to be won, plus two spots in the interconfederation playoff path. Concacaf saw 32 nations enter the race to make the finals. Round 1: The four lowest-ranked Concacaf nations battled it out in two-legged ties. Anguilla and British Virgin Islands eliminated Turks and Caicos Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands respectively, both on penalties. Round 2: The top 28-ranked nations, plus the two winners from Round 1, were drawn into six groups of five teams. Teams played each other only once, rather than home and away. This stage was played in two blocks, in June 2024 and June 2025. The six group winners and six group runners-up moved on to Round 3. Advanced: Bermuda, Costa Rica, Curaçao, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago Round 3: The 12 remaining teams were drawn into three groups of four teams. This phase started in September and will be completed in October and November. The group winners will qualify for the World Cup, with the two runners-up with the best record going on to take part in the interconfederation playoffs. - Check out the fixtures and results | Latest tables QUALIFIED (0/3): What can be decided in October? Group A: Suriname (5) sit in first place, but a 1-1 draw at home to Guatemala (2) on Friday could be damaging. Panama (5) moved level at the top by beating El Salvador (3) 1-0. On Tuesday, it's Panama vs. Suriname as the top two meet, and El Salvador vs Guatemala. Group B: Curaçao's (7) 2-0 win over Jamaica (6) on Friday put them in the box seat for a first-ever World Cup appearance. On Tuesday, Curaçao are to home to Trinidad and Tobago (4), who can't afford to lose if they are to stay in contention for an automatic place. The other game sees Jamaica host Bermuda (0). Group C: Haiti (5) moved top of the group on Thursday with a 3-0 win in Nicaragua (1), while Honduras (5) and Costa Rica (3) played out a goalless draw. It's still too close to call, and on Monday it's Honduras vs. Haiti, the top two facing off, and Costa Rica vs. Nicaragua. The Socceroos qualified for the World Cup with a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

But the main part will be done and dusted in June. Round 1: The 20 lowest-ranked nations played two-legged ties in October 2023. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore and Yemen advanced. Round 2: Those 10 winners joined the 26 best-ranked nations. The 36 teams were drawn into nine groups of four teams, with the top two nations going through to Round 3. This stage began in November 2023 and was completed in June 2024. - Final tables Advanced: Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyz Republic, North Korea, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan Round 3: We were left with 18 nations, drawn into three groups of six teams. Matches began in September 2024 and the round is completed on Tuesday. The group winners and runners-up took the first six places at the 2026 World Cup and their campaign is complete. Japan became the first team to qualify for the World Cup on March 20, followed by Iran , Jordan , South Korea , Uzbekistan and Australia . - Check out the results | Final tables Round 4: The six teams in this stage were drawn into two groups of three. They will play each other once, so two matches in total per team, in one host country in October. QUALIFIED (6/8): Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Australia What can be decided in October? We will find out the final two automatic qualifiers, plus the teams that will battle it out for a playoff in round five. Group A: Qatar (hosts), United Arab Emirates, Oman Wednesday: Oman 0-0 Qatar Saturday: United Arab Emirates 2-1 Oman Tuesday: Qatar vs. United Arab Emirates UAE's late comeback victory over Oman puts them in a strong position, but they do meet hosts Qatar in the final match on Tuesday. Here's what that fixture can mean. UAE win: UAE qualify for the World Cup, and the scoreline will then determine who finishes second. If UAE win 1-0 or by two or more goals, Oman will be second and in the playoff. If UAE win 2-1, second place will be decided between Oman and Qatar on yellow and red cards. Oman have four yellows to Qatar's two. If cards are the same, there will be a random draw for the playoff place. If UAE win 3-2 or higher scoring, Qatar will be second and in the playoff. If Qatar vs. UAE is a draw: UAE qualify, and Qatar are in the playoff. If Qatar win: Qatar qualify, and UAE are in the playoff. Group B: Saudi Arabia (hosts), Iraq, Indonesia Wednesday: Indonesia 2-3 Saudi Arabia Saturday: Iraq 1-0 Indonesia Tuesday: Saudi Arabia vs. Iraq Indonesia have been eliminated, so it's a straight shootout in Tuesday's game. If Saudi Arabia win or draw: Saudi Arabia qualify for the World Cup with Iraq in the playoff If Iraq win: Iraq qualify for the World Cup with Saudi Arabia in the playoff As hosts, Saudi Arabia are favorites to qualify from Group B.

db0c7fbe1af2,Fantasy Football,,"The sixth Sunday of the NFL season featured another fantastic performance from Carolina Panthers RB Rico Dowdle , another touchdown from Dallas Cowboys WR George Pickens , and continued development from precocious New England Patriots QB Drake Maye as a top-10 fantasy option. Oh, there were injuries, too, with excellent wide receivers Puka Nacua (ankle), Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) and Marvin Harrison Jr . (concussion) leaving games prematurely. Fantasy managers must monitor their status for the upcoming week. Each Monday, before the current NFL week ends, we will identify players available in at least 50% of ESPN standard leagues worthy of your attention, from standard formats to deeper options. The NFL is a weekly league, and player valuation and roles seldom remain stagnant. It does not matter how you acquire players for your fantasy rosters, just that you get them. Quarterback Jaxson Dart , New York Giants (34.4% rostered): This is not the first time we have discussed Dart in this space, though fantasy managers remained rather tepid with interest. Dart was active in fewer than 10% of ESPN standard leagues in Week 6. That must change after Dart scored 23.6 points in a stunning win over the beleaguered Philadelphia Eagles . Although Dart remains an unfinished product as a passer, he has notably rushed for more than 50 yards in each of his three starts, scoring touchdowns in two of them. That is enough to make him relevant in fantasy. A road game in Denver this week might not be as much fun as facing Philly, but Dart boasts undeniable QB1 potential in fantasy this season and should be rostered in many more leagues. Sam Darnold , Seattle Seahawks (23.1%): Some fantasy managers just refuse to believe in Darnold despite his solid numbers. Darnold scored 20.0 points on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars , and after a rough Week 1 outing, he is averaging nearly 20 PPG over his past five games. He and the Seahawks face the Houston Texans in Week 7. Given his numbers, it is hard to suggest anything but Darnold being underrated in fantasy. He showed us his ability last season with the Minnesota Vikings , and he is performing similarly this season. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Although there is no shortage of veteran quarterbacks available for streaming in Week 7, the Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence (vs. LAR) and the Panthers' Bryce Young (at NYJ) do not have great matchups. So it is that we must recommend Pittsburgh Steelers starter Aaron Rodgers (13.7%) for a road game against the Cincinnati Bengals . The Bengals have not played great defense this season. Rodgers scored 17.5 points in Sunday's win over the Cleveland Browns , his best game since Week 1. The Arizona Cardinals ruled out Kyler Murray (foot) and started longtime backup Jacoby Brissett versus the Colts. Brissett (0.5%) scored 20.7 points, more than Murray has in any of his five games this season. We've seen Brissett fill in before with occasional success, but if Murray is out this week, there are surely better options since the Cardinals face the Green Bay Packers this week. If one is that desperate, note that new Bengals starter Joe Flacco scored 18.76 points in his debut. He faces the Steelers this week. Running back Kimani Vidal ended up being the replacement of choice with Omarion Hampton out in Week 6. Carmen Mandato/Getty Images Kimani Vidal , Los Angeles Chargers (27.1%): Someone had to pick up the running back duties with starter Omarion Hampton (ankle) shelved, and we had a good idea it would be some combination of Vidal and Hassan Haskins . Most sided with Haskins (49.7%), since he played at Michigan for Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh. Wrong choice! These coaches just keep everyone guessing! Vidal enjoyed a far greater performance, turning 21 touches into 138 yards and 22.8 points. Haskins had seven touches. Add Vidal for Week 7 against the Indianapolis Colts , while noting Hampton might miss more time than originally expected. Tyjae Spears , Tennessee Titans (23.6%): Spears (ankle) made his season debut in Week 5 with little statistical consequence. In Week 6, he turned nine touches into 50 yards and 9.0 points, outpacing starter Tony Pollard , who scored 6.7 points on 12 touches. The elusive Spears does his best work catching passes, and perhaps the Titans will use him even more in Week 7 against the Patriots. For now, Pollard investors have little to worry about. Bam Knight , Cardinals (5.6%): We featured Michael Carter in this space last week, as he appeared to be the Arizona running back of choice with James Conner and Trey Benson sidelined. On Saturday, a day before facing the Colts, rather surprising word came that the Cardinals intended to give Knight, with his third NFL organization before his 25th birthday, a chance at first-team volume. Knight scored a touchdown and notched 12.4 points on his 12 touches Sunday, but he didn't differentiate himself much from Carter, who scored 8.4 points on 11 touches. Knight is likely to be a bit overrated this week for the game against a tough Packers team. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Steelers starter Jaylen Warren (knee) returned from a few weeks off and scored 8.3 points against the Browns. Meanwhile, Kenneth Gainwell (56.8%) caught six passes (though for only 14 yards), but his overall output was 9.6 points. This remains a timeshare, with Warren clearly the preferred choice. Although Gainwell has reached double-digit points in only one game, he continues to matter at a weak position in fantasy. The Vikings and Texans enjoyed the bye in Week 6, and all four of the running backs for these teams relevant to fantasy remain rostered in more than 50% of leagues. Still, check your league for Texans Nick Chubb (68.2%) and Woody Marks (59.7%), as they face the Seahawks this week. They still come preferred to Browns backups Jerome Ford (24.9%) and Dylan Sampson (14.3%), who combined for 12.4 points in Sunday's loss. Wide receiver play 1:26 What to make of the Patriots WR performance in Week 6 of fantasy Field Yates breaks down the surprising performance from Kayshon Boutte and DeMario Douglas in the Patriots' win over the Saints. Kayshon Boutte , Patriots (7.0%): Boutte was featured in this space after his solid Week 1 outing, in which he caught six passes for 103 yards against the Las Vegas Raiders . Then Boutte caught a measly seven passes for 105 yards over the next four games , making his opening-week output look mighty aberrant. Well, the rather inconsistent Boutte returned to relevance Sunday against the New Orleans Saints , catching all five of his targets for 93 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Does any of this mean Boutte will have a big Week 7 game against the Titans? Nope, but QB Drake Maye is terrific, and the Titans, well, are not. Pats teammate DeMario Douglas (6.7%) scored 16.1 points Sunday, and he also gets to face the Titans! Josh Downs , Colts (41.5%): Downs has reached double-digit points in three of six games so far. Those are the ones in which he has seven or more targets from resurgent QB Daniel Jones . In the other three games, Downs has not been targeted much, so he has not done much. We can't be sure Jones will target Downs this week against the Chargers, but at this point, fantasy managers need to trust Jones, and Downs feels a bit too available. In addition, the Colts face the Titans in Week 8. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Harrison might not play in Week 7 against the Packers, which means more attention for Michael Wilson (3.9%), Zay Jones (0.1%) and Greg Dortch (0.2%). Yeah, it's not exactly a Hall of Fame crew for a Cardinals QB (to be named later) to throw to without Harrison (though TE Trey McBride might see 20 targets in Week 7). Jones scored 12.9 points in Sunday's loss, but Wilson has been involved in the offense all season, and he feels more likely to matter. Similarly, we do not know if Buccaneers rookie star Egbuka will be available to play on ""Monday Night Football"" against the Lions. Tez Johnson (0.0%), a rookie selected in the seventh round from Oregon, made the highlight reels with his 45-yard, fingertip touchdown, but it was his only catch Sunday. Kameron Johnson (0.0%) played more snaps and saw four targets, converting one into a touchdown. We recommend veteran Sterling Shepard (14.8%) first, then Kameron Johnson, but while Bucs head coach Todd Bowles already ruled out Chris Godwin Jr . and RB Bucky Irving out for Week 7, for all we know Egbuka, and Mike Evans (hamstring) could still play. It is early in the week, but make plans in case neither can go. San Francisco 49ers reserve Kendrick Bourne caught 10 passes for 142 yards while filling in for Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings in Week 5, scoring a cool 24.2 points. He followed that up on Sunday with five catches for another 142 yards and a still-cool 19.2 points. Bourne, 29, has been around for a while and never surpassed 800 receiving yards in a season. At this rate of 142 yards per game, he would get there well before Thanksgiving. It is possible the 49ers QB (to be named later) will ignore Bourne when everyone else becomes healthy (including TE George Kittle ), but take a chance for Week 7 against the Falcons. Texans rookie Jayden Higgins (22.9%) caught five passes on six targets over the first four games of the season prior to the bye week, and then in Week 5 against the Ravens he caught four passes on as many targets. Perhaps star Nico Collins is the lone Texans WR worth relying on, but Higgins was a fantastic college player at Iowa State and a second-round draft pick. He should matter soon. Tight end Harold Fannin Jr ., Browns (29.1%): This isn't really an emerging passing game to invest in (yet), but Fannin caught 7 of 10 targets from fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel against the Steelers, and some of them came after starting TE David Njoku (knee) left early. Perhaps Njoku will miss some time. Fannin has scored double-digit points in three of six games, and the Browns face the Miami Dolphins in Week 7. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Raiders star Brock Bowers (knee) has missed consecutive games, much to the chagrin of fantasy managers who expected another monster season. Backup Michael Mayer (3.1%) caught 5 of 7 targets for 50 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, his 16.0 points eclipsing any performance from Bowers this season. There will not be controversy for the Raiders, for Bowers is the starter when healthy, but Mayer is the only healthy one for this week. Seahawks starter AJ Barner (10.1%) continues to produce fantasy-relevant numbers, but managers continue to rely on underachievers such as Njoku and the Ravens' Mark Andrews . Barner scored 10.1 points against the Jaguars, the fourth time in five weeks he reached double digits. His is not major volume, and his touchdown rate is a bit high, but you can trust him in Week 7 and drop him for his bye in Week 8. Bye weeks: Keep these players rostered Bye weeks continue in Week 7 with the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens taking off. For the Bills, fantasy managers might wish to part with WRs Keon Coleman (75.5%) and Khalil Shakir (76.8%), along with TE Dalton Kincaid (78.7%). In each case, it would be more prudent to keep these players on your bench rather than dumping them for one-week fixes, if you can help it. This remains one of the top offenses in the league. Move on from the Bills D/ST (62.1%), though. The bye week comes at a good time for the struggling Ravens, who might get QB Lamar Jackson (hamstring) back for Week 8 against the Bears. Fantasy managers must keep RB Derrick Henry and WR Zay Flowers through the bye as well. That is not the case with veteran TE Mark Andrews (84.3%), who scored 6.6 points on Sunday and boasts more than half of his season total from one Week 3 game. Meanwhile, why is the Ravens D/ST (41.0%) still so popular? Only the Cowboys D/ST has been worse for fantasy! Defense/special teams Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts The Browns continue to struggle to score points, so although the Dolphins don't exactly play awesome defense, the Miami D/ST (2.5%) unit appears to be a useful streamer for Week 7. The Giants D/ST (18.3%) scored 8.0 points in the victory over the Eagles, and it will face a Denver Broncos offense that scored only one touchdown in Week 6. The Giants have registered three or more sacks in half their games, and they create turnovers. Go with the Giants over the scuffling New York Jets (9.1%), who face the seemingly easier opponent in the Panthers. The Panthers have scored 57 points over the past two games and feature Dowdle and star rookie WR Tetairoa McMillan .",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/46584020/fantasy-football-free-agent-pickups-waiver-wire-nfl-week-7,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559686_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,b46aca02b03b7691ec7e31ed1b303f5ed7da5725
ef057c648bad,Fantasy hockey pickups: Zeev Buium's power-play success leads defensemen,,"The 2025-26 NHL season is underway, and every team has played at least twice in the league's first week, with the New York Rangers playing a league-leading four times. If you're in daily leagues, paying attention to the upcoming schedule and player pickups is essential to keeping your roster competitive. Every Monday, we'll mine the waiver wire for lesser-rostered performers who have the potential to help fantasy teams in a variety of leagues. We'll also present several strong streaming candidates for the immediate week ahead. Resources: Goalie depth chart | Daily lines | Projections | Play for free | Player rater | Most added/dropped | Mock draft lobby | How to watch Forwards Anton Lundell , LW, Florida Panthers (2.87 FPPG, 38.0% available): While the best advice is to not overreact to early-season results that get amplified by the excitement of the return of hockey, you don't want to sleep on a potential breakout when there are other reasons to buy in. Lundell's availability is slipping quickly, but there might still be time to pickup the Panthers' answer to Aleksander Barkov 's likely season-long absence. Bonus for custom leagues: Lundell's LW eligibility is like getting a free extra center in your lineup. It's your league.  Run it how you want. Choose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in. Create your custom league for free! Elias Lindholm , RW, Boston Bruins (3.43 FPPG, 35.9% available): While we are on centers you can sneak into your lineup at other positions, can you find it in your heart to forgive Lindholm's disappointing first season with the Bruins? The Bruins have seemingly forgiven him and trotted him back as the center atop their very top-heavy depth chart. Lindholm has two goals and two assists across the first three games, and looking like he's in sync with David Pastrnak this season. Shane Pinto , C, Ottawa Senators (5.10 FPPG, 69.9% available): Set aside for a moment Pinto's role as a member of the Senators top power-play unit; his even-strength line with Claude Giroux and Ridly Greig already has three goals across two games when on the ice together. They are also one of the top 10 lines early in the season for shot attempts rate. Now, recall that Pinto also gets to take the ice with Ottawa's top catalysts on the advantage. Matty Beniers , C, Seattle Kraken (3.00 FPPG, 85.9% available): It makes sense when you consider the results to this point of his career, but it still looks weird to see Beniers available in the vast majority of fantasy leagues. Before you get completely tired of him, remember he isn't 23 until November and the early returns from this season show him as the Kraken's true No. 1 center. His line with Jared McCann and Jordan Eberle is getting top-tier 5-on-5 minutes and staying together on the power play. Marco Kasper , C, Detroit Red Wings (2.00 FPPG, 30.1% available): Just like the 2021-22 version of Dylan Strome , Kasper finds himself between Patrick Kane and Alex DeBrincat . While Kasper's wingers are on a different team and a little longer in the tooth, there is still a lot of potential. This line is fourth in shot attempts rate in the league at this stage, but is also a wash on scoring with two goals for and two against. Kasper also has a physical component to his game and should remain fantasy relevant through a combo of points and hits. See also: Oliver Bjorkstrand , RW, Tampa Bay Lightning (2.25 FPPG, 79.5% available) Dmitri Voronkov , LW, Columbus Blue Jackets (2.60 FPPG, 35.3% available) Andrei Kuzmenko , LW, Los Angeles Kings (2.27 FPPG, 82.5% available) Leo Carlsson , C, Anaheim Ducks (2.60 FPPG, 77.4% available) Artturi Lehkonen , LW, Colorado Avalanche (2.33 FPPG, 62.0% available) Owen Tippett , RW, Philadelphia Flyers (2.00 FPPG, 35.5% available) Defense Zeev Buium , D, Minnesota Wild (3.05 FPPG, 70.3% available): The optimist wants to recommend a pickup of Buium because he is getting full control of the blue line for the Wild power play and the results have been great. But that minus-4 rating is very real. Buium and Jared Spurgeon have been on the ice for zero goals and allowed three at 5-on-5. It's made more stark by two other Wild D pairs both sitting in the top five for shot attempts rate in the league, as Spurgeon and Buium rank 61st. Alexander Nikishin , D, Carolina Hurricanes (2.25 FPPG, 90.1% available): Third pair, schmird pair. Nikishin and Shayne Gostisbehere have averaged 12:41 together at 5-on-5 and have been on the ice for five -- yes, a league-leading five for a defensive pair -- goals at even strength. Aaron Ekblad , D, Florida Panthers (1.87 FPPG, 62.8% available): Maybe we got a little too hyped on the shiny new toy by collectively drafting Seth Jones and mostly ignoring Ekblad. But they are both on the Cats' top power-play unit, and that will probably stay true at least until Matthew Tkachuk returns later this season. Ekblad and Gustav Forsling are a formidable first pair and have been dominating the shot attempts through three games (61.8% Corsi for), with four goals while they are on the ice together. Andrew Peeke , D, Boston Bruins (2.73 FPPG, 93.3% available): His 6.7 fantasy points from only hits and blocked shots is the early high-water mark for the season. If you are looking for a cheap defender that can contribute at the bottom of your lineup, look no further. Sam Rinzel , D, Chicago Blackhawks (2.03 FPPG, 81.0% available): Averaging 3:43 per game on the power play? Almost all of that with Connor Bedard and the top unit? And only one goal allowed at 5-on-5 with his regular defense partner, Matt Grzelcyk ? Sign us up. See also: John Klingberg , D, San Jose Sharks (2.45 FPPG, 96.8% available) Simon Edvinsson , D, Detroit Red Wings (2.40 FPPG, 34.5% available) Matt Roy , D, Washington Capitals (2.10 FPPG, 86.6% available) Artem Zub , D, Ottawa Senators (3.60 FPPG, 92.6% available) Goaltenders Karel Vejmelka , G, Utah Mammoth (2.50 FPPG, 67.9% available): The Blackhawks, Flames, Sharks and Bruins are on tap for this week and none of the games are in back-to-back sets. Vejmelka might be seen in a much more positive light at this time next week, and his 5.0 fantasy points per game aren't exactly shabby at the moment. Scott Wedgewood , G, Colorado Avalanche (3.93 FPPG, 59.8% available): Mackenzie Blackwood is likely out for at least two more games, perhaps longer. Wedgewood is reaping the benefit in the meantime, with 11.8 fantasy points and 100% crease share. The Sabres and Blue Jackets are on tap to start the week. See also: Short-term streamers Justin Brazeau , RW, Pittsburgh Penguins (2.97 FPPG, 88.1% available): The potential for Brazeau to continue earning his fantasy keep depends entirely on Evgeni Malkin . Can Geno keep up this pace? Probably not. Still, you could do worse in the short-term in deeper leagues. Ryan O'Reilly , C, Nashville Predators (1.70 FPPG, 35.2% available): Defensive fantasy metrics don't mean too much this early in the season, but it's at least worth noting that the Predators have the best fantasy schedule on paper, with a four-game road trip through Canada against the Senators, Leafs, Canadiens and Jets. It's worth starting O'Reilly on his volume alone, but the opponents also bode well. Frank Nazar , C, Chicago Blackhawks (3.00 FPPG, 59.3% available): Combine O'Reilly with Nazar and you have a center to start every day of the week. Playing away from Bedard at even strength, Nazar is more than holding his own with Teuvo Teravainen and Tyler Bertuzzi on his flanks. The trio has three goals at 5-on-5 (granted, also two against). Jack McBain , C, Utah Mammoth (2.30 FPPG, 94.8% available): If Barrett Hayton continues to miss time, McBain gets to continue playing up the lineup alongside Clayton Keller and Nick Schmaltz . Tristan Jarry , G, Pittsburgh Penguins (4.80 FPPG, 71.0% available): This is a very cautious recommendation. Jarry looked good in his start against the Islanders and, on paper, the Ducks, Kings and Sharks are collectively a solid schedule for a goaltender. But there are concerns. The Ducks have dominated possession through two games, and the Sharks have handed out negative fantasy points to opposing goaltenders. That said, looking for goalie help in the early season isn't easy and Jarry will be available.",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/hockey/story/_/id/46583778/espn-nhl-fantasy-hockey-waiver-wire-free-agents-pickups-anton-lundell-zees-buium,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559645_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,de3d69944667ed9e18224f3780b787d51eb59b66
14e95cc6e93e,"First bets for Week 7: The Bucs' run stops here, Giants cover in Denver",,"Oct 13, 2025, 02:05 PM ET Week 7 gets underway with a matchup of AFC North rivals, as the Pittsburgh Steelers visit the Cincinnati Bengals on ""Thursday Night Football."" Sunday's slate begins with the Los Angeles Rams and Jacksonville Jaguars meeting at Wembley Stadium in London, and the Indianapolis Colts visiting the Los Angeles Chargers highlights the late afternoon window of games. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Detroit Lions get together in a battle of offensive juggernauts to kick off a ""Monday Night Football"" doubleheader, and the night wraps up with the Houston Texans visiting the Seattle Seahawks . Eric Karabell, Pamela Maldonado, Matt Bowen, Eric Moody, Joe Fortenbaugh and Seth Walder looked at the early Week 7 odds and identified which ones are worth jumping on now before potential shifts later in the week. Note: Odds at time of publication, courtesy of ESPN BET Sportsbook Bowen: Cleveland is averaging only 13.7 PPG this season, the second fewest in the league. And when you watch the Browns on tape, with Dillon Gabriel at quarterback, they aren't built to create explosive plays at a high rate. This feels like a game (based on the matchup) where rookie running back Quinshon Judkins is featured. Control tempo while leaning on your defense to limit Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami pass game. The game is in Cleveland, too. Take the under. Last week: Buccaneers -2.5 vs. 49ers (Buccaneers won, 30-19) Fortenbaugh: This luckbox Buccaneers run is coming to a screeching halt at some point in the near future, so we might as well lean into the projected regression with a Lions team playing at home off a loss. Tampa Bay is now 5-1 on the season with a point differential of +14. To put that into perspective, the Seahawks are 4-2 with a point differential of +49 and the Texans are 2-3 with a point differential of +47. Throw in the myriad injuries to the Tampa receiving unit and you've got Detroit covering the 4.5 and restoring order to the NFC. Last week: Steelers -4.5 vs. Browns (Steelers won, 23-9) Karabell: Let's stop a bit short of expecting Joe Flacco and the Bengals to win the game, but it is a home game against a heated rival on a short week, and the addition of Flacco does change things. It's not like Pittsburgh's QB is some young fellow. Flacco should keep this game close in the fourth quarter, at the least. I would not take the Steelers in pools. This is a field goal game at the end. Last week: Ravens-Rams over 45.5 (Rams won, 17-3) Maldonado: The Giants are quietly figuring it out with Jaxson Dart . You can feel the shift. They finally have an identity. Run the ball, control the clock, make the other team uncomfortable. Dart isn't putting up video game numbers, but he's doing exactly what this offense needs: extending plays. The defense is starting to look nasty too, especially up front with Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux collapsing pockets. It's not flashy, but it's effective. Going into Denver, this feels like another one of those ugly, grind-it-out games. The Giants are now built for that. Last week: Eagles-Giants under 42 (Giants won, 34-17) All of ESPN.

Sign Up Now Moody: The Panthers have won two straight and scored 27 or more points in three of their last four games. Rico Dowdle erupted for 234 total yards two weeks ago and piled on 239 more in a Week 6 win over Dallas, and Carolina's defense shut down Javonte Williams and Cowboys' running game. The Jets, meanwhile, managed just 82 total yards against the Broncos in London, the third-lowest single-game total in franchise history. With momentum on their side and New York reeling, this is a great spot to back Carolina. The Panthers are 4-1 against the spread in their last five games. Last week: 49ers +2.5 at Buccaneers (Buccaneers won, 30-19) Walder: I'll be the first one to say throw out any historical stats about how often 1-5 teams make the playoffs when it comes to the 2025 Ravens. Most 1-5 teams are simply bad, and despite whatever we have seen from Baltimore thus far, I don't think anyone expects that this is a bad team going forward. And almost none of those teams have a perennial MVP candidate like Lamar Jackson , either. And rarely have those teams faced the hardest schedule in the NFL (as the Ravens have) and will face the 27th-hardest schedule going forward (as the Ravens will). It's because all of that that I was perfectly prepared to argue for Baltimore's chances to make the playoffs -- and then I saw the odds. The 1-5 Ravens are even money to miss the playoffs? They certainly could come back, but 50/50? That surprised me, and it certainly would shock FPI. The model, which assumes Jackson returns after the team's Week 7 bye, gives the Ravens only a 25% chance to make the playoffs. The Ravens will need a lot to go their way to play playoff football again.

27517ad7976b,WWE 'Raw' takeaways: The Vision is blurred,,"The Vision has been blinded. After weeks of doubt and questions about what would happen if Seth Rollins were to lose at Crown Jewel, Rollins did what he had to do to beat Cody Rhodes on Saturday. It immediately cost him. Bron Breakker proverbially poked Seth Rollins in the eye with a shocking speech to end ""Raw,"" sending The Vision trio into the rearview mirror. This was particularly surprising, because Rollins began ""Raw"" by heaping effusive praise onto Breakker, Bronson Reed and Paul Heyman individually. The big surprise breakup finished off a show full of left turns, from Dominik Mysterio again using deception to keep his Intercontinental title to Asuka and Kairi Sane's tumultuous relationship to Lyra Valkyria finally, maybe, figuring Bayley out? Here are the biggest takeaways for the WWE's last day in Perth, Australia. Oct. 13 ""Raw"" results • Intercontinental champion Dominik Mysterio defeats Penta by pinfall • Rhea Ripley defeats Kairi Sane by pinfall • Bronson Reed defeats Jimmy Uso by pinfall • Bayley and Lyra Valkyria defeat Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez by pinfall • CM Punk defeats LA Knight and Jey Uso A Vision breakup already? Rollins opened the show with a strong promo that celebrated Breakker, Reed and Heyman, but the fact that Heyman had issued an ultimatum before Crown Jewel to drop Rollins, should he lose to Rhodes, was glaringly absent from Rollins' address. In fact, Rollins doubled down, saying later in the show, ""This is the mountaintop. ... Rarified air."" He now needs an oxygen mask at the summit, because Breakker and Reed have put a target on his back. The Vision collapse certainly came as a big surprise -- firstly because it came immediately after CM Punk won a triple-threat match over Jey Uso and LA Knight to position himself as the No.1 contender to Rollins' World Heavyweight Championship title. Secondly, Heyman raised Reed and Breakker's arms following their attack on Rollins, seemingly leaving Rollins alone and broken. With adversaries now in every corner and nobody in his, the water is perilous for the Visionary and his hopes to remain World Heavyweight champion. I question the timing of this attack. Breakker is a future world champion and Reed has picked up incredible victories over Roman Reigns, but this feud feels sudden and too soon. Perhaps an extra layer of intrigue was needed in the Punk vs. Rollins saga? Maybe the Brons will cost Rollins his world title and then battle each other? More ""Raw"" takeaways • Dominik Mysterio continues to find dastardly but clever ways to retain his Intercontinental Championship. Against Penta, he distracted the timekeeper to steal the bell hammer, then placed his Intercontinental title in the middle of the ring. While the referee was busy clearing the belt from the ring, Mysterio hit Penta in the knee with the hammer and then stuffed it in his boot to deliver a 619 and hit the frog splash to retain his title. These clever ""by the skin of his teeth"" victories continue to play well on screen and entertain WWE crowds, who count 1-2-3 along with the refs and cheer Dom's antics. • The Kabuki Warriors have implosion written all over them, but for now, they are hanging on by a thread. Asuka yelled at and slapped Kairi Sane before Sane's match with Rhea Ripley, which Sane lost. But Asuka got a measure of revenge by delivering a DDT to Ripley on the announcers' table, and the scene ended with Asuka arm-in-arm with Sane over Ripley. Do these two teams (Ripley and Iyo Sky and The Kabuki Warriors) find three more partners and battle at Survivor Series: WarGames on Nov. 29? • In the past 48 hours, Reed and Ripley have gone 4-0 in front of home crowds. What kind of alternate WWE universe are we living in? • Remember the Festus character in the 2000s? He was kind and mild-mannered, but as soon as a bell rang and he heard it, he became a monster. It feels like Bayley has a version of that going on. Lyra Valkyria got the happy version of Bayley as they entered their match with Judgment Day, but Valkyria needed the vicious Bayley, so she slapped her to unlock her meanness, leading to the win. As WWE commentator Michael Cole noted, ""Has Lyra figured Bayley out?""",https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/46582955/wwe-raw-results-seth-rollins-paul-heyman-vison-breaks-up,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559644_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,002e51557afec5605fe3376d30721f971877a233

Star and role players alike made highlight-worthy plays throughout the week, helping their teams secure important victories. But only one player can be ""him."" Ahead of this week's ""Monday Night Football"" doubleheader featuring the Buffalo Bills versus the Atlanta Falcons and the Chicago Bears at the Washington Commanders , it was time to decide who earned the honor on Sunday. Here are the fan-voted results for ESPN's NFL Week 5 ""Himmy"" Award: Here's how each ""Himmy"" nominee made his case in Week 5. ESPN Research contributed to this story. Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes Stats to know: 22-30, 257 yards, 3 TDs Leading the Chiefs to their third win in their past four games, Mahomes was in fine form as Kansas City took down the Detroit Lions 30-17 . In addition to leading an efficient and diverse passing game -- eight different Chiefs recorded a reception on Sunday night -- Mahomes assisted his squad on the ground as well. The star quarterback recorded a rushing touchdown, leaving his mark on all four of Kansas City's trips to the end zone in its big win. It was Mahomes' second game this season with four combined passing and rushing touchdowns. He had no such games last season and has had just one such game over the previous two seasons combined. Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Baker Mayfield Stats to know: 17-23, 256 yards, 2 TDs The Buccaneers are 5-1 on the season, with the performance of their quarterback in Week 6 playing a major role. Mayfield's biggest play Sunday came late in the third quarter as Tampa Bay was looking to add some cushion to a one-point lead. On second-and-11, Mayfield uncorked a 45-yard pass to wide receiver Tez Johnson for the rookie's first career touchdown to put the Buccaneers up by eight in the 30-19 win. Mayfield is the first quarterback with 1,500 passing yards, 12 passing touchdowns and no more than one interception in his team's first six games of a season since Patrick Mahomes in 2020. New England Patriots QB Drake Maye Stats to know: 18-26, 261 yards, 3 TDs Maye and the Patriots have now won three consecutive games, with New England's second-year quarterback leading his team to victory against the New Orleans Saints . Completing nearly 70% of his passes in the road triumph, Maye threw for 261 yards and a trio of first-half touchdowns -- two of which went to Kayshon Boutte -- as the Patriots came out on top 25-19 . Maye became the first Patriots player to throw for 250 yards and three touchdowns in a victory since Tom Brady (Oct. 6, 2019). Carolina Panthers RB Rico Dowdle Stats to know: 239 total yards from scrimmage, 1 TD It was another huge week for Dowdle as the Carolina Panthers earned a win over his former team, the Dallas Cowboys . The running back enjoyed a productive day both receiving (four receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown) and rushing (183 yards on 30 carries) as the Panthers posted a 30-27 win after a game-winning field goal by Ryan Fitzgerald . Dowdle's 239 scrimmage yards marked the most by any player against a former team since yards were first tracked in 1933.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46583304/patrick-mahomes-baker-mayfield-drake-maye-rico-dowdle-himmy-award-week-6,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fnfl_week6_4_split_16x9.jpg,,b6cc1faefb4f870c199daf408617d633c49e0383
a2275066df36,Dutch-born players making Suriname World Cup dreams a reality,,"Suriname sits atop its World Cup qualifying group, putting it on course to reach the tournament for the first time in history. Ben Nichols/ISI Photos/ISI Photos via Getty Images PARAMARIBO, Suriname -- The referee had blown his whistle, but no one at the Franklin Essed Stadion left the stands. The drummers kept drumming, the horn players kept playing, and the Suriname men's national team took a lap around the field. The hosts, known by fans as the Natio , appeared headed for their first defeat in World Cup qualifying , but a stunning stoppage-time goal by Virgil Misidjan earned a 1-1 draw with visiting Guatemala and the point that comes with it. Misidjan's missile nearly hit his own goalkeeper, Etienne Vaessen , who came up to try to create chaos on a corner kick. But Vaessen jumped out of the way as Misidjan took a shot from outside the box, giving Guatemala goalkeeper Nicholas Hagen only a slight glimpse as it passed him and leveled the score. Halfway through the final round of World Cup qualification, Suriname is atop the Group A standings . It's the closest the country has come to qualification since the 1970s, and if it can stay there for another three matches, its first World Cup awaits. After last Friday's match, Vaessen couldn't avoid being drawn into the crowd that pressed along the fence, with child after child and fan after fan asking for a selfie or an autograph. They are national heroes, yet Vaessen was not born here. Neither was Misidjan. In fact, only one player who saw action in Friday's tie, forward Gleofilo Vlijter , grew up in Suriname. The rest hail from the Netherlands -- which colonized the area in the 17th century and ruled it until 1975 -- and are eligible to play for the nation via their parents or grandparents. But watching the crowd clamor for Vaessen, it was clear: This is Suriname's team. - A dash of Eredivisie and MLS: Why Indonesia is 'not like before' - 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it - The evolution of the World Cup ball as 2026's Trionda is unveiled ""They love football,"" Vaessen told ESPN. ""There was that question at first, 'Oh, the players are from Europe,' but I feel at home here. I give everything for the country, and they feel that, too. I keep good, so they're happy with me. I'm happy with them. I can make time for a little selfie to make people happy. It's really important."" Indeed, soccer has a long history in Suriname. Club team Transvaal twice won the Concacaf Champions Cup, and Surinamese players' influence on Dutch football has been strong. Edgar Davids, Aron Winter and Clarence Seedorf, plus current Suriname manager Stanley Menzo and assistant Henk Fraser, were born in the Caribbean nation but instead represented the Netherlands. Until recently, though, soccer in Suriname was in a decades-long swoon. Though FIFA regulations permit players with a grandparent from that country who acquire a passport, it was only ahead of its 2021 return to the Concacaf Gold Cup , its first participation in the continental championship in 36 years, that Suriname's government would issue athletes passports without requiring them to surrender their other nationality. The change was spearheaded by Menzo's predecessor as Suriname manager, Dean Gorré. Another ex-pro born in Suriname, Gorré was in his second spell managing the team, and after earning the Gold Cup place, he and his staff lobbied government officials to make a change that would benefit the national soccer teams but also could make Suriname successful in Olympic sports. ""We qualified for the Gold Cup with amateurs, which was fantastic,"" Gorré said. ""After that, we constantly spoke to the people in the government. I told them why it's so important for us to represent Suriname on the highest level and what the country can achieve from this. Finally, it went into a discussion and they said, 'We're going to make it happen.'"" After that, players who had wanted to suit up for Suriname committed quickly, with more than two dozen new recruits joining since. They are helping Suriname not just improve but compete almost immediately for something many people here never thought they would see: a place in the World Cup. Doing so would bring a great deal of joy to Suriname, something Menzo remembers a lot of growing up in Paramaribo, where he learned not only shot stopping as a goalkeeper, but also how to use his feet. That made him a perfect choice as the No. 1 for new Ajax manager Johan Cruyff in 1985-86, and Menzo went on to win a pair of European trophies with the Dutch giants in more than 200 appearances. ""When I left in 1971, this country was a paradise,"" Menzo told ESPN. ""Because I came back often, I saw it go down."" Suriname's independence in 1975 left a power vacuum that was eventually filled in 1980 by a military coup . One of the bleakest moments of that transitional period came in December 1982, when coup leader Dési Bouterse rounded up more than a dozen prominent critics and had them executed . Among them was André Kamperveen, who became the first Surinamese player to play in the Netherlands' top flight. He went on to captain (and later manage) the national team, and he was also an administrator, becoming a FIFA vice president and founding the Caribbean Football Union, a sub-confederation in Concacaf. Just months before his death, he had attended the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. Some years later, a social worker named Sonny Hasnoe brought together a group of Surinamese players plying their trade in the Netherlands dubbed the ""Colorful Eleven"" that played various friendly matches, hosting Surinamese club SV Robinhood in 1986 and playing the next two years in the Netherlands. In 1989, they were en route to a mini-tournament in Suriname when tragedy struck. Surinam Airways Flight 764 from Amsterdam to Paramaribo crashed in what accident investigators later determined was a cascading series of pilot errors made by the American flight crew contracted to fly for the airline. Some 178 people died, including 15 members of the Colorful Eleven's traveling party. Menzo was set to take part in the tournament but landed in the country a day earlier than most of the group. ""It comes back in your memory, in your life for a few days. Then it's gone again,"" Menzo said. ""The 7th of June, we'll always remember it. Sometimes, I think about it. I see a picture and think about it, but it's not something that's constantly with us. We live in the now and have moments far behind us."" The now that the Natio lives in is giving the country a reason to celebrate, as they did last month with a draw against Panama and a win at El Salvador , plus Friday's draw that set off the jubilant moments. ""We need some positivity,"" Menzo said. ""We hope we can give the country that with football. Football, especially in this country, is a sport for everybody. Everybody loves football. Suriname went to San Salvador last month and emerged with a surprise late win over El Salvador. MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images ""We're very proud as Surinamese people. It's good to give them that pride back. Suriname always was negative in the news, and now it's something positive."" The hope extends far beyond Suriname, back to the family, friends and other members of the diaspora in Europe. ""I came from Amsterdam, and everywhere I walk, people talk to me about Suriname, how we have to qualify,"" winger Sheraldo Becker told ESPN. ""They want us to do it for them; we want to do it for our country. More for them than for ourselves."" The attention that Suriname is receiving from the Netherlands isn't helping only the national team, as many Dutch-Surinamese players are taking their own steps to pay homage to their roots. Both of UEFA Champions League winner Georginio Wijnaldum 's parents are from Suriname, and he recently partnered with an organization to help fund renovations to a public school. Though Wijnaldum's nearly 100 appearances for the Dutch national team make him ineligible to take the field for Suriname, he wore a red Natio jersey with his name and No. 8 on the back on Friday, taking in the match from one of the few semi-private areas in the 3,150-seat stadium. Wijnaldum hopes others will follow his lead by getting involved with projects on the ground in Suriname, and not just soccer players. Many people in Suriname are excited about the potential of outside investment from other sectors helping bolster sport, culture and other elements of society they believe are neglected. ""It doesn't just mean a lot to me but for the country,"" Wijnaldum told ESPN in Paramaribo. ""I did something for charity, which is positive, but hopefully other people -- not just footballers, but people who have money -- can invest in things here to give children and the people of a country a better future. ""I think the football team is really good to help the county move forward."" All of ESPN. All in one place.

""If Suriname does qualify for the World Cup, it would go worldwide,"" said Jean-Pierre Ristra, who works in marketing and helps run a cafe. ""There'd be more attention for the young ladies, the youth team, to give them football as a profession. That would open a whole lot more doors."" Suriname heads into Tuesday's match in Panama with a chance to get another road win in Central America and go at least two points clear at the top of the group with two games left. Of course, it will not be easy against pre-round favorites Panama, who has the same opportunity -- also sitting on five points but behind Suriname because of goals scored. Before this cycle with its expanded 48-team World Cup field, the closest Suriname has ever come to making the World Cup came in 1977. The Natio won its side of the Caribbean bracket and traveled to Mexico for the 1977 Concacaf Championship that served as a qualifier. Only the winner went through to the 1978 World Cup tournament, and Suriname finished in last, failing to earn a point. Still, that team is fondly remembered, with Menzo inviting several veterans of that squad to speak to the team at an event two nights before the Guatemala match. There is a hope that this current group of Dutch-Surinamese players can find strength in what Surinamese soccer was in the 1970s and 1980s and once again make the nation relevant regionally, if not beyond. ""I have to feel like I'm one of those carrying on the legacy. I know where Suriname was, and I know where we are now,"" Menzo said. ""The whole process with players abroad started somewhere -- not with me. It's a long road, and everybody is part of this legacy. Now, I'm part of the legacy. We're in a stage where we can finalize it. ""That's what I told the former players of 1977: You were on the step of a World Cup, but maybe the step was too big for you at the time. Now, we're also a step from qualification. What you couldn't achieve, let's try to achieve it now. We have a strong belief we can achieve it -- but belief and achieving it are different things.""",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46578654/dutch-born-players-making-suriname-world-cup-dreams-reality,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559585_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,9bbd47117b31cf89049c3c32a1776e244c0ad3b8
429eb6ffd15d,Fantasy basketball: One thing you shouldn't be surprised with this season ... for every NBA team,,"Many statistical surprises will occur during the upcoming NBA season, and fantasy managers should be prepared for all the angles for their leagues, regardless of format. Here are potential surprises for each team for fantasy purposes. Will some/most/few of these things occur? Don't be surprised if ... Johnson might have gotten to that level last season if not for the shoulder injury that shut him down in January. Johnson can be a 20/10 player with more than a block, steal and 3-pointer per game. Who does that? Not many players. If he gets hurt again, we must reevaluate. Brown averaged 26.6 PPG several seasons ago, but now that PF/SF Jayson Tatum is out for much of the season, he needs to score more. SG/PG Derrick White might be the better value coming two rounds later, but Brown will see a career-best in shots. Tatum (Achilles) makes his season debut in March. Stash him if you have an injured list slot, but not for the bench in redraft formats. Demin, 19, played a season for BYU, and while he didn't shoot particularly well or score as much as many expected, he is a gifted passer and, at 6-foot-9, he rebounds well. There will be triple-doubles in his future. The Nets have a few scorers. Demin, despite his rookie status, will end up on fantasy rosters this season. He might be the No. 2 rookie for fantasy, too. Charlotte Hornets PG LaMelo Ball maddens fantasy managers for the fourth consecutive season The numbers are always terrific, except for one: Ball has performed in only 105 games over the past three seasons. He had offseason surgery on his wrist and ankle. Perhaps that fixes everything, but at least Joel Embiid has played in 60-plus games four times. Ball did it once. The Hornets are bad, which means there is a likelihood of them sitting good players after the All-Star break to tank for the draft, too. Vucevic averages 18 and 10 every season with 3-pointers and solid shooting, and finally his ADP reflects his value -- to a point. Going in the top 30 might be the highest ADP for him in a while. Perhaps that is a fair tradeoff for someone about to turn 35, but he finished last season No. 8 on the Player Rater. Ignore his defense and love the fantasy numbers. Yes, we should predict this every season until he does it. He's only 24 and still improving. Moving on. This one is cheating a bit, because nobody thinks Flagg will produce bigger numbers than C/PF Anthony Davis . He should play more, though. Davis has reached 65 games in one of the past seven seasons, and there is no reason to push him with fellow bigs Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II on the roster. Investing in Davis can be perilous for the impatient. Wonderful player, but brittle. Flagg averages 17 and 7, shoots well, and there is little reason to think he can't suit up at least 75 times. Johnson comes over in trade for Michael Porter Jr. , and while he can't possibly maintain the shooting volume he did in Brooklyn, the shots he sees should be better thanks to the passing skills of C Nikola Jokic . Johnson seems a bit too downgraded in drafts. He can still average 18 PPG. Amen Thompson , the twin brother who plays for the Houston Rockets , is the one you covet in fantasy. He scores and boards, with ample steals and blocks. The one on Detroit also goes in the top 100 of ADP, and he too should pile on the steals, but he isn't much of a scorer or shooter. Neither twin has much of an outside shot, either. Butler finished last season 77th on the Player Rater, but this isn't stopping him from being a top-50 pick in ESPN ADP. OK, so what might change for the positive? Well, Butler shouldn't be traded this season, so that's good, but he also hasn't suited up for more than 65 games since the 2016-17 campaign. It's about the playoffs for Butler. His numbers went up a bit with the Warriors last season, but not close to 20 PPG. Do not reach in drafts. That's a lot for a 7-footer who hasn't topped five APG before, but PG Fred VanVleet (knee) is done for the season, there really isn't a pure point guard available and the offense was already going through the team's center anyway. Sacramento Kings C Domantas Sabonis averaged seven APG in two seasons before last year. Sengun has the skills to do so and flirt with being a top-10 roto player as well. He was No. 19 last season. That would make Nembhard, a borderline top-100 selection in current ADP, a potential top-50 option. PG/SG Tyrese Haliburton is out for the year, and it is hard to see PG T.J. McConnell (hamstring), currently injured, seeing his minutes rise so much. Nembhard runs this team for this season and performs well. LA Clippers PG/SG James Harden finishes as the No. 3 fantasy option yet again! Harden, 36, surprised many a fantasy manager with his return to excellent statistical performance last season, when only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic topped him on the Player Rater. Why would this season be different? OK, so Harden is older than most, but this is his offense again, and he shouldn't fall to the middle of Round 2 in drafts. These fine numbers are repeatable. What?! Nothing against SGA and Jokic, but it is only natural to expect Doncic, in better shape and more comfortable in this offense, to perform better than he did for the Lakers last season. And he was great for the Lakers. SF/PF LeBron James will have another outstanding season, but Doncic will take over the offense and earn his second scoring title. He might even finish as fantasy's No. 1 player. Pippen started 21 games for last season's Grizzlies, averaging 14.2 PPG, 4.5 RPG and 5.7 APG, with steals, 3-pointers and strong shooting in them. There might not be major statistical upside for him, but PG Ja Morant (ankle) is always hurt, and Pippen is a better passer than newcomer PG Ty Jerome . Pippen is a solid late-round sleeper, and not only in deep formats. If Kel'el Ware's minutes rise as expected, the Heat big man could average a double-double in his second season. Rhona Wise-Imagn Images Ware put up solid numbers in the second half of last season when he joined the starting lineup, shifting C/PF Bam Adebayo to power forward. Now, Ware gets a nice spike in minutes. This is going to be a top-100 player, but he isn't being drafted as one. Turner, the longtime Pacer who switched allegiances, has been a fantasy fixture in roto formats for the blocked shots, and we like centers who hit 3-pointers and shoot well. We also like centers who rebound more than 6.5 times per game. That should happen now with the Bucks, who have a bit of a stripped-down roster. This nearly occurred last season, but Gobert held on with an unlikely, massive performance in April (19.4 PPG, 13.6 RPG). Otherwise, Reid was the better player in points formats, and since he is younger, more versatile and has the new contract, we should expect more minutes and production, too. Reid can rebound more than he has in the past. He averaged 18.1 PPG and 9.7 RPG as the starting center. This could be the year Gobert falls shy of 10 RPG. Murphy blossomed into a star last season, averaging 21.2 PPG, but there is clearly upside for more. He averaged 25.1 PPG during 13 January games. Murphy hasn't been the most durable option, but he looks like A.C. Green (look him up) compared with overrated PF Zion Williamson when it comes to durability. It's an odd team, with SG/PG Jordan Poole running ""point,"" but Murphy should be the signature player. Many of us are big Hart fans, but there is no way new Knicks coach Mike Brown is playing him 37.6 MPG. Hart led the league in the category last season with Tom Thibodeau relying so much on his starters. Hart already had finger surgery this summer, and his back hurts. Expect something like his 2023-24 numbers, which are fine and valuable, considering his proclivity for rebounding at a position where few do that, but not top-50 worthy. Holmgren seems to be a bargain pick in the fourth round of ESPN ADP, and his third NBA season really should deliver his best numbers yet. Perhaps potential investors are concerned about durability after Holmgren missed 50 games last season with a broken hip and lost his rookie season to a broken foot. He also played in all 82 games in 2023-24. There could be a run at 20 and 10 here, with myriad blocks and a growing number of 3-pointers. Take Holmgren over injured Grizzlies C/PF Jaren Jackson Jr . (toe). This is bold, but Bane comes from Memphis and should see excellent usage, contributing points, rebounds, assists, steals, 3-pointers and solid shooting while taking away some numbers from others. This is nothing against new teammates PF/SF Paolo Banchero and SF/PF Franz Wagner , but it's not as if they are big rebounders or 3-point shooters. Bane is the draft day bargain here. You know what, let's be optimistic that this mountain of unpredictability can suit up enough to satiate fantasy managers and average 28 PPG, 10 RPG and 1.5 BPG. Embiid (knee) isn't promising anyone anything, but he did perform in 66 and 68 games in the two seasons prior to 2023-24, so there is more of a track record for qualifying for league awards than there is for missing more than 62 games again. Take the chance if he somehow slips into the fifth round. That prediction seems like enough to pique the interest of potential investors, because production has rarely been an issue for this 7-footer. Williams averaged 15.3 PPG and 10.2 RPG for last season's Hornets over 44 games, and they couldn't wait to move him elsewhere. A trade to the Lakers failed. Williams is also an attractive fantasy option because he is a center who hits his free throws; he made more than 80% last season. The Suns can feature him. It took Clingan a while to shed the look of a raw rookie last season, but then he delivered 10.3 PPG, 11.7 RPG and 1.7 BPG in seven April contests. Can we expect that production over six months? Perhaps not, but Clingan is a legit 7-2, a huge body and a franchise building block. It wouldn't take much to make him a top-100 overall player. This is more for deeper roto formats because Schroder might not do much else for a fantasy roster, but he always seems to end up with plenty of assists. The Kings started SG/PG/SF Malik Monk 45 times last season, and he averaged 5.6 APG, but Schroder is better suited to run an offense, and Monk is a sixth-man type. Schroder fits the criteria for potential assists at little draft cost along with Utah's Isaiah Collier , Milwaukee's Kevin Porter, Clipper Chris Paul , Portland's Scoot Henderson (this is the year!) and Toronto's Immanuel Quickley . Yeah, PG De'Aaron Fox is still here, and we're not predicting bad things for him, but Castle should get ample opportunity to run the offense and set Fox up for more 3-point shots because his volume was way down last season. Castle isn't much of an outside shooter, but he can run an offense and get to the foul line. His second season should be even better than his first. Poeltl delivered career bests for Toronto last season with 14.5 PPG and 9.6 RPG, and we cannot help but notice that a player who typically hurts fantasy managers with his free throw shooting went from 55.1% to 67.4%. OK, so not exactly Mark Price (look him up) but certainly more palatable. Poeltl is annually a player to target in the sixth or seventh round. Hopefully, he can participate in 70 games. Markkanen is a draft day bargain in ESPN ADP, going outside the top 75 despite delivering huge numbers in his first two Utah campaigns. This isn't a durable player, but few complained in 2022-23 when he averaged 25.6 PPG and 8.6 RPG. He hits 3-pointers and, before last season, field goals. He's hardly too old to return to prior levels. Keeping with this mini-theme, Whitmore never had a chance in Houston, but a big scorer lurks. How about 20 PPG? He might not do much else for fantasy managers with rebounding or passing, but we should have doubts about which Wizards even stick around for 82 games. This team is tanking again. SG/PG CJ McCollum and SF Khris Middleton will be on contenders eventually. Whitmore might produce like Brooklyn's Cam Thomas statistically , except he isn't even being drafted in fantasy. Just give him the ball.",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/story/_/id/46571866/fantasy-basketball-surprised-nba-2025-26,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1012%2Fr1559149_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,eddd343721ae667029ed18fa2a0cc0b8bf3e2753
c3a13f598a96,Barack Obama Offers Marc Maron Political and Professional Advice on ‘WTF’ Finale,,"Marc Maron has dropped the 1,686th and final episode of his long-running WTF podcast, with former President Barack Obama returning for Maron’s last interview. Maron managed to keep the identity of his last guest a secret until the episode dropped Monday morning, Oct. 13. In introducing Obama — who famously appeared on the show 10 years ago — Maron described him as the perfect person to help him bring WTF to a close. As Maron said in his intro: “I do a lot of talking about how I feel about the world , both interior and exterior; micro, macro; what’s going on in me, how am I reacting to what’s going on in the world. And it became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular. In that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we’re living in, as frightening as it is, with what’s happening. And how do we do it with some grace, and perhaps some hope and some focus, and really call what’s going on what it is. And that guest is President Barack Obama.” While Obama came to Maron’s house for their 2015 chat, this time Maron visited the former president at his office in Washington, D.C. During the conversation, the pair spoke at length about Trump, the state of the Democratic Party, the weaponization of the justice system, and prominent institutions like universities and law firms kowtowing to the current administration. “We have blown through, just in the last six months, a whole range of not simply assumptions, but rules and laws and practices that were put in place to ensure that nobody is above the law, and that we don’t use the federal government to simply reward our friends and punish our enemies,” Obama said. He added that “people are right to be concerned,” but said that just like during the McCarthy era and at other contentious points in American history, “What’s required in these situations is a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks. And then more people stand up and go like, ‘Yeah, no, that’s not who we are. That’s not our idea of America.’” Maron also took the opportunity to ask Obama for some advice — not just on how to navigate this moment politically, but also personally. He asked the former president how he contended with the weight of leaving his biggest job ever, with Obama recalling some advice he got at the time: “Don’t rush into what the next thing is.” He continued, “Take a beat and take some satisfaction. Looking back and saying, ‘You know what, didn’t get everything done that I wanted; it wasn’t always exactly how I planned it, but there’s a body of work there that I’m proud of.’” Following the interview, Maron said he hoped the interview was “helpful,” while also calling it an “honor” to interview Obama again. He then signed off for the last time, thanking fans for all their support, the numerous people who’d helped him put on the show, and, lastly, his beloved cats, especially all those who’d passed away. “Cat angels everywhere,” Maron said as the show drew to a close.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/barack-obama-wtf-last-episode-barack-obama-interview-1235445889,Entertainment,BBC,Jon Blistein,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2188444363.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-13T14:15:45+00:00,c18ffbcd0bbf7d5f60474b90f79e74c001c7ba40

Oct 13, 2025, 11:31 PM ET LANDOVER, Md. -- For a while, it felt like Chicago's Week 6 win at Washington was going to play out like the last time the Bears were on Monday Night Football to start the season, with a loss to the Minnesota Vikings . The Bears had a double-digital lead on the Commanders and squandered it off a combination of blown coverages, settling for field goals over touchdowns, penalties and overall sloppy play. But this time, nearing the one-year anniversary of the Bears' last trip to Northwest Stadium that ended in devastation on a Hail Mary, Chicago capitalized off its opponent's late-game mistake and came away with a 25-24 win to mark back-to-back victories on the road. Jake Moody booted a 38-yard field goal as time expired hours after he was elevated to the game-day roster with kicker Cairo Santos dealing with a quad injury. Quarterback Caleb Williams wasn't perfect in his DC-area homecoming. But winning ugly continues to be a theme for the Bears, who won their third game coming off a bye week since 2013. Chicago Bears (3-2) Turning point: The Bears trailed 24-22 when Jayden Daniels and Jeremy McNichols botched their exchange near midfield. Chicago recovered the fumble and gave Williams and the offense the final 3:07 to get back on track and turn an ugly game into triumph with a game-winning drive. Chicago had all three of its timeouts to utilize down the stretch as it set up for Moody's game winning kick in the rain and wind. Most surprising performance: D'Andre Swift came into Week 5 averaging 3.3 yards per carry. Just like last season against the Commanders, Swift broke through against Washington with a season high 108 rushing yards while finally generating the chunk plays (7.7 yards per carry) the Bears run game had been looking for. Chicago's lead rusher also came away with the second-longest reception of his career, a short pass that he took 55 yards down the Commanders' sideline for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Biggest hole in the game plan: Defending the deep ball. Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels had three completions on 20-yard throws against the Bears defense, including two touchdowns. Despite the Bears being in their dime defense late in the third quarter, somehow none of Chicago's defensive backs remembered to cover Washington receiver Luke McCaffrey , who was left wide open for a 33-yard touchdown off a wheel route. -- Courtney Cronin Next game: vs. New Orleans Saints (1 p.m. ET, Sunday) Washington Commanders (3-3) The Commanders didn't need another Hail Mary to beat the Chicago Bears . All they needed to do was take better care of the ball. And they didn't. And it cost them. The Commanders turned the ball over for a third time late in the fourth quarter clinging to a two-point lead. It led to Chicago driving for the game-winning field goal and 25-24 lead - and returning the favor of exiting this field with heartbreak. One year ago of course, quarterback Jayden Daniels tossed a 52-yard Hail Mary to beat the Bears. But Washington's defense continues to struggle -- and that points to more pain as the season unfolds if it doesn't improve. They could not stop a Chicago ground attack that had struggled entering the game. But it was the turnovers that did them in: Daniels threw a red zone interception that not only cost them a field goal attempt, it led to Chicago driving for one of its own. Rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt then lost a fumble that led to a Bears touchdown. Daniels then failed to execute a proper handoff to Croskey-Merritt that gave Chicago the ball at its own 44 and lead to the game-winning field goal. Turning point: On the first play of the fourth quarter Chicago lined up for a 48-yard field goal attempt. But defensive tackle Daron Payne burst through the middle to block the kick and keep Washington in the lead at 17-16. While there were other big plays, those three points proved to be the difference as Washington never trailed again. Quarterback performance: Daniels had a terrific night -- and two killer plays. He threw for 211 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for another 52 yards. He kept drives alive with his legs and he made the passing game work with big plays despite missing top receiver Terry McLaurin for a third consecutive game. But Daniels tossed an interception and failed to execute a handoff late, leading to a fumble. Also, the Bears consistently applied pressure on him when Washington used an empty formation; the Commanders did not adjust well enough versus that look. Biggest hole in the game plan: Washington did a poor job versus running back D'Andre Swift . He had not gained more than 78 yards from scrimmage in any of his first four games this season. Yet he rushed for 108 and caught two passes for another 67. He consistently burned Washington. The Bears did a good job opening holes for him, but head coach and playcaller Ben Johnson also helped by calling misdirection runs. Trend to watch: Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt fumbled for the second consecutive game. Croskey-Merritt has done a nice job but at times gets too loose with the ball -- and it has hurt him when running through the middle. There's a lot to like about him, and he rushed for 175 yards combined in those two games, but it's something to monitor moving forward. -- John Keim Next game: at Dallas Cowboys (4:25 p.m. ET, Sunday)",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46582359/nfl-washington-commanders-chicago-bears-jayden-daniels-caleb-williams-moody,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559867_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,eff92e56de0818de34cea48909d81a2c2294ff85
216cff10e852,MLB,,"TORONTO -- J.P. Crawford , the longest-tenured member of the Seattle Mariners , has experienced different tastes of disappointment in his seven seasons in the Pacific Northwest. A last-place finish. Falling just short of reaching the postseason three times. Playoff exhilaration getting abruptly extinguished the one year they did make it. Sometime early this season, the shortstop explained after the Mariners completed perhaps the most important road trip in franchise history with a 10-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays to take a 2-0 lead in the American League Championship Series, he believed this team was different. ""We know we're a good team,"" Crawford said. ""And now everyone knows that we can do this thing and that's what's lighting the fire underneath everyone."" The Mariners are now just two wins from doing the thing -- winning their first American League pennant and advancing to the World Series for the first time in franchise history -- with Game 3 scheduled for Wednesday at T-Mobile Park. It is the first time they've ever led an ALCS by multiple games. It is the 28th time in postseason history that the road team has won the first two games of a best-of-seven series. Only three of those clubs went on to lose the series. ""We think about it,"" said second baseman Jorge Polanco , who swatted a go-ahead three-run home run in the fifth inning to give Seattle a lead they didn't relinquish. ""We hear it a lot. We know. But the mentality is just keep it simple. Just try to refocus on playing game by game."" Less than 24 hours after the Mariners, wearied coming off an emotional 15-inning win in Game 5 of the AL Division Series on Friday, stole Game 1 with a late-inning comeback fueled by adrenaline, they opted for a less dramatic blueprint in Game 2. Instead, the Mariners pounded three home runs and got six scoreless innings from three relievers to complete Monday's demolition inside an open-roofed Rogers Centre on Canadian Thanksgiving before heading back to Seattle to potentially close out the series. The Mariners did not waste time in inflicting heavy damage against a pitcher they had never seen before. Trey Yesavage was eight days removed from holding the New York Yankees hitless over 5 ⅓ innings in his fourth career start in Game 2 of the ALDS. His abnormally high release point and arm angle, combined with a fastball-splitter combination he uncorks from over the top, overwhelmed the Yankees. The Mariners entered the encounter with a simple gameplan to avoid falling victim to the splitter, a pitch that the Yankees went 0-for-11 on with eight strikeouts: If it's low, let it go. Wait for a mistake up in the zone and do not miss. Julio Rodriguez did not miss. Three batters into the game, after Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch and Cal Raleigh walked, Yesavage threw a mistake splitter to Rodriguez up and over the plate in a 1-2 count that Rodríguez cracked down the left-field line for a three-run shot. It was the first home run Yesavage has allowed in his brief major-league career -- he had previously surrendered just two extra-base hits in four starts -- and the first extra-base hit of any variety he's surrendered with his splitter at this level. ""I feel like at the end of the day, you gotta see the ball and get your pitch,"" Rodríguez said. ""We have seen what he's been doing and obviously we respect that, but we went out there to compete."" Blue Jays manager John Schneider called for a reliever to warm up as Yesavage's pitch count approached 30 after Rodriguez's crowd-silencing blast. But the rookie right-hander stranded a runner at second base with consecutive strikeouts. From there, he settled into the game as Toronto responded with three runs in the first two innings to tie the game. Yesavage held the Mariners without another run until departing with one out and two runners on base in the fifth inning. Two batters after the exit, Polanco continued his torrid October by launching a 98-mph fastball from right-hander Louis Varland just over the wall in right-center field to give the Mariners the lead with their second three-run homer. The home run was the switch-hitting Polanco's third of the postseason and first batting left-handed after connecting with his first two against Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal in the ALDS. The 12-year veteran has eight RBIs in the playoffs, already tied for third most in the Mariners' concise postseason history. Josh Naylor delivered the final blow, a two-run home run to right field off right-hander Braydon Fisher for his third hit of the day to give Seattle a 9-3 lead in the seventh inning. A native of Mississauga, a Toronto suburb, the first baseman became the first Canadian-born player to ever hit a home run in the postseason as a visiting player in Canada. ""I went 0-for-4 yesterday, and we won,"" Naylor said. ""So if I did it again today, maybe [it] was good luck to go 0-for-4, and we would win again. But I was very thankful to get some hits, help the team out. Super cool to do it in front of my family, too."" The excitable Naylor celebrated the homer by pointing to the crowd behind the Mariners' dugout as he began his trot. He and third baseman Eugenio Suarez were the two boppers the Mariners acquired at the trade deadline to bolster an offense that failed to adequately complement an elite pitching staff in years past. The moves solidified what had sprouted in Crawford's mind early in the season, that this team could do the thing that no team has ever done since the franchise's inception in 1977. ""We're two wins away,"" Crawford said. ""If that doesn't fire anyone up, I don't know what can.""",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46587786/mariners-take-commanding-2-0-lead-blue-jays-alcs,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2025%2F1013%2F0257fc769bd54746965f6e1e60d14dad1141%2F0257fc769bd54746965f6e1e60d14dad1141.jpg,,879c3d922d75cc9edb68a3cabdd3299414a7ffea
463ca4a6dc6d,Brewers pull off 8-6-2 double play vs. Dodgers in NLCS Game 1,,"MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers pulled off the first 8-6-2 double play in MLB postseason history against the Los Angeles Dodgers during Game 1 of the National League Championship Series on Monday night. With the bases loaded and one out in the fourth inning and the game still scoreless, Max Muncy hit a deep fly ball to center field. Brewers outfielder Sal Frelick was tracking the ball, and as he leaped to catch it, the ball bounced off his glove then the wall and back into his glove. Muncy was not out because the ball hit the wall, but the Dodgers' runners seemingly thought the ball was caught because they tagged up instead of taking off for the next base. Teoscar Hernandez went back to third base then took off for home as Frelick relayed the ball to shortstop Joey Ortiz , who fired a perfect strike to catcher William Contreras , forcing Hernandez out at the plate. Contreras then ran down and touched third base, getting the force out on Will Smith . Smith had gone back to second when he thought Frelick made a clean catch. The play was officially recorded in the box score as Muncy grounding into a double play because there were force plays at two different bases, according to official scorer Tim O'Driscoll, even with it beginning 404 feet out. According to ESPN Research, Muncy's double-play ball would have been a home run in nine ballparks, including Dodger Stadium. As all this was developing, Frelick had his arms out with a quizzical look on his face, seemingly wondering what had just happened. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts challenged the call, but both outs were upheld, ending the inning. The Dodgers went on to win 2-1 . The most recent 8-6-2 double play in the regular season involved a ball hit by Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa to Cincinnati Reds center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. in April 2004 -- though that one ended with a tag at the plate.

Oct 13, 2025, 10:27 PM ET ATLANTA -- Michael Penix Jr . made all the plays necessary in his ""Monday Night Football"" debut and had plenty of help from running back Bijan Robinson and wide receiver Drake London en route to the Atlanta Falcons beating the Buffalo Bills 24-14 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Penix, the second-year quarterback, was 20-of-32 for 250 yards passing and a touchdown. Robinson had 170 yards rushing, including an 81-yard touchdown run, and another 68 receiving. London had 10 catches for 158 yards and a touchdown. It was the second time Robinson and London each had 150 yards and a touchdown as teammates in their careers. They're the only Falcons teammates to do it more than once since the 1970 merger, per ESPN Research. Atlanta's defense might have been even better than its offense. The Falcons forced the Bills into four three-and-outs, which was double Buffalo's highest single-game total of the season coming in, and sacked quarterback Josh Allen four times. Here are the most important things to know from Monday night for both teams: play 0:22 Drake London steps out of bounds just before hitting pylon Drake London appears to dive for a touchdown, but his foot lands out of bounds a yard short for the Falcons as time expires in the first half. Is Robinson the leading contender for NFL Offensive Player of the Year? What Robinson has done early this season is remarkable. The third-year running back has more yards from scrimmage through five games than any other player in Falcons history. His 138 rushing yards at the half were the most by any player in the league after two quarters this season. Robinson came into the game leading the league with 146 yards from scrimmage per game -- and then put up 238 on Monday night, the second-highest total in the league this season. Robinson is the second player to reach 450 rushing yards and 300 receiving yards through his first five games of a season in NFL history, joining Thurman Thomas in 1991, according to ESPN Research. Trend to watch: The Falcons were without two of their top three wide receivers in Darnell Mooney (hamstring) and Ray-Ray McCloud III (healthy scratch). McCloud's absence was a surprise. It forced the Falcons to rely heavily on two skill players: Bijan Robinson and Drake London , who combined for 89% of the team's yardage in the first half and came in with the highest percentage of their team's scrimmage yardage (57%) out of any duo in the NFL, according to ESPN Research. Stat to know: The Falcons' 335 yards in the first half were their most before halftime since 2009. For the first time in Falcons franchise history, the team had a running back and wide receiver -- Robinson and London, respectively -- eclipse the 100-yard mark in the first half. -- Marc Raimondi Next game: at San Francisco (8:20 p.m. ET, Oct. 19) play 0:23 Bills comes up with a huge blocked field goal Parker Romo goes to kick a field goal for Atlanta, but the Bills comes through with a big block. The frustration was visible from quarterback Josh Allen , who pushed his helmet to the ground as he sat on the bench once again after failing to string together a drive in the middle of the fourth quarter. The struggles persisted in Monday's game at Atlanta as the Bills (4-2) suffered their second straight loss. Though the defense was sloppy and gave up too many yards, the offense failed to take advantage of opportunities. In the first half, the Bills punted on four straight drives, and though they scored a touchdown on their first drive of the second half, the spark didn't linger. They turned the ball over on downs, giving the Falcons the ball back at their 47-yard line. And even when the Bills blocked a field goal attempt, the offense responded with back-to-back three-and-outs. Allen finished the game 15-for-26 (57.7%) with 180 passing yards, 2 passing touchdowns, 2 interceptions and 4 sacks. He also rushed for 42 yards on six carries. Tight end Dalton Kincaid (oblique) was inactive, and wide receiver Joshua Palmer (ankle) was injured in the first half and didn't return. Offensive coordinator Joe Brady went away from running back James Cook III late in the game and did not use him on third downs despite Cook rushing for 87 yards on 17 carries. After starting the season scoring 30-plus points in the first four games, the Bills' offense has work to do. Trend to watch: Injuries. The Bills came into this game with two starters -- linebacker Matt Milano (pectoral) and tight end Dalton Kincaid (oblique) -- out because of injuries. Before the game, defensive tackle DaQuan Jones suffered a calf injury in warmups and was ruled out. Wide receiver Joshua Palmer (ankle) left the game in the first half, linebacker Terrel Bernard didn't play in the second half because of an ankle injury, and safety Cole Bishop missed time in the second half because of cramping, but returned in the fourth quarter. The Bills have a bye this coming week, and it couldn't come at a better time for much-needed rest. Stat to know: The Falcons' 335 first-half yards were the most that the Bills have allowed before halftime since 2001 (Week 2, at Indianapolis Colts ). Missed tackles were a major theme for the Bills' defense, especially in the first half, but the unit adjusted well in the second half. The Falcons were held to 8 net yards in the third quarter and 109 net yards in the fourth. -- Alaina Getzenberg Next game: at Carolina (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 26)",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46586838/bijan-robinson-atlanta-falcons-mnf-week-6-win-buffalo-bills-monday-night-football,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559828_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,5433875e427478edafec57238cca1ff1f4f6142f
