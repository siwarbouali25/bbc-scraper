e0adc8957ee3,Phillipson: Universities must tackle antisemitism,,"Universities must act to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination on campuses, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said, as she set out measures to tackle antisemitism. Phillipson said there had been an ""unacceptable increase in antisemitism"" at universities and added that many Jewish students currently do not feel safe on campuses. She said the UK government was funding training to help staff and students at universities ""tackle this poison of antisemitism"". ""There can be no place for harassment and intimidation,"" Phillipson told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""Universities can and must act on that."" Speaking on the programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said the Labour government should be ""gripping"" antisemitism in the UK, including what she branded ""hate marches where people are being so racist to the Jewish community"". She argued ""hatred"" was demonstrated on the streets of London on Saturday, when thousands of protesters gathered for a rally in support of Palestinians. Ahead of the march, organisers had said they wanted to show solidarity with the Palestinian people. There have also been regular protests staged at universities over the conflict in Gaza, including on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel earlier this week. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part, warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". The demonstrations came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. A report by the Community Security Trust , a charity which provides security at sites like synagogues and Jewish schools, last year found a 117% increase in antisemitic incidents on university campuses in the 2022/23 and 2023/2024 academic years, when compared with the preceding two years. Phillipson said she had spoken to Jewish students who felt they needed to conceal their identity. ""On campus, Jewish students don't feel safe,"" she said. ""And often, parents worry about sending their children to university. We cannot accept that. There can be no place for it."" The education secretary said she had written to university vice-chancellors urging them to take steps to protect Jewish students from harassment. The government said the Union of Jewish Students will deliver 600 training sessions to help university staff support students, identify harassment and hate. A £4m fund will support projects that teach pupils and students how to identify misinformation online and promote interfaith understanding. Separately, £2m is being put towards a scheme to teach secondary school pupils in England about the Holocaust - the genocide of Jews during World War Two. Patel said the Conservatives stood by the right to protest and freedom of expression. But Patel told Laura Kuenssberg that pro-Palestinian marches taking place in London were ""ugly protests"" which demonstrated ""division and hatred"" in our society. ""Look at what happened on the streets of London yesterday. Look at the level of hatred that was demonstrated on the streets of London to Britain's Jewish community,"" she said. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London on Saturday, as well as a small group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters. The director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign - one of the groups that organised the march - said it would ""never stop"" supporting Palestinians. Ben Jamal said: ""This is a movement supported by millions of people in this country and around the world who want freedom and justice for Palestine."" During the march, which came a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began in Gaza, slogans such as ""stop arming Israel"" and ""free Palestine"" could be seen. The Metropolitan Police said it had made 14 arrests for offences including breaching Public Order Act conditions, affray and supporting a proscribed group.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9y7gg6eqo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9ad6/live/da179840-a75a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-12T20:20:46.236000+00:00,25ac8e0fac130cd2c1e4fd9a58c026dd9b7c6a8a
541505e0ffe1,Badenoch demands PM address 'unanswered' China spy case questions,,"Badenoch demands PM address 'unanswered' China spy case questions Joshua Nevett Political reporter and Harry Farley Political correspondent AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) both deny the accusation of spying for China Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has written to the prime minister asking him to address ""unanswered"" questions about the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - were dropped in September, prompting criticism from MPs. The director of public prosecutions (DPP) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said ministers were ""disappointed"" it had not proceeded. In her letter, Badenoch said the government's account of the situation had ""changed repeatedly"". Sir Keir Starmer previously said ministers could only draw on the last government's assessment of China - which dubbed it an ""epoch-defining challenge"" - and his government has maintained it is ""frustrated"" the trial collapsed. Badenoch outlined ""several key questions which remain unanswered"" in her letter on Sunday, and asked that Starmer or a senior minister appear before MPs ""to clear things up once and for all"". She wrote: ""This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on Members of Parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security."" The letter queried remarks made by Phillipson to the BBC earlier in the day, in which she said Starmer's national security advisor Jonathan Powell had no role in the ""substance or the evidence"" of the case. Phillipson also said ministers were ""deeply disappointed that the case hasn't proceeded"", and insisted the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was ""best placed to explain why it was not able to bring forward a prosecution"". The Conservatives had suggested Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it said it needed to secure convictions. Badenoch questioned Phillipson's comments: ""What does this mean? If he was ""not involved"" in the decision over months not to give the CPS what they needed, then who was?"" Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, visited China earlier this year The opposition leader also claimed the government - which had denied ministers were involved in the trial's collapse before the DPP claimed the necessary material had not been obtained - had sought to ""appease China"". She disputed Starmer's comments that ministers could only draw on the previous Conservative government's position, writing: ""As various leading lawyers have pointed out, this is not how the law works."" Starmer had told reporters earlier this week: ""You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence"". ""So all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then."" Badenoch asked that Starmer clarify whether any ministers knew about the government's interactions with the CPS in which it ""refused"" to provide the material being sought. She also asked if the matter had ever been raised with Starmer, including by Powell, and if an earlier denial of the government's involvement had been ""misleading"". The Conservatives have submitted an urgent question in Parliament, asking ministers to address MPs on Monday to explain why the trial collapsed. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told the BBC ministers ""must urgently explain why it chose not to disclose the reams of information it has demonstrating China was a threat to national security in the 2021-2023 period"". He said: ""It looks as if Jonathan Powell was behind this decision - and he should resign if he is."" Meanwhile, several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat. They claim there is a document with ""hundreds"" of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence. Sources cited the hack on the Ministry of Defence, which ministers suspected China was behind, as one of many incidents. ""I don't think there is a sane jury in the world that would look at that evidence and conclude China was not a threat,"" a source in the last government said. Former Conservative ministers also point to public statements, including from the former head of MI5 Ken McCallum, who in 2023 said there had been a ""sustained campaign"" of Chinese espionage on a ""pretty epic scale"". The Liberal Democrats said the government's approach to China was ""putting our national security at risk"". The party urged the government to block the planning application for a new Chinese embassy in London. ""Giving the green light to the super embassy being built in the heart of the City of London and above critical data connections would enable Chinese espionage on an industrial scale,"" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. Last month, the DPP said ""the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test"".

b1f592f9c00a,Starmer arrives in Egypt ahead of summit on Gaza peace plan,,"The prime minister has arrived in Egypt ahead of an international peace summit where the peace plan for Gaza is due to be signed. Sir Keir Starmer will pay ""particular tribute"" to US President Donald Trump at the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh, Downing Street has said. A ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated. The US president will lead Monday's summit alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with leaders from more than 20 countries in attendance, a spokesman for Sisi said. Under the deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages - including 20 who are believed to be alive, and the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages. Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip. Many details for the later phases, which would be negotiated after the successful completion of phase one, could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas. On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the UK had ""played a key role behind the scenes in shaping"" the Gaza peace plan. Britain had been involved in ""complex matters of diplomacy"", she told Sky News, without providing further detail. Appearing later on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson was asked to spell out the UK's role, and responded: ""We do have a role, but of course the role of the US has been critical in this - we can all recognise that."" However, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, called Phillipson's comments ""delusional"". Posting on X, he added: ""She can thank [Trump] anytime just to set the record straight."" Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel further criticised the UK's claims on Sunday. Also appearing on Sky News, she was asked whether the UK had played a key role, and said the ""opposite"" was true. Haskel said decisions by the UK government - including the one last month to recognise Palestinian statehood - had ""actually pushed Hamas to embolden their position"". Monday's summit in Egypt will involve a ""signing ceremony"" for the peace plan, ""marking a historic turning point for the region after two years of conflict and bloodshed"", Downing Street said. Sir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for ""bringing us to this point"" as well as Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure ""swift progress towards phase two"" of the truce. No 10 added in its statement: ""He will offer the UK's steadfast support and engagement with international partners as we look to secure the ceasefire, get urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and secure a basis for a lasting peace and security."" French President Emmanuel Macron will also attend, the Elysee Palace confirmed on Saturday, where he will ""express his full support for the implementation of the agreement"". Confirming the summit late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to ""end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability"". Trump had told reporters at the White House on Friday that he would be travelling to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament the Knesset, before heading to Egypt. He said: ""We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited."" Egypt's foreign ministry had also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the prime minister's visit to Egypt for the Sharm El-Sheikh summit would be a ""photo opportunity"" and the government has ""had no role whatsoever"" in the Gaza ceasefire. ""I think it's extraordinary that Keir Starmer is apparently going to Egypt tomorrow when we've got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving,"" she told Kuenssberg. The ceasefire came into effect after the Israeli government approved the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal on Thursday, following three days of indirect talks in Egypt. The Israeli military said it had partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza and pulled back to an agreed position within the territory - though troops still occupy half of the Strip. The UK has already said it has ""no plans"" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the latest ceasefire from Israel. The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the region to what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, officials have said, alongside forces from Arab and Muslim countries including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. Downing Street said that the UK will also host a three-day summit from Monday to discuss Gaza's recovery and reconstruction. Attendees will include representatives from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and the Palestinian Authority. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Friday the UK would continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza. Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says. A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military offensive, having never got past the first stage of a three-stage plan.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qnqx7znqno,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d6b2/live/01ba3120-a7a4-11f0-80e5-35639bfcaf32.jpg,2025-10-12T22:17:55.836000+00:00,7862aa7f9f007c68d11416e89832ff9115ee9f20
912d73316427,Surge in Chagos arrivals prompts row over housing costs,,"Surge in Chagos arrivals prompts row over housing costs Joshua Nevett Political reporter Damien Dursonial handout Damien Dursonial (C) and his family were among the arrivals at Heathrow this week The UK government is facing calls to support Chagos Islanders who need temporary housing after a surge of them arrived in the country to claim their right to British citizenship. Hillingdon Council said 152 Chagossians had arrived at Heathrow Airport in the borough this week so far, bringing the total to over 600 since last July. The Tory-run council says it expects to spend £2m this year on its legal duty to help homeless British-Chagossians, putting pressure on stretched housing resources and ""breaking"" its finances. Many of the Chagossians are coming from Mauritius because they say they feel unsafe there after the UK government agreed a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to the country. The UK government said Chagossians were expected to make their own housing arrangements prior to travelling and argued the influx of arrivals was ""completely unrelated"" to the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius. The Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, then an overseas territory of the UK, was transformed into a military base in the 1960s and the entire population was forced to move out, mainly to Mauritius or the Seychelles. But in 2002, a limited number of Chagossians were granted the right to full British citizenship. Several thousand now live in the UK, incuding an expat population of 3,000 in Crawley, West Sussex Then in November 2022, the government launched a new British nationality route which was widened to all individuals of Chagossian descent, living anywhere in the world, permitting them to be recognised as British citizens free of charge. Adults have five years, from 23 November 2022, to claim British nationality. Children born within the five-year application time have until they are 23 to apply. This predated the the UK government's decision this year to sign a deal to hand ownership of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base that was built on Diego Garcia - the largest of the islands. The deal has not gone down well with many Chagossians, who see it as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland. Some fear they could be prosecuted by Mauritian authorities for supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Damien Dursonial, 35, landed at Heathrow with his wife and two children, aged four and six, on Wednesday this week. Born in Mauritius, where he worked as a police constable, Mr Dursonial saved up for two years and sold his motorcycle to pay for the flights to the UK. ""I came to the UK because it was the only place where we could feel safe, respected and recognised as a British citizen,"" Mr Dursonial said. ""As a Chagossian in Mauritius, we faced real threats by simply identifying as British or supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos islands."" Mr Dursonial and his family have been placed in temporary accommodation by Hillingdon Council, in West London. But he said: ""The government should have done this because all this work is falling on a local council. ""It had to spend about £1.2m. Whereas ministers are giving away the Chagos Archipelago and taxpayer funds to Mauritius."" Steve Tuckwell says the cost of housing arrivals is ""breaking the council"" Hillingdon Council says it is at risk of going effectively bankrupt and has put in a request for exceptional financial support from the government. It is aiming to cut spending by £38m this year, the largest savings target the council has ever undertaken. ""It's breaking the council,"" Steve Tuckwell, the cabinet member for planning, housing and growth at the Conservative-run council, told the BBC. ""It's taking away hard-earned taxpayers' money from core services."" Tuckwell, a former Tory MP, said the council had written to ministers asking for funding to support Chagossians but had not received any responses. ""I'm calling on the government to do the right thing,"" Tuckwell said. ""Stop this burden on Hillingdon taxpayers. The bank account is running dry."" The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814 and became formally established as an overseas territory after the UK government bought the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965. The islanders were evicted between 1967 and 1973 to create a joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia. The global population of Chagossians is estimated to be about 10,000, with many of them living in Mauritius, the Seychelles or the UK. Vanessa Mandarin Calu, who works with Biot Citizen, said many British-Chagossians were temporarily settling in the UK while they wait to return to their homeland. ""Our homeland is a British Overseas Territory - the government should create a clear pathway for British-Chagossians instead of handing our territory to another country without consulting us,"" Ms Mandarin Calu said. Hillingdon Council opened a pop-up processing centre in the borough this week to deal with the surge in Chagossian arrivals. Local authorities have a legal duty to help eligible people who are homeless and provide temporary accommodation for families with dependents. As British citizens, people of Chagossian descent are entitled to the same support as any other homeless person with a UK passport. The council says it is already struggling to support asylum seekers placed in the borough by the Home Office. A government spokesperson said: ""Chagossians travelling to the United Kingdom are expected to arrange their own accommodation prior to arrival. ""Hillingdon Council has received funding to provide support in cases where immediate local pressures arise and cannot be resolved through standard contingency measures, with support for all local authorities kept under ongoing review. ""This is completely unrelated to the Diego Garcia Military Base agreement signed with Mauritius. ""In November 2022, the last government launched a route to British citizenship for the descendants of those born on the Chagos Archipelago. The Diego Garcia agreement has no impact on this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd721j8390zo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8370/live/76292040-a5d1-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-11T06:39:14.322000+00:00,f247100993cb8f1f9985d32d121f920e383535e3
8685f7036fb9,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term",,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term David Deans Political reporter, BBC Wales News Matthew Horwood Rhun ap Iorwerth has been leader of Plaid since 2023 Plaid Cymru has promised to publish a plan for Welsh independence - but not within the first term of a Plaid-led government. At the party conference members endorsed leader Rhun ap Iorwerth's proposal to set up a ""standing commission"" to talk to the public about the future of the country. Members supported plans for the commission to prepare a white paper on Welsh independence, but ap Iorwerth told members that was not ""for the next government"". He did not give a date for when, but it suggests Plaid Cymru could pursue the idea if it won both the 2026 and 2030 Senedd elections. Ap Iorwerth used the conference in Swansea to present his party as a government in waiting, saying it was ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next vote in May. The party has already pulled back from its previous commitment to offer an independence referendum within five years, made at the last election in 2021 under former leader Adam Price. Ap Iorwerth ruled out a referendum in the first term of a Plaid-led government back in May . However, in Friday's conference speech he said the party would ""kick start the national debate on independence"". Plaid's annual conference on Saturday endorsed a motion that said Wales was ""on a journey to independence, and that enhancing devolution could form part of that journey"". It said a previous Welsh government-backed independent commission on Wales' future was a ""model for engaging people"" on constitutional issues, with the party's motion saying a standing commission should be set up to oversee the government commission's recommendations. Among other things, the government commission called for justice and policing powers to be given to the Welsh government, and for the full devolution of rail services – both decisions the UK government would need to take. Independence was a viable option for Wales' future, the commission had said, although it did not explicitly support it or any other option, with a caveat that independence meant ""hard choices in the short to medium term"". 'Formal path' The conference motion said the standing commission would engage ""citizens in an ongoing dialogue about constitutional issues"" and research ""issues of relevance to Wales' constitutional future"". It would also prepare a ""white paper on Welsh independence"". The motion also said that the power to hold a referendum should be devolved. A white paper is a document that details a government's plans or proposals. The SNP published a white paper on its independence plans ahead of the 2014 Scottish referendum, in its second term of government. BBC Wales was told the standing commission could begin gathering evidence for a white paper in a Plaid first term. Proposing the motion to the conference on Saturday, Ap Iorwerth said: ""The motion looks to the future... and the need ultimately for a white paper which would set the formal path towards asking the people of Wales in a referendum. ""We make it clear it is us that should call the referendum when the time is right. ""But that's not for now or the next government.

05cf2e4341fe,How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms,,"How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms Glenn Campbell Scotland Political Editor, Aberdeen PA Media John Swinney will make his keynote speech to the conference on Monday There is one sure sign that the Scottish National Party is about to meet for its annual conference. Around this time each year, there is always renewed emphasis on the goal of independence from the party's leadership. And right on cue, the SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney published another Scottish government paper this week promising a ""fresh start"" for Scotland should it become an independent country. It's useful for the SNP leadership to show those gathering in Aberdeen for the party's 91st annual get-together that their primary cause has not been forgotten. In truth, the party is completely stuck on how to establish a viable route to Scottish statehood. That is a source of frustration to many in the SNP and should result in a lively debate on independence strategy at conference later. PA Media Swinney launched a new paper on independence this week Whatever is decided, there is unlikely to be any movement towards independence unless the SNP retains power at Holyrood. That looked to be in serious doubt a year ago when Labour swept to power at Westminster having comprehensively defeated the SNP in a national election for the first time in 14 years. Three things have changed since then. Swinney has stabilised the SNP, Labour's popularity has slumped and the rise of Reform UK appears to have widened the SNP's pathway to what would be an incredible fifth term in office. When John Swinney took over as first minister following the resignations in quick succession of Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf he inherited a party in turmoil. He has proved to be a steadying force. He quickly calmed controversies over gender identity, the environment and the police investigation into SNP finances which has led to the prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell. PA Media Swinney inherited a party in turmoil after the resignations of Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon If that was phase one of his leadership, phase two was to focus the Scottish government on priorities like improving public services. In short, to try to make a noticeable difference for the public. One ally of the first minister sums up this approach as ""stop digging, get delivering"". Swinney might highlight scrapping peak rail fares , signs of a reduction in child poverty and the decision to lift the two child limit on access to benefits (whether or not the UK government does the same) as examples of progress. The SNP's political opponents would point to persistent long waits on the NHS, cuts to college budgets and the emergency release of prisoners from overcrowded jails as evidence of failure. Among other challenges to be confronted by whoever is in charge, repeated warnings from financial watchdogs that levels of social spending in Scotland are unsustainable. There also appears to have been a decline in trust in the Scottish government to work in Scotland's best interests in recent years, according to the latest social attitudes survey for 2023 . All of this will feature in the pre-election arguments to come. Getty Images Labour's momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer walked into Number 10 Labour insists that Scotland can take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government with Anas Sarwar as first minister. Labour's trouble is that their 2024 momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer stepped into Number 10. The unpopularity of the prime minister and the UK government seems to have dragged Scottish Labour down. Opinion polls suggest the SNP has a double digit lead over Labour, with Reform UK nipping at their heels, having pushed the Conservatives into fourth place. The SNP appears far less popular than it was five years ago and the rise of Reform UK seems to be fragmenting support for unionist parties. That could mean the principal party of Scottish independence is still well placed to overcome divided opposition in constituencies across the country and finish as the largest party nationwide. There is nothing definitive about these polls and seven months of campaigning could produce a different outcome. Remember that against widespread expectations, Labour beat the SNP in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election earlier this year. PA Media Labour would like to see Scotland take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government under Anas Sarwar The Tories hope their calls for cuts in public spending, regulation and taxation will distinguish them from their left-leaning rivals and help them persuade traditional supporters not to switch to Reform UK. While Nigel Farage's party has focused on reducing immigration and more oil and gas exploitation, these are both policy areas outwith Holyrood's control. One hope for the SNP's opponents is that they can rally anti-SNP support behind whichever party appears best placed to beat them in each local area. That has had limited success in the past. As independence is more popular than the SNP at the moment, part of Swinney's strategy will be to entice at least some lapsed SNP voters back. That will mean a bit more talk of independence - a cause for which Swinney has been campaigning since he was 15. With such political experience he will sense that to many within and beyond the SNP, independence seems like something of a political mirage at the moment. The UK Supreme Court has ruled that any future referendum would need the consent of the UK government and Sir Keir Starmer has made clear he has no intention of enabling a vote during his time in power. In a key conference debate on Saturday, Swinney will argue that the ""only uncontested route"" to another referendum is for the SNP to win an overall majority of seats in the Holyrood election next May. That was what persuaded then Prime Minister David Cameron to agree to the 2014 referendum - and the first minister thinks a similar outcome would force the current PM to budge. 'Mandate to deliver independence' Then there are those who think a more radical approach is required. That the SNP should treat the 2026 election as if it were a referendum. In other words, if independence supporting parties secure more than 50% of the votes in the Holyrood list ballot that should be considered as a ""mandate to deliver independence"". It's not clear what that means. Seeking to negotiate with the UK government? Unilaterally declaring independence and daring the UK to block it? Or something else? It is an approach that would not be regarded as legitimate by parties that favour continued union. The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK would reject it on the basis that elections are about so much more than the single issue of independence. This is a debate Swinney's team expect to win at conference. Their question is by how much? They will want it to be by the widest possible margin to avoid damaging his authority. One elected politician arguing the alternative case predicted a ""wee gem"" of a debate where the leadership would need to work harder than usual to get their way. Whether the SNP focus on trying to achieve a majority of votes for all independence supporting parties (including the Greens and Alba) or a majority of Holyrood seats for themselves, these are both very high bars to clear. The SNP also needs to be careful about pushing independence too hard. While it remains a popular policy with a large minority of voters it is not necessarily a priority for all those who support it. When asked to identify their key concerns in one recent survey, those asked identified the NHS, the cost of living and immigration as their top three. The Scottish government Swinney met Donald Trump in the Oval Office on his visit to the US So what else can we expect from this conference? It seems to me that Swinney has been working hard to develop an image for himself not just as a first minister but also as a potential statesman. Think meetings with Donald Trump in both Scotland and at the White House, statements at Holyrood on Ukraine and Gaza and a forthcoming visit to Africa. I imagine there will be some reference to Swinney's international engagement, not least because the newly recognised Palestinian ambassador to the UK is due to address conference. It's worth remembering that Swinney took over as first minister midway through a parliamentary term secured on a manifesto signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. Yes, they were close. He was her deputy in government. But this conference, particularly his keynote speech on Monday, is an opportunity for Swinney to put his own stamp on things. Expect him to set out more clearly who he is and what a Swinney government less bound by previous pledges would seek to do. There will obviously be continuity but perhaps some elements of change too. Will that be worthy of description as a third phase of his leadership? Let's see.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgknlj3vr76o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7eb1/live/3375c820-a68a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-11T08:17:58.053000+00:00,28a976ad43163114d6b79caddbf7d8a657f67f10
d6a0ab907d9d,Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein while prime minister,,"Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein while prime minister Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter , Joe Pike Politics investigations correspondent and Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images Sir Tony Blair met with Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while still prime minister, following lobbying by Lord Peter Mandelson, the BBC has confirmed. A memo written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft, dated 14 May 2002, briefs Sir Tony about ""super-rich"" financial adviser Epstein ahead of a meeting scheduled at 17.00 GMT that day. The meeting was six years before Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002, and discussed US and UK politics. He never met or engaged with him subsequently."" He added: ""This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction."" Emails seen by BBC News show Lord Mandelson pushed for the meeting, telling Sir Tony's chief of staff Jonathan Powell that Epstein was ""a friend of mine"" who ex-US President Bill Clinton hoped to introduce to the PM. The release of this and several related documents had previously been blocked by government officials due to concerns about the impact on UK-US relations. The document has now been released by the National Archives under a Freedom of Information request, following the sacking of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador after fresh revelations about his friendship with the disgraced financier. In the email to Powell - the current UK government's national security adviser - Lord Mandelson refers to Epstein as ""safe"". The email on 7 May 2002 states: ""Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB? ""This was frustrated - TB said at the time - in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies. ""He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him."" The email continues: ""I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him. ""I have ascertained from Jeffrey that he is flexible - he could be here any time from Tuesday onwards to fit round the diary - but would obviously need to know reasonably quickly so as to re-schedule accordingly. Can you let me know?"" There are three separate handwritten notes on the print-out of the email, some of which are illegible, but one appears to read ""do you want to do this... Because you wanted to see Clinton by yourself... I know very little more about him"". At the time, Lord Mandelson was a backbench MP, having twice resigned from the cabinet, but still a force in Labour. Clinton has acknowledged being a former associate of Epstein but said had no knowledge of his crimes. Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The National Archive has also released a schedule headed Trade and Industry Meetings with Industry, which includes a memo published on 14 May 2002, briefing Sir Tony about Epstein ahead of a meeting schedule for 17.00 GMT that day. The briefing, written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft is marked R, understood to mean restricted. In the memo, Rycroft, who until March 2025 was the permanent secretary at the Home Office, wrote to Blair: ""Jeffrey Epstein is seeing you at 5pm today. ""He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson."" Rycroft states: ""The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York"". He adds: ""Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him. ""He thinks you would find worthwhile a conversation with him about a) science and b) international economic and monetary trends.""

65453694efa5,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper",,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper Getty Images UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said there are ""no plans"" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire from Israel. The first phase of a deal with Hamas that will lead to a ceasefire and the release of hostages has been approved by Israel and has now come into effect, according to its military. Cooper, who is meeting foreign ministers in Paris, said the UK will continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza. ""This is still a fragile process but it is one there is a huge momentum behind and a huge commitment to, so we have to make it work,"" she said. The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to Israel to coordinate what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, according to US officials. This is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and to help coordinate humanitarian assistance. Forces from Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, will also be involved, helping to observe the truce and report any violations. US officials said that no American forces would enter Gaza. Asked on BBC Breakfast on Friday whether UK troops would be involved, Cooper said: ""That's not our plan, there's no plans to do that."" The foreign secretary was also asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent comments in an interview with Euronews, that Europe had ""essentially become irrelevant"" in ceasefire plans, and said the decision by countries, including the UK, to recognise a Palestinian state had been an ""ultimate reward (to) Islamists"". Cooper replied that the UK has had disagreements with Israel over this issue but that ""the point now is that we need countries coming together to make peace a reality and to actually make it happen"". She insisted that the UK has ""already contributed"" to get to this point in the peace process, including by putting forward proposals as part of a framework for peace and through the recognition of a Palestinian state. Cooper said that moving forward, the UK would be involved in talks with Arab states over ways to get financial investment into Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment. On Friday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to back ""substantive humanitarian aid packages"" during the ceasefire, along with the leaders of France and Germany. The leaders, known as the E3, said they ""stand ready to support further talks on the next stages of the plan and to contribute to it"". More than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in Israel's military offensive according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel launched its military offensive in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly Israeli civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Sir Keir had previously emphasised the UK's role in peace negotiations, and said on Thursday that the country had ""played an important part behind the scenes"". Speaking at a press conference on a visit to Mumbai, he added that the UK now ""stands ready to play our part in implementing this [the peace plan], again with others, as we go forward"". Cooper flew to Paris on Thursday from Northern Ireland with her German counterpart. Both ministers had been attending a meeting of foreign ministers from the Western Balkans at Hillsborough Castle near Belfast. She told the BBC's Today programme on Friday that they had held discussions about the lessons learned during the implementation of peace processes in their own countries in recent decades. ""What we know is that countries can come together to support peace, to resolve conflict, to rebuild nations,"" she said, and added that she believed the reflections could help in Gaza. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK must play a ""maximum role"" in maintaining the ceasefire. ""We're prepared to play our part; the UK must step up,"" Sir Ed said, and added that the UK should push to contribute to a peacekeeping force.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pek0lz6mo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7b9a/live/275b3230-a5bf-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-10T16:02:34.966000+00:00,2128f20eda3c7ad58c2a0bda1bf3230b06c681b9
688657a756e6,Government to consult on digital IDs for 13-year-olds,,"Government to consult on digital IDs for 13-year-olds Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter PA Media The government will consult on whether children aged between 13 and 16-years-old should be included in roll-out of planned digital IDs. The proposed UK-wide scheme will be introduced by 2029, and available to all UK citizens and legal residents but only mandatory in order to work. There has been a backlash to the scheme, with a petition attracting nearly three million signatures. But on Friday, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the plan, telling LBC ""lots of 13-year-olds already"" have digital IDs and that standardising the process would help. A spokesperson said the government ""need to consult"" on including children as young as 13, since many already work part-time. ""As we announced, it will be a legal requirement for employers to check someone's digital ID as part of Right to Work checks."" the government spokesperson added. ""Children can work part-time from the age of 14. In some local council areas this is from the age of 13."" Under the proposals, digital ID will be available for free to all UK citizens and legal residents. It will be mandatory only for those seeking employment, while remaining optional for students, pensioners and others not entering the workforce. Defending the plans to consider the inclusion of 13 to 16-year-olds in the scheme, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told LBC: ""Everybody has forms of digital ID... We all have different ways of having to prove who we are. ""Lots of 13-year-olds already do [have a form of digital ID], and what the department is going to be consulting on is exactly how that should be taken forward. ""I do think that this is the right way forward, to have this standardised process now, and it's something that we had been already setting out for people who come to work from abroad."" The UK petition opposing the IDs warns the scheme could lead to ""mass surveillance and digital control"". However, civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch branded the scheme ""Orwellian"" and urged MPs to reject plans. Director Silkie Carlo said: ""The prospects of enrolling even children into this sprawling biometric ID system is sinister, unjustified and prompts the chilling question of just what Starmer's government think the digital ID will be used for in the future. ""At a time when parents are taking a critical view of whether children should have smartphones, it is shocking that the government is considering enrolling children into this digital ID app."" The Liberal Democrats said the consultation on offering digital ID to 13-year-olds showed they had been right to warn about ""mission creep"". ""It is frankly sinister, unnecessary, and a clear step towards state overreach,"" said the party's science and technology spokesperson Victoria Collins. During a trip to India this week , Sir Keir praised the country's far more extensive Aadhaar digital ID system, which includes biometric data, as a ""massive success"". He suggested similar technology could be used in UK banking and public services. Downing Street later clarified his comments, stating the UK scheme would not necessarily replicate India's biometric model and would be run by the public sector. Other countries that already have digital ID systems include Estonia, Denmark and Spain, as well as Canada and Japan. The European Union is introducing the Digital Identity (eID) Wallet, which all member states will be required to roll out to citizens by the end of 2026.

930e5cfd2f96,Farage 'stunned' ex-Wales Reform leader took bribes,,"Farage 'stunned' ex-Wales Reform leader took bribes Adrian Browne Wales political reporter and Dan Moffat BBC Wales Getty Images Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said he was ""stunned"" when he found out his party's former leader in Wales took bribes to make statements in favour of Russia while a Member of the European Parliament. Last month, Nathan Gill, pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. Asked, by BBC Wales, if he questioned Gill over the statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it, all I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine."" ""I told him not to go, he defied me and went, I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill, who is no longer a Reform member, also used to be a politician in Cardiff Bay. He was one of seven UKIP politicians elected to the Senedd in 2016 when the party was led by Farage. Gill took money from Oleg Voloshyn, once described by the US government as a ""pawn"" of Russian secret services, and made pro-Russian speeches in the European Parliament, statements to a TV channel and arranged an event with a politician close to Moscow. Mr Voloshyn is a former member of the Ukrainian parliament for the pro-Russian Opposition Platform for Life party. Gill's activities emerged in WhatsApp messages on his phone after he was stopped at Manchester Airport on September 13 2021 under counter-terrorism laws. On a campaign visit, on Friday, for the upcoming Caerphilly Senedd by-election, Farage responded publicly for the first time to the Gill bribery case. ""I'd known this person for a very long time, I knew him in the European Parliament in the UKIP days to be a God-fearing Christian, somebody that you would think was the least corruptible person that you would know,"" he said. Asked if he knew about Gill making pro-Russian statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it."" ""All I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine. He said 'we're going on a visit to Ukraine, do you want to come?' ""I said 'you're off your rocker, this is one of the most corrupt countries in the world,  you must be mad'. And I told him not to go. ""He defied me and went. I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill served as a UKIP, and later Brexit Party, MEP between 2014 and 2020 and was leader of UKIP Wales between 2014 and 2016. He was leader of Reform UK Wales between March and May 2021, leading the party's Senedd/Welsh Parliament election campaign but is no longer in the party. Gill will be sentenced in November. His defence barrister has said he expects to be jailed. Nigel Farage campaigned alongside Nathan Gill (in red and white striped tie) in Caerphilly in 2019 for the European elections The Caerphilly Senedd by-election, prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August, takes place on 23 October.

9ba907854b4c,Lib Dems back Bank of England after Farage criticism,,"The Liberal Democrats have promised to back the Bank of England's (BoE) independence ""against Farage's threats"" after the Reform leader urged it to end its bond-selling programme. On Friday, party leader Sir Ed Davey and his deputy Daisy Cooper met the bank's governor Andrew Bailey to ""reaffirm support"" for the Bank's autonomy. It comes two weeks after Nigel Farage met Mr Bailey to argue for the end of BoE bond sales, known as quantitative tightening, claiming it is costing taxpayers billions and driving up debt. Sir Ed accused Farage of ""putting his obsession with mimicking Donald Trump ahead of what is in the best interests of the British people"" by pressuring the central bank. Reform UK has been approached for comment. Sir Ed has pledged to lead the fight against Reform UK - using his Lib Dem conference speech to argue his party had a ""moral responsibility"" to challenge Farage. Speaking after his meeting at the Bank's Threadneedle Street HQ, Sir Ed said: ""Liberal Democrats will stand firmly behind Bank of England independence, just as we have stood against recent attacks on the independence of our judiciary. ""Trump's threats to sack governors of the Fed if they don't do what he wants are causing economic panic in the United States,"" Sir Ed said. ""That is the last thing we need here at home - we cannot let Trump's America become Farage's Britain."" Speaking to reporters later, Sir Ed argued the BoE needed ""modernisation"" but argued keeping it independent from government was ""the best way"" to lower food bills and mortgage rates. The Bank began its quantitative tightening programme in 2022 , unwinding the emergency support it brought in after the 2008 financial crisis. That earlier process, known as quantitative easing, saw the Bank electronically create billions of pounds to buy UK government bonds, a form of debt, in a bid to prop up the UK economy by keeping market interest rates low. The Bank subsequently launched new rounds of QE after the eurozone debt crisis, the Brexit referendum and the coronavirus pandemic. The Bank is now in the process of selling these bonds for less than it paid for them, with losses being picked up by the Treasury under a deal agreed in 2009. Reform has criticised the process, with deputy leader Richard Tice branding it a ""systemic misuse of taxpayers' money"" in a letter to Bailey in June. He also blamed it for increasing the costs of long-term government debt, which recently rose to a 27-year high. Farage and Tice visited the Bank for talks with Bailey on 25 September, after the Bank chief agreed to a meeting. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Tice called for MPs to take a more active role in debating the policy, arguing they were reluctant to do so for fear of encroaching on the bank's independence. But he added that the ""huge multibillion cost"" meant it had an impact on taxation, traditionally a matter for Parliament, and could ""change the decisions the chancellor makes"" at November's Budget. They also pressed the Bank to relax its stance on cryptocurrencies, accusing it of holding back innovation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr70g372m91o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2f8b/live/711129e0-a5d6-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-10T12:42:29.008000+00:00,3541b736e9fabbb59610cfe31eab6e6dcb8a8f9e

Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), told the BBC freedom of speech did not mean the freedom to intimidate, harass, and discriminate against Jewish students. He said he was concerned about antisemitism on campuses and warned universities the OfS was ""prepared to act"" if Jewish students were not protected. The regulator has the power to issue fines, cut off access to public funding and revoke the ability to award degrees if universities breach its rules. Mr Ahmed - who champions free speech on campuses in his role - spoke to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast following a wave of pro-Palestinian protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part , warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". Sir Keir said it was ""un-British to have little respect for others"" by staging demonstrations on the anniversary and argued the protests had been used by some as a ""despicable excuse to attack British Jews"". Students from London universities took part in a joint march on 7 October, while rallies took place in Edinburgh, Belfast and Sheffield. Protest group UCL Action For Palestine, which took part in the London march, posted on social media that it would not be ""silenced or intimidated"" and stood in solidarity with the thousands of Palestinians killed before and prior to October 2023. The protests came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. Security has been stepped up at synagogues across the country in response to the attack. In his interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said he was concerned about the protests on 7 October and antisemitism against Jewish students. ""Universities and colleges also have a duty to take steps to protect students from harassment and that includes antisemitic harassment,"" he said. ""And we in the OfS will be prepared to act if we think universities are not meeting those duties."" He said if there was ""unlawful support for proscribed organisations"" on campus ""then that's absolutely not something that freedom of speech protects and it is something that we would expect universities to address"". Universities and colleges must be registered with the OfS if they want certain benefits, including access to student loan funding. If universities are deemed to have breached the conditions of registration, they can be sanctioned by the OfS. In March this year, the University of Sussex was fined £585,000 by the OfS for failing to uphold freedom of speech . The OfS said the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to ""positively represent trans people"", could lead to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views. Risk of political violence In an earlier interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said the assassination of American conservative activist Charlie Kirk was ""an appalling tragedy"" and warned democracy would not survive if differences could not be settled through speech. ""You must allow people to express their views on really controversial topics, because alternatively, there will be no alternative to violence,"" Mr Ahmed said. ""And that will be the abyss that we end up falling into."" Mr Ahmed also said the OfS was ""ready to act"" to punish universities for not protecting academics and students from harassment and intimidation from foreign dictatorships. Mr Ahmed said he had seen evidence of visiting foreign scholars threatening academics in the UK, whispering in their ears ""we're following you, we're watching you"". He said: ""If your business model involves breaking the law, if your business model involves unlawfully suppressing academic freedom and freedom of speech at the behest of a foreign dictatorship, then you need another business model."" Mr Ahmed said the OfS had powers to force universities to take action. ""We can remove their titles to universities. We can fine them. We can ultimately cut off their access to public funding.""

In an interview with BBC Scotland News, the first minister accepted that ""some people have had to wait far too long"" for certain treatment. But he insisted the Scottish government was working to expand capacity and increase operations and that ""progress is being delivered"". The NHS is still working to recover from the Covid pandemic and, as of June, about one in nine people in Scotland is on an NHS waiting list. Speaking ahead of his party's annual conference in Aberdeen, Swinney also addressed the case of an eight-year-old girl with a serious condition who has been told to expect a 19 month wait for her surgery. The girl's mother has told BBC Scotland News the delay meant her daughter could not live a normal life due to her declining kidney function. The first minister said he could ""totally accept"" the worry and anxiety caused by these circumstances and offered to personally look in to the case. Swinney said the Scottish government was taking all the steps it can within its resources to ensure NHS performance matches the expectations of the public. The most recent Scottish social attitudes study covering the period up to 2023 found that 69% of those asked felt that NHS performance was getting worse. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine also claimed more than 800 deaths in Scotland last year were believed to be linked to long A&E waits. Swinney said: ""What we are doing, what we are focusing on, is about doing all we can to reduce waiting times and make sure more people are being treated and of course the most recent data shows, for example, is we've had record numbers of operations. ""We've had record numbers of hip and knee operations and these are some of the things people have had to wait quite a long time for. ""There is no shortcut. We need to make sure we get a flow of patients in to A&E, so they can get assessed quickly, so they are able to be released home. We have very high levels of patient discharge from hospital, we take all of these steps to make sure people receive care that they require."" 'Counterproductive and damaging' Swinney also said he wanted to avoid industrial action by hospital doctors who are to ballot for a strike. He said the Scottish government would ""work constructively"" with the British Medical Association (BMA) to resolve the dispute. He was also asked about immigration during the interview. Swinney said the UK debate was ""counterproductive and damaging"" and a ""positive approach"" was needed to help grow Scotland's working age population. He said we should ""embrace migration"" and that doing so was ""something we should be proud of"". Swinney said: ""I think we have to have a rational and considered debate about migration because I can't talk to a single business sector or area of activity in our country that doesn't tell me they are short of people. ""We have very low unemployment in Scotland today and our various sectors are short of people and we've got a working age population that is not large enough to support our economy and our activities.

Labour has led Wales since the start of devolution in 1999, and has dominated Welsh politics for a century. The next Senedd election takes place in May. He said the ""transformative"" policy, offering at least 20 hours for 48 weeks a year by 2031, would be a ""helping hand with the things that matter the most"". He told the conference in Swansea that ""Labour's time is up"" and that Reform wanted to treat the Senedd as a ""plaything"" to gain an ""electoral foothold"". Ap Iorwerth called on voters who wanted to stop Reform to back his party, accusing Nigel Farage of spurring a summer of ""simmering hatred"". On Friday he said the 2026 vote will not be an independence election - but said it would ""kick-start"" the debate about whether Wales should go it alone. Currently help with childcare costs is only available to families whose parents are in work, education or training, or to very young children who live in a Flying Start area. Families whose parents are in work, training or education who has less than £100,000 a year in income would still get 30 hours a week for three to four-year-olds, as they do now. Some eligible two-year-olds qualify for 12.5 hours of care a week under Flying Start, but it is not available nationally. Plaid's plan would also allow ineligible families to claim 20 hours a week for three to four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year, and all families 20 hours for nine-month-olds to two years. The party says the policy would be worth £32,500 to families for the first four years of their child's life. Matthew Horwood/Plaid Cymru Rhun ap Iorwerth was met with a standing ovation as he closed his speech in Braygwyn Hall Ap Iorwerth told BBC Wales: ""This can make a huge difference. It's a very, very important step in terms of helping families with the cost of living. ""This is universal, which marks it out from the system in England."" The Welsh government has been under pressure to match childcare provision in England, where children between nine months and two years of working parents receive free child care. The Bevan Foundation has said that high costs were pushing more families into poverty and out of work . Plaid's plan would be in three stages. It is proposing to keep the existing 30 hour offer for three to four-year-olds, while extending the roll out of 12.5 hours a week for two-year-olds. The next step would be to give 20 hours to parents of three and four-year-olds who are not currently eligible for any help. The party would then try each year to increase the number of hours offered to children under the age of two. It would be rolled out over the life of the next Welsh Parliament, with the policy fully implemented in the 2030/31 financial year. The party says that by the end of the five-year roll out it will spend roughly an extra £500m a year on childcare - bringing the total cost to £800m. It says it can find the cash from the Welsh government's budget, with about £400m thought to be available in the next budget if other services increase by inflation. Ap Iorwerth said it was ""money that we know we can afford"". Getty Images Plaid Cymru says the policy would be worth £32,500 to families for the first four years of their child's life Party sources, asked why parents whose incomes are above £100,000 should get free childcare, said services that are delivered universally are better, and that households across demographics are struggling. Plaid says it would be the most generous childcare care offer in the UK. 'Plaything' Ap Iorwerth, a former BBC Wales broadcaster, announced the policy in a speech where he set his party stall as a government-in-waiting. He called on his party to seize the ""historic opportunity ahead"" and turn it into ""reality"". Plaid Cymru has played a key role during the life of devolution, being an occasional supporter of Labour governments since 1999. It has been unable to beat Labour in an election - but recent opinion polling has suggested Plaid is vying with the party to win, as is Reform. The Member of the Senedd for Ynys Môn told the conference hall that Labour had forgotten ""where it came from who it was there to serve"". He said the UK had faced a summer of ""simmering hatred"", spurred on, he said, by Nigel Farage. ""Farage and his followers drive the deliberate fragmentation of society, giving life to the bogeyman without whom they are nothing."" He said Reform UK wanted to treat the Senedd as a ""plaything"" to gain ""an electoral foothold"". 'New leadership' Ap Iorwerth said Plaid was ready to govern ""right now"", promising to ""usher in an age of new leadership that will set Wales on a different path."" ""We are not here as Labour's conscious, we are not here to repair Labour, we are here to replace them,"" he said. The party leader promised an ""immediate cash injection"" into the NHS to prioritise the longest waits. He warned that Reform threatened the health service with ""US-style bills"", and vowed to keep the NHS free at point of need. Matthew Horwood/Plaid Cymru Ap Iorwerth was elected the new leader of Plaid Cymru in 2023 Ap Iorwerth was greeted with cheers and applause throughout the speech, and was given a standing ovation after he called on those who have ""never voted for Plaid Cymru before, the time is now"". ""The time is now to stop Reform and elect a government more radical, more ambitious, more impatient to bring about positive change."" He said his government would be on the side of ""young and old, urban and rural, north and south, Welsh speaker, non Welsh-speaker"". The party has traditionally been stronger in its Welsh-speaking heartlands of north and west Wales. Plaid Cymru promised a referendum on independence at the last election in 2021 - but is not now. Earlier Ap Iorwerth told Radio Wales Breakfast the 2026 election would not be about independence for Plaid. ""There's no referendum... in the next few years,"" he said. But in his speech he said the party ""will kick start the national debate on independence"", building on the work of the previous commission on Wales' constitutional future by setting up a permanent commission. ""It's not just about aspiration, it's about creating the best chance to build a modern nation of good health, opportunity, prosperity, and fairness,"" he said. Analysis Rhun ap Iorwerth is hoping to be Wales' first non-Labour first minister - judging by the reaction in the hall, his members think he can. Plaid Cymru conferences can be business like affairs but there was a definite change in the atmosphere in Swansea - not a city in the party's usual heartland of north and west Wales - with a speech that was well received in Brangwyn Hall. It is not proposing wholescale shake up of public services - the party leader thinks that's too risky in the current climate - but says it offers ""radical"" plans such as a payment to tackle child poverty . Labour's woes have given the party the best chance it has ever had to lead Wales but Plaid faces some challenges. If Plaid came first it is possible they would have to work with Labour or other parties in some form, with no party having ever won a majority in the Senedd. It is also hoping to bring people who have never voted for Plaid into the fold, in the hope they are motivated by wanting to stop Reform. The party has to convince voters they are the best option to do that, while the Greens, the Lib Dems and Labour say similar things. They also face a Reform party that has Wales set in its sights - a party with greater resources, something Plaid has struggled with in the past.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewnv2xprzko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6900/live/0eb52e40-a5f9-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-10T16:38:28.234000+00:00,45ecccb5cad00a89125121d6430285bb6ecd7efa

Fayaz Khan, 26, posted a video last October where he named the Reform UK leader and made a gun gesture with his hand. The jury went out at 12:54 BST on Wednesday before returning its verdict at Southwark Crown Court on Friday. Khan had a ""very large presence online"" with his videos on TikTok under the username ""madapasa"", amassing hundreds of thousands of views. PA Media Reform UK leader Nigel Farage went to Southwark Crown Court to give evidence during Khan's trial Prosecutor Peter Ratliff said Khan's videos showed his attempts to come to the UK by small boat from Afghanistan. On 12 October, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube titled ""the journey of an illegal migrant"" which highlighted Khan and referenced ""young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little"". Mr Ratliff said Khan responded with a video on 14 October, which was played to the jury, in which Khan addressed the Reform UK MP as ""Englishman Nigel"". The video continued: ""You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me. ""Don't talk about me more. Delete the video. ""I'm coming to England. I'm going to pop, pop, pop."" Mr Ratliff told the jury that while Khan said ""pop, pop, pop"" he had made ""gun gestures"" with his hand and headbutted the camera. 'Pretty chilling' Khan, an Afghan migrant, had also pointed towards an AK-47 tattoo on his face to ""emphasise he wasn't joking"". The prosecutor added: ""If you've got an AK-47 tattooed on your arm and your face, it's because you love AK-47s and you want the world to know that."" Farage, the MP for Clacton in Essex, gave evidence on Tuesday and said Khan's video was ""pretty chilling"", adding: ""Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried."" The Reform UK leader added: ""He says he's coming to England and he's going to shoot me."" Jurors were shown other videos posted on social media by Khan in which he appeared to make ""pop, pop, pop"" noises and similar hand gestures to those in the TikTok video referencing Farage. Metropolitan Police Khan came to the UK on a small boat last year from Afghanistan Khan was not called to give evidence on Wednesday by defence lawyer Charles Royle, but in a police interview last year he had said: ""It was never my intention to kill him or anything. ""This is my character, this is how I act in my videos."" Khan said: ""In every video I make those sounds, I say 'pop, pop pop'."" Jurors were also shown a screenshot of a subsequent TikTok post by Khan with the caption ""I mean what I say"" written on an image of a GB News report about the alleged threat against Farage. In the prosecution's closing speech, Mr Ratliff said the alleged threat to kill was ""not some off-the-cuff comment"" and the video was ""sinister and menacing"". He added that Khan was ""a dangerous man with an interest in firearms"". In his closing defence speech, Mr Royle said Khan was ""remonstrating in his own idiosyncratic, moronic, comedic, eye-catching, attention-seeking way"", rather than making a threat to kill. The Metropolitan Police said Khan is due to be sentenced on 14 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx216n1529o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/343f/live/f5763790-a5e3-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T15:03:10.289000+00:00,9d9ce8869979ec4602a2b57be3169ceb54670806

3b93fe02d029,Sunak takes advisory roles with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic,,"Rishi Sunak has taken up advisory roles at tech giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic. The former prime minister - who remains the MP for Richmond and Northallerton - said he was ""delighted"" to be working ""with two of the world's leading tech firms"" and planned to donate his earnings to a charity he founded. Sunak has been told he must not lobby ministers on behalf of the companies by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), an independent watchdog which oversees the activities of former government figures. During his premiership he made tech regulation a significant priority, setting up an AI safety summit in 2023 . In letters of advice sent to Sunak by Acoba and published on Thursday, his part-time role at Microsoft was described as providing ""high- level strategic perspectives"" on geopolitical trends. The watchdog said it had been informed by Sunak that his part-time advisory role at Anthropic - an AI firm seeking to compete with companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta - would be ""akin to operating as an internal think tank"". Acoba said Anthropic ""has a significant interest in UK government policy"", meaning that Sunak's appointment could potentially be seen to offer ""unfair access and influence"" within government. The appointment with Microsoft, a ""major investor"" in the UK, also presented similar issues, it wrote. However, it also said that his time spent out of government would have reduced the value of any information Sunak may still possess, while reiterating the standing rules ex-ministers have to abide when seeking employment after leaving government. Sunak was told not to advise on bidding for UK contracts, or to lobby the government for two years from his last day in ministerial office. In addition to the two tech roles, it was previously confirmed Sunak will act as a paid advisor to the bank Goldman Sachs , where he previously worked between 2001 and 2004. There had been speculation that Sunak, who was in No 10 between October 2022 and July 2024, would leave the Commons to take up a Silicon Valley role shortly after the election. He previously lived in California, where he still has a home, and held a US visa until 2021. But in his final prime minister's questions, Sunak vowed to spend more time in his constituency, which he called ""the greatest place on Earth"". ""If anyone needs me, I will be in Yorkshire,"" he said. All proceeds from the new roles will be donated to The Richmond Project, a charity Sunak founded with his wife to tackle numeracy problems in the UK, another area he was vocal about while in Downing Street. Posting on social media, Sunak said he would use his roles to ""ensure"" that coming technological change ""delivers the improvements in all of our lives"". Sunak said: ""I have long believed that technology will transform our world and play a key part in determining our future.

Nine people were removed on Thursday, in addition to a group of 10 last week, the government said. Previous removals have involved smaller numbers of people. It takes the number returned to France under the deal to 26, while the UK has accepted 18 in return. Ministers hope the scheme will deter people from attempting to enter the UK illegally in small boats by threatening removal to France, with properly vetted asylum seekers accepted in return. But on Thursday, the Home Office confirmed 1,075 migrants crossed the Channel the previous day. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the recent return of larger groups would send a ""clear message"" to ""think twice"" about travelling to the UK illegally. ""We must put an end to these dangerous crossings which put lives at risk and money in the pockets of criminal gangs,"" Mahmood said. Thursday's flight saw a regular deportation flight bound for Eastern Europe diverted to France to offload nine people. The Home Office said more flights are scheduled to take place ""over the coming days and weeks"". The first removal under the UK-France deal was carried out in September, with the scheme set to run until June 2026.

East Wiltshire MP Danny Kruger became the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to the party last month and has now written to his 71,000-strong electorate to explain why. He explained he had ""jumped ship"" because of what he claimed were Tory ""failures"" on issues such as mass migration and Brexit, which he believes led to a loss of confidence in the party. The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment on Mr Kruger's claims. Mr Kruger said his former party was ""rightly and naturally punished for its record"" at the 2024 election in the letter, which was sent to every constituency household. He said: ""I was elected in 2019 to 'get Brexit done' and then – as Boris always stressed – to move beyond Brexit and fix the underlying problems with our country. ""We did the Brexit bit, but then we failed. Most of all, we failed to control our borders and reduce taxes as we had promised. ""Many of our communities have experienced huge and unwelcome change due to mass migration."" He further described his unhappiness at the armed forces being ""hollowed out"", the ""highly precarious"" nature of the economy, and said public services were ""at the brink of collapse"", despite spending increases. Following his defection, Mr Kruger was criticised for not calling a by-election by both the leader of the Conservatives on Wiltshire Council, Richard Clewer, and Melksham and Devizes Conservative Association chair Brian Burchfield.

532441c5e000,Pubs could stay open longer under licensing reforms,,"Pubs could stay open longer under licensing reforms Getty Images Pubs and bars in England and Wales could see extended opening hours as the government launches a fast-track review on ""outdated"" licensing rules. The plans could make it easier for venues to serve food outside and host more live music, in a bid to ""remove unnecessary barriers"". Pub landlords and local communities will be able to have their say in a four-week call for evidence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the review was about ""cutting red tape"" and ""boosting footfall"" to support the UK's economic growth. But critics have warned relaxing rules around alcohol would lead to more antisocial behaviour. Sir Keir said ""pubs and bars are the beating heart of our communities"", and added that the government was ""backing them to thrive"". ""When our locals do well, our economy does too,"" he said. The call for evidence will focus on nine key recommendations from the government's licensing taskforce, with particular emphasis on streamlining on-trade alcohol licensing for hospitality venues. It said it plans to cut the cost of licensing , extend business rates relief and cut alcohol duty on draught pints. A proposal to remove the local newspaper advertising requirement for a manager wanting to set up a premises or alter their licence was among the taskforce's other recommendations. It also recommended a permanent increase to the number of temporary event notices - needed to hold a one-off licensable event on unlicensed premises - and simpler rules for trading in outdoor areas. Nick Mackenzie, co-chair of the licensing taskforce and chief executive at pub giant Greene King, said updating the licensing system was a ""vital step"" towards reducing the challenges of running a hospitality business. ""Pubs are faced with continued rising costs, placing them under enormous pressures which is why the government must continue to back the sector, including critical reforms on business rates which would unlock opportunities for pubs to invest and help drive economic growth,"" he said. UK Hospitality, the body which represents pubs and bars in the UK, welcomed the review and said the changes could reduce red tape and costs stifling businesses. ""Under the current regime, a single complaint from a single resident is enough often to stop a business from being able to trade. It can result in a review; it can result in a business being closed down,"" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the body, told BBC Radio 4 Today programme. ""This is not about trading later, this is not about 24-hour licensing and drinking, this is about making sure that we can respond to consumer demands, and that we can offer freedom and flexibility at a low enough costs."" Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, called for the government to implement the licensing taskforce's recommendations published in June and cease ""endlessly delaying whilst it's literally 'last orders' for many pubs and businesses'. But Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK told the Guardian the proposed reforms would be a ""charter for chaos"" without support from local authorities and health experts. He said permitting vendors to sell alcohol later into the evening would ""inevitably mean more victims of crime, including domestic violence, more antisocial behaviour and disturbance, more police time spent dealing with drink-fuelled incidents and both ambulance and A&E staff having to deal with even more people who have come to harm as a result of alcohol"". Pubs in England and Wales do not have universal fixed opening hours under current licensing rules. Instead, local authorities grant licenses with specific operating hours which pubs must follow. The number of pubs in the UK has steadily decreased every year since 2000, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. The association estimates that 378 pubs would close in 2025 across England, Wales and Scotland, amounting to more than 5,600 direct job losses. The BBC has heard from landlords and customers on government's licensing review. Mark Costello from Leeds, who runs a brewery and tap room, said costs were his main concern. ""It doesn't matter how long we're allowed to stay open; it costs a huge amount to stay open so what we need is the customers to fill the place, and they don't have the money to go out like they used to,"" he said. ""We need help with business rates, energy and staffing costs,"" he added Jay Ashton from Huddersfield, who owns two micropubs said he has to deal with ""a bureaucratic mountain"" when dealing with the councils who he says are ""barriers to growth"". Andy in Heathfield, East Sussex, said a pub he lives next to is making ""everyone's lives a misery"" and longer hours and more music will destroy the village. David from Cambridge, who has been a pub goer for 55 years, says the increased business rates, national insurance and minimum wage and customers with less disposable income are the real problem facing pubs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l830m55dno,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/397e/live/2a95de20-a4eb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-09T10:35:20.596000+00:00,3c60ceb4db9c779c1f41d49d65c5b4ee65cc85fb

The two leaders met to discuss ways to expand business and trade links after they signed a landmark trade deal in July . Sir Keir's two-day visit to India's financial capital involved the UK's  largest-ever trade delegation of more than 100 CEOs, entrepreneurs, university vice-chancellors and cultural leaders. Among the other issues discussed by the two prime ministers was the war in Ukraine, as India continues to buy Russian fossil fuels, helping to fund Vladimir Putin's war effort. Sir Keir described the trade deal as ""huge"" for the UK and ""the most ambitious trade deal India has ever done"". Speaking at a press conference, he said: ""This trade deal is a launchpad to boost British leadership in everything from tech, to life sciences, to renewable energy and much more beyond that... ""The opportunity is clear - Just look at the sheer scale of India, the world's largest democracy on track to become the third-largest economy by 2028."" In their meeting, the PM said the pair discussed the need for ""a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, the need for stability and security in the Indo-Pacific, and the need to co-operate in critical areas like climate and energy, including breaking away from dependence on fossil fuels"". Asked whether he raised the issue of India buying Russian oil, Sir Keir told journalists: ""Yes, we did discuss that this morning with President Modi, and we each went through the steps we're taking to bring about a resolution of the conflict."" Modi has described himself as a friend of Putin, but suggested he wanted to see the Ukraine war come to an end through ""dialogue and diplomacy"". Sir Keir said he also raised the case of Jagtar Singh Johal , a British Sikh activist who has been held in an Indian prison for seven years without a conviction. WPA Pool/Getty Images Thousands of photos of Sir Keir Starmer and Narendra Modi line streets in Mumbai Arriving in India, the prime minister was given a rousing welcome, with thousands of giant photos of him and Modi lining the streets in Mumbai. On Thursday Sir Keir announced more UK universities would be opening campuses in India, which the government said would bring a £50m boost to the economy. Confirming that the University of Lancaster and the University of Surrey had been given approval for new campuses, he said: ""I'm delighted that more Indian students will be able to benefit from a world-class British education in the near future – strengthening the ties between our two countries while pumping millions back into our economy and supporting jobs at home."" The UK has a growing network of international campuses in India, with the University of York, University of Aberdeen and Queen's University Belfast among those expected to open campuses from as early as next year. On his first day, Sir Keir met the founder of India's digital ID system - Nandan Nilekani - in the wake of plans to introduce a digital ID for people working in the UK. The government's plan to introduce compulsory digital ID for people to prove their right to work in the UK has seen more than 2.8 million people signing a petition against the idea. But Downing Street is determined to press on, claiming it will curb the ability of migrants to work illegally. The government says the yet-to-be-implemented UK-India trade deal has already led to £1bn of investment and almost 7,000 jobs being created in the UK. Under the deal the UK will cut taxes on goods imported from India including clothing, footwear, jewellery and frozen seafood, while India will reduce duties on the import of Scotch whisky, cosmetics, medical devices and luxury cars.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdj66llg9go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46b6/live/0cd29c00-a4cf-11f0-b9e2-5ff3a1edd7bf.jpg,2025-10-09T14:44:04.198000+00:00,ff8972547f5f79b43722ed535698da96ccf9e748

That is despite the Lib Dems having their most successful general election ever last year in terms of seats won. A party spokesperson said ""in actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats"". It comes as the Green Party of England and Wales says it now has 90,000 members, a 91% increase on 2020 figures. The Liberal Democrats saw a significant boost in membership in the run-up to Brexit in 2020, when the party was campaigning for a second referendum. The drop in paid-up members since then has been masked by the inclusion of ""registered supporters"" in figures published in the party's annual accounts each year since 2017. Registered supporters sign up for free to get access to briefings and events, but they cannot decide policy or vote in leadership elections. The party clearly states the figure published in the annual accounts relates to both member and supporters. However, it does not provide a breakdown. 'Public profile' Prof Tim Bale leads the Party Membership Project, a joint project between Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University. He said the drop in membership was surprising given the Lib Dems' electoral success, which would suggest ""a party on the up, in which case you might get more ambitious people wanting to join it"". But he added: ""There's an extent to which surges into parties are prompted by public profile... and they don't seem to have much chance of getting into government at the moment."" In more positive news for the Lib Dems, he said research carried out by his project after the 2024 election showed that the Liberal Democrats were the most active of all the memberships of the political parties. Figures collected showed that a greater proportion of Lib Dem members (19%) had canvassed voters face-to-face or over the phone than any other party. Prof Bale said there was ""all sorts of research over time that, certainly in very close races, contact with the voters, whether that be face to face or just leafletting does seem to make a difference"". A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""We have a record number of MPs, the most popular party leader in the country, and elected more councillors than Labour or the Conservatives for the first time ever in May's local elections. ""When it comes to actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats as the only party that can stop Reform turning Trump's America into Farage's Britain."" Other parties Working out how many members a political party has can be tricky. There is no legal obligation for political parties to publish their membership figures, so they tend to only be revealed in annual accounts or when a party holds a leadership election. Labour, which is the largest political party in the UK on current publicly available figures, has seen a drop in membership of 37% since 2020. Latest published figures put its membership at 333,235 at the end of last year, although reports have suggested it may have fallen further to 309,000. An updated figure should be given by Labour later this month, when the winner of its deputy leadership contest is announced. Reform UK did not give a figure for membership in its annual accounts last year, but a ticker on its website says it has just under 260,000 members. The Green Party of England and Wales has seen a rapid surge in membership and now says its has 90,000 members, which is a 54% rise on last year's figure of 58,322 in December. The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures, but 131,680 people were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election, which is 40,000 fewer than in the 2022 contest. Party membership figures are not verified by outside bodies. Where we got our figures The figure that has been most recently used for the current size of the Lib Dems is 83,174, which was the figure for December 2024 that appears in the party's annual accounts, including both members and registered supporters. As the freelance journalist Adam Ramsay has pointed out, the figure for paid-up members is given elsewhere, in a statement for the party treasurer in the accounts for the Liberal Democrats in England . It says there was an ""overall membership of 60K"", with 55,000 - or 92% of them - in England, and supporter levels that ""remain constant at over 20K"". To get the membership figure for 2020, we looked to the number of ballot papers issued in the leadership election, as only full members can vote. At the time, the party said it had issued 117,924, papers, which was its highest ever number.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5069p70x2o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2fa8/live/4ac8fe20-a45f-11f0-a789-358ea6d9d143.png,2025-10-09T01:13:34.391000+00:00,686e1a8729e5033c76cfd3d7c632471b9b52762f
9d94af385a6e,All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time,,"All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time Emma Simpson Business correspondent and Emer Moreau Business reporter PA Media All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers, the government has announced. The change could potentially have a major effect on the size of the payouts some victims are able to achieve. It is one of a number of improvements to the compensation schemes available to victims, made in response to the first report from the public inquiry into the scandal, widely described as one of the UK's worst ever miscarriages of justice. In July, the chair of the inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, delivered his findings into the human impact of the scandal and called for urgent action . The government said it has accepted all but one of the recommendations relating specifically to Horizon. More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon computer system made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts. Hundreds of others poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution. Making the announcement, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said there was ""clearly more to do to bring justice to those affected"" and accepting the recommendations was a ""crucial step"" towards doing this. There are now three compensation schemes for victims in various circumstances, but they have been criticised for being too slow and complicated with many of the worst affected victims receiving offers for far less than they'd originally claimed for. Victims who have sought compensation through the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) - which accounts for more than half of the compensation claims paid out so far - are now eligible for government-funded legal advice to help them decide whether to accept a fixed sum offer, in changes announced by the government on Thursday. This brings it in line with the other schemes. The government has also committed to setting up a new appeals process for postmasters who accepted a fixed payout under the HSS scheme, which also includes funded legal advice. Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help. Action taken in response to other recommendations included: the government extending the date for the closure of the HSS scheme giving greater clarity on the definition of ""full and fair redress"" starting work on a restorative justice project for postmasters So far, more than £1.2bn has been paid out to more than 9,000 claimants across all of the compensation schemes. The Post Office said it had been working closely with the Government to respond to the inquiry's report and had agreed a deadline of the end of January 2026 for accepting new applications to the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, saying it would give potential applicants more time to consider their case. ""I encourage any current or former postmaster who thinks they might be eligible for the Horizon Shortfall Scheme to get in touch ahead of the closure date. We have a dedicated claimant support team available on the phone to discuss your options, provide support, and answer any questions so we can begin to process your claim right away,""  said Post Office Chair, Nigel Railton. Reacting, a spokesperson for Fujitsu - who provided the Horizon IT system - said the company had ""apologised for, and deeply regret, our role in sub-postmasters' suffering"". 'Battling all the time' Tony Downey Tony Downey and his wife Caroline were victims of the Post Office scandal Tony Downey bought the Hawkshead Post Office in the Lake District in 2001. He and his wife Caroline were forced to put in £35,000 of their own savings to make up for ""losses"" created by the faulty software. He lost his home, his livelihood and went bankrupt as a result. His health has also suffered. Mr Downey is still waiting for full compensation nearly three years after submitting his claim. ""It just seems to be battling, all the time, to get a little bit more, and a little bit more, and a little bit more,"" he said. ""We're just exhausted with it."" Responding to Mr Downey's testimony, a government spokesperson said: ""While we do not comment on individual cases, we take every effort to make full and fair offers to all claimants and only request information that will enable us to do so."" Neil Hudgell of Hudgell Solicitors, which represents hundreds of victims, said it is ""proper that applicants are entitled to have their cases fully assessed before electing to accept a fixed sum"". He said there would likely be ""an upturn in numbers"" seeking compensation as deadlines for applying are set. ""There are clearly going to be a lot more claims in the system,"" he said. Mr Hudgell added that claims were still being processed slowly, and said that unless more resources were invested to speed up claims handling, ""we will still be needing to talk about compensation claims in three to five years' time.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7dx7le0ddo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a196/live/d4a0ecd0-a4fe-11f0-9779-cd87a9626924.jpg,2025-10-09T16:00:32.490000+00:00,c67b42e1d1fd72ed1ba318c5909ddfb28d42c776

Caroline Clapper, who sits on both Hertfordshire County and Hertsmere Borough councils, said a by-election would incur ""a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer"". Fellow defector Brett Rosehill said other councillors had switched parties and this was the first time demands had been made for a by-election. Clapper also said there was no precedent for a poll being called following a politician's move to a different party. Steve Fraser Steve Fraser, a Hertsmere voter, says councillors who change party should resign and contest a by-election Steve Fraser, who lives in Potters Bar, said: ""When our councillors decide to change parties part way through their term of office, they should resign so that an election is held. ""Most people intend their vote for a party in the election, rather than for the particular person standing. ""So, if someone decides to change party part way through their term it's only fair that they should resign and, if they like, stand again in their new colours."" On social media, Carol Ripley said: ""Sorry but this is just not fair on voters who elected this councillor."" In the county council elections earlier this year, Clapper received 67% of the vote for the Conservatives in Watling ward. The Reform UK candidate in the same ward came second with just 16%, but that result may not necessarily be replicated in a by-election. Simon Dedman/BBC Caroline Clapper was re-elected to the Watling ward in this year's election Clapper said: ""I completely understand that some residents may feel surprised or disappointed by my decision to join Reform UK after so many years as a Conservative. ""It is not a decision I have taken lightly. ""However, in local elections people vote first and foremost for the individual candidate they trust to work hard for them. ""There is no precedent for councillors standing down and calling a by-election after changing party affiliation, and such a move would incur a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer."" Rosehill added: ""During this administration alone, there have been five councillors who have switched parties, and this is the first time such demands have been made.

526905a3ce11,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces",,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces Brian Wheeler Political reporter Standing ovation as Badenoch says Tories would scrap stamp duty The next Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes, Kemi Badenoch has said, in a surprise announcement at the end of her first conference speech as party leader. Badenoch received a standing ovation from Tory activists in Manchester as she declared: ""That is how we will help achieve the dream of home ownership for millions."" She said scrapping stamp duty - a tax paid by home buyers in England and Northern Ireland - will ""unlock a fairer and more aspirational society"" and help people of all ages. It came after a speech packed with new policies aimed at grabbing political attention and setting out clear dividing lines with her opponents. Badenoch was under pressure to deliver the speech of her political career, to end speculation that she will face a leadership challenge, as her party continues to trail Labour and Reform UK in the polls. Her 45-minute address was peppered with jokes and personal stories and went down well in the hall, where - in contrast to some of the other speeches this week - there was standing room only. And in a clear break with the leaders' speeches at the Labour and Liberal Democrat conferences, she only mentioned Reform twice. Instead, she concentrated her fire on Labour, accusing Sir Keir Starmer of leading a  ""weak and directionless"" government, which was making ""one hell of a mess"" of the country. Her announcement on stamp duty was kept under wraps until she delivered it, telling the Tory faithful: ""Stamp duty is a bad tax. ""We must free up our housing market, because a society where no-one can afford to buy or move is a society where social mobility is dead."" 'Golden rule' Stamp duty is paid by people buying homes in England and Northern Ireland for more than £125,000 - but first time buyers are exempt from it on properties worth up to £300,000. Those buying homes worth more pay a percentage of the value of the home. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reported to be considering scrapping stamp duty at her Budget in November, although Badenoch claimed it would be significantly increased. Under the Tory plans, stamp duty would be abolished entirely on ""primary residences"". The tax would continue to be charged on additional properties, properties purchased by companies, or by non-UK residents. The Scottish and Welsh arms of the party have confirmed that they would replicate the cut if elected in Scotland and Wales, where taxes similar to stamp duty apply to property purchases. The Conservatives said they had ""cautiously"" estimated that abolishing stamp duty on main homes after 2029 would cost the Treasury £9bn a year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the direct cost of the cut might be around £10.5-11bn a year by that point, with additional costs in Scotland and Wales taken into account. But researchers at the think tank added the estimated cost given by the Tories was not ""unreasonably low"", given uncertainty over how house purchases and property prices could evolve in the coming years. Badenoch insisted she could meet this promise with the money to come from £47bn in planned savings the party announced earlier this week, from cuts to the welfare budget, foreign aid, and Civil Service. The Conservative leader has promised that in office, her party would ensure half of all savings would be put towards reducing the deficit, the gap between government spending and tax revenues. Badenoch said the pledge would be a ""golden rule"" of any future Tory government, as she tries to rebuild credibility on the economy and present her party as the only one that will responsibly manage the public finances. In her conference speech, Badenoch claimed the Conservative Party was ""fizzing with ideas"" to fix the ""broken model"" she said was holding the country back. She pledged to scrap a string of government policies - from new employment rights to VAT on private school fees. And she ran through some of the big policy announcements the party has made this week, including: Her promise to end the ""family farm tax"" got a big cheer in the hall, and her proposals to slash welfare spending and take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights also went down well. In a sustained attack on the Labour government, she said: ""All they have delivered is a doom loop of higher taxes, weaker borders, and month after month of chaos. ""They had a plan to win, but no plan for power. ""No vision for Britain. They know how to make promises, but not how to deliver them."" Acknowledging the Conservatives' dire opinion poll ratings and recent local election losses, she said voters were ""still angry"" with her party. And in a swipe at Reform, she said this had led to ""parties that in normal times would never be seen as a serious option for government are gaining ground, making promises they will never be able to keep"". But the speech was chiefly aimed at emphasising that the Conservative Party is under new leadership - one that was prepared to make the ""bold"" and ""tough"" decisions that her opponents would not.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20zv94ldpko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3560/live/3eedd230-a444-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-08T18:50:53.146000+00:00,2eb6148260cca3329dba90ec2845408cb1f94215
bbb0d618f257,Reform UK removes posts after Labour legal threat,,"Reform UK removes posts after Labour legal threat Jacob Morris Newyddion S4C BBC Reform UK confirmed the posts have since been removed from its social media accounts. Reform UK has deleted social media posts after receiving a legal letter from the Labour Party. Addressed to Llŷr Powell, Reform UK's by-election candidate, the letter accused Reform of using copyrighted images in its material for the Caerphilly by-election. On 7 October, Labour gave the party 24 hours to remove an image featuring the first minister and candidate Richard Tunnicliffe, warning that failure to do so could lead to legal proceedings. Reform UK confirmed the posts have since been removed from its social media accounts. The move follows a row last week, when Reform UK sent its own legal letter to Welsh Labour , citing the Defamation Act 2013 and the Representation of the People Act 1983. The letter came after online posts appeared to link candidate Llŷr Powell to Russian president Vladimir Putin - an accusation the party strongly denies. Reform also objected to references that suggested former Reform Wales leader Nathan Gill had taken bribes. Last month, the 52-year-old from Llangefni, Anglesey, admitted eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. The dispute comes ahead of the Caerphilly by-election on 23 October, where the candidates are: Richard Tunnicliffe (Welsh Labour), Lindsay Whittle (Plaid Cymru), Gareth Potter (Welsh Conservatives), Llŷr Powell (Reform UK), Gareth Hughes (Wales Green Party) Steven Aicheler (Welsh Liberal Democrats), Roger Quilliam (UKIP), Anthony Cook (Gwlad).",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx203vp909go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1bb6/live/d0865cf0-a479-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T07:48:08.741000+00:00,5b28432c1dc2fa22ac934840f3807f9b0b6e5970
3dc82d219481,Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market,,"Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images The debate around stamp duty is intensifying. When Kemi Badenoch said a future Conservative government would abolish it on the purchase of main homes, it went down well at the Tory Party conference . There has also been speculation that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is considering replacing it. Scrapping stamp duty would be popular among some home buyers, including first-time buyers. There's been widespread support in the housing sector as well as among some independent economists. Analysts say there would be some significant consequences of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences, affecting buyers, sellers and the wider UK economy. 1. House prices might rise Whenever there has been a temporary easing of stamp duty, such as in the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdowns, house prices have then risen. It is more difficult to judge whether a permanent abolition would have the same long-term impact on prices as the short-term sweetener of a stamp duty holiday. However, greater demand is likely to feed through to asking prices. ""If, and this is a big if, it is a simple tax giveaway, the likelihood is that the current stamp duty bill simply passes through into prices,"" says Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. In turn, that could mean first-time buyers paying less in stamp duty, but having to find a bigger deposit. ""Given the way stamp duty works, this would be unevenly distributed across the country,"" Mr Cook adds. The most obvious point here is that the government in Westminster can only control stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales have their own land and transaction taxes overseen by the devolved administrations. 2. Tax cut for wealthy A swathe of first-time buyers do not pay stamp duty. That's because, in England and Northern Ireland, they are exempt when buying properties of up to £300,000 . ""For them, the enormous challenge is raising a deposit,"" says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. Data from property portal Rightmove suggests that 40% of homes for sale in England are stamp duty free for first-time buyers. While the vast majority of movers pay stamp duty, the rate increases at certain price thresholds . So, the bigger the home, the bigger the benefit, if stamp duty was scrapped. This will also mean a big regional difference in the impact of such a policy. At the moment, 76% of properties on sale in the North East of England are free of stamp duty for first-time buyers, according to Rightmove's figures. In London, it is only 11%. Richard Donnell, from Zoopla, points out that 60% of all stamp duty is paid in southern England - so the majority of the benefit of abolition would be felt in the south. 3. Easier to find somewhere to move to One of the great selling points of stamp duty abolition is the extra mobility it should provide for workers, buyers, sellers and downsizers, according to experts. ""Homeownership is the foundation of a fairer and more secure society - but stamp duty has denied that opportunity to too many for too long,"" says Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners Alliance. ""Our research shows over 800,000 homeowners have shelved moving plans in the past two years, and stamp duty is a major barrier."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economic think tank, describes stamp duty as ""one of the most economically damaging taxes"". In its most recent analysis, it says particular winners will be those who want to move frequently, to more or less expensive homes. It should, for example, clear an obstacle for older homeowners, who want to sell a family home but are discouraged by stamp duty. If they are more likely to move, then their homes become available to younger families and the whole market becomes more fluid. However, others suggest the influence of stamp duty could be overblown. ""Take someone downsizing, from a £750,000 property to a £300,000 one. In England and Northern Ireland, they'd pay £5,000 in stamp duty. It's a fraction of what they're likely to pay in estate agency fees, and sits along a huge range of costs from conveyancing to removals,"" Ms Coles from Hargreaves Lansdown says. ""It begs the question of whether removing the cost of the tax is a gamechanger."" 4. Potential tax rises elsewhere Stamp duty raises a lot of money for the Treasury, so scrapping it would leave a gap in the public finances. The IFS said that the direct cost of the Conservative policy might be around £10.5bn to £11bn in 2029-30, although the Tories' own estimate is about £9bn. The question for any administration tempted to scrap or reduce stamp duty is how else it finds the money. The Conservatives say they will make savings elsewhere. They also say the policy will boost growth and the housing sector in general, and therefore bring in more tax receipts. The other option is to raise other taxes. As some analysts have said, the main consideration is not what is scrapped, but what replaces it. 5. Impact on renters The idea of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences will benefit homeowners but could end up meaning less choice for renters. The IFS suggests it could discourage the purchase of rental properties by landlords, as they would still have to pay stamp duty. The think tank says it would increase the more favourable tax treatment of owner-occupation relative to renting.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9v7wppzm2ro,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e48c/live/cdb688c0-a4f5-11f0-8e74-1f6664d312e9.jpg,2025-10-09T17:35:08.858000+00:00,24e0ad8aeb1bec8bbc80e47f94d62a9421410940
d3bc42e292f4,What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget?,,"What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget? Getty Images There has been speculation that November's Budget could see Chancellor Rachel Reeves break Labour's pre-election pledge not to increase income tax, National Insurance (NI) or VAT for working people. It's been suggested that she could extend a freeze to the income thresholds at which people start paying the taxes, or have to pay more. What is National Insurance and what does it pay for? The government uses National Insurance to pay benefits and help fund the NHS. It is paid by employees, employers and the self-employed across the UK. Those over the state pension age do not pay it, even if they are working. Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the National Insurance contributions (NICs) you make across your working life. It may be possible to make voluntary payments to fill gaps in your contribution history. How much do employees pay in National Insurance? The type and amount of NI you pay depends on your age, employment status and income. Workers start paying NI when they turn 16 and earn more than £242 a week, or have self-employed profits of more than £12,570 a year. The amount owed is usually deducted automatically from employees' wages along with income tax. The starting rate for NI for employees fell twice in 2024: from 12% to 10%, and then again to 8%. The previous Conservative government said these cuts were worth about £900 a year for a worker earning £35,000. For the self-employed , the rate of NI paid on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 fell from 9% to 6%. This was said to be worth £350 to a self-employed person earning £28,200. Most self-employed people pay their NICs through their self assessment tax return . The NI rate on income and profits above £50,270 is 2% for all workers. How much do employers pay in National Insurance? Since April 2025, employers pay NI at 15% on most employees' wages above £5,000. They previously paid 13.8% on salaries above £9,100. Businesses also pay 15% NI on expenses and benefits they give to their staff - such as company cars or health insurance. The employment allowance - the amount employers can claim back from their NI bill - rose from £5,000 to £10,500. What are the current income tax rates? You have to pay income tax on your earnings from employment, or profits from self-employment, above the tax-free personal allowance of £12,570. Income tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions , income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits. The basic rate of 20% is paid on annual earnings between £12,571 and £50,270. The higher rate of 40% is paid on earnings between £50,271 and £125,140. Once you earn more than £100,000, you also start losing the £12,570 tax-free personal allowance . You lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 that your income goes above £100,000. Anyone earning more than £125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. They also pay an additional rate of income tax of 45% on all earnings above that amount. These rates apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some income tax rates are different in Scotland , where a new 45% band took effect in April 2024. At the same time the top rate also rose from 47% to 48%. What are NI and income tax thresholds and why do they matter? Changes to the income thresholds mean that millions are paying more tax overall, despite the 2024 NI cuts. The thresholds are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. These used to rise every year in line with inflation. However, the previous Conservative government froze the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance at £12,570 until 2028.  It also kept the higher-rate tax threshold at £50,270. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the chancellor have both refused to rule out extending the current freeze. Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancelled out the benefits of the 2024 NI cuts for some workers. In the 2024-25 tax year, it said an average earner would have a tax cut of about £340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between £26,000 and £60,000 would be better off. But by 2027, it said the average earner would be only £140 better off - and only people earning between £32,000 and £55,000 a year would still benefit.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q51vl18yo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d97b/live/fd25fee0-9f93-11f0-b9ae-cbef91e6ae73.jpg,2025-10-10T11:20:32.625000+00:00,34e24c994f13b36c8695c045fbce17ffa3b293c8

Nigel Farage's party also wants out of the ECHR, as well as other international treaties that he thinks stand in the way of curbing illegal immigration. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, meanwhile, has been just as strident the other way. ""Kemi Badenoch has chosen to back Nigel Farage and join Vladimir Putin,"" he declared - adding ""this will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system"". EPA Kemi Badenoch pledged to pull out if the Conservatives win the election, but there are many unanswered questions about the consequences Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has weighed in, though he hovers somewhere in between. He told the BBC he does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing how international law is interpreted to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation. But while strongly-worded opinions over whether or not to pull out of the treaty make for easy headlines, the consequences are deeply complicated. Even Badenoch acknowledged last year that leaving would not be a ""silver bullet"" for tackling immigration. So how is it that such a nuanced issue has been reduced to a political hot potato? Dodging political bullets It was back in 2011 - not far into David Cameron's tenure as prime minister - that this issue came to the forefront of domestic politics. It centred around the case of John Hirst, a man convicted of manslaughter, who argued the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting in any circumstances was a breach of human rights. In 2005 Strasbourg had ruled in his favour. It essentially said the UK's policy was too black and white. Cameron's Labour predecessors Tony Blair and Gordon Brown dodged the political bullet of being seen to give in to the court. But when the relatively new Tory PM said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote, his soundbite propelled the ECHR to the heart of public consciousness. Getty Images David Cameron said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote The ECHR had been largely drafted by a British team and aimed to impose on post-fascist Europe a ""never-again"" package of legal rights. Its content drew heavily on historic laws - for example the concept of Habeas Corpus (banning unlawful detention), can be seen in the ECHR's Article 5. Officially, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights. And when it rules that a country is in breach, the member states come together to find a way of fixing the problem in the Council of Europe (nothing to do with the EU). But in the UK, there is also the Human Rights Act, which means ECHR cases can be dealt with by its own judges. Disputes between UK courts and Strasbourg can be worked through too - what happened following the John Hirst case is testament to this. In 2017, ministers allowed offenders who had been released on licence the right to vote - but made clear that Parliament would never allow votes for criminals still in prison cells. The Council of Europe closed the case. And just weeks ago the Strasbourg court threw out a fresh attempt by a prisoner to re-open the issue. Yet it was the original clash, together with Cameron's comments in 2011, that stuck in many minds. PA Media Starmer does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing certain aspects around how international law is interpreted Adding fuel to the fire that same year, Theresa May - home secretary at the time - shared a story during party conference about a Bolivian man who avoided deportation because of his pet cat. This illustrated the problem with human rights laws, she argued. Only the story, as May told it, wasn't entirely correct , according to England's top judges. The Home Office indeed wanted to send the man home as an illegal immigrant. And the cat - called Maya - had featured in the man's appeal. But that was only a tiny part of the detailed evidence he provided. A spokesperson for the Judicial Office at the Royal Courts of Justice, which issues statements on behalf of senior judges, said at the time that the cat was ""nothing to do with"" the eventual judgement, which allowed the man to stay. Yet the pet became a source of unintentional humour - and when a judge cracked a joke about the cat no longer needing to fear adapting to Bolivian mice, the case took on a life of its own. By that autumn, a mood had begun to take hold about human rights that, 14 years later, has culminated in the Conservatives pledging to leave the ECHR. 'Open-ended and obscure obligations' Richard Ekins KC is a law professor at the University of Oxford and his thinking on “judicial power” for the Policy Exchange think tank has been hugely influential on the right of British politics. He is a staunch critic of the ECHR on the basis that membership in his view compromises UK sovereignty. ""But there is a more fundamental problem,"" he argues. ""And the fundamental problem can be observed by paying attention to what the court has been doing, which really is quite openly to expand the Convention's reach over time."" He references a case last year, where the court ruled that Switzerland had breached human rights by failing to tackle climate change. The incredibly complex judgement was celebrated by campaigners as a game-changer - but a British judge, Tim Eicke KC, said the majority on the panel had ""gone beyond what it is legitimate and permissible for this court to do"". Getty Images The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights set out in the convention ""The judgment… imposes very far reaching, but also open ended and obscure obligations on member states,"" argues Prof Ekins. ""Domestic courts are going to be invited to apply the European Court's new approach to discipline, supervise [and] control climate policy, which obviously is a highly complicated and tangled set of considerations that intersect with social policy, economic policy, foreign policy."" This is the heart of his argument: a court completely divorced from the political will of the British people is now making the UK do things that are far beyond its original remit. ""It's incompatible - its intention at least - with parliamentary democracy,"" he argues. Hijacked by the immigration debate Nowhere is the allegation of overreach stronger in British politics than in Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system. Yet the evidence supporting this claim is often anecdotal and complex - as was the case with Maya the cat. A study of media stories about the ECHR by the University of Oxford's Bonavero Institute for Human Rights found that fewer than 1% of all foreign criminals who have appealed against their deportation in the UK have won their case on human rights grounds. When cases went as far as Strasbourg, the court tended to throw them out. PA Media Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system is based on evidence that is often anecdotal and complex That's not to say there are no issues at all. Lord Jonathan Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge, believes that some decisions by immigration tribunal judges have become ""extravagant"" and far removed from the original boundaries of the right to family life. ""I have no problem about the text of the Convention,"" he says. ""I do have a problem about the unlimited expansion which it's undergone at the hands of the Strasbourg Court. ""It's unfortunate that the whole issue has been hijacked by the question of immigration. ""I think that it will make some difference to the ability to keep people out or deport them if we are not members of the ECHR. But I think the extent that it will make a difference is not widely understood - and has been greatly exaggerated."" Would leaving 'stop the boats'? So, would leaving the ECHR really ""stop the boats"", to use Rishi Sunak's phrase? ""The number one problem about deporting illegal immigrants, first of all, is finding a place which will take them and which is not unsafe,"" argues Lord Sumption. ""And secondly, [there is] the Refugee Convention. It doesn't require us to take in asylum seekers. It does require us to adjudicate on their claims and give them certain rights once they've got here, even if they got here illegally. ""The ECHR is certainly an additional difficulty, but not as great a difficulty, as is suggested."" Getty Images Lord Sumption: 'I think the extent that [it would] make a difference has been greatly exaggerated' The UK government has already promised to devise clearer and stricter rules that will tell immigration officials and judges how to interpret the right to family life. ""I think it is a runner,"" argues Sir Jonathan Jones, who was the Treasury Solicitor until 2020. This, he believes, could be the best way forward - particularly around the definition of the ECHR's Article 8, which guarantees the right to, among other things, family life. ""It's legitimate for the government to say we will take a tighter view, as a proper, reasoned, good faith attempt to rein in what we think Article 8 covers and what it doesn't."" But Alex Chalk, the last Conservative Lord Chancellor before Labour won power, argues that the UK government needs to seek reform faster. ""The ECHR is not holy writ,"" he told the BBC during the Conservative party conference. ""This government should be moving much more quickly to seek urgent reform. [It] should have been saying, look, we want to lead on this to do this in six weeks. ""The US Constitution was drafted in 15 weeks or so. This really can be done."" 'Rights are going to suffer' Human rights lawyer Harriet Wistrich is concerned about what could be lost if the UK does leave the ECHR. It has, she argues, been at the forefront of challenging the state's treatment of victims of awful abuses. ""We were able to hold Greater Manchester Police accountable on behalf of Rochdale grooming gang victims through civil [damages] proceedings. ""The Hillsborough inquests were possible by having Article 2 [the right to life] inquiries into deaths, where you want to examine what went wrong and what the state could have done differently. ""If we withdraw fully… it's those rights that are going to suffer,"" says Ms Wistrich, who is also the founder of the Centre for Women's Justice. EPA In May, nine nations called for ECHR reform over migration law. Their open letter - which the UK did not sign - called for states to have greater freedom over who to kick out Beyond legal battles at home, there are big international questions too around leaving. The 1998 Belfast Agreement, the cornerstone of peace in Northern Ireland, and the post-Brexit deal with the European Union placed respect for human rights law at their centre. Critics of withdrawing from the EHCR predict both could come crashing down. But Professor Ekins believes that you can have human rights safeguards without a supranational court overseeing all nations. He and colleagues wrote a detailed proposal on Northern Ireland that argue the historic arrangements don't require the UK to remain in the ECHR, providing it honours human rights and cross-community power-sharing arrangements by other means. James Manning/PA Wire Leaving the ECHR 'will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system,' Sir Ed Davey argued The issues in Northern Ireland and the Republic could, however, go deeper. Sir Jonathan Jones for one is sceptical about how leaving the ECHR would go down in both places - because the ECHR's role in the agreement was to demonstrate to a lot of people who do not trust the British state that there are laws in place to protect them. Without it, whoever has a majority in the Commons would be able to do whatever they wanted, thanks to the ""winner takes all"" reality of how our constitution works. ""The thing about the Convention is that it constrains governments, and it constrains the way that governments can treat minorities and people it doesn't like,"" he says. ""If we were out of the ECHR, you wouldn't have that constraint."" Alex Chalk warns there could be an international price to leaving, too. There is value, he says, in sitting at the Council of Europe and raising issues with French and German counterparts at international conferences. ""You should try to reform before you yank your way out because inevitably there could be cost to doing so,"" he argues. But ultimately, he adds, ""this is a matter of politics more than it is of law"".

074254cd4834,Bleak reality of opposition sets in for Conservatives,,"Before us, there is a battalion of unemployed chairs. For the Conservatives right now, the fight even to be listened to is not easy. The speech by the shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride is one of the big set-piece moments of this conference. And yet there were countless empty seats in a modestly sized hall. Next door, in the exhibition centre, there are swathes of empty blue carpet. Some of the fringe events exploring the party's future have been standing room only. But not in the main hall. This party, so often and for so long the dominating force in British politics, is a shrivelled version of its usual self. They have not had a conference like this in more than a quarter of a century. Granted, they were in opposition this time last year too. But many attendees then will have signed up before they knew about that – the general election could have come after it. Plus, 12 months ago, there was a survivors' elation vibe about their proceedings: a leadership election was underway and members of any political party tend to revel in a battle of ideas and personalities, almost whatever the circumstances. This year, the bleak reality of opposition has set in. Even back in 1998, a year and a bit into their last big stint in opposition, they were the principal voice in opposition to a big majority government. Not so now. A year and a bit on from a cataclysmic election defeat, the Tories have become more unpopular. It is Reform UK that have momentum, a sustained lead in the opinion polls and a recent track record of election victories, albeit a very long way away from a general election. In the weeks prior to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester, there has been a steady drip drip of former Tories joining Nigel Farage, some with the parting rhetorical gift of claiming their old party is finished. It is not an entirely downcast mood here though. Perhaps by definition those who have turned up are still up for the scrap ahead. The party has decided to embark on a blitz of policy announcements, after a year in which they have endured a recession in attention amid the boom in interest in Reform. What they want you to notice is their pitch to be seen as economically credible. They want to shrink the state by around £50bn by cutting benefits, cutting foreign aid and cutting the civil service. Most of that money saved would be spent paying down the deficit, but some would go on eye-catching policies like scrapping business rates in England and helping young people save to buy a home . Yet the ghost of Liz Truss lingers: despite their best efforts to politely disown her, the Conservatives' opponents will probably never lose their appetite for reminding voters of the calamity of her brief premiership . And for Kemi Badenoch, the challenge is being noticed – and persuading her party to keep her in her job. Her rivals, Sir Keir Starmer, Reform leader Nigel Farage and the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey have all been around for longer and are all likely better known. Filling those empty chairs, commanding attention is just the beginning of the task she confronts. Has there ever been a tougher time in modern history for the Conservative Party? I'm not sure there has.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ne9yz37go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ea50/live/b06730f0-a2d2-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T16:25:19.948000+00:00,bcb9d3ab92f89df1475051214b94c462e3bfe026
32ea352a35d5,Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future,,"Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future Matt Chorley 5 Live presenter PA Media Louis Armstrong had all of it in the world. The Beautiful South needed a little more. For Kemi Badenoch, and her 118 MPs, time is also on their minds. The Conservative leader believes she needs more time, to turn around her party from its historic drubbing in last year's general election. Yet as time's gone on, she's gone further down in the polls. ""I didn't say it would be easy,"" she told Tory members on Sunday. ""And I didn't say it would be quick."" For her MPs - and I've contacted almost all of them for my BBC Radio 5 Live show via text and WhatsApp over the last few days - time is of the essence, and for some, it is already running out. Around one in three Tory MPs responded to my questions about the mood of the party, and the pressure Badenoch is under. They break down roughly into two camps. In the first are those who think the next election is a considerable way off and want Badenoch to be given space to try to repair damage not all of her own making. The mood, they insist, is better than much of the media speculation. ""Chipper"", even. They take comfort from Labour's own woes and leadership speculation, and cling to a belief that Reform UK's populist policies increasingly do not survive contact with reality. ""There's a gallows humour about the party, a 'well it can't get any worse, can it?' strange jovialness which is kind of bonding,"" says one Tory MP. Several texts I received suggested Badenoch had bought herself more time in office, perhaps months, with a single performance at Prime Minister's Questions last month , when she challenged Keir Starmer over what he knew about the friendship between his US ambassador, Peter Mandelson, and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. One former cabinet minister said: ""The Mandelson PMQs was a turning point. She smashed it. ""That one half hour has probably bought her another six months of grace in the job. She doesn't need to learn the same lesson twice. Giving her time and space is starting to pay dividends."" And then there is the second camp who think the clock is ticking: on her leadership and on the long-term viability of what used to be called the world's oldest and most successful political party. They grumble, especially those elected for the first time last year, about a leader's office lacking in direction, fight, even a willingness to acknowledge their existence. ""It's not that we're not getting listened to as a party,"" says one 2024 Tory MP. ""It's that we've nothing to say. We're too timid, we think we're in government still and are fretting about costing things that we'll never have to worry about if we keep on launching commissions and our best pushback against Reform is 'That's not costed, you know'."" In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches. When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied ""oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in"". Some tell me privately that the looming date of 2 November, when Badenoch will have been in office for a year and therefore open to a confidence vote, is ""focusing minds"" in the leader's office. ""She needs to have a very impactful conference in order to stave off a confidence vote before the end of the year in my view,"" says one MP. ""There's a whiff of fatality in the air because of the polls."" So how much time does she have? Next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd and many English councils are shaping up to be ""the moment of truth"", according to some of her MPs. (Labour MPs were saying similar things to me about Keir Starmer last week.) One member of Badenoch's own frontbench, who closely monitors the mood of the party, texts me bluntly: ""She is under unbelievable pressure. This will be her last conference as leader."" When I expressed some surprise at the prediction, the MP quickly responded: ""I like Kemi and I think we should stick with the leader we have so I hope I'm completely wrong."" Others are more convinced that her time is running out. One Conservative who publicly backed Badenoch in last year's leadership contest told me: ""Kemi's time as leader could end by Christmas rather than after the May elections. ""Ultimately unpredictable, and how conference goes will shape the outcome, but conference, and post conference polls, are undoubtedly pivotal."" Whatever the merits of having someone different in charge – and many see Robert Jenrick waiting in the wings – it risks exposing the Tories once again to the most damaging of political forces: ridicule. One grandee tells me: ""We need to regain our senses and remember we were totally thrashed last summer and have not yet been forgiven. More shenanigans won't help."" A shadow minister agrees: ""This conference is super important. People and members want direction and messaging and so this is Kemi's moment. She can't squander it - she needs to show why we are the sensible option on the right and a genuine force still. ""If she doesn't deliver it could be curtains but most MPs I speak to want this to work. There is too much PTSD from the last five years."" A former cabinet minister says: ""The Tories will start to make progress - and it will be on the economy – after enough time has passed since our crushing defeat and the public feel enough water under the bridge since that defeat."" Another says: ""When the country is ready to listen to us again (a year hence maybe?), we'll show that we are totally unified, have some great people and the right ideas."" One MP who has been in the Commons for two decades says: ""No one is expecting instant miracles nor is there urgent appetite for a coup."" PA Media Kemi Badenoch defeated rivals Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat in the 2024 leadership election in Birmingham Some note that she is very much the new kid on the block: Farage has been an elected politician on and off for more than quarter of a century. Starmer has been leader for almost six years. Even Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, was a minister in the coalition government 15 years ago. Being unknown means voters struggle to work out what she is about, but it also presents an opportunity to move beyond the last Tory government and appear new and fresh. Talk continues about what to do about Reform. Will some sort of deal have to be made? A merger? A pact? A takeover? Whatever, the Tories need to be in a stronger position before it can think about such a negotiation. There is also a theory that's taken hold in Conservative thinking that part of their predicament is the fault of Keir Starmer. ""Usually the opposition would have longer but the government collapse in popularity has happened so quickly it has sharpened focus on needing to have an alternative narrative,"" one Tory MP, first elected in 2024, said. ""It is hard to look like a renewed party though when so many of the key people are well known from the last government when it was comprehensively dumped from power."" Some declare her party conference pledge to repeal the Climate Change Act a ""gamechanger"". Others say the same of a promise to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. What is not always clear is if they actually expect it to change the game, or merely hope it might. Badenoch and her team are being urged to ""quickly set out a bold, uncompromisingly honest, radical 'Maggie 2.0' program of reform, on tax, small business, immigration and welfare, to tackle the grievances Farage is feeding on"". EPA Three display cabinets at Conservative party conference holding outfits worn by Margaret Thatcher Ah yes, Maggie. Margaret Thatcher. She would have turned 100 this month, but the former prime minister still haunts this conference and this party. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who took over as leader of the Conservatives after their 2001 election defeat before being ousted two years later, told me: ""I think it's a very difficult time for anyone to be leader. ""The Conservative party has a messiah complex, thinking some messiah will suddenly appear and lead us to the promised land. ""They look back to Margaret Thatcher and think she arrived as a fully-formed messiah to save the party and the country. In fact, when she arrived some people thought 'this is a disaster'. People said she was shrill, weak, difficult. It took her time for her strength of character and intellect to dominate and for her to become the leader she was. ""Kemi has that capability and needs time too. Otherwise we risk confirming people's view of us from our behaviour during the last government that we are fratricidal and not to be trusted."" In the conference exhibition hall in Manchester there is a lot of Thatcher merchandise - and a glass display case holding the burgundy wool suit she wore on the day she left Downing Street - a monument to the moment a female Tory leader was ousted by her colleagues because they believed she was doing more harm than good. After this conference week in Manchester we might have a clearer idea if Tory MPs are ready to do that particular Time Warp again.

43c9596e4810,The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire,,"The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire James Cook Scotland editor Getty Images Something has shifted in Scotland. The saltire, which was long embraced by supporters of Scottish independence, has now been unfurled for a different cause. Up and down the land, the blue and white of St Andrew is fluttering from lampposts and being waved alongside the union flag at anti-immigration protests. Until recently those two standards were more often seen on different sides of the debate about Scotland's future. Now the saltire's presence is generating controversy of its own at demonstrations from Perth to Aberdeen and from Glasgow to Falkirk, where the latest rally was held on Wednesday evening. This battle for Scotland's flag is also a battle about what it means to be a patriot in modern Scotland - a battle of competing nationalisms. Steven Rennie addresses a rally outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Steven Rennie is one of the prominent figures in these recent protests. He blends opposition to independence and immigration with sharp criticism of the Scottish National Party - which is in favour of both. I stood within a few feet of Mr Rennie as he addressed hundreds of supporters in the centre of Glasgow in late September. With his shoulders wrapped in the red, white and blue of the union flag, he spoke of the saltire. ""They claimed our national flag as their own and for 12 long years we've allowed them to wield it as a weapon of division and hate. ""But no more. We have reclaimed our flag, our identity, our pride and also our resolve,"" he said. Those on opposing sides of the debate have made their feelings known at protests The crowd - separated from hundreds of counter-protesters by a line of police officers - cheered the denunciation of the SNP whose leaders, in a referendum 11 years ago , failed to persuade a majority of Scottish voters to opt to leave the UK. ""The SNP has wreaked havoc on our nation, dismantling our prosperity and our potential at every turn, replacing us with new Scots and putting our own people at the bottom of the pile,"" said Mr Rennie. ""New Scots"" is a welcoming term used by Scottish government ministers who are keen to attract more foreign workers to help grow an economy which is challenged by a record low birth rate . The SNP has run the devolved government in Edinburgh since 2007 but immigration remains the responsibility of the UK government in London - and it has rejected calls for a separate Scottish visa system . Getty Images There was a counter-protest to the demonstration on Falkirk in August Migration is a thorn in the side for Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and appears to be rising up the agenda ahead of the Scottish parliamentary elections next spring. The small boats crisis and the accommodation of asylum seekers in hotels , which Sir Keir has promised to phase out, have fuelled demonstrations around the UK. That includes protests in Falkirk, where a building which was once a three-star hotel is being used to house migrants. One protester, who gave his name as Mark, held a union flag emblazoned with ""Stop the Boats"". He said politicians should be fixing ailing public services, not spending taxpayers' money on medical and dental care for asylum seekers. Mark was one of the protesters in Falkirk ""We're sick of these people rolling up in boats, getting four-star hotels,"" he told me. ""They're getting their three meals a day while Britain's services suffer. We're just sick of it and Starmer is not doing enough to try and stop it."" Minutes earlier one of the speakers had shouted: ""Keep Britain white. Keep Scotland white. Keep Scotland Scottish."" Mark insisted the man did not speak for him, and that the protest was ""nothing to do with racism"". Outside the hotel a group of counter-protesters, including many trade unionists, had gathered. They too were critical of the prime minister – but for different reasons. They accused him of pandering to the far right. Getty Images Counter-protesters demonstrated against a rally protesting about immigration in Glasgow earlier this month The two camps appear to share a sense of disgust about the UK's ailing economy and the poor state of public services - although they do not necessarily agree on the causes or the solutions. ""The real issue in our society is the people in government who aren't tackling these issues head on, not people fleeing persecution trying to find a better place to live,"" said a counter protester in Falkirk, who gave her name as Sage. Referring to the anti-asylum seeker protest across the road, she said: ""I don't blame these people for falling for these narratives, because everyone is suffering. ""It doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum we're on, everyone is going through it."" The real problem, insisted Sage, was billionaires making record profits and not paying enough tax. ""We know who is underfunding our services. It's not migrants and refugees,"" she said. One recurring complaint among protesters is about the number of migrants being housed at local authority expense. The issue is most acute in Glasgow, which has the UK's highest number of refugees in council accommodation. Asylum seekers are housed by the UK Home Office but, after they are granted leave to remain and become refugees, that support quickly expires. At that point, many become homeless and, because Scottish councils have a statutory duty to house all homeless people, they must step in. ""Essentially, we have run out of temporary accommodation,"" said Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken. ""We don't have anywhere to put all of these people who are now declaring themselves homeless in the city, and we're having to put them up in hotels, and that's very, very expensive."" Getty Images Protesters in Falkirk said they were opposed to housing asylum seekers in the town The SNP councillor for Langside wants the UK government to step in but is at pains to stress that refugees do not have priority over anyone else. Aitken added: ""Anyone who is telling you that asylum seekers and refugees are prioritised by the SNP, by the Scottish government, or by this council is lying to you. It is simply not true."" Still, some hostility to immigrants persists and migration has risen up the list of Scottish voters' concerns as flags have appeared on lampposts around the country. Hundreds of saltires have gone up in working class communities such as those in north and east Glasgow; Sighthill in Edinburgh; and Falkirk's Westfield. Shawn, a refugee who lives in north Glasgow, believes the saltire usually represents peace, harmony and inclusion - but says it is now being flown ""for the far-right and racism"". The former police officer and his mother Mala successfully sought asylum in the UK after they fled their South East Asian homeland in circumstances they asked not to discuss in public for their own safety. Shawn said he had experienced racism on the streets of Glasgow Shawn, who runs a community organisation called the Springburn Unity Network, said he had been subjected to racist insults in Glasgow and knew immigrants who were afraid to leave their homes because of the recent protests. Debates about flags are not just raging in Scotland's big cities and working class towns. In the prosperous Renfrewshire village of Bridge of Weir, the hoisting of saltires has led to a row on the local Facebook group. In the middle of the village, Dougie Moore told me he approved of the flags because they sent a message to immigrants that ""they should be coming to enjoy our country the way that we enjoy it rather than changing things"". Bunty Singh, who owns a local café and delicatessen, said he had no issue with anyone flying a national flag but also insisted there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir. ""It's a peaceful, lovely village,"" insisted Mr Singh who was born in Glasgow to parents who were originally from India. ""We're happy to be here and we are welcomed here."" Bunty Singh said there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir But at a local community hub Ian Gillies was concerned about the saltires, which he regarded as unwelcoming and divisive. ""I think it's in keeping with the spirit of the age,"" he said. ""'Every man for himself and we don't want anybody else coming our way.' I see the same trend in the States and elsewhere in the continent. It's sad to see it coming here."" Mr Gillies is not the only person to note an Americanisation of politics on this side of the Atlantic in the age of Donald Trump and social media. At the protest in Glasgow where Steven Rennie spoke about the saltire, there were chants, calls and placards in support of right-wing American influencer Charlie Kirk, who had been shot dead days earlier. Later the crowd chanted ""Oh Tommy, Tommy"", in tribute to the convicted criminal and far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , who uses the name Tommy Robinson and has been supported by Elon Musk. Getty Images There were tributes to the late right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk at a demonstration in Glasgow Matthew Feldman, a visiting professor at Liverpool Hope University and leading expert on the radical right, said he was concerned that extremism was bleeding into mainstream political debate because overt racism and the glorification of terrorism were ""being given a pass"" on US-owned social media platforms. At the anti-migrant protest in Falkirk, one banner referenced former SNP first minister Humza Yousaf's calls for greater ethnic diversity in Scottish public life in a speech which had been highlighted and criticised by Musk and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The same banner went on to quote a white supremacist slogan known as the 14 Words: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" ""The 14 Words actually comes from the eighth chapter of Mein Kampf,"" explained Prof Feldman. He said the slogan was ""a translation of Hitler's sense of Aryan supremacy"" and was popularised in the US in the 1980s by the late white supremacist David Lane. ""It is inconceivable to me that somebody that is writing out that phrase doesn't associate it with white supremacism and, more importantly, with a sort of an anti or racist view towards ethnic and religious minorities,"" added Prof Feldman. Getty Images One banner at a protest in Falkirk contained a white supremacist slogan It was not the only extreme language on display in Falkirk. Another sign read ""Kill 'Em All. Let God Sort 'Em Out,"" a phrase originally associated with a 13th Century Catholic crusade. While not defending the placards, many of the protesters we spoke to insisted they had genuine concerns about the safety of women and children. They pointed to the conviction of an Afghan asylum seeker for raping a 15-year-girl in the town and the arrest of a resident of the asylum hotel on sexual indecency charges, which he denies. Farage has also suggested sexual assault by asylum seekers is a particular problem, a claim described by Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken as one of history's oldest and nastiest racist slurs. When I spoke to Farage on a visit to Aberdeen earlier this year he insisted that Reform UK was now a serious contender in Scottish politics. ""I've spent a year going around England campaigning ahead of the English local elections, and perceptions of me and the party have changed over that last year, and I intend to make that happen in Scotland over the next year,"" he told me. That claim may be bolstered by Reform's strong third place in June's Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election , which Labour won. On Wednesday, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said arguments about immigration were being ""fanned by a wider debate"" going on in the UK and around the globe. The SNP leader told me he believed in a Scotland that was ""tolerant, welcoming and inclusive"" and urged people ""to avoid us being swept down a route of a relentless rightward direction in the United Kingdom"". Swinney added: ""I don't think that's where Scotland wants to be. I don't think that's how Scotland feels. And I want to make sure that people in Scotland realise that there is a danger that we will be carried down that route if we don't take a different course."" Polls ahead of May's Holyrood election suggest a big lead for the SNP, with Reform potentially overtaking the Conservatives to challenge Labour for second place, despite never before having won a seat at Holyrood. Whatever flags are waved by whichever party in the campaign, immigration appears likely to take its place alongside the economy and public services as a big issue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxqknx7jqo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fe18/live/e1266390-a44a-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T05:23:41.120000+00:00,f00d9d17665b7a7e2ee6de315db240aad28103dd
e598dc3621ee,Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power?,,"Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power? Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images In the month since self-proclaimed ""eco-populist"" Zack Polanski took charge of the Green Party of England and Wales, there has been a noticeable change within the party. With over 20,000 new members in recent months, the Green Party is the largest it has ever been. The party appears to be trying to shed its image as well-meaning eco-warriors to become an insurgent force. While there appears to be momentum within the party, in a splintered political landscape there is a question mark over how the Greens can turn this into votes. When campaigning to become Green Party leader, Polanski promised to ""pick fights"". On the eve of his first conference as leader, Polanski was argumentative during an interview on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme when pushed to defend his deputy Mothin Ali over inflammatory comments he had made about an Israeli army reservist. This willingness to create controversy - if it wins attention and cuts through to the public - has been embraced by his party. Boldness is needed to combat voter disillusionment and rising right-wing populism, argues Rachel Millward, Polanski's other deputy co-leader. ""I guess I can't see the point of not going as big as you can go,"" says Millward. ""If we stay timid, we might gain nothing. ""Whereas, if we're bold we definitely gain people because it resonates because it's true and it's real and people are craving that honesty."" The Green Party's head of elections, Chris Williams, oversaw the Greens' best-ever general election campaign last year - it gave the party four MPs for the first time by tailoring and targeting campaigns in both Tory and Labour heartlands. But he is now recalibrating the party's approach to reflects Polanski's leadership style. ""To tailor an old adage: if you try to annoy nobody you don't excite anybody,"" is how he puts it. The Green Party see on opportunity to build on the momentum. With increased belief comes more members, more donations ""the campaigns get bigger, and the targets grow, and we win more seats, and we just build upwards and keep on going"", Williams argues. The UK's shifting electoral landscape, is also bringing growing opportunity, Williams says. ""By-elections are being won with just 27% of the vote. ""The swings we need are smaller - instead of climbing Everest, we're having to climb Snowdon now in order to win a constituency."" The party has already picked a raft of so-called ""development constituencies"" in Tory and Labour held areas across the country, though the targets are predominantly urban where traditional parties like Labour and the Conservatives are shedding votes fastest, Williams says. Some members warn a shift away from localised strategy could risk alienating the very voters who delivered the breakthrough wins in 2024. The party's two current MPs in rural areas could be particularly exposed - ex-leader Adrian Ramsay in Waveney Valley, on the border of Suffolk and Norfolk, and Ellie Chowns in North Herefordshire. Ramsay and Chowns also ran on a joint ticket against Polanski, picking up just 16% of the vote. On the ground, Millward - who co-leads the predominantly rural Wealden District Council - insists the countryside vote is not at risk. ""We've had more new members coming in, even in our rural area,"" Millward says. Getty Images Zack Polanski, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward (l-r) are set on taking the Green Party in a new direction. For all their ideological differences, the Green Party is watching Reform UK as a case study in how to win attention and turn it into electoral support. A well-attended panel discussion on ""how to stop Reform"" at conference was notable for the number of members praising the work of the Green's foe Nigel Farage. Members argued for copying a playbook of simple messaging, emotional appeal and a willingness to provoke - albeit with different content. In his leader's speech, Polanski said: ""If Reform can rocket through the polls with a politics of despair, then it's time for the Green Party to do the same thing with a politics of hope."" But the Green Party's electoral strategy is being reshaped not just by the rise of Reform UK. There's a risk that Your Party, the emerging political force led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, could take the wind out of the Green Party's sails. At 82,000 members the Green Party is the biggest it has ever been. For context Your Party claims to have had more than 600,000 sign-ups in the weeks after it launched. For Millward, all this proves is ""Labour's lost its support on the left"". ""And we are actually gaining from that as well - so it's not like a net loss to us."" The Greens have long relied on grassroots energy and volunteer labour. They now have more members to call on, but for a party trying to scale up from protest politics to serious electoral force money matters. Behind the scenes, Millward and others are pushing for a bolder approach to fundraising. She used her conference speech to argue they will be the party of ""fivers"" – emulating the micro-donations successes of US figures like Barak Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The party also needs to become ""bold enough to ask"" sympathetic donors that have sustained big parties like the Conservatives, Labour and Reform, she says. ""We're not talking about being funded by corruptive billionaires, but there are people who are with us and who would like a change."" The 2026 local elections will be a key test for the Greens. The party is aiming to hold a record 900 council seats when they contest a series of nominal strongholds, in London, Brighton and Huddersfield. The party is also talking up their chances in taking over new combined authority contests in Sussex, and in Norfolk and Suffolk. In Wales, they have high hopes the new proportional representation voting system will allow the party to gain a foothold in the Senedd. But fractured multi-party voting in a first past-the-post electoral system in England and Wales can lead to unpredictable results. It is clear the Green Party leadership see a path to victory. Although some in the party argue that losing the ability to appeal to more conservative areas risks deepening divides, just when many voters want calm and competence, others view it as the price to be paid. What the party must now see is if voters will reward ""picking fights"" with electoral success - or a bloody nose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx85q4dyzo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/193b/live/d6d4a950-a167-11f0-8b70-39bf68f49b3e.jpg,2025-10-05T13:15:26.026000+00:00,13abb7877500137130af79d8f04a8d9e24427f96
e7bc4c86a145,Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates,,"Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates Getty Images Caerphilly Castle is the second largest in Britain, behind only Windsor Castle Eight politicians are competing in, arguably, the most interesting by-election in the 26-years of Welsh devolution. They are seeking to represent the constituency of Caerphilly in the Welsh Parliament. Prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August , the poll takes place on 23 October. Here you can read about all of the candidates, in alphabetical order, and their messages to voters. The details were provided by the political parties and candidates, and reflect their views. Steve Aicheler - Welsh Liberal Democrats Welsh Liberal Democrats Who is he? Steve Aicheler lives in Machen with his family and is a community councillor and school governor. He works for a national non-profit organisation promoting entrepreneurship in education and has founded several local businesses. Steve says he is standing to give Caerphilly a strong, independent voice in the Senedd who puts people first. What are his policies? Fix the social care crisis to free up the Welsh NHS and reduce waiting times. Provide 30 hours of free childcare a week for every child aged nine months to four years, so that every parent in Caerphilly has access to affordable and flexible childcare. Prioritise education, ensuring young people in Wales have equal access to opportunity as young people in England. Bring jobs back to Caerphilly, challenging a Cardiff-centric City Deal that has failed to deliver for local people. Protect local services that are under threat from Labour locally and in the Senedd. Anthony Cook - Gwlad Glenn Whitehouse Who is he? Anthony Cook grew up in Cefn Hengoed, lives in Ystrad Mynach and says his family has been ""part of the Rhymney Valley mining history for generations"". He is a father of three children that he takes on ""adventures over Parc Penallta and Gelligaer Common"" and says that, as a boy, he ""played in the shadow of Penallta colliery and caught the C9 bus to Bargoed to go shopping with my nan in a once thriving high street"". He says he understands the ""struggles that have followed the decline of our traditional industries"". The name of his party, Gwlad, means country in Welsh. What are his policies? Help town centres by building homes, siting public services such as polyclinics (centres for GP surgeries, outpatients and minor injuries) there and encouraging evening shop opening, at least from April to October. Reform VAT; as new build is free of the tax but repair is not, making it cheaper to build new on the outskirts of town rather than restore the old centre. The elected Welsh government should run Wales, not boards and panels of the ""great and the good"" which require additional funding to administer and give ministers a way to evade responsibility. End subsidies for renewable energy schemes such as solar farms that are destroying good agricultural land. Oppose Welsh government funding of politically partisan NGOs (non-governmental organisations), eg those that campaign for men to access women's spaces. Gareth Hughes - Green Party Who is he? Gareth Hughes, who lives in Caerphilly, was born in Bangor and educated at Friars Grammar School, Coleg Harlech and the London School of Economics. He has been an apprentice printer, print journalist, university lecturer, researcher and played a prominent role in the early days of housing associations in Wales. He returned to journalism, with the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in the late 1990s, as an ITV Wales political reporter and commentator, later analysing public life for BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and others. What are his policies? Create green jobs for people where they live. Provide better public services - including more evening bus services and warm, safe housing. Build stronger communities with empowered local voices. Promote a fairer, greener future tackling the climate emergency. Gareth Potter - Welsh Conservatives Welsh Conservatives Who is he? Gareth Potter is married with two children and has lived in Ebbw Vale since last year. Born in Pontypool, he grew up on a Trevethin council estate and attended West Monmouth Comprehensive School. He worked for retailers, including Matalan, then in charity retail with the British Heart Foundation before focusing on politics full-time. He was previously a staff member for Conservative South Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar and worked, for the last four years, as a campaign manager for Bristol and South Gloucestershire Conservatives. What are his policies? Scrap business rates for small businesses to allow our forgotten high streets to grow, creating more local jobs and reducing unemployment across Caerphilly and growing tourism. Ban mobile phones in schools by rolling out lockable phone pouches across all schools in Caerphilly and ensure children are automatically excluded for carrying knives into school. Push to extend GP services beyond 09:00 BST to 19:00 and review NHS hospital planning which has seen hospitals like Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr designed for A&E services but instead all A&E going to the Grange in Torfaen 30mins away for residents living just yards from Ystrad Fawr. Scrap Wales' 20mph default speed limit and build an M4 relief road south of Newport to support growth in our town and villages across Caerphilly. Keep local services open while cutting council waste, scrapping the Senedd expansion while initiating an Anti-Waste Action Plan. Llŷr Powell - Reform UK Reform UK Who is he? Llŷr Powell has lived and worked in Caerphilly for the last five years and has called the area home for much of his professional life, aside from a brief hiatus to work in the House of Commons in 2024. He has worked in communications in public, political and charitable organisations, including roles in political communications and public affairs, where he has used his platform to highlight issues facing the left-behind communities of south Wales. He is a fluent Welsh speaker, and describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter of grassroots Welsh rugby and a keen follower of the national side. What are his policies? Protect the NHS, free at the point of delivery, with free prescriptions. Champion shorter waiting lists, more frontline staff, proper funding and an upgrade for Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr. Support local high streets, be a strong voice for Caerphilly's local economy and prioritise attracting much-needed investment to create more opportunities and jobs in this area. End the Nation of Sanctuary policy, which has wasted £55m of taxpayers' money. Fight to keep libraries open as the Labour council wants to close 10 of them while sitting on almost £190m in reserves as council tax keeps rising. Ensure reserves are spent on local communities not wasteful projects. Get Wales moving again by pushing to reverse Labour's 20mph speed limits, which are negatively impacting Caerphilly's economy and putting businesses off investing in the region. Back better and safer transport links. Roger Quilliam - UKIP Roger Quilliam Who is he? Roger Quilliam has been a member of UKIP's National Executive Committee since 2024. The party says he has worked for over two years closely with party leader Nick Tenconi in activism and citizen journalism for UKIP, Turning Point UK, and Disciples of Christ. UKIP says he campaigns against mass immigration, communism, liberalism, and in favour of patriotism, nationalism, and traditionalism and that his core values are rooted in family, community, national identity, justice, and law and order. What are his policies? Abolish the Senedd. Freeze immigration for a minimum of five years. Mass deportations and remigration. Reinstate Christianity back into the heart of government and put Britons first. Richard Tunnicliffe - Welsh Labour Welsh Labour Who is he? Richard Tunnicliffe has lived in Caerphilly with his Troedyrhiw-born wife Lynda for 26 years and they raised their three sons in the town. He has worked as an accountant and financial analyst and runs a publishing company with his wife, specialising in Welsh translations of popular children's books. He was encouraged to become more active in the local party by Hefin David, who was mentoring him to be a candidate in next year's Senedd election at the time of his death. What are his policies? Honour Hefin David's legacy by listening to constituents and solving community problems together. Champion Bevan's NHS by working proactively with local health service leaders. Earn trust by doing what I say I will do and never over-promising. Calling for the council to prioritise protecting libraries across the borough and use any future funding to do so. Lindsay Whittle - Plaid Cymru Plaid Cymru Who is he? Lindsay Whittle was born in Caerphilly town, he lives in Abertridwr, was raised on the Penyrheol council estate and attended Cwm Ifor Primary School. A councillor for Penyrheol since 1976, he was Caerphilly council leader from 1999 to 2004 and 2008 to 2011, and has been Plaid Cymru group leader on the council since 2022. From 2011 to 2016 he was a South Wales East assembly membe r (as Senedd members were previously known). What are his policies? Campaign for a fair funding settlement for Wales to help protect local services and oppose cuts, recently opposing plans to close public libraries and a leisure centre across the Caerphilly constituency. Attract quality jobs through Plaid Cymru's Making Wales Work plan, giving locally-owned small and medium-sized businesses and co-operatives in Caerphilly more help and adjusting business rates to boost town centres. Billions spent on rail projects in England, such as HS2 and the Oxford-Cambridge line, bring extra money to Scotland and Northern Ireland but not Wales. Releasing cash for Wales would help pay for local improvements. Invest in primary healthcare: Lindsay Whittle supports Plaid Cymru's plan to set up elective care hubs to get people seen faster, with a triage system to speed up referrals between GPs and hospitals.

2ae140198d13,The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter,,"The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC ""Oh God,"" and then a pause, a sigh, and then, ""Oh God,"" again. Just as a senior Conservative was telling me the party might be able to climb out the terrible hole it's in, news popped up of another of its ranks deserting for Reform UK. Their response? Sad resignation, at yet another resignation. The individual exit of Sarah Atherton, who was briefly a defence minister when the Tories were in power, is not the point. Well over a dozen Conservative MPs or former MPs have made that same move. The question for the Conservatives perhaps this weekend is: is there a point? You don't need me to tell you that the Conservatives are unpopular - deeply so. The hangover from the last election was always going to be nasty after a proper thumping, 14 years in power, and, oh yes, those five prime ministers. But the party's standing has fallen even further since then. No discernible bounce with its new leadership under Kemi Badenoch. No profit from the misery of the government. For the group once regarded as the most successful political operation in the western world, it's dire. Technically, the Tories are still the main opposition. That brings status and meaning. It's Badenoch who gets to ask six questions of the prime minister every week. It's the Conservatives who, as is traditional, are most often called on to respond to government announcements. They still have way more MPs than the Liberal Democrats, or the SNP, and legions more than Reform or the Greens. But politically, it just doesn't feel at this moment that they are the government's hungry main challengers. That's in part because they were smashed to bits in July 2024 and it was always going to take a bit of time to come round. It's in part because the party is so far behind in the polls. It's in part because the government is very deliberately making its arguments against Reform, not their traditional Conservative rivals. As another senior party figure observes, Labour's ""framing of cutting the Tories out is the right one"". It suits Labour and the Lib Dems to treat the Tories as if they are irrelevant. And it's in part, many Conservatives argue, because Badenoch ""just hasn't generated any traction, any attention"" during her time in charge. As the Conservatives arrive in Manchester for their conference, in the very serious aftermath of the attack on Heaton Park synagogue, the primary job is to grab any attention: perhaps the Tory party is smack bang in the middle of a battle to matter at all. Reuters Prime Minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer Like it or not, just as Sir Keir Starmer has discovered, grumpy parties who are not doing well point the finger at their leader. Badenoch has admirers in the Conservative Party for speaking out on particular issues like single-sex spaces, free speech, or declaring that some cultures are in her view ""less valid"" than others. Some of her colleagues applaud her blunt, tell-it-like-it-is manner. But politics is also a business of charm and empathy. A senior Tory told me after the election defeat the party had to ""go everywhere and do a mea culpa, to listen and take a kicking"". But the issue with Badenoch, they say, is ""she is grand... hasn't been anywhere and isn't listening to anyone"". Ouch. With conference about to start, it's almost a Tory tradition to fill the papers and podcasts with gripes about the party leader. She has had some more effective performances at Prime Minister's Questions. Policies are starting to emerge. Money has kept flowing to the party.  One of her backers maintains that although she is still ""finding her way"", she has some of the same ""strength and character as a young Margaret Thatcher"". Thatcher was seen as ""strange and shrill"" when she got the job, but became the party's most successful boss of modern times. But as Badenoch approaches a year in the job, it's becoming harder to find people who'll make that comparison. Whatever Badenoch's personal strengths and failures, there is a different criticism of how she has gone about the job, with a party veteran suggesting, ""there is just no pace, no nimbleness"". Maybe that should have been staring the party in the face: her original pitch for the job was ""Renewal 2030"" - a date past the next general election. During many of her interviews Badenoch has said she wants to take her time working out the right moves for the party, developing credible ideas rather than being rushed. You can expect lots of policy to be unveiled in the next few days. But politics moves incredibly fast, and another source agrees pace is a problem, saying: ""What she misunderstood is you get one chance to introduce yourself to the public – she lost the chance to generate any traction and she won't get that back."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was only too happy to step into that ""vacuum"", gaining strength in the polls and grabbing headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans. Getty Images Badenoch after delivering a speech at the Institute of Chartered Accountants' Hall in September Candidly, it is not unusual to hear Conservatives saying freely in private that Badenoch won't be in the job for long, she could be ""out by Christmas"", or ""might not even have to be dragged out"" if the party bombs at the polls in a set of mega elections in May. Indeed, when asked the question herself in a conference warm-up interview, she more or less said: Well, ask me then. Refreshingly honest from a leader who isn't fully in control of her own destiny? Or foolhardy when this is a moment when she ought to be mustering as much authority as she can? The conference gives a shop window to the party and its leader to show what she is made of too. As one senior MP says: ""This conference is about her, and making it clear she has a direction and a sense of where she is going, and it is hers and she is going to lead it – we have this one chance."" ""We understand the polls aren't great, a source close to the party leadership adds. ""There needs to be a bit of understanding from those who are grumbling."" But where is Badenoch trying to lead? ""If I want a can of full fat coke, then I go and buy one, if I like what Reform are saying I'm gonna vote Reform, I'm not going to vote for a party that's not quite there,"" a party insider says. Badenoch's signals on climate change, on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, tip towards the right of the Conservative spectrum, on territory that right now, Reform have painted in bold primary colours. Bloomberg via Getty Images Reform leader Nigel Farage has grabbed headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans Badenoch is a Brexiteer, a strong advocate of free speech, and seemingly often up for a spat in the latest round of culture wars. But politics is a business - not quite like any other - but a business nonetheless. And many in the party reckon she is going after the wrong customers and ought to be trying to appeal more to soft liberals or soft Tories, rather than to those interested in Reform. ""Frankly, the gap in the market is on the centre right,"" one source says. Some of the current Tory top brass are keen to get the argument onto issues they hope might appeal more to more voters, and it's not stupid to guess it, yes, the economy. One shadow minister says: ""We have to talk about the money in your pocket and trying to articulate what all of Labour's tax rises and debt means to you in terms of the cash in your pocket and the food in your fridge."" With Reform UK in the ascendant, are they the right enemy for the Tories in any case, one source wonders? Their presence on the right means the Conservatives right now don't have the luxury of assuming they will always be the number two. The party used to be ""free to carry on in opposition in our own space – now when the party looks for who its enemy is, is it Labour, Reform or Lib Dems, or it doesn't know?"". According to one source close to the party leadership, in recent years people have struggled to know what the party stands for: ""We have flip-flopped, criss-crossed, gone from [Theresa] May to [Boris] Johnson, to [Rishi] Sunak."" There will be big announcements over the next few days setting out Badenoch's position ""and it will be the job of MPs and councils and everyone to go and sell that message"". Getty Images Badenoch giving a speech earlier this year As party members and associated hangers-on start to arrive in Manchester today, there are reasons to be gloomy for the current leadership. If you look back at the polling, Badenoch is in a worse position according to net satisfaction ratings than John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, David Cameron, Theresa May,  Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. (If you're wondering, I didn't forget Liz Truss, but she wasn't around long enough to have her popularity measured after nearly a year). ""I don't remember it ever being this bad,"" says one insider, suggesting not just that Badenoch's time will be up before too long, but also that the party has been hollowed out of experience and knowledge, and many of the big-name MPs who have stuck around have, frankly, rather checked out. But one of Badenoch's backers suggests it's the party, not the leadership, that ought to have a word with itself. They told me their colleagues have got a ""messiah complex - ever since Margaret they think there is a leader out there who will lead them to the promised land"". In other words, get your heads down, get your work done, and stop thinking it's all about the person at the top. ""We need to understand real history, not folk history,"" they say, suggesting a new leader would not and could not solve the party's problems on their own. Do it again, and a frontbencher suggests ""people will think, 'Oh God, they haven't changed!'"" But the overall picture for the Tories' top team is as foul as the weather in Manchester which awaits them. ""They're not relevant, they don't matter - that is the big thing the current team have not understood,"" one Tory source worries. ""If it's not resolved soon it's easy to see  how we might be in third or even fourth place"" when it gets to the next election, they add. Not for the first time, you don't need me to remind you - but I will - that politics in the 2020s is a very unpredictable era. There are known unknowns. Might Badenoch pull off a blinding speech this week? Will Labour be patient with Sir Keir until the general election? Will Reform hold together? Will the economy improve? And unknown unknowns that we can't list right now. And anyone who claims to know what's next may as well be trying to sell ice to an Eskimo. The Conservative party has been pronounced more or less gone before. There was even a book published titled ""The Strange Death of Tory England"". Five years later, David Cameron strolled into No 10. But the party is in trouble. Conferences are always an opportunity for political parties, but also a risk. The pressure is on the Tories to show they matter in the next few days, or more on their own side may wonder what they're for.

James Landale Diplomatic correspondent Getty Images As prime minister of the UK for more than 10 years, Sir Tony Blair was a master of political compromise. He was seen as a deft negotiator of the centre ground, triangulating his way out of the straitjacket of traditional left-right politics. But if there were peace in Gaza and he were summoned to help govern what was left, would even Teflon Tony – as he was once known – have the political wiles to keep all sides happy and the guns silent? His putative role is still not clear. Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan envisages an international transitional body that would oversee the governance of post-war Gaza. The US president would chair this so-called ""Board of Peace"" and Sir Tony, aged 72, would be a member. He's a ""good man, very good man"", Trump told reporters. Sir Tony's presence on this hypothetical body would come as no surprise. The former prime minister has been closely involved in drawing up Gaza peace proposals for months. He has been working with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Ron Dermer, a key adviser to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In August, Sir Tony attended a high-level meeting with Trump at the White House to discuss a post-war strategy for the Strip. A month earlier he also held talks with Steve Witkoff, the president's chief envoy, at the White House. In a statement, Sir Tony unsurprisingly lavished praise on the Trump plan, describing it as ""bold and intelligent"" and ""the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering"". He said the proposals created the possibility not only ""of Israelis and Palestinians finding a path to peace"" but also ""a broader regional and global alliance to counter the forces of extremism and promote peace and prosperity between nations"". And that is the key point: this is what Sir Tony has been pushing for decades in different roles. As prime minister from 1997, he supported the Clinton administration's efforts to find peace in the region. On the very day he left office in June 2007, he was appointed special envoy for a so-called Quartet - representing the US, Russia, the EU and UN – designed to coordinate peace efforts, a role he held until 2015. His supporters insist his remit at the Quartet was economic development and he was excluded from the political process. Since then his business and other interests – including his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change - have kept him firmly plugged into the region. Diplomats say this is what makes Sir Tony unique; he is trusted by the Trump administration, he has an unparalleled network in the Middle East, and he has long experience of dealing with both Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. Nick Hopton, director general of the Middle East Association, said the former UK PM was the only western leader one could imagine taking the role. ""He's got the credibility and experience having been embroiled in the Middle East for 24 years,"" he said. ""But it will work only if he is able to have the confidence of Donald Trump and also if he is not seen as being manipulated by Benjamin Netanyahu. He also needs to demonstrate he has the confidence of the Palestinian Authority leadership."" But – and it is a big but – Sir Tony would come to the role with much baggage. To some he is a divisive figure, to others worse. Role in Iraq invasion 'not forgotten' His role in joining the 2003 invasion of Iraq - based on incorrect reports about the country's weapons of mass destruction – still tarnishes his reputation in the region and has led some to accuse him of war crimes. Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, was blunt. ""Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine,"" she posted on social media. ""Shall we meet in The Hague perhaps?"", a reference to the location of the International Criminal Court. Sir Simon Fraser, former head of the UK Foreign Office, said Sir Tony had shown genuine interest in the Palestinian issue and was trusted in Washington, Israel and the Gulf. ""But the Arab street has not forgotten Iraq,"" he said. ""The future oversight of Gaza needs a broader base and cannot look like an American/British enterprise."" Hamas, for one, did not seem keen. Husam Badran, a member of the group's political bureau, said this week Sir Tony should be on trial for the US invasion of Iraq, not administering Gaza. ""Any plan linked to Blair is an ill omen,"" he said. Some Palestinians and others also see Sir Tony as historically always being too close to Israeli and US positions. Nomi Bar-Yaacov, a former international peace negotiator, said: ""I don't think the Palestinians trust him at all. I think they view him as a colossal failure during the time that he was the Quartet envoy."" Even UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who used his Labour conference speech on Tuesday to praise the Trump peace plan, chose to make no mention of the key role his predecessor might play. As Middle East peace envoy for eight long years, Sir Tony was supposed to help build up the Palestinian Authority so that one day it would be in a fit state to run a Palestinian state. But few would argue that this is where the PA is today. Palestinians also argue he did not do enough to push back against illegal settlements and settler violence. Some have claimed he should have made a stronger case for Palestinian statehood, focusing instead on economic development. Getty Images As former Quartet special envoy Tony Blair met Benjamin Netanyahu in 2014 The interesting question is why Sir Tony still feels the need to be involved in trying to find an end to the fighting in the Middle East. He has long seen himself as a peace-maker, after his success negotiating the Good Friday Agreement that helped reduce conflict in Northern Ireland. But as a political correspondent throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and thus a close observer of the Blair years of power, I was always struck by his dogged refusal to accept that he might have failed to persuade someone of his point of view. It niggled at him. To that extent, the Middle East may be seen by Sir Tony as unfinished business. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told PA Media Sir Tony's role would ""raise eyebrows"" because of the Iraq war and said he had an ""incredible legacy"" in Northern Ireland of building peace that lasted. ""If he can bring that skill set to bear in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the support of Israelis, Palestinians and other regional powers, then so much the better,"" Mr Streeting said. In truth, the role of Blair is a second order issue. He will have a job to do only if this peace plan succeeds and survives, and there is no guarantee of that. Far more important are the differences between both sides and details that are as yet unresolved by the framework outlined by the White House. Sanam Vakil, Middle East programme director at the Chatham House think tank, said: ""The focus on Tony Blair and his legacy of western intervention in Iraq masks the real challenges of this peace framework that lacks details, timelines and deliverables - and does not yet have Palestinian or Israeli buy-in, let alone leadership. ""Without significant work to move beyond 20 points on a piece of paper, this plan will be another version of cosmetic diplomacy that embeds structural injustice and deprives Palestinians of agency and sovereignty."" So maybe what really matters is not perhaps the psychodrama of Sir Tony Blair and the controversial opinions people hold about him. A more relevant question may be more what role any transitional authority in Gaza might play and whether Sir Tony has the right skills and experience to play a significant role. If his job would be to coordinate with Gulf leaders and the White House, that is one thing. But if he were being asked effectively to govern Gaza, overseeing the reconstruction, the security and economic development of the Strip, that is quite another. ""Viceroy Blair?"" one diplomat texted me. ""That will never wash.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d5938w3ko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ebc5/live/f21cee50-9e2b-11f0-ba41-9d184b600492.jpg,2025-09-30T19:31:18.674000+00:00,0664df86f879ca2d24ecbbd482679548e1a50884
5fb84056c04c,Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage,,"Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage Matt Chorley Presenter, BBC Radio 5 Live Getty Images ""Know yourself and know your enemy,"" wrote Sun Tzu, the Chinese military adviser from the 6th century BC. ""In a hundred battles, you will never be defeated."" Sir Keir Starmer might not quite have 100 battles, but he's got a fair few on his hands: with his party, with the bond markets, with the mayor of Greater Manchester. And yet the prime minister, who still helms an enormous Commons majority, has a resolute focus on who the singular enemy is. And it's a party with five MPs: Reform UK. Time and again, Sir Keir has chosen during Labour's conference week to focus on Nigel Farage, having written off the Conservatives as ""dead"" and barely mentioning the Lib Dems, Greens or other parties eating into Labour support from the left. 'Different fight' But in the lanyard-laden fringes and bars in Liverpool, there is a live conversation about the wisdom of this strategy. Does naming your enemy so publicly help bring focus to the government's operation and attack? Or does it risk elevating Reform UK, a new party with no record in government, to an elite status which only serves to bolster rather than damage them? Reform UK love it. Whenever the prime minister goes out of his way to mock or ridicule them during PMQs, Farage and his MPs including Richard Tice and Lee Anderson slap their thighs in pantomime laughter, believing they are being paid a high compliment. At the weekend, Sir Keir said the fight with Reform is different. ""Most elections have always been Labour or Conservative,"" he said. ""This is a different election that we are facing.  We have not had a proposition like Reform in this country ever before. This is a different fight. It is a fight about who we are as a country, it goes to the soul of our future."" Some in Liverpool this week have likened this to Joe Biden's repeated refrain against Donald Trump in 2020 that they were locked in a ""battle for the soul of the nation"". However, some within Labour are unsure if the strategy of attacking Farage is the right approach. One backbench MP from the North East told me that those in Downing Street advising the PM ""don't get it"" - and don't represent ""white, working class council estates"" with voters that worry about immigration. ""They tend to be the frothy coffee drinking liberal lefties. They are speaking to the same people,"" they added. Others suggest that keeping Kemi Badenoch's Conservative party alive, or at least their share of the vote up, is needed to split the vote on the right. One senior minister said: ""The Tories being dead doesn't help us, it just pushes people to Reform. It's a bit like how at the last general election we needed the Lib Dems to do well, as they took seats off the Tories rather than us. ""But this is worse, because both Tory and Labour are voters shifting to Reform. In places from Barnsley to Bexley, we need the right vote to split, and then we need to squeeze Lib Dems and the Greens to come down the middle."" John Denham, a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the last Labour government, agrees. ""It makes no sense to me to elevate Reform to that position, even if you think the Tories are dead,"" he told me on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We have four years left of this government. The idea that the only thing we think we can offer in four years time is 'well, at least we're not Reform'... surely to God we can do something with the huge majority we've got and the time we've got to tell a convincing story that marginalizes Reform."" He suggested that there were a ""really very small"" group of people who might switch between Reform and Labour. The latest YouGov poll suggests just over half of Labour's 2024 voters are sticking with them. Some 12% have switched to Reform, and 4% to the Conservatives, while another 13% have gone to the Lib Dems, 12% to the Greens, and others have gone to the SNP and Plaid Cymru, suggesting losses to the left are far greater than to the right. 'We love it' However, Tom Lubbock, from pollsters JL Partners, thinks focussing on Reform UK is ""extremely smart politics"". ""If you look at Labour voters who are undecided at the moment, if you force that choice and say it's a choice between Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage, a lot of them who are undecided will come back into the Labour boat. ""And, you know, there's a lot of time to go before that next election, but it's actually very smart at the moment to make that the choice."" Previous party leaders and governments have faced this choice about how to deal with insurgent parties under Farage. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, made around 30 references to Farage in his conference speech last week. Simon Lewis, a former director of communications for Gordon Brown, said: ""The risk is that you are seen to be taking your opponent too seriously. ""Multiple references to his name probably gets people thinking, goodness, these guys are really scared about Reform. And I think you do have to be very careful."" Number 10 insiders defend the strategy, and insist the PM is adamant that the country is at a crossroads, and he thinks it is his responsibility to stand up to Farage. So what do Reform make of party leaders falling over themselves to namecheck them and their leader? ""It made us laugh,"" said Gawain Towler, a former press adviser to Farage. ""We love it. We absolutely love it! It's so preposterous.""

3d99c7fb1bf0,Reeves pre-emptively justifies tax rises,,"In Liverpool Rachel Reeves seemed to be floating a pre-emptive argument ahead of possible tax rises in her November Budget. The key line in the chancellor's speech in relation to the Budget was her linking of tough decisions ""in coming months"" to global headwinds and a critical reassessment of the long-term productivity performance of the UK economy, about to be delivered by the Office for Budget Responsibility. ""We will face further tests, with choices to come, made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage to the economy, which is becoming ever clearer,"" she said. This prepares the government's argument if there does need to be further tax rises, even significant ones at the Budget. Firstly, they will blame the broad global economic backdrop, of trade wars, actual wars and rising government interest rates. ""The world has changed,"" the chancellor told the Today programme. Secondly, the OBR's reassessment of the UK's long-term economic trends is revealing ""ever clearer"" evidence of ""long-term damage"" which she will blame on the record of her predecessors. The other notable call was for ""responsible management of public finances"" against opposition voices and those in her own party. Other than that, this was relatively light on policies. The policies that most of the country are the most interested in - what is in the Budget - have not been nailed down, and depend on the ping pong about to start with the OBR over its forecasting process. It is on that, where we did get new news today. The chancellor confirmed publicly that she agreed with the International Monetary Fund about changing the fiscal dance that has created non-stop speculation about tax changes. The OBR forecast by law has to happen twice a year, but that could now only happen in full once a year. There are various options. This is a tacit admission that after whatever emerges from the Budget, everyone would benefit from a period of stability, and that has not been the case over the past year. Elsewhere she repeated the idea that the election promises not to increase the main tax rates were still in place. When asked if VAT could rise, she said: ""The manifesto commitments stand."" This appears to connect the commitments to a state of the world that could change. As the Chief Secretary to the PM Darren Jones said: ""The manifesto commitments stand today."" Those manifesto commitments are clearly under pressure, if the OBR's calculations go against the Treasury. Her interpretation of how flexible they are was revealing. She wants to protect pay packets and ""not put up the prices in shops"". That would appear to rule out a straightforward rise in the rate of VAT, which would directly raise bills. There are many other options, depending on the size of the gap - to be revealed to her by the OBR this week - from scrapping some tax breaks and allowances, especially on housing and pensions, to extending the freeze on tax thresholds. The changes made by the OBR to the UK's underlying rate of growth could add considerably to the gap in the public finances Reeves has to bridge in the Budget. The draft details will be presented to her on Friday. It is then and only then that the real work of translating a series of tax proposals into a Budget starts in earnest. The government will also seek to persuade the OBR that its policy moves, from infrastructure plans, to closer ties with Europe, can help long-term growth. Today was about leaving some options open, at a tricky time. The extent of tax rises, and who gets hit, is still very much up for grabs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6x07j9e43o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b00d/live/35d04c80-9dcf-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-29T16:36:04.080000+00:00,49bd84822a5e22116dd9d6bf818121ae5ed450d3
60200561be67,Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?,,"Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business? Simon Jack Business editor WPA Pool/Getty Images One of the key audiences that the prime minister and the chancellor will have to convince at this year's Labour conference are the business leaders they targeted with a charm offensive before the election last July. The party trumpeted itself as ""the natural party of business"" and Rachel Reeves told anyone and everyone that this would be ""the most pro-business government this country has ever seen"". Labour had some big business beasts backing them. Billionaire mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell - a long-time Conservative supporter - switched his backing to Labour . Some 120 business leaders signed a letter which read: ""We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change. For too long now, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation, and a lack of long-term focus. ""Labour has shown it has changed and wants to work with business to achieve the UK's full economic potential."" But post-election, the party sent a different message - warning of tough choices and hard times ahead, and delivered a Budget to prove it. That Budget, says John Caudwell, with its £25bn rise in employers' National Insurance, undid a lot of the goodwill the chancellor had garnered. ""I think there was a desperate loss of faith from the business community in general from the last Budget,"" he says. ""I think people were shocked at the level of negative components for businesses."" On top of that NI rise, the National Living Wage was hiked by an inflation-busting 6.7%, with a rise of 16% for 18 to 20-year-olds. Mr Caudwell says he understands that Labour needed to raise money to shore up the public finances but felt it hit some sectors unduly hard. ""Even if you say they needed to be done, certain aspects were very unfair. So if you look at the increase in employers' NI, that really badly hit those businesses that employ tens of thousands of people on low wages, because they got hit by minimum wage and they got hit by the NI."" PA John Caudwell says businesses were shocked at ""the level of negative components"" they faced after the last Budget Other small business owners have also told the BBC they have lost confidence. Rachel Carrell is the boss of childcare firm Koru Kids and signed that letter in 2024. She says she hopes the government can restore business confidence over the rest of the parliament. ""I wouldn't sign that letter today but they've got three or four years to turn this around. That's a really long time."" She believes there's an opportunity to fix things in the upcoming Budget, but says ""they need to move quickly"". While anecdotal evidence of crumbling business confidence is not hard to find, official measures show a mixed picture. The Institute of Directors' confidence measure shows a steep fall after the last election, which compilers put down to immediate warnings issued by the government once in power that tough times and tough choices lay ahead. That was duly delivered on by the Budget and has hovered near those lows ever since. However, the government's favourite index to quote is the Lloyds Bank confidence survey, which shows confidence on the future is much more robust. Other measures, including the ICAEW and the S&P PMI measures, tend to support a more gloomy outlook. That in turn is supported by the number of businesses looking to recruit. Job vacancies have been on a downward trend since the Covid pandemic and there are 150,000 fewer staff on payrolls now than there were before the Budget bombshell, with a large part of those jobs going in hospitality. However, there is widespread hope among smaller businesses that the long-promised overhaul of business rates will come soon and in their favour. The government points understandably to the enormous amounts of money pledged recently when tech royalty from Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and others met real royalty at US President Donald Trump's recent state visit. John Caudwell welcomed it too. ""I hear a lot of negativity about government - we hear about rich people leaving and they are useful to the UK economy, but they're not as useful as the £150bn of inward investment that we've got coming into the country to create high-paid jobs in high-technological businesses. So we have to get a balanced view on that."" Mark Brearley runs a trolley and tray manufacturing and export business in Peckham, south London. He is less impressed with the razzamatazz surrounding the tech billionaires and their largesse. ""I'm sure it's very important to get these racy high-growth sectors to invest here. But what about the less exciting bits of the economy - the ones who are always here? We feel forgotten. ""I was hopeful that a new government would give us some help but all my costs have gone up - my business rates have doubled. I'm more cautious about investing in a new machine, a new product, hiring a new person."" The new Employment Rights Bill , which confers greater rights and protections on employees from day one, is also adding to employers' reluctance to take on new staff. Mark Brearley says small businesses like his feel forgotten The government has made much of its plans to sweep away impediments to economic growth and has seen that acknowledged by some of the biggest investors in UK infrastructure. Just months after Labour entered Downing Street, Scottish Power announced a £24bn UK investment. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: ""The government has taken on the planning bogeyman to unlock growth and get us building. That's why the UK is now Iberdrola's biggest investment destination globally."" Rain Newton-Smith, director general of the employers group the CBI, also gives the government high marks on the international stage. ""I think this government have navigated really difficult geopolitics. We've got a better deal with the US than others, we're forging a closer relationship with Europe and they got the deal with India. ""They've got a lot of work done internationally, and that does count. But they've really got to dial up delivery, and make sure that they they learn from the mistakes of last autumn."" Business confidence is a vital but fragile thing. It's a key ingredient for any government hoping that economic growth will pay for its other spending commitments - on heath, defence and welfare. Labour has a job on its hands at conference, and at the Budget, to restore the animal spirits of UK business.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0xyxnyz48o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7aa5/live/803f8e10-9af1-11f0-89b4-1b2d09c610c7.jpg,2025-09-29T06:29:26.809000+00:00,4012358ec77c35c2ca0ec06f7ff0a9cbde553a3f
f0865c91c474,How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job?,,"How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job? Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Sir Keir Starmer achieved what many sage minds in Westminster believed was impossible. Labour smashed itself to bits in 2019. But Sir Keir put the party back together and swept back to power with an epic majority five years later. Yet, turn on the radio or glance at the headlines and Labour appears to be flirting with the unthinkable – giving him his P45. In the last few days I've spoken to 30 people across government and the party -  ministers, MPs, advisers - to try to work out, as the prime minister makes his way to Labour's annual party conference in Liverpool, how much trouble is he really in? ""How many more data points do you need to see that he is just not very good at being prime minister?"" Unforgiving as that sounds, the Whitehall figure who posed that question is far from the only person who has seen Starmer's government up close to conclude that fundamentally, the prime minister is just not suited to many aspects of the job. For months polling has suggested the public feels the same. Sir Keir is an intelligent, incredibly diligent, serious-minded politician who has achieved extraordinary things. But time and again the same problems are raised, summed up brutally by another senior figure: ""His judgement on people has proven to be flawed, see endless staffing resets."" ""His judgement on policy is flawed, hence U-turns, and he can't communicate, and has been unpopular in the public's eyes for a long time."" Others point to a slow pace of decision making in Downing Street, suggesting the prime minister thinks ""too like a chairman, not a chief executive,"" says another insider. And ""he only gets to the right answer having exhausted all the other options,"" rather than moving fast using a gut political instinct. Another senior party figure says: ""He doesn't think like a leader."" Getty Images Everyone in the Labour party is fed up with months of shocking polls. But others are fed up of colleagues complaining about the boss, whether the small number who do so in public, or the much higher number who do so in private. ""It's like being England manager,"" one cabinet minister jokes. ""Everyone thinks they can do a better job."" You can hear the frustration in others' voices, highlighting the ""outstanding job"" Starmer has done on the world stage – wrangling President Donald Trump, or leading support for Ukraine. ""He hasn't put a foot wrong,"" when it comes to foreign policy, says a cabinet minister. Another praises the ""sensible changes"" the prime minister has just made to Downing Street, saying ""people now are now in jobs that will suit their abilities better"" after the reshuffle, and promising the public will soon see the benefit. There can be no hiding from a very messy few weeks, with the forced exits of Angela Rayner and Lord Mandelson , and the circus around the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham's not very hidden ambition. But there are other believers in what they see as Starmer's steady and relentless leadership, as one party source jokes: ""There were a couple of weeks where we couldn't get of bed without accidentally tearing our own arms off."" They predict ""that could all go away if we have a decent couple of months"". Perhaps. What even some of the prime minister's staunchest allies believe is that, he must explain more clearly, and vigorously, to the party - and to all of us - what the government is actually doing and why. Getty Images Sir Keir himself admitted as much in the summer, saying: ""We haven't always told our story as well as we should."" So in the next few days, and live on the programme tomorrow, expect the prime minister to try hard to make a clearer pitch to the country. After a horrible few weeks, aides say the prime minister is in a ""better place, clearer about the argument he wants to make"". Announcements like the Hillsborough Law, the returns deal with France, and yesterday's confirmation that ministers will go ahead with digital ID cards will convey, No 10 hopes, a sense of momentum. And you can expect him to build on the argument he's been making about patriotism in politics, trying to reclaim some of the territory Reform UK have been trying to grab. There are two problems though. Firstly, even Starmer's biggest fans in government know fluid communication is not his strong point. He doesn't see the camera, or the TV sofa as his friend. A strong defender of Starmer tells me: ""I wish he was better at telling a story, people don't understand how deeply he feels it and how passionate he is, but he personally isn't good at it."" Secondly, and according to one senior MP this is the bigger issue: ""We're just not clear about what we are doing or who we are for."" Another staffer tells me: ""There is no fire, no passion, no vision – we are timid and flat-footed."" Even if the prime minister suddenly developed the silky charm and persuasiveness of George Clooney, or the bombastic nature of Piers Morgan, the question becomes, what is the story he wants to tell? Multiple exits from the No 10 communications team tell you that working this out is not an easy task. Getty Images One source says: ""Until we know the story we are trying to tell we will get buffeted around."" Is reforming schools, hospitals or welfare at the top of the list?  Building houses or becoming a green ""superpower""? Or being at the forefront of technology, or protecting our borders, or growing the economy? Or is it now this priority of ""patriotic renewal""? If you have that many priorities, how can the public understand what you care about most? To govern is to choose after all, if you're not doing much choosing, are you doing much governing? One source suggested frankly, even for those who work closely alongside him, it's often hard to work out what the prime minister thinks, telling me: ""He often appears unknowable."" ""He compartmentalises his life - personal, professional, and political - in a way that works for him, but leaves colleagues unsure of his true views."" In a sense it seems extraordinary that the leader of a political party can leave colleagues unsure of their views, after 14 months in office, and four years as leader in opposition. But his early years in charge were dominated by internal fights for control of the party, and over antisemitism, not over ideas. One source recalls: ""We had lots of fights to win in opposition, but they were never, ever about what the parties' priorities should be."" Getty Images The prime minister has a huge chance in the next few days to spell out to his party, and to the public, exactly where he stands, and exactly what he believes in specific terms. After a horrible summer, and a very tricky year, it is desperately needed if the party is to get back on track. ""There is a way through this, but he has to assert himself,"" says one cabinet minister, desperate for the prime minister to remind his party and the country why they elected him in the first place. Ministers and Downing Street are frustrated by chatter about Starmer's leadership, especially the behaviour of Andy Burnahm in recent days. ""Everyone needs to just shut up and get on with their own jobs,"" one government source says. Another says: ""the Burnham stuff is just ridiculous."" ""He doesn't have a seat in Parliament, wouldn't necessarily find or win one,"" and one minister snipes, ""any chance to have a dig – Burnham will never miss an opportunity"". They predict confidently, the party ""doesn't want regicide or disruption, they just want us to do well"". But leadership chatter is a symbol that all is not well. And that sense of assurance is far from universal. One senior figure outside government warns me, ""they don't realise they are in serious, serious trouble – this is literally a head-in-hands-moment"". There are real discussions in different pockets of the Labour movement about whether Starmer should still lead the party. And the sweaty bars and fringe meetings of the party conference provide the perfect backdrop for those out to make trouble. Yet it's clear from multiple conversations that it's not only mischief makers who are pondering what to do. ""Frustration is wide and deep,"" says a senior MP. One insider who has been part of conversations about the chances of changing the leader says, ""it's not flighty people, not just newbies without a clue, they're not idiots"". Even on the government payroll one minister worries, ""the country is desperate for a disrupter, and it's just not who he is,"" questioning whether Starmer can be the right man for this political moment. Here's the fundamental question, asked by many, expressed by one senior figure: ""Do we think Keir can improve? People don't think he can, although they wish he would. But there is a sinking feeling."" Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Some MPs are even pointing to the example of the Democrats' failure to tell former President Joe Biden to go , which left the party no time to build up another candidate. The source continues we ""dread and fear being the people who didn't do what was necessary to stop the country electing Farage"". Others would baulk at that comparison. The prime minister has only had just over a year in charge. The problems Labour inherited on taking office were profound. Centre left political parties in many countries are grappling with how to deal with demographics, immigration, an era where public money is very tight. There are more than three years until the next general election. There is time to start wrestling with all of that. The electorate has shown politicians they can move in droves, and fast. So many ministers plead for patience. One wishes his colleagues would not just ""get a grip"", but remember they were all elected on a promise to stop political chaos. ""Anyone who thinks the challenging world is rectified by a change in leader, I don't understand the rationale. When we look at how unstable things are, and talk about leadership, how would the bond markets respond, when our primary responsibility is stabilising the economy?"" Another source dismisses those predicting doom in the party, ""nothing is irrevocable, and nothing is inevitable"". Perhaps the rebooted No 10 will start getting better results. Perhaps, and No 10 fervently hopes, Sir Keir will wow the crowds at conference, and display why he earned the job to start with, and won the election in the first place. The prime minister's position is also, frankly,  protected by the fact there is no consensus about who could do a better job than him. Even if Labour were to conclude universally, which it is far from doing, that Starmer's leadership is somehow beyond repair, that reality is a smack in the face for those who'd seek a change. As one Whitehall figure suggests: ""problem one, is he good at being PM? No. But next problem, do you have an upgrade? Hmm..."" Labour's answer to that question right now, notwithstanding Andy Burnham's antics, is, ""well, we're not sure"". AFP via Getty Images A lack of clarity over who would be next, and fresh memories of the political shambles of the Conservatives' change of leader, both put the brakes on anyone seeking to make a change any time soon. As ever in politics two things that might appear to be contradictory are in fact, both true. Is it mad on paper for Labour to be even vaguely contemplating changing their leader so soon, without an obvious strong successor, when they ran on a promise of no drama? For many, yes, it's crackers. But is the discussion about whether the PM can carry on like this just idle chit-chat? Not at all. One senior figure sums up the situation with no pleasure – discussion about changing the Labour leader ""is both lunatic, and real"". The leadership's hope is that a strong conference without too many noises off, and an effective speech from the platform by the prime minister himself might calm everything down. A political get together, a party conference for the politicians, members, and associated hangers-on, would never transform a prime minister's fortunes with the public overnight. But it can make a big difference to how a party feels about itself. For Starmer to have a chance of restoring his position with the public he must first, once again, persuade his party that he is the man for the job. But without restoring his party's faith in him, convincing Labour of his merits, his own position could well be at risk. One insider who knows the prime minister well suggested: ""He is not a natural explainer… he states positions but doesn't repeatedly argue for them. ""This has led to an aversion to debate, treating persuasion as weakness."" Yet politics is, above all else,  the art of persuasion. That is perhaps the dilemma for Labour. That is the problem for him.

0f4766085b7c,What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform?,,"What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform? Iain Watson Political correspondent BBC ""The country is at a crossroads,"" Sir Keir Starmer is expected to declare in a speech just ahead of the annual Labour conference, which kicks off this weekend. The prime minister will suggest there are two paths to choose: one is the way of ""division and decline"" with Reform UK, or Labour's route – unity and progress. For some in Labour's ranks, the leadership's response, so far, to the rise of Reform has gone down like a lead balloon. Not nimble enough, not impassioned, is the message. With Labour lagging in the polls, expect to hear the anti-Reform rhetoric ramped up - but exactly how to burst the populist bubble has proved challenging. The response to Reform leader Nigel Farage's proposal this week to end existing migrants' Indefinite Leave to Remain suggested that Labour hadn't quite settled on the most effective line of attack. Chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned Reform's alleged cost-savings and denounced the policy as a gimmick; Labour Party chair Anna Turley highlighted unanswered questions but also raised the prospect of families being broken up; the MP Sarah Owen also mentioned family break-up but added that this was ""morally abhorrent"". None of these responses were mutually exclusive but they differed in tone, and perhaps point to a tension between denouncing Reform as not serious - or as all too serious. Just a year ago, the Conservatives were Labour's principal opponents. The government now has to grapple with an insurgent party with no track record in office and which is eroding Labour's, not just the Conservatives', vote. And it's not a problem that's unique to the UK. Reuters Sir Keir Starmer will be eyeing the lessons from Australia, after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won a second term There is concern amongst centre-left parties internationally that a rejuvenated right is doing well at the ballot box and seemingly winning the battle of ideas. So how do they fight back? The think-tank, the IPPR; the Center for American Progress and the pro-leadership Labour Together organisation have brought together an array of progressive leaders to share their electoral lessons at a major conference in London on Friday. Their big tent encompasses not just international socialist and social democratic parties but also Greens, Liberals - and even some former Conservatives. Labour strategists are looking enviously at their Australian counterparts who won a second term in May. Anthony Albanese's government tackled the immigration issue - in which they had felt vulnerable - soon after taking power and tightened rules on student and temporary visas. They were able to demonstrate a steady reduction in net migration before polling day and made the political case for continuing to bring in skilled labour - defeating an opponent who called for bigger reductions. But there won't be a single template for Labour to follow. The Spanish Socialist PM Pedro Sanchez's approach is to not to bang on about immigration but when necessary to defend it as a contributor to a growing economy, while the Danish Social Democrat PM Mette Federikson has been taking a hard line on asylum. There is nonetheless a shared recognition that a defence of the status quo is no longer sustainable. The IPPR's Harry Quilter-Pinner says it would be a mistake to follow ""the playbook of the right"". He tells me: ""The populist right's story is one of extraction – of just taking. Progressives should reject this - it stokes divisions."" He suggests when it comes to economic migration there needs to be an assessment of whether - and how quickly -  a UK citizen could be trained to do a job. He believes more of a fuss should be made of becoming British citizen, and there needs to be an expectation of what new citizens would contribute. Claire Ainsley, who was Sir Keir Starmer's policy chief when he was in opposition, is now overseeing a project on centre-left renewal at the Progressive Policy Institute, and her advice is to grow the ""seeds of doubt"" about Reform in the electorate's minds in the three years between now and the election. She believes that while people are happy to cast a protest vote, they currently question whether Reform are really a government in waiting - so challenging them on whether their policies hold together, or whether their numbers add up, is a way of undermining their support. But it does also mean doing more to tackle the core issue. She says the party leadership realised ""the previous set of answers on immigration were not going to wash with the British public that want to see action"", and says she was encouraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's promise that ""nothing is off the table"" in tackling illegal migration. But tackling Reform isn't just about immigration. Ms Ainsley says it's about people feeling worse off and not feeling they have got a fair deal on the economy,  and a sense that other people are getting treated better than them. The current buzzword around government is ""contribution"" - convincing people that they will be beneficiaries and not just contributors to a welfare state. This is likely to be developed further in the main Labour conference speeches in Liverpool next week. Previewing that, Labour Together published a report this week. In it, chief policy officer Morgan Wild argues that over the past decades, the link between what people put in and what they get out has all but disappeared. He says: ""It is hard to explain to people why their council tax is going up while their waste service is being cut. It is hard to explain to the public why asylum seekers are being placed in hotels for years on end at the taxpayers' expense....the best way to restore trust is through the contributory principle. If you pay in, you should be able to see what you get out."" Labour MP Clive Lewis, on the party's left, doesn't underestimate the scale of the challenge. One of his school friends took part in the recent Unite the Kingdom march in central London . Lewis hadn't thought he'd be part of it – he had black family members and is, says Lewis, ""a great guy"" - but his friend had texted to say he felt he was being listened to. Lewis says he has seen a ""vehemence and anger"" amongst a section of the electorate who feel let down - and for Keir Starmer to be believed when he calls out Farage, he needs to be trusted. He says he believes seeing off Farage is a much bigger task than making a speech, and the prime minister has to do nothing less than change the political culture in the government and in the country. Adam Langleben of the Progressive Britain think tank also believes progressive parties need to be more ""humble"" – whether in victory or defeat. ""We have an avoidable habit of not listening enough to the electorate,"" he says. Tackling a pessimistic public mood also requires more than policies. The prime minister is a political leader who appears to know the value of symbols. Soon after winning his party's leadership in 2020, he branded Labour literature with the union flag, which was also never far from the backdrop of his TV news clips. Initially it was to help define him against his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The message was: Sir Keir would be unambiguously pro-Nato, pro nuclear deterrent, pro strong defence - proud of the flag. Safe to vote for. But those who converged in central London on the Unite the Kingdom march to hear Tommy Robinson weren't exactly waving their flags to symbolise support for Labour. It has again become a contested symbol. The prime minister is expected to say he wants to reclaim the flag. It's a problem that previous Labour leaders have grappled with - and the current one can perhaps learn from. When Neil Kinnock was the Labour opposition leader in the 1980s, he did not want to cede the mantle of patriotism to the Conservatives, so he sought to define patriotism in line with his own beliefs, and he placed the union jack (and the flags of the UK's constituent nations) on party literature to reclaim it, he said, from the far-right party, the BNP. In the 2000s, the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown sought to claim 'Britishness' for themselves. But Keir Starmer faces a tougher political landscape now. According to recent polling from pollster Lord Ashcroft , the public can't agree on why union and English flags have been appearing on lampposts, and whether or not this is a good thing. Labour, Lib Dem and Green voters tend to think they signal hostility to immigrants; while right of centre voters believe they are signs of frustration with immigration. Overall, 39% of respondents supported the appearance of the flags while 28% disapproved - but about a quarter of voters surveyed had mixed feelings. Despite obvious divisions, Adam Langleben believes it is possible to create a ""progressive patriotism"", taking a leaf from the maiden speech of the murdered MP Jo Cox , which celebrated diversity but recognised that ""we have far more in common than that which divides us"". Reform UK have been clear what they are against. But some of the prime minister's own MPs say he can only really be successful in taking on Reform if he is clearer about what he is for.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5703yn77o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5e19/live/7804c0a0-99f5-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-25T11:25:24+00:00,d56df95abf9dbe270b0bdcf5259c7a69c39acb5d

The department said ""officials are working at pace with [the minister] to determine how we will move forward with a War Memorial"". The trust took this as welcome confirmation that the new Labour government did intend to honour the previous government's commitment to make a grant available to help fund a Muslim war memorial, even if it was not confirmation the memorial would definitely go ahead. Over the following months Sir William continued to press for a decision and whether the Â£1m was still available. In November 2024, the department said that it remained ""committed to providing funding of up to Â£1m"", and officials were working on taking the matter forward. The following month, an exercise to gather information about suppliers was launched, which the trust responded to. But by May this year, nothing had happened. Sir William emailed again to ask about progress, but the response again was that no decision had yet been made. Sir William now says: ""Silence reigns."" ""The issue is not that the government is obliged to support the trust's memorial,"" Sir William says. ""It is when we can expect a decision whether it will provide any financial support and, if so, how much and on what terms. On that hangs how we approach others to give to the project.""

93bec1d5998d,Burnham's provocative challenge to Starmer shows he is serious,,"Location: party conference. A fairly new prime minister is struggling for popularity with his party and the country at large, against a backdrop of grim economic choices. A popular, plain-speaking mayor enters the week talked up as a future leader  — and is doing little to dampen that speculation himself. The year is 2012, the prime minister is David Cameron and the mayor is Boris Johnson. But it could just as well be 2025, Sir Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham. Sometimes politicians of all parties flirt with the possibility of one day becoming leader in suggestive, coy, almost deniable ways. This is not an example of that. Burnham is being more overt. To the Telegraph, the Greater Manchester mayor gave a straight answer to a straight question: yes, he had been contacted by Labour MPs ""throughout the summer"" about the prospect of him returning to Westminster, where he was an MP for 16 years, to lead Labour and replace Starmer as prime minister. Burnham said this was ""more a decision for those people than it is for me"". He repeated that line in an interview with BBC Manchester. Well, up to a point. Burnham is not an MP. He would have to decide to become one if he wants to be Labour leader and prime minister. Labour's rule book dictates that the party leader must be an MP, so when the party is in government that means the prime minister must also be an MP, meaning they have to be elected to Parliament rather than made a member of the Lords. This means that his path to Downing Street is extremely complicated. First, a Labour MP would need to resign their seat so there is a by-election - unless a contest happened to arise through an MP dying or similar. Because of Burnham's distinctive regional pitch, the constituency would surely have to be in Greater Manchester or at least the north-west of England. Two Manchester Labour MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, have already ruled out standing down for Burnham. Then, Burnham would have to be selected as Labour's candidate. This would require the approval of Labour's national executive committee, which for most purposes is controlled by allies of Starmer, although at least some of those would probably support Burnham's return to Westminster. Then, he would have to win the by-election in a difficult national political environment for the Labour Party. And then, finally, Burnham would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer  - at which point presumably other candidates would enter the fray. There are a lot of difficulties along that path. Still, it is clearly a path that he is willing, at the very least, to publicly entertain. The mere existence of the Telegraph interview, alongside a long profile in the New Statesman, the bible of left-liberals, is pretty provocative. Burnham knew that he would be asked questions about his national ambitions, and that they would create a stir in the days before a crucial party conference for Starmer. Perhaps most notable, though, is that Burnham used both interviews to spell out a policy prospectus: higher council tax on expensive homes, borrowing to invest in council housing, cutting income tax for lower earners and increasing it for higher earners. In the New Statesman, he said: ""We've got to get beyond this thing of being in hock to the bond markets"". That is a direct challenge not just to Starmer but to Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her view  - her supporters and plenty of experts would say the economic reality  - that the government cannot borrow much more money. It is an argument that quite a few Labour MPs make, mostly in private: that this government has allowed itself to become too constrained by Treasury orthodoxy. To have Burnham joining that argument publicly, whether his leadership challenge is plausible or not, is unwelcome for Starmer and Reeves. In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now. One senior source said he was: ""A Boris-sized ego, but without the strategic thought."" Speaking from the main stage of Conservative conference back in 2012 (an honour not being afforded to Burnham at Labour's conference next week), Boris Johnson ended up rallying the members behind David Cameron. It took him seven years to get to No 10. It's hard to see the Starmer and Burnham story taking quite so long to play out, whatever the ultimate conclusion.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx275r1l3xpo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/da0e/live/172696c0-99e9-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg,2025-09-25T09:50:48.015000+00:00,238925805f5ba54834c3088b16ab6682e44c54db
f12bce52aabf,How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock?,,"How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock? Dharshini David Deputy economics editor and Raphael Sheridan Economics reporter BBC Glenys is concerned about people whose only income is the basic state pension At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80. Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April , will add a spring to those dancers' steps. Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension. ""I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,"" she says. Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. ""My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea."" Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability. The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer. Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April. The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched. It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable. That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans. ""You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,"" she says. ""If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference."" The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population. Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned. Linda worries about having to pay tax on her state pension in the future Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits. As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones. The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a ""messy tool"". So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue ""infinitely"", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases. The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and the row over the winter fuel payment , underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters. That is not just the case with current retirees. Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form. Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can. There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending. No-one said getting older was easy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c07a/live/b2ce65e0-92cc-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg,2025-09-16T09:04:55.401000+00:00,86c0560311218126e96b2d16bd5d6c033b347fab
777652698006,The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney,,"The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney Glenn Campbell Scotland political editor The White House John Swinney lobbied Donald Trump at a meeting in the White House John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship. On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president. Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK. In early March, Swinney said it was ""unthinkable"" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question. Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to ""ethnic cleansing"". But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet. Why has John Swinney's approach changed? The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott. Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff. Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited. So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach? That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque. ""We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,"" he said. He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky. Scottish government Swinney is arguing for a reduction or removal of US import tariffs on whisky This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy. That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions. That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states. UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky. But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action? Reuters Trump opened his new golf course in Aberdeenshire during his visit to Scotland Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind. The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March. I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day. He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word. This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office. Building a new relationship It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were ""thank you"". Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words. A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney ""nasty"" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign. It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built. It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections. He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again. Reuters Keir Starmer had dinner with Donald Trump during his visit to Scotland this summer There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government. However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known. That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire. Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a ""terrific guy"". It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry. He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda. Scottish government Swinney had a 50-minute conversation with Trump on his visit to Washington Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president. He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America. But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky. The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House. He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world. None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office. This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down. Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential ""win-win"" business deal to Donald Trump. The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky. A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK. Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too. If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up. If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an ""absolute blinder"". One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was ""smart politics"". PA Media Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said whisky was very high up the UK's list of priorities What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge. They enabled him to run rings round them. The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days. Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson. Eventually, the new Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander took to the airwaves to insist that the UK government had been ""thinking, working, talking and negotiating about whisky for many weeks and months"". He argued that whisky was ""very high"" up the list of priorities for the UK as it seeks further trade concessions from the US and warned Swinney against ""playing politics"". There is no certainty that whisky will get a special deal or that any announcement will come during Trump's state visit - but the industry has sensed in recent weeks that a better deal for them could be ""deliverable"". They would raise a glass to that if it happens and leave the politicians to squabble over who fought Scotch's corner the hardest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cb2b/live/071a8960-92de-11f0-950e-eb051178bae0.jpg,2025-09-17T06:07:24.876000+00:00,f677f380a7d8d4e0650cff237db5d2ee5a2cc0e5
f1fbeaddf06c,Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't,,"Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't Sarah Smith North America editor in Scotland Getty Images A list of Donald Trump's favourite things would be very unlikely to include raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens (as Julie Andrews famously sang in The Sound of Music). Instead, the president's list would surely have on it playing golf, a way to brazenly promote his commercial interests and, thirdly, trade deals that generate billions of dollars for the United States. No wonder he looks so pleased with himself - his working holiday in Scotland has delivered on all three of these passions. On what was billed as a ""private visit"" he got a lot of work done. He is taking home with him a trade deal with the EU which is not only the largest in history, it is also extremely favourable to the US. The EU will spend hundreds of billions of dollars buying American energy and military equipment as well as investing billions more in the US economy. In return European goods will be subject to a 15% tariff when they are exported to the US rather than the 30% Trump had threatened. The deal is an important achievement for Trump to be able to boast about, even if he has failed to conclude the ""90 deals in 90 days"" he had promised. He also seemed to relish hosting Sir Keir and Lady Starmer at his Turnberry golf resort on Monday. It was a peculiar spectacle, the British prime minister being welcomed as guest in his own country. But the PM was prepared to overlook the protocol when he was being treated to an unusual and valuable amount of face time with the US president. Trump is, after all, a man whose foreign policy is abnormally influenced by his personal relations with other world leaders. Their talks were dominated by the crisis in Gaza. Starmer appeared to make some headway as he pressed Trump to use his influence to get more food into the Palestinian territory. Getty Images Starmer and wife Victoria were hosted by Trump at Turnberry Trump said afterwards that the US would work with the UK and other European partners to set up food centres, adding that he will tell Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure that food gets to people who need it. ""I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food."" He also seemed to give the green light to Starmer to officially recognise the state of Palestine even though that is not something the US will do. ""I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him taking a position,"" he said. Trump also made a significant change to his position on the conflict in Ukraine. He revealed that he is now giving Russian President Vladimir Putin only 10-12 days to agree to a ceasefire, not the 50 days he had previously given him. ""There's is no reason in waiting… I want to be generous but we just don't see any progress being made."" All of these major announcements were made during an exceptionally long, wide-ranging and free-wheeling press conference, during which the US president appeared extremely relaxed. He was prepared to talk at length about anything from wind power to immigration, including his views on King Charles and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Watch: Trump says he turned down an invitation to Epstein's island There was one issue he could not escape, much as he perhaps wanted to. He was inevitably asked about Jeffrey Epstein, as the long running controversy about why he is refusing to release all the files held by the US government on the deceased sex offender followed him across the Atlantic. A van displaying an old photograph of Trump at a party with Epstein was driving around Aberdeenshire to make sure the president could not escape the furore. He told us for the first time why he fell out with the disgraced financier many years ago, saying that Epstein had poached staff from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and he refused to talk to him after that. And he denied ever having sent a lewd drawing to Epstein (as reported by the Wall St Journal), claiming that he only ever draws very basic pictures of buildings. The intrusion of the Epstein scandal into Trump's Scottish trip was a reminder of what inevitably awaits him on his return to Washington but it did not seem to dent his buoyant mood. A few anti-Trump protests were staged. But they were largely kept away from the president himself and were remarkably muted compared with previous visits. The most determined demonstrators were Trump fans who turned out to greet him as he landed in Prestwick and at both golf resorts, holding large signs welcoming him to Scotland. The president also took every opportunity to use this trip to proudly promote his two Scottish golf resorts. He hosted the press conferences with Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU's executive, in the newly renovated ballroom at Turnberry, boasting of the opulent new ceiling and brand new windows at the same time as discussing famine in Gaza. Getty Images Starmer and Trump arrive by helicopter at Trump MacLeod House Arriving in Aberdeenshire with Starmer on board his Marine One helicopter, he took a couple of laps to show off the new golf course before landing. After talks with John Swinney on Tuesday morning, he had the Scottish first minister attend the official opening of the Trump International Golf Links in the village of Balmedie, along with several VIPs and a phalanx of TV cameras. It is exceptionally unusual for a US president to so nakedly use his office to promote his own commercial interests but it is something Donald Trump clearly revels in doing. Almost as much as he enjoys playing golf. Which he managed to do on almost every day of this trip.

1be69e4b2f5a,Badenoch hopes to grab attention with policy blitz,,"Badenoch hopes to grab attention with policy blitz Chris Mason Political editor 'To fix our country, we must reverse Labour's measures' says Badenoch The Conservatives have been one of the democratic world's most successful parties at winning elections. And yet a party used to standing so tall has shrivelled to Lilliputian levels. They have rarely, if ever, known a scenario so bleak. With that backdrop, a leader's position would always be questioned – and Kemi Badenoch's has been. But her speech to the party's annual conference was a confident performance, arguably her best moment yet as leader, and a fleshing out of her brand of Conservatism. She appeared relaxed and like she was enjoying herself, which is quite a thing given she would have been feeling the pressure of doing her first closing conference address as Conservative leader. The Tories spot a niche they hope they can own: to be perceived as wise custodians of the public finances. Despite the Liz Truss legacy, they have been buoyed by polling suggesting this is a perception they should lean into as a differentiator from Labour and Reform UK. What I have noticed over the last few days is something of a Darwinian selection among the people who came to the conference in Manchester. Yes, the numbers were down on where they were last year or when the party was in government, as you would expect. But those who turned up were up for the fight. I got chatting to one local party association chairman as activists headed for the station after Badenoch's speech. ""This gives us something to talk about with voters,"" they said with an approving smile, after the blitz of policy announcements in recent days. Stamp duty surprise As a new leader, Kemi Badenoch did not want to rush into announcing policies. This was partly out of a belief that you have got to think things through before you announce them. She likes to distinguish between policies and announcements, claiming her rivals will often make a splash with an idea that hasn't been properly thought through. The problem, though, is while all these policies were being worked up, the party didn't have much to say. The stand-out new policy in the speech, which the party had managed to keep under wraps until it was delivered from the lectern, was her plan to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland. The party sees stamp duty as a particularly bad tax, because it puts people off moving house. But the key thing here is that yes, the party has given itself something to talk about, but is anyone listening? Some of the leader's internal sceptics said they were pleasantly surprised by what they heard. Kemi Badenoch will hope this buys her some time and some attention. But in our noisy political ecosystem, neither is guaranteed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywrpelp7jo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cacf/live/cbd4f390-a45d-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-08T20:06:04.083000+00:00,aa9d1967197f5c6524e8117bf2eb3e3a09a23454
9cbd2a1269e7,Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness',,"Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness' Chris Mason Political editor EPA The Conservative Party conference in Manchester is taking place against a backdrop of grief and pain over last week's synagogue attack When a political party gathers for its annual conference, the host city (or at least the political and security bubble that surrounds the conference centre) becomes home to feverish and partisan political chat. What is different about the next few days is Manchester is also a city in mourning after the horrific attack on Thursday. There is, of course, still sharp political argument here but the emotional and practical backdrop is one of grief, fear and an ongoing police investigation. The flags outside the conference centre fly at half mast. A community just a few miles from here, but also all over the UK, is terrorised, frightened and grieving. Many Jewish people are furious more has not been done - for years - to protect them. And all this poses some of the biggest questions about who we are and what we hold dear. The other day the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood pleaded with pro-Palestinian protesters not to head out onto the streets in the immediate days after the attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue. She argued that to do so would be ""un-British"". But others ponder just how British it is to curb repeated protests - the plan Mahmood now plans to legislate for. So what are the fundamental tenets of Britishness - a concept itself some would contest - under which a multicultural, multilingual, multireligious collection of nations such as the UK could agree on? Against the backdrop of pain and grief, this is a debate about some of the fundamentals of our society - democracy, protest, offence, tolerance (even tolerance for the intolerant) and proportionality. In addition to antisemitism, there is Islamophobia too. The home secretary talked over the weekend, rather euphemistically, about what she called ""community relations"" and others might put more baldly as racism and hatred. The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK had tolerated what she called radical Islamist ideology ""for too long"". This element of the conversation around the dangers of Islamism and how it is countered is not new and itself infuriates many as we collectively wrestle with what to do about it. These are challenges for the home secretary, challenges for the government yes, but challenges for society as a whole.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7840dv7n4po,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/afef/live/acb32710-a279-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T06:01:51.849000+00:00,8b1de4374fa1c138867b726cc803bb2403668971
8ee7f100cb83,Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage,,"Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage Chris Mason Political editor Starmer questions if Reform wants to serve ""our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country"" Sir Keir Starmer was last year's big winner at the general election. This year saw the prime minister sharpening his argument against Nigel Farage and - by extension - against those within his own party, from the cabinet down, who fret he's not the best frontman for the fight that beckons with Reform UK. There is a defiance and steeliness to the prime minister; with this performance, he reminded his internal critics just who it was who won that whopping majority in the election 15 months ago. The year gone by has been a relentless grind – not least the last few weeks, after losing the former deputy PM Angela Rayner and US ambassador Peter Mandelson - and in his speech, the prime minister wanted to remind the audience of the achievements of the past months. His critics within the Labour party remind him, relentlessly, that Labour's politics must be politically more aggressive, front-footed and pointed in order to defeat a communicator of Nigel Farage's ability. This speech was the prime minister's response. It taught us little new about Sir Keir's political creed, but persistently painted the dividing line he wants: Reform versus everyone else. And he says he's the figurehead for that fightback. Farage has claimed his migration policy being labelled ""racist"" by the prime minister had put his staff at risk; it left him ""more determined than ever"", he said. Was Sir Keir Starmer's speech up to the challenge? Is this the point where the pace quickens? The prime minister is now approaching a bleak-looking Budget and a grim set of local elections, and elections in Wales and Scotland, next May. And even his most loyal allies accept those elections could determine if he's still delivering a conference speech to the assembled party as prime minister this time next year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw1jwdlz7lo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f98/live/049f4ce0-9e26-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-30T17:52:33.029000+00:00,0c0d7501f6218fa32b8356e644d663a4634db3f8
caad761735e3,Labour grapples with threat from Reform UK at party conference,,"It is just 14 months since the general election. Not yet 500 days. Labour has a working majority of 161. But here on the banks of the Mersey, it really doesn't feel like that. I am reminded of Conservative conferences of old, where a circus would accompany Boris Johnson from the railway station to each and every event he attended, in the years when it was transparently clear he was rather keen on becoming prime minister. Swop a former mayor of London and subsequent prime minister for the current mayor of Greater Manchester and aspiring prime minister Andy Burnham, and you have a sense of the vibe here. There is no shortage of acidic views about what is seen as the rather thrusting nature of Burnham's ambition, or near hagiographic accounts of his governance of Greater Manchester as its mayor – with the clear implication he should stay there. But there is one big reason why all this is happening, so early in this parliament: it is symptomatic of a party wrestling publicly and privately with how it confronts Reform UK. There is broad and deep reflection from plenty here – from the cabinet to councillors – that the pitch right now from Labour to the country isn't good enough. This is why we are seeing a sharpening in the language and the policies being presented now. No fewer than 10 cabinet ministers are addressing this conference from the main stage on Monday. The centrepiece address will be from Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who will argue that Reform presents a threat to the British economy with the potential, she will argue, for more borrowing and rising barriers to international trade. But perhaps more striking is the speech from the new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. She has been dubbed 'the Terminator' by the tabloids. She gives every impression she might regard that nickname as a bit wishy-washy, a bit namby-pamby. ""You won't always like what I'll do,"" she will say, addressing Labour activists in front of her directly. In other words, her instincts and approach in the Home Office might make some within the party squeamish. But she sees it as absolutely essential – and the clue is in the candid observations she has already shared here at an event on the conference fringe. ""We can reclaim the mantle that was once ours and can be again: we will be the party of the working class,"" she said – an acknowledgement that, right now at least, they are not. It is a reflection, in a sentence, of how this party perceives its predicament and what it is trying to do about it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr701vn0rjmo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/42a2/live/42a6d600-9d06-11f0-a8fe-677b0b0b2d56.jpg,2025-09-29T08:06:22.261000+00:00,9ca067e52da09bc744ea75a5b6b3e22cac66b74d
6dda1cf1f678,Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point,,"Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point Nick Robinson BBC ""At what point did we become North Korea?"" That was the question Nigel Farage posed when asked by a US congressional committee about limitations on freedom of speech in the UK. He was condemning the ""awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into"", which he claimed had led to various arrests including that of Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan over his views on challenging ""a trans-identified male"" in ""a female-only space"". When I heard the question, I confess I thought that the leader of Reform UK had gone over the top. Farage was comparing his country - my country - with a brutal dictatorship that murders, imprisons and tortures opponents. And he was doing it in front of an influential audience of American lawmakers. Lucy North/PA Wire 'I don't regret anything I've tweeted,' Graham Linehan said earlier this month When I interviewed his deputy, Richard Tice on Radio 4's Today, I asked him whether he really believed that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was the same as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Three times I asked the question. Three times Tice swerved it, suggesting Farage was simply using ""an analogy"". But Farage is not alone in questioning how far restrictions to freedom of speech have gone in the UK. Tensions around the limits of free speech are nothing new and since the advent of social media in the mid-2000s, the arguments have been simmering. Now, though, they're reaching a boiling point. BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images Farage lambasted the 'awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into' During his recent visit, US Vice-President JD Vance said he did not want the UK to go down a ""very dark path"" of losing free speech. The US business magazine Forbes carried an editorial this month that took this argument further still. In it, editor-in-chief Steve Forbes condemned the UK's ""plunge into the kind of speech censorship usually associated with tin pot Third World dictatorships"". He argues that, in stark contrast to the United States - where free speech is protected by the first amendment to the constitution, ""the UK has, with increasing vigour, been curbing what one is allowed to say, all in the name of fighting racism, sexism, Islamophobia, transgenderism, climate-change denial and whatever else the woke extremists conjure up"". So, how exactly did we get to the point where the UK is being compared to a dictatorship and, given how inflamed the conversation has become, what - if anything - would it take to turn down the heat? Big tech dialled up the debate The case of Lucy Connolly has become a cause celebre to some in the UK and beyond. The former childminder from Northampton, who is married to a Conservative councillor, had posted an abhorrent message on X, calling for people to ""set fire"" to hotels housing asylum seekers following the murder of three young girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024. It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times at a time when the threat of violence was very real. Police/PA Wire Lucy Connolly was jailed for 31 months after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing ""threatening or abusive"" written material on X. And yet she was given the red carpet treatment at the Reform party conference, as ""Britain's favourite political prisoner"". The length of her prison sentence - 31 months although she only served 40% before she was released - was questioned by many, including people who were appalled by what she had written. It is just one case that highlights how much social media has changed the shape of the debate around free speech and made heroes and villains of ordinary people. And I use the word ""ordinary"" deliberately because views similar to Connolly's will have been expressed up and down the land by others who might well have said, as she now does, ""I was an idiot"". But while it's unlikely that any action would have been taken had she said what she did in a coffee shop or a bar, the fact she posted it on social media changed things. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has changed the rules for Facebook and Instagram What's more, big tech firms have changed their approach in recent years. After billionaire businessman Elon Musk bought Twitter, which he re-named X, he changed content moderation, which he regards as ""a propaganda word for censorship"" - and he talks a lot about people spreading ""the woke mind virus"". Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has also changed the rules governing Meta and Instagram. In the case of Connolly, her post was ""accelerated by the algorithm"" and spread far more widely, according to Lilian Edwards, an emeritus professor at Newcastle University. Dilemma around policing speech The arrest of Graham Linehan at Heathrow, too, raised further questions around policing freedom of speech - and put the way issues are handled under renewed scrutiny. Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley has voiced his own concerns. ""It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the (online) content out there that enforcement is the answer to that,"" he has said. What these cases both illustrate is the lack of consensus about what can and should be policed online in the UK, and by who. And a lack of consensus too about how we can set apart the unpleasant, offensive, ugly and hateful things said online from those that are genuinely threatening or dangerous. PA Sir Mark Rowley: 'It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the content out there that enforcement is the answer' In the UK, the Human Rights Act does give protection to free speech but as a ""qualified right"". This means that ""governments can restrict that right… provided that the response is proportionate - [or] 'necessary in a democratic society' is what people tend to say"", according to Lorna Woods, professor of internet law at the University of Essex. But some of the comments made at the protest in London earlier this month, billed by far-right, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as a ""free speech rally,"" demonstrate that, despite other controversies, that right isn't that qualified. Like nailing jelly to the wall ""Violence is coming"" and ""you either fight back or die"", Musk told flag-waving protesters via video link. Along with his call for the overthrow of the government, some might argue that his words at the rally were an incitement to violence. But the UK's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the barrister Jonathan Hall KC, has said that Musk's words would not have broken the law. ""Politicians use martial language all the time, don't they?"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Metaphors such as fights and struggles are pretty normal. And he was talking about it contingently, wasn't he? He wasn't saying: 'Go out immediately.'"" Reuters Musk called moderation ""a propaganda word for censorship"" Yet the fact both men were able to address a huge crowd in London is perhaps evidence that there is rather more leeway for free speech in this country than those likening the UK to a ""tin pot dictatorship"" suggest. According to Essex University's Prof Lorna Woods, the lowest level of views that can be prosecuted in British criminal law are those deemed ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character"". These are concepts that few people without a law degree could easily define, let alone agree upon. It is the job of the police initially, but ultimately the courts, to try to nail that particular piece of jelly to the wall. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Former deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg says the the UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries on free speech The UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries, according to Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who later became right-hand man to Zuckerberg. He believes the UK needs to ""think long and hard"" about ""whether we've overdone it"" on policing speech. ""Surely part of the definition of being in a free society is people say ghastly things, offensive things, awful things, ugly things, and we don't sweep them under the carpet,"" he has said. Free speech versus 'me speech' What the British public want is another story. Earlier this month, in a survey by YouGov, 5,035 British adults were asked what was most important when it came to online behaviour: 28% said it was that people were able to express themselves freely but 61% prioritised keeping them safe from threats and abuse. ""People tend to prefer safety to free speech [online],"" argues Anthony Wells, a director at YouGov. What's more, there seems to be a generational divide. Mark Kerrison / Getty Images and SOPA Images / Getty Images In a new YouGov survey, 61% of Britons said keeping people safe online was more important than absolute free speech In my conversations with young people in their 20s and 30s - the age of my own children - I often hear the view that far from being an ideal to be strived for, free speech is the cause of much of the anger, division and fear they live with every day. In recent years a ""cancel culture"" has emerged in which those with ""unacceptable"" views can be hounded out of their jobs, no platformed as speakers or intimidated as students. Even back in 2021, a YouGov poll of Britons found that a majority of those surveyed - some 57% - had sometimes stopped themselves from expressing political or social views because of the fear of being judged or negative responses. For those who believe that free speech is under threat in the country, these figures can be used as evidence that decades of political correctness has had a chilling effect on people's ability to express their opinions. ""Our definitions of what constitutes hate speech, and I think a very broadened definition of what constitutes harm, is meaning that people feel like they are walking on eggshells and they're frightened - not just that they'll have the police around, but that they'll be cancelled if they say the wrong thing,"" the former Brexit Party MEP Baroness Claire Fox told the BBC's The World Tonight. But dig deeper and this debate, like so much else, is also about politics and the deepening and, increasingly, angry and violent divisions in our society. What can America teach us? Even with its constitutional protection for free speech, plenty in the UK question what basis Americans have to lecture Britain on free speech, given the arguments they are having back at home. The anger and division sparked by the assassination of the conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk in Utah this month ramped up the debate further on that side of the Atlantic over where the boundaries should lie between what is offensive, hateful and dangerous. Michael Le Brecht/Disney via Getty Images ABC has suspended talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel over comments about the killing of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi appalled many conservatives when she declared that, ""There's free speech and then there's hate speech"". It seemed to take her into precisely the territory, which has caused so many problems here in the UK. President Trump himself has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15bn (£11bn) over what he calls defamation and libel, adding to the long list of media outlets he has taken to the courts over stories - the newspaper has called it ""intimidation tactics"" - and he celebrated the sacking of the late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel as ""great news for America"". The US historian Tim Snyder, who is an outspoken public critic of the direction America is heading under Trump believes that free speech should be distinguished from what he calls ""me speech"". Win McNamee/Getty Images Trump has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15 billion ""Me speech is a common practice among rich and influential Americans,"" writes Mr Snyder. ""Practitioners of me speech use the phrase free speech quite a bit. ""But what they mean is free speech for themselves. They want a monopoly on it. ""They believe that they are right about everything, and so they should always have giant platforms, in real life or on social media. ""The people with whom they disagree, however, should be called out and intimidated in an organised way on social media, or subjected to algorithmic discrimination so that their voices are not heard."" As much about listening This issue is one I've felt strongly about for as long as I can remember. My grandparents knew first hand what it was to be persecuted for who you were and what you thought or said. They were German Jews who fled the Nazis for what then was the relative security of China and later had to flee the Communists there. As a child, I recall watching in reverential silence as each day, after lunch, my grandfather held a huge radio on his lap and turned the dial, skipping stations until he found the BBC World Service. There, he had learned, he would find news he could trust and speech which was free of political control. So important was this to him that he had risked hiding with his wife and daughter (my mother) in a cupboard in their home in Shanghai to listen to it on a banned shortwave radio. Nick says he finds it hard to accept comparisons between the UK and a dictatorship That is why I find any comparison between the UK and a dictatorship a little hard to swallow. What I learned as the grandchild of those who had fled not one but two murderous ideologies was that free speech was about listening as much as talking. What mattered above all else is being able to hear both sides of an argument and learn the facts behind them - without having that information controlled by governments, rich and powerful media owners, or anyone else.

796a2f6086cd,Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning,,"Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning James Landale Diplomatic correspondent BBC Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago. Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Trump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019) There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries. How Windsor became 'Trumpton' For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."" Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty Images One challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech. 'Pressure to make this massive' So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me. Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty Images President Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and Thursday The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."" Peter Nicholls/Getty Images Members of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images President Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit ""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain. Serious business behind the pageantry Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda. Carl Court - Pool/Getty Images Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."" Leon Neal/Getty Images Planning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."" The Mandelson question For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when? Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Lord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and Vance Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit. Profound differences in the UK and US The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"". Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy. The diplomatic game of cards Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019 ""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter. But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. ""This is very early in Trump's presidency,"" one diplomat said. ""Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?""

d85289a2b48f,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform",,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025. The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style. And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times. These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping ""How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy"" was a joke. And what was planned as No 10's ""get back in charge week"" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax on her expensive new house. Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team. The start of this political season has been wild. Arron Chown/ PA Both Rayner's team and No 10 felt she had to go In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut. The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken. Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed. There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake. It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster. It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis. She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called ""Mr Rules"" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, ahem , flexible attitude to the normal rules. She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust. Jane Barlow/ PA Rayner had styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the ""service of the people"", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels. For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, ""it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight"". And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world. ""There's just the smell test,"" a Labour insider said. Chris Jackson / PA Angela Rayner, Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves all came under fire for accepting  permitted freebies This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not. Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now. Getty Images Nigel Farage moved forward his conference speech after Rayner's resignation The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument. Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust. Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock David Lammy is the new deputy prime minister The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days? Making changes to his ministers. The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making. Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: ""None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership."" You and I might translate that as: ""The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway."" One insider described it as moving those who were ""a bit awkward, or a bit tired"". Aaron Chown/ PA Some hope Shabana Mahmood will take a more strident approach on small boats as the new home secretary What those changes add up to depends on who you ask. One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle ""is all about immigration"", believing ""Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this"" to solve the small boats issue or ""we're all done for"". Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system. As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings. But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock Yvette Cooper will have to contend with a visit from President Donald Trump within days of taking up the foreign brief Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job. I wouldn't bet we'll see her meeting JD Vance in waders any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days. Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that. Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry. He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical. Phil Noble / Reuters Angela Rayner's exit from government has brought on a change in the prime minister's top team But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves. This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition. His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the ""time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long"", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck. Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: ""I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions."" This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for. ""Phase 2"" was meant to be ""delivery, delivery, delivery"". Another bout of political jargon that followed, ""change"", ""renewal"", ""security"", ""fairness"", ""milestones"", ""first steps"", you get the point. Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing. ""You can see the problem from Mars,"" another party insider says, ""there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything"", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week. But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work. And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement. House of Common / UK Parliament/ PA The start of Sir Keir Starmer's phase two of government has not quite gone to plan Seven days ago there was an ambition that week one of ""phase two"" might be an orderly start to the term. The Rayner saga skewered that plan. Now with his new chosen team in place there is more opportunity to make things work perhaps, but fewer excuses if things go wrong. A senior party source told me: ""The test is how does the PM show how No 10's capacity for political strategy and policy making have materially changed?"" With a long list of problems and the party conference looming, we'll soon know if Downing Street can pass that test, to prove it can manage the many challenges of ""phase two"" any better than the agonies of year one.

f3e20689d462,Reeves urged to avoid 'half-baked' tax fixes in Budget,,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves should avoid ""directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes"" when trying to boost the government's tax take in next month's Budget, a leading think tank has said. Taxes are widely expected to go up in the Budget, with pressure on the chancellor to raise money in order to meet her self-imposed rules for government finances. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) - regarded as one of the UK's most influential economic voices - has said some tax rises could be ""especially economically harmful"". The Treasury said the chancellor had been clear the Budget would strike the right balance between funding public services, while also encouraging growth and investment. Some analysts have estimated that Reeves will have to raise tens of billions of pounds through either increasing taxes or cutting spending in order to meet her rules which she has described as ""non-negotiable"". The two main rules are: Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament Before the 2024 general election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. The IFS said it would be possible for the chancellor to raise tens of billions of pounds a year more in revenue without breaking these manifesto promises, but this would not be straightforward. Its director Helen Miller told BBC's Radio 4's Today programme: ""The politics is important and we're going to hear lots and lots about whether Rachel Reeves can raise the money she wants without breaking one of her manifesto pledges – and that's worth thinking about – but the economics is important too."" The IFS said there are ""serious constraints"" on the next four biggest taxes - corporation tax, council tax, business rates and fuel duties - while ""some other tax-raising options would be especially economically harmful"". The IFS's comments came in an extract from its annual Green Budget, which analyses the challenges facing the chancellor. In it, the think tank urged wider reform to the tax system which would align ""overall tax rates across different forms of income"", something it says would be ""fairer and more growth friendly"". ""There is an opportunity to be bold and take steps towards a system that does less to impede growth and works better for us all,"" said Ms Miller who is one of the authors of the report. It suggests reforms to property tax and capital gains tax as ""good places to start"". Speaking to the Today programme Ms Miller said that stamp duty is an ""absolutely awful tax"" and said council tax, which is based on 1991 property valuations, is ""ludicrously out of date"" and ""regressive"". ""Make it a tax based on up-to-date property values, make it proportional, and raise revenue from that rather than the current council tax and stamp duty,"" she added. Ms Miller said Ms Reeves's last Budget was ""full of tax increases"", leaving ""only losers"", adding that ""reform means you could have some winners"". ""If you do a reform approach, you can say you're doing something for a principled reason, and make the system better, make us all better off, ultimately. At least you've got some good news to go alongside the inevitable upset from raised taxes."" The report goes on to look at a number of trade-offs the government could make in an effort to bring in more income. It warns against a wealth tax - which it said would face ""huge practical challenges"", potentially penalising savings and encouraging wealthier people to leave the country. ""If the chancellor wants to raise more from the better-off, a better approach would be to fix existing wealth-related taxes, including capital gains tax,"" it noted. It says property taxation is ""an area in desperate need of reform"". It calls for a reformed council tax based on current property values, rather than the current system that ""ludicrously"" uses values from 1991. Doubling council tax on the most expensive properties could raise £4bn, the report finds, while £6bn could be raised from the abolition of relief on inheritance tax for main homes. Extending the current freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028, could raise ""a significant amount"". Speaking to the BBC in September, Rachel Reeves did not rule this out. The IFS noted that restricting income tax relief for pension contributions could potentially raise a large sum - but should be avoided as it would be ""unfair and distortionary"". It said there were ""better options"" for increasing tax on pensions, such as reforming the tax-free element. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The chancellor has been clear that at Budget she will strike the right balance between making sure that we have enough money to fund our public services, whilst also ensuring that we can bring growth and investment to businesses.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n08n15w2o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13d9/live/98a29640-a5d3-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-13T06:53:39.465000+00:00,20180ff70c5bac75a30a336f84689b0487832b91
2abd987a416c,Swinney says 'precedent is on my side' to secure indyref2,,"Swinney says 'precedent is on my side' to secure indyref2 James Delaney BBC Scotland First Minister John Swinney told BBC's The Sunday Show that ""precedent is on my side"" when it comes to indyref2 John Swinney said the precedent set ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum should trigger a new poll, if the party wins a majority at the next Holyrood election. The SNP gained more than half of MSPs in 2011, an electoral triumph that paved the way for a vote on the country's future. On Saturday delegates at the party's conference in Aberdeen backed his strategy ahead of a bid to make the next election a de-facto poll on independence. But Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said the UK Labour government, which would have to approve the move, does not support a second referendum. Sir Keir Starmer previously said he had no plans to allow a fresh poll to take place during his term as prime minister. But Swinney told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that the prime minister's position was ""fatuous"" due to the ""clearly established basis"" set out after the SNP's historic win 14 years ago. He added: ""Precedent is on my side. ""This is what happened in 2011. ""And precedent is a substantial factor in legal consideration of the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future."" The SNP leader said that result meant his party was in a ""much stronger position"" to negotiate a mandate for a new vote should they achieve a majority next year. Asked if the election should instead be fought on current issues, such as standards of living, Swinney replied: ""I would say to people worried about their standard of living, this election should be about independence. ""Because, under the United Kingdom, people's standard of living has been flat as a pancake for 15 years."" The first minister said Scotland had to consider if was going to accept ""more of this"" as well as what he described as a ""shift to the right"" in UK politics. He said the SNP was bringing down NHS waiting lists and building more affordable homes. Swinney added: ""Self-government works for the people of Scotland and if we want to improve living standards, let's have the choice of independence."" PA Media Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signed copies of her memoir at the conference Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed Swinney's strategy as she signed copies of her new memoir at the conference. Sturgeon, who will step down as an MSP next year, said achieving a majority was an ""exceptionally hard task"". But she added: ""If you don't set your sights high, you don't deliver big things."" In the 2011 election , the SNP – then led by the late Alex Salmond – won 69 of 129 available seats. The party has failed to gain an outright majority in two Holyrood elections since then. Salmond and the then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron signed the Edinburgh Agreement in October 2012. It set out the terms for the 2014 ballot under Section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. Scotland voted against leaving the UK by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7% in September 2014. Any new vote would require Starmer to grant similar assent. Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander told The Sunday Show that he had ""heard all of this before” from Swinney regarding indyref2 Also appearing on the Sunday Show, Alexander said Swinney was using independence to divert attention away from the SNP's ""horrific"" record on public services. He said he was not sure if he had been listening to ""the Grand Old Duke of York or the first minister of Scotland"". Alexander added: ""This is all about marching his troops in that hall up to the top of the hill and then back down again. ""We have heard all of this before."" Asked if the UK government would say no to a second independence referendum, the Labour MP for Lothian East said he was ""working for victory"" at the Holyrood election in 2026 and ""not anticipating defeat"". Alexander told The Sunday Show: ""I am not going to divulge in his game which is to divert attention from his horrifically bad record on Scotland's public services by trying instead to provoke an argument about the constitution."" The Scottish Secretary, who replaced Ian Murray last month , was also questioned about whether he had a ""duty to the electorate"" to outline what would happen in the event of an SNP majority. He replied: ""I was elected on a very clear manifesto in July of 2024 which said Labour does not support independence or another referendum. ""That's the mandate on which I was elected and I will adhere to that mandate."" John Swinney has hinted that he has some tactics in mind to force the issue of a referendum, should the SNP win big next year. He might have given one of them away by talking about the legal importance of precedent. One speaker at the conference yesterday raised the prospect of a judicial review - should UK ministers reject calls for a vote - and was then name-checked by Swinney on stage. Could fresh court action be on the first minister's mind? The example of 2011 may provide a political precedent - but is there a legal one? After all, the Supreme Court has already issued a ruling that UK ministers must consent to a binding referendum. We are of course getting way ahead of the game. There is still an election to be fought, and a Holyrood majority is a hard thing to secure. But some in the SNP are already thinking even further ahead. Indeed it has been suggested that Sir Keir Starmer's refusal might be moot as, if results go against him in Scotland and Wales, then he may well be out on his ear and they'll be negotiating with someone else. Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton accused the first minister of ""desperately pushing his obsession with independence"" to divert attention from ""the SNP's failures in government"". She added: ""Swinney, as usual, is putting party before country, by fixating on breaking up the UK, rather than fixing the damage done to our NHS, schools, jobs and economic growth by his government."" Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said the first minister was using the ""crutch of independence"" in a bid to to restore the party's fortunes. He said: ""John Swinney and the SNP need to talk about independence as a distraction because they have failed to deliver after almost two decades in charge. ""People will see through the strategy as they want change from the same old stuff.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg424dk03x9o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1bbb/live/419bcf60-a75e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-12T12:19:52.415000+00:00,77e54c0daead580837456fdf673f55f05227ecd7
662b8c867537,Witkoff praises PM aide's 'tireless efforts' on Gaza,,"Witkoff praises PM aide's 'tireless efforts' on Gaza Kate Whannel Political reporter and Henry Zeffman Chief political correspondent EPA The US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has praised the ""incredible input and tireless efforts"" of the UK's National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell in bringing about the ceasefire in Gaza. In a social media post, Witkoff also said he wanted to ""acknowledge the vital role of the UK in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel"". The comments sharply contrast with those of Mike Huckabee, the US's ambassador in Israel, who said a UK minister was ""delusional"" for suggesting the UK played a ""key role"" in the process. The specific and personal praise for Powell from Witkoff is a boost to the national security adviser at a moment of political vulnerability. Powell is facing pressure over what role he played in the collapsed court case against two men accused of spying for China. Sources in government had for some time been emphasising the strength of the relationship between Powell and Witkoff. The two men are said to be in almost daily contact. Their relationship has become closer through their work on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with Powell playing an instrumental role in trying to rebuild the US-Ukraine relationship after President Trump and President Zelensky's public confrontation in the Oval Office in February. Powell was also in Egypt last week as negotiations over the ceasefire were being finalised. Some in government expect Powell's experience of negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland will be called upon by the US and others in the coming weeks and months, especially on the issue of decommissioning of weapons. Powell was instrumental in brokering the 1998 peace deal in Northern Ireland when he was chief of staff to then Prime Minister Tony Blair. He left Downing Street after 10 years and went on to set up Inter-mediate, a conflict resolution charity which has helped negotiate peace agreements in Colombia, Mozambique and Spain. Bronwen Maddox, director of the international relations think tank Chatham House told BBC Radio 4's Profile that Powell made the case that to achieve peace people had to talk to their enemies ""even if they have blood on their hands"". Talking previously about the process of negotiation, Powell has said: ""It's much harder to kill people when you know them. ""You have to get to know people and build a relationship of trust to break out of the cycle of violence."" Getty Images In September Powell met Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Than On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Sky News the UK had ""played a key role behind the scenes"" in shaping the Gaza peace plan and had been involved in ""complex matters of diplomacy"". Responding on the social media platform X, Huckabee said: ""I assure you she's delusional. She can thank Donald Trump anytime just to set the record straight."" Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel added to Huckabee's criticism arguing that the UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood had ""actually pushed Hamas to embolden their position"". However, on Monday, Witkoff publicly lauded the UK's involvement and specifically the role of Jonathan Powell. Asked about his praise, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: ""I was not born yesterday. ""I think it is actually very sad that the government is having to beg people to send tweets to say something nice about Jonathan Powell. ""I think that that is quite tragic, the way that the UK's reputation is falling under this Labour government."" Sir Keir Starmer has travelled to Egypt, where US President Donald Trump and negotiators from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will sign the peace plan. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is also expected to attend the international summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, along with world leaders from around 20 countries. The ceasefire brokered by Trump in Gaza began on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of the peace plan. The last 20 of the Israeli hostages have been released and are now back in Israel, and Hamas is due to hand over the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages. Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Gaza Strip.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4rwne0ggo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f0c0/live/77246bd0-a824-11f0-9402-2f1ec29d00d4.jpg,2025-10-13T10:54:28.861000+00:00,0e949b81d868f105451dcebae1e211f3a4df70e4

The announcement came during his keynote speech at the SNP conference in Aberdeen. Swinney also reiterated his commitment to Scottish independence, revealed a sponsorship scheme for social care workers, and criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over Labour's record at Westminster The first minister said there was ""no more important issue"" than the NHS. He told delegates that his walk-in GP scheme would begin at 15 sites then expand across Scotland. He said: ""They will break from the status quo. They will add to the care we already value. Staffed by GPs and nurses. ""And you won't need to call up for an appointment. That means more people can go after work - when it fits with their lives."" Swinney promised that the first site would be up and running ""within the year"". PA Media The SNP leader was speaking at the end of his party's conference in Aberdeen The first minister also said Scotland was being damaged by a morally wrong ""race to the right"" by parties at Westminster. He said this had led to an ""80 per cent fall"" in the number of overseas nurses the NHS was able to recruit and the shutdown of a visa route for care home staff. Swinney said: ""Thousands of care workers here in the UK entirely legally have been left high and dry. ""Unable to work, while care homes are crying out for staff. In what world does that make any sense?"" He said the Scottish government would sponsor overseas staff so they can ""work, pay tax and help keep Scotland's care homes running"".

c3ee7cf08bd4,The controversy over the collapsed China spy case explained,,"The controversy over the collapsed China spy case explained AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spies The government is facing questions after a case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed, just weeks before the trial was due to go ahead. In September, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges, sparking a political row over who was to blame. The background to the case is complicated - so here we try and walk you through how we got here and the political impact. What was the case about? Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry - who have both consistently maintained their innocence - were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Why did it collapse? Last week, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. In a rare intervention, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who is the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said the CPS had tried to obtain further evidence from the government ""over many months"" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute. He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a ""threat to national security"" at the time of the alleged offences. However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution. What was the political fallout? Downing Street has insisted the decision to drop charges was made by the CPS, with no ministers or members of the government involved. The government has maintained that it is frustrated the trial collapsed. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also sought to shift the focus to the previous Conservative government, which was in power when the alleged offences took place. He argued the prosecution could only be based on the Tory government's position at that time, when he says China was not designated a ""threat to national security"". Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected this claim, pointing out that a number of former senior security and legal officials have also questioned the government's argument. Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat. However, they claim there are hundreds of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence. The Tories have suggested that the PM's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it needed to secure convictions. Ministers have insisted Powell had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the case. Why is this a problem for the government? Badenoch has accused the government of deliberately collapsing the trial because ""the prime minister wants to suck up to Beijing"" - something it has denied. Since last year's general election, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China to help achieve its aim of growing the economy. Then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Powell have all visited the country over the past year. The government has insisted its approach to China is rooted in the UK's national interests. However, Badenoch has claimed that following the collapse of the case it seems the PM has been ""too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq057734w1o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d716/live/191e2800-a842-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T14:42:49.030000+00:00,bbc386e0fc55228a95ae0f887fbe343d2c350c26

Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - in September. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed the case collapsed because the government had refused to give the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ""vital information"" as it wanted to ""curry favour"" with China. Security Minister Jarvis dismissed claims the government deliberately collapsed the case as ""baseless"". Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.

Giving a statement to MPs in the Commons, Jarvis denied reports Mr Powell had ruled China could not be defined as a national security threat at a meeting of Whitehall officials in September, shortly before the charges were dropped. ""Of course, [the national security adviser] takes part in discussions about national security and diplomatic relations. That is literally his job,"" he said. ""But any discussions were on the basis that the case would be going ahead and how to handle the implications. ""The national security adviser was not involved in any decisions about the substance of the evidence."" Jarvis said it was deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins who provided a witness statement in December 2023 under the previous Conservative government, with further witness statements requested and provided in February and July this year. He said Mr Collins was given ""full freedom to provide evidence without interference"", adding: ""Ministers and special advisers did not take decisions about that evidence and they were not cited on the contents."" Jarvis said all the evidence provided was based on the law and the Tory government's position on China at the time of the alleged offences. He added that the decision about whether to proceed with the prosecution was taken by the CPS, ""who were hamstrung by antiquated legislation"". The Official Secrets Act of 1911 has since been replaced by the 2023 National Security Act, which Jarvis said closed ""the loopholes that have been exposed by this particular case"". ""Suggestions that the government concealed evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,"" he said. ""The [deputy national security adviser] did not materially change his evidence and was under no pressure from anyone to do so... ""What has changed is the CPS's assessment of the case law."" Jarvis sought to blame the previous Tory government for not classifying China as a threat to national security and being too ""slow"" to update national security laws. Defending her party's record, Badenoch pointed to a number of examples where Tory ministers and government documents had described China as a ""threat"". ""The trial has collapsed because for months and months, the government has been refusing to give the CPS vital information,"" she said. ""This wasn't a mistake. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This looks like a deliberate decision to collapse the case and curry favour with the regime in China."" She added: ""I suspect that [ministers] have decided that closer economic ties with China were more important than due process and our national security."" The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to ""come clean on why this case fell apart"" and publish all correspondence between the deputy national security adviser and the CPS. The party's foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said: ""The government's attempts to duck scrutiny and scapegoat a single official simply won't wash.

193512538cdd,Chris Mason: SNP are the latest proof that things change quickly in politics,,"Chris Mason: SNP are the latest proof that things change quickly in politics Chris Mason Political editor in Aberdeen PA Media John Swinney was the third SNP leader in a little over a year A year or so ago, the Scottish National Party looked to be in deep trouble. They had been comprehensively thrashed in the general election , falling from 48 MPs to just nine. They had managed to have three leaders in a little over a year: Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and then John Swinney. It was a rate of attrition that would make even the Conservative Party of recent years blush. There had also been a high-profile and long-running police investigation into the SNP's finances, involving Sturgeon, who was told earlier this year she would face no action . Plus there were bitter rows over gender identity. And the SNP has been in devolved government in Scotland since before you could buy an iPhone – since May 2007. Electoral gravity looked to be catching up with them, and catching up big time – just ahead of the crucial elections to the Scottish Parliament next May. PA Media John Swinney, with Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon But in case you needed yet another reminder that our domestic politics remains a smorgasbord of competitiveness and unpredictability, the SNP is the latest case study. Swinney has brought stability to a party that indulged in the opposite for a while. And support has splintered among its rivals – Labour, Reform and others. Here is how the pollsters More in Common put it: ""Since last year's general election, Labour's support has more than halved in Scotland while the SNP has marginally improved its standing. While not seeing as significant a rise as in England, Reform has emerged as the potential second-place party after the SNP in Scotland, suppressing the Conservatives' vote share as well as eating into Labour's."" Its analysis continues: ""Despite losing 11 points in the constituency vote, this result would put the SNP just shy of a majority in Holyrood, mostly due to fragmentation in the other parties."" Remember, this is a snapshot, not a prediction. But it is fascinating nonetheless. The mood among SNP party members and senior figures at the conference was chipper and upbeat. The party feels competitive again and not only hopeful of victory next year, but even talking of that outright majority. Just winning again, with or without a majority, would be an extraordinary achievement. The party, if it does so, would he heading into its third consecutive decade in devolved power. A majority is a big ask, with an electoral system that makes securing one tricky. But it matters because the SNP's latest attempt to make an argument for another independence referendum rests on securing a majority. The party's logic goes like this: the last time they persuaded the government at Westminster to grant one, they had won a majority at Holyrood a few years before. That majority was won by Alex Salmond in 2011. The referendum followed in 2014. So, goes the current First Minister's logic, they need a majority again so they can point at that precedent from a decade and a half ago . PA Media Swinney is hoping to emulate the electoral success of Alex Salmond in 2011 The stumbling block is the UK government has made it clear, including in its manifesto, that it is opposed to another referendum. Privately, senior SNP folk ponder that if they do win a majority, and Labour lose power in the Senedd in Wales and do badly in local elections in many parts of England, Sir Keir Starmer might be out of Downing Street. There are a lot of ifs there and who knows. But even if Sir Keir was a goner, that manifesto would still be something Labour could point to. And the SNP would ask, again, just how voluntary the union of the United Kingdom really is if there is no achievable mechanism for another referendum. The SNP's critics point to what they see as a dismal domestic record, on the NHS, housing and the number of deaths among drug addicts, for instance. The party counters with its own riff on what it sees as its greatest hits – they had one for every stair between the ground and first floor of the conference centre. Free university tuition and free prescriptions are among them. But there is something else going on too. There is a near 50/50 split on the constitutional question in Scotland – independence or not. This is a nation split down the middle. This gives the SNP a deep well of potential support. It offers the opportunity to continue to defy what in other circumstances would likely be the undeniable gravity of longevity in office – plunging to defeat. Let's see. In local politics, politics in the nations and at the UK level, conventions continue to be upended in multiple directions. It is also true – and the SNP and its rivals know it – things can change quickly too.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4lz0789xo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/72bd/live/94e688c0-a87d-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-13T22:13:01.429000+00:00,cb49da7b82d3cbee7cb789b06cee96d31ec5b7cf
e7048e01a044,"Prostate cancer screening urgently needed, says Rishi Sunak",,"Former prime minister Rishi Sunak has stepped up his call for a targeted screening programme for prostate cancer. In a BBC interview he said he was ""convinced of the urgency "" of introducing such a programme which would be affordable, deliverable and ""save countless lives"". His comments come as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its decision from five years ago not to recommend routine screening. Media reports suggest it may stick with its current stance. Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy, who has advanced prostate cancer, wants younger men to be checked. He wants the age threshold for requesting a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test lowered. Currently, it is not routinely offered to men without symptoms who are under 50. The PSA test is controversial though. Levels can rise for reasons other than cancer, such as infections, leading to false positives. Critics say this can result in unnecessary treatment and side effects. Sunak is an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research , which is publishing a report on the costs and benefits of a targeted screening programme. It would focus on men aged 45–69 with a family history of prostate cancer and black men, who face double the risk. This group includes around 1.3 million men in the UK. The charity estimates the programme would cost £25 million a year - or about £18 per patient - similar to bowel and breast cancer screening. It assumes 20% of eligible men would be invited annually, with a 72% uptake rate. Diagnostic activity (scans and biopsies) would need to rise by 23%, with only a modest increase in NHS staffing, it says. The benefits of introducing targeted screening for those at the highest risk outweigh the financial and logistical costs, according to the report authors. Speaking to the BBC, Sunak said: ""I've had family and friends that have been impacted by it – thankfully not lost their lives – but that partly has made me aware of why its so important we catch it early – the doctors are so brilliant now at treating you if you catch it early."" He said men, including himself, were often shy of coming forward to discuss health issues: ""That's why a proactive targeted screening programme could make a difference in helping save lives."" The screening programme backed by the Prostate Cancer Research Charity would involve an MRI scan as well as the PSA test and then a biopsy. Asked whether he might have done more while in Downing Street to push the case for prostate cancer screening, Sunak said testing had now become more reliable: ""The thing that has changed is use of MRI scans so we can now much more effectively and safely target the people who most need our help - the moment is now – its deliverable and affordable"". But some medical experts are sceptical about the value of screening. They argue there is still a risk that patients will be treated for the cancer when it is not strictly necessary and will then have to live with side effects such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Professor Hashim Ahmed, Chair of Urology at Imperial College, says more research is needed to determine the potential value of screening. ""The problem is we can often find disease that doesn't need to be treated and we end up causing harm...and my concern at the moment is that harm to benefit equation isn't quite right."" The National Screening Committee will have to weigh up the evidence and arguments. While the new report by Prostate Cancer Research says the implications for staffing and availability of a screening programme would be manageable, others have argued that it would take scanning capacity away from patients being treated for other conditions. Patient voices are also shaping the debate. On a recent visit to a prostate cancer clinic at Guy's Hospital in London, Sunak met David Bateman who is 66. After asking for a PSA test he was diagnosed with the cancer at the age of 59 and was told it had spread to his pelvis. He has since been given chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment but cannot be cured. David supports screening for those who are potentially vulnerable. ""That is very important to me because of my sons – they are 38 and 40 – I want them checked as soon as possible. If I had been screened at 50 I am sure I wouldn't be in the position I am today,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykxqerk12o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c1f2/live/55ace660-a82b-11f0-9f09-57500e5dbf06.jpg,2025-10-14T05:01:05.278000+00:00,13d13d49fdc1a860faedf7be60a40d9a1d2b7c53
61fbcd929f1a,Man jailed for five years for Farage death threat,,"Man jailed for five years for Farage death threat PA Media Fayaz Khan made the threat in a video he uploaded to TikTok A man who came to the UK on a small boat and threatened to kill Nigel Farage has been jailed for five years. Fayaz Khan, 26, made a gun gesture with his hand, pointed to an AK-47 tattoo on his face and named the Reform UK leader in a TikTok post in October 2024. Authorities believed the Afghan migrant had given them a false name and he was actually a 31-year-old called Fayaz Husseini, Southwark Crown Court heard. Speaking outside court, Farage said it was a ""win"" that ""violent criminal"" Khan had been jailed. The defendant was found guilty on Friday of making threats to kill the MP for Clacton, in Essex. In the video on his ""madapasa"" account on TikTok, Khan pointed towards his face tattoo and said he was going to ""pop, pop, pop"" Farage, referring to him as ""Englishman Nigel"". PA Media Farage told the gathered media outside court that Khan was a ""violent criminal"" Farage described the threat as ""pretty chilling"" during the trial, adding: ""Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried."" ""The only reason we know about this guy is because somebody sent it to me on TikTok,"" he added after the sentencing. ""It makes me wonder how many other madapasas are there now in this country?"" It followed Khan shouting from the dock that he wanted to go back to Afghanistan, accusing Farage of using him ""because you want to be prime minister"". Khan was one of 65 migrants on board a black inflatable boat that entered the UK by crossing the English Channel. ""The defendant livestreamed the recording of his crossing, which appears to have gathered a large online viewing,"" said prosecutor Peter Ratliff. 'Enemies' The court heard Khan gave a false name because he had ""enemies he did not want to find him"". However, the prosecution said it was ""more likely"" he had given misleading details due to his criminal record while living in Sweden. Mr Ratliff also disputed Khan's claim that he was unaware it was illegal to arrive in the UK by small boat. He claimed Khan ""intended to encourage others"" by documenting his journey from Sweden to the UK, sharing it with hundreds of thousands of viewers online. Metropolitan Police Khan spent nine years living in Sweden before he came to the UK in October 2024 The court was told Khan had 17 previous convictions in Sweden, including for carrying a knife, threatening behaviour and vandalism. Khan was also jailed in June 2019 after using threatening behaviour towards a public servant. On 12 October 2024, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube entitled ""the journey of an illegal migrant"", which showed Khan and referenced ""young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little"". 'Gun gestures' Jurors in Khan's trial were told he responded with a TikTok video two days later, threatening Farage. In the video, he said: ""You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me. ""Don't talk about me more. Delete the video. ""I'm coming to England. I'm going to pop, pop, pop."" Mr Ratliff told the jury that while Khan said ""pop, pop, pop"", he made ""gun gestures"" with his hand and headbutted the camera. During sentencing, Khan's barrister said the defendant wanted to apologise to Farage and his sister ""for any offence and upset caused"". He was also sentenced to eight months - to run concurrently - for entering the UK illegally, having previously pleaded guilty to the offence. Nicholas Coates, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Khan not only entered the UK illegally – but made sinister threats against a Member of Parliament in plain view of thousands of followers. ""Elected politicians must be able to carry out their jobs free from the fear of harm or abuse, and we will make sure that those who seek to intimidate them face the full force of the law.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj97lkmd23po,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6e95/live/492128e0-a8f1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-14T11:48:10.836000+00:00,71d7cc125384cae800260abb6742e5e1f674621d
f32c9d710110,"Recognising Palestinian state helped get ceasefire, PM says",,"Recognising Palestinian state helped get ceasefire, PM says Brian Wheeler Political reporter Reuters The UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood helped to bring about the ceasefire deal in Gaza, Sir Keir Starmer has told MPs. Speaking after a summit in Egypt, the PM stressed that the agreement signed there belonged to US President Donald Trump, telling MPs: ""This is his deal."" But he said the UK had been in a position to work ""behind the scenes"" for a ceasefire ""precisely because of the approach this government takes,"" including its recognition of a Palestinian state. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said recognising Palestine without setting a condition for the release of hostages was ""rewarding terrorism"" and accused the PM of ""diminishing"" UK influence in the Middle East. Sir Keir told MPs that Monday's deal provided ""a moment of profound relief"" as he paid tribute to both the hostages and the civilians killed in Gaza. But he also stressed that ""making that peace last will be no less difficult a task"" and that implementing the peace plan ""is no small challenge"". Negotiations will now follow on phase two of the deal, which involves Hamas laying down its weapons - a possibility the group is reported to have dismissed - and the rebuilding of Gaza under a ""peace board"" chaired by Trump and potentially including former prime minister Sir Tony Blair. Sir Keir said the UK stood ready to deploy its diplomacy and expertise to support the reconstruction of Gaza - the devastation of which he says ""defies description"". The UK will provide an additional £20m in humanitarian aid to provide ""water, sanitation and hygiene products"" to people in the territory, he added. There are no plans to send British troops to be part of the multinational force that will monitor the truce, but the prime minister said the UK would help with the ceasefire monitoring process. And he said the UK could draw on its experience in Northern Ireland to ""play a full role"" in the decommissioning of Hamas's weapons and capability. The prime minster told MPs the deal represented the ""first real chance we've had"" of a two-state solution since the 1993 Oslo Accords , which were meant to provide interim self-government for Palestine as a stepping stone to an independent state. ""So we are fully committed to this [deal] because a safe and secure Israel, alongside a viable Palestinian state, is the only way to secure lasting peace for the Middle East,"" he told MPs. The PM also claimed that the UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood had aided the cause of peace. He told MPs: ""This move, taken alongside our allies France, Canada, Australia and others, helped lead to the historic New York declaration, where for the first time the entire Arab League condemned the atrocities of October 7, urged Hamas to disarm and, crucially, demanded that they end their rule in Gaza."" Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of ""taking the wrong decisions time and time again, diminishing our influence in"" the Middle East. ""It's quite clear that UK relations with Israel have been strained by the actions of this government,"" she told MPs, to cries of ""shame"" from the Labour benches. The Conservative leader added: ""In a move praised by Hamas, Labour decided to recognise a state of Palestine with no condition to release the hostages still held in the tunnels of Gaza, rewarding terrorism."" At the time, the US voiced strong opposition to the UK and other countries recognising Palestinian statehood, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Hamas would ""feel more emboldened"" by the move. Under Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan , Gaza would initially be governed by a temporary transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a ""Board of Peace"". Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority - which administers the West Bank - once it has undergone reforms. According to the plan, Hamas - which seized control of Gaza in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections - would play no future role in its governance, directly or indirectly. The ceasefire deal says Hamas should release all the 48 Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza after two years of war. All but one were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ex18xx9xeo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2ea3/live/292a26f0-a90e-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg,2025-10-14T15:07:41.027000+00:00,6a88a9d784614841a0b9de82e8cae5ba83e3fd52
988f35a012f9,European rights body urges UK ministers to review protest laws,,"European rights body urges UK ministers to review protest laws Kate Whannel political reporter and Georgia Roberts political correspondent Getty Images Europe's human rights watchdog has raised concerns about the policing of protests in the UK following arrests over the ban on Palestine Action, and called for broader protest laws to be reviewed. In a letter to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O'Flaherty said law changes had allowed authorities to ""impose excessive limits on freedom of assembly"". Responding in a statement, Mahmood said the right to protest was ""a fundamental freedom"" but had to be balanced with the right of people to live ""without fear"". O'Flaherty also wrote to two chairs of parliamentary committees expressing ""concern about the current climate for trans people in the UK"". As commissioner, Mr O'Flaherty is tasked with identifying potential shortcomings in human rights law in countries that are signed up to the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, including the UK. The Conservative Party recently announced it would leave the convention if it wins the next general election, while the Labour government has said it is reviewing how it is applied in UK law in relation to asylum cases. It is understood the home secretary plans to respond to Mr O'Flaherty's letter, which was sent last month and published by the commissioner on Tuesday . A government source said Mahmood took a ""dim view of the arguments"" and ""fundamentally disagrees with the assessment"". ""It doesn't help sustain public confidence in the European Convention when the council is seen to intervene in domestic politics and national security in this way."" Allies of Mahmood also said that she considers the Supreme Court's judgement on the issue of trans rights to be ""beyond reproach"". In his letter to Mahmood, sent following a five-day visit to the UK over the summer,  O'Flaherty said two laws passed under the previous government - the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023 - raised questions under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Public Order Act was in part passed to counter environmental groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, which deployed tactics aimed at causing disruption such as gluing themselves to roads. Mr O'Flaherty said the laws ""allow authorities to impose excessive limits on freedom of assembly and expression, and risk over-policing"". He recommended that ""a comprehensive review of the compliance of the current legislation on the policing of protests with the United Kingdom's human rights obligations be undertaken"". He also expressed concern about measures in Labour's Crime and Policing Bill - which is currently being debated in Parliament - that would ban protesters from wearing face coverings in particular locations. He said such a ban should not be enforced unless there was ""evidence of imminent violence"". The bill would also put restrictions on gatherings ""in the vicinity of a place of worship"" - a move the government has said is in response to a series of ""intimidating protests"" near synagogues and mosques. O'Flaherty argued that the term ""vicinity"" was ""undefined"" and could make it ""impossible in practice to organise protests in large cities or towns"" and urged ministers to reconsider the measure. The government has recently announced other changes including allowing police officers to instruct protest organisers to hold events in a different place, if a site has been the location of repeated demonstrations. It has also said it could consider further restrictions , including targeting some chants used at pro-Palestinian protests. Defend Our Juries, a group campaigning against the government's decision to ban Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation, has accused ministers of pursuing an ""anti-democratic agenda"". Hundreds of people have been arrested at protests against the ban, where some people have held up placards reading: ""I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action."" Noting the large number of arrests, O'Flaherty said domestic laws ""designed to counter 'terrorism' or 'violent extremism' must not impose any limitations on fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, that are not strictly necessary for the protection of national security and the rights and freedoms of others"". In a statement, Mahmood defended the government's approach saying: ""Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes. ""This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community, which has been expressed to me on many occasions in these recent difficult days."" Separately, O'Flaherty has written to the Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee Sarah Owen and Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights Lord Alton to warn against creating legal uncertainty for transgender people as the UK government implements a Supreme Court judgement made earlier this year. In April, the court unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Following the judgement, Britain's equalities watchdog issued new guidance which says that in places such as hospitals, shops and restaurants ""trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities"". The guidance has been submitted to Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson and is awaiting UK government approval. O'Flaherty said the European Convention of Human Rights ""guarantees the right of trans people to personal development and to physical and moral security"". He argued that in the process of implementing new guidance, the government should ""avoid a situation where a person's legal gender recognition is voided of practical meaning, to the extent that it leaves trans people in an unacceptable 'intermediate zone'"". He said the new guidance should be clear on ""how inclusion of trans people can be achieved across all areas, and how exclusion can be minimised to situations in which this would be strictly necessary and proportionate"". Asked about the letter, Downing Street said: ""We are clear that there are laws in place to protect trans people from discrimination and harassment, and we proudly uphold a robust legislative framework. ""But we have never supported self-ID and we have a process in place when it comes to someone changing their legal sex.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pl4pzg87o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/88d3/live/7c2f1e10-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg,2025-10-14T17:06:13.219000+00:00,01ca97f5049d37fecd3453b151fda2d69c8d1bd7
aa2f6e811702,Peer faces Lords ban for raising speeding fines with police chief,,"Former House of Lords Speaker Baroness D'Souza faces an eight-week suspension after complaining to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner about ""unfair"" speeding fines. A Lords inquiry found the 81-year-old peer broke rules on ""personal honour"" by writing to Sir Mark Rowley on Lords headed notepaper to query multiple breaches of the 20mph limit adding up to £400 in fines. Baroness D'Souza said she only wanted to ""open a conversation"" on London speed limits, but later called the letter to Sir Mark ""unwise"" and said she regretted sending it. The Lords Standards Commissioner ruled the letter was ""an attempt to influence"" the police investigation. In his report , Commissioner for Standards Martin Jelley said Baroness D'Souza's actions ""may harm the House by eroding public trust in parliamentarians and in institutions which exist to serve the public interest"". In the letter, Baroness D'Souza complained the offences would result in 12 points on her driving licence and losing her driving licence, which she said might mean she would have to ""give up attending Parliament"". ""I live deep in the countryside with no local bus services and unsuitable train schedules,"" she added. The peer had asked Sir Mark if losing her licence was ""a fair response for exceeding the speed limit while we are all still learning what a 20-mile speed actually feels like?"" ""Who can say if my speedometer or your radar is entirely accurate in recording 21 miles instead of 20,"" she added in her letter, which was sent on House of Lords headed paper. Baroness D'Souza,  a crossbench peer who does not belong to a party, was eventually disqualified from driving temporarily on 16 July. She has only spoken in the House of Lords once since then and, voted twice. In the letter, she acknowledged that Sir Mark, the UK's most senior police officer who also leads on Britain's counter-terrorism efforts, had ""much other business to deal with"". ""I apologise for bothering your office with such a trivial matter,"" she added. The Met Police passed the letter to the House of Lords' commissioner for standards who recommended an eight-week suspension, citing the aggravating factor that the intervention was for personal benefit. Baroness D'Souza,  who was the Lords' speaker between 2011 and 2016, denied she had been attempting to influence the police investigation, but instead find ""any mitigating factors"" that might keep any driving ban to a minimum. She told investigators she used Lords stationery because she had previously met Sir Mark ""in the context"" of her parliamentary role. Baroness D'Souza accepted that her letter to the Met Police chief was ""inappropriate"" and said she ""deeply regretted"" the decision to send it. She appealed against the proposed eight-week Lords ban, claiming it was ""unduly severe"" compared with shorter suspensions for bullying or misuse of facilities. Her appeal was rejected by the committee. The report will now go before the House for approval. If agreed, the suspension will take effect immediately. Baroness D'Souza was previously criticised for billing taxpayers thousands of pounds in expenses for chauffeur-driven cars. This includes a keeping chauffeur-driven Mercedes waiting outside the Royal Opera House - just a mile from parliament - for four hours, before returning to the Lords at a cost of £230.40. She also used a Mercedes to get from Westminster to Canterbury for the enthronement of Archbishop Justin Welby in March 2013 cost £627, freedom of information results found.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4558r5gko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fe10/live/beb55400-a914-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg,2025-10-14T16:20:31.632000+00:00,870ae51bafa0c80c74214dd0ad48cf3e2feb264b
e028c69e8cbb,Miliband defends clean power goal after energy bills rise,,"Miliband defends clean power goal after energy bills rise Joshua Nevett Political reporter PA Media Ed Miliband has said the government's drive to deliver clean power is ""the best way"" to bring down energy costs, amid calls from opposition parties to scrap green levies. The energy secretary told an industry conference the UK's dependence on fossil fuels was its ""Achilles heel"" and argued clean power was the only way to reduce bills. The UK government is aiming for clean power to meet 95% of electricity demand by 2030, and Miliband has pledged to lower average bills by £300 by that date. But bills went up by 2% for millions of people in England, Wales and Scotland under energy regulator Ofgem's latest price cap this month. The cost of household energy bills has become a prominent political battleground, with the Conservatives and Reform UK blaming net-zero policies for higher prices. The UK government is under a legal obligation to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, after a law change passed in 2019 with cross-party support. However, political consensus on the goal has since broken down, with the Conservatives announcing last week they would axe the legally-binding target, end subsidies for renewables and ditch taxes on carbon emissions. Reform UK, which won its first Commons seats at last year's election, has pledged to scrap net zero and ""wage war"" on renewables developers if it wins power. There was a rapid spike in energy prices in 2021, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and although costs have gone down, they have remained high by historical standards. Energy experts say higher costs have primarily been driven by the UK's reliance on gas and its exposure to its volatile prices on international markets. But there are costs to renewables too, including green levies to fund the rollout of renewables and upgrades to the electricity grid. Ofgem said higher bills this winter were the result of extra funding for means-tested discounts off energy bills, and system costs, including switching generators such as windfarms on and off. The Conservatives and Reform UK have honed in on the cost of energy in the UK as their main justification for scrapping net zero, and argue Miliband's pledge of lowering bills by £300 won't be realised. But in his speech to a conference organised by Energy UK, an industry group, Miliband insisted renewable power was cheaper than gas. ""Dependency on global fossil fuel markets is this country's energy Achilles heel,"" Miliband told delegates. ""Some people want to double down on this weakness - this government disagrees. ""We believe that the sprint for clean power is the best way to reliably bring down bills for good and give us energy abundance."" On Monday, the UK government announced the approval of a large solar farm in Lincolnshire that would be able to provide enough clean energy to power about 7.5 million homes. Heated debate But at the Energy UK conference, industry bosses urged the UK government to take urgent action to reduce the costs of electricity for households and businesses. Dhara Vyas, Energy UK's CEO, said electricity costs had been high for too long and ""customers cannot be expected to shrug off persistently high bills because of benefits some years away"". ""The widespread concern about bills is of course closely linked with public perception and the discussion about how we fairly pay for the cost of the transition,"" Ms Vyvas said. She said taking action to reduce energy bills should be top of the government's to-do list ahead of the upcoming autumn Budget. Ministers are considering removing policy costs from energy bills to make electricity cheaper. Policy costs are effectively government taxes used to fund environmental and social schemes, such as subsidies for renewables. These costs made up about 16% of an electricity bill and 6% of a gas bill last year, according to research by the charity Nesta. The Climate Change Committee has long recommended removing policy costs from electricity bills to help people feel the benefits of net-zero transition. One option - backed by Energy UK - is shifting policy costs from electricity bills to gas. 'Take on myths' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and Conservative shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho also gave speeches at the Energy UK conference in London. The Liberal Democrats have set out a plan to increase investment in clean energy and change how new renewable projects are paid for. They say their plan could halve energy bills by 2035. In his speech, Sir Ed contrasted his party's proposals with those of Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, claiming he was inspired by US President Donald Trump and would ""put up bills, destroy jobs and hurt the economy, while climate change rages on"". ""So now the cross-party consensus on investing in renewables has been shattered,"" Sir Ed said. ""And it would be incredibly complacent and dangerous to assume it will just put itself back together on its own."" Sir Ed said supporters of renewable energy ""either take on the myths or we fail families for at least a decade"". In her speech, Coutinho said the UK had among the highest electricity costs in the world. She said given carbon emissions were still rising globally, ""many would agree our approach to climate change isn't working in the way it's supposed to"". Coutinho, a former energy secretary, said the UK government needed to be more ""clear-eyed and honest with the public"" about the cost of renewables, once subsidies, grid investments and other factors had been taken into account. ""So if the argument is renewables are cheap, let's look at the full costs and examine that and present those facts to the public,"" Coutinho said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzn1vx701o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/280a/live/19851000-a91a-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg,2025-10-14T16:47:50.963000+00:00,f12fd0ab7ce6354ed7ab5dec1ea9d94e29395837
ae74e0f53a3f,"UK will be second-fastest-growing G7 economy, IMF predicts",,"UK will be second-fastest-growing G7 economy, IMF predicts Faisal Islam BBC Economics Editor Getty Images Chancellor Rachel Reeves said, despite the IMF's upgrade to UK economic growth, ""for too many people, our economy feels stuck"" The UK is set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year, according to new projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the IMF also predicts the UK will face the highest rate of inflation in the G7 both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills. Prices are forecast to rise by 3.4% this year and 2.5% in 2026, but the IMF says higher inflation is likely to be temporary, and should fall to 2% by the end of next year. UK economic growth rates remain modest at 1.3% for this year and next, but that outperforms the other G7 economies apart from the US in 2025, in a torrid year of trade and geopolitical tensions. The G7 are seven advanced economies - the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan - but the group does not include fast-growing economies such as China and India. The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They work together to maintain global economic stability. In the IMF's forecast for economic growth , it predicts the UK will push Canada out of second place, after its trade-war-affected economy was hit by the biggest downgrades for 2025 and 2026. However, Canada is expected to retake second place next year when its economy is forecast to grow at a rate of 1.5%. Germany, France and Italy are all forecast to grow far more slowly at rates of between 0.2 and 0.9% in 2025 and 2026. Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the fresh upgrade to the IMF's outlook for the UK's economy. ""But know this is just the start. For too many people, our economy feels stuck,"" she said. ""Working people feel it every day, experts talk about it, and I am going to deal with it."" But highlighting the inflation forecasts, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said the IMF assessment made for ""grim reading"". He said that UK households were ""being squeezed from all sides"", adding: ""Since taking office, Labour have allowed the cost of living to rise, debt to balloon and business confidence to collapse to record lows."" The IMF said a slight overall upgrade for the UK in its World Economic Outlook, from its previous outlook in April, was due to ""strong activity in the first half of 2025"" and an improved trade outlook, partly thanks to the recently announced US-UK trade deal. Trump tariffs loom large The global outlook is dominated by the so far ""muted response"" of the world economy to the imposition of hefty tariffs on almost all imports into the US, a weakened dollar, questions about the independence of the US Federal Reserve and sky-high valuations of US tech companies. The IMF expects some of this to unwind soon, saying ""resilience is giving way to warning signs"". In the US tariff costs which had been absorbed by exporters and retailers, are now feeding into higher goods prices. So far tariffs have been reflected in higher prices for American shoppers of household appliances, but not of food and clothing. In an interview with the BBC, the IMF's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the worst consequences of a global trade war had been tempered. ""Bottom line: the effect of the tariff shock is there. It is negative for global outlook. It is weighing down on investment and consumption decisions, there is trade policy uncertainty… but it's not as bad as expected because the shock itself has been scaled down and there are these offsets"". The IMF cited Brexit as an example of how uncertainty around major changes in trading arrangements can, after a delay, lead to steady falls in investment. Economist tells the BBC's Michelle Fleury he sees ""lower growth"" and ""higher inflation"" for US AI warning The IMF also pointed to a possible bursting of the US AI tech boom. ""Excessively optimistic growth expectations about AI could be revised in light of incoming data from early adopters and could trigger a market correction,"" the IMF said. The IMF's separate Global Financial Stability Report added to concerns about tech stock market valuations, concluding that ""markets appear complacent"". Mr Gourinchas said the IMF was not asserting that there would be an imminent bursting of a bubble. ""Whether this will be followed by a market correction, I don't think anyone can tell for sure, but we have to be looking out for potential risk, and certainly this is one of the risks,"" he said. The concentration of the overvaluation of tech stocks on a small number of companies was now ""substantially higher"" than at the dotcom bubble in 2020, the IMF said. However, Mr Gourinchas said the ""AI investment boom"" was also helping sustain US economic growth. The forecasts were released on the eve of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank attended by the world's finance ministers and central bankers in Washington DC, with considerable attention on a new US bailout for Argentina.

Hundreds took part in the 5 km (3.1 mile) race in Victoria Park on Sunday, according to East London Mosque (ELM), which organised the event. It was advertised as ""inclusive"", but it was only open to men, boys, and girls under 12. MP Steve Reed said blocking women was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) would investigate. The ELM has not directly addressed the criticism but said it had a ""long-standing commitment to supporting women and girls"" and encourages women to take part in various sporting activities. The annual event is described on the mosque's website as having become a ""highlight in the East London Muslim calendar"", raising thousands of pounds for causes across the UK and abroad, including local youth projects, food banks and refugee support. When asked about women being barred from the race on LBC Radio, Reed said: ""I saw these reports... and I was as horrified as anybody else. ""It's absolutely unacceptable that women should be blocked from going on a fun run in a public space when the men are allowed to go out there and do that. 'We cannot tolerate that' He said he was sure the equalities watchdog would be aware of the case and appropriate sanctions would follow. He added: ""Speaking for myself, I was appalled. ""We do not want a situation in this country where men are allowed to do things that women are then barred from. We cannot tolerate that."" The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, is quoted on the website congratulating all those who took part , ""especially to the youngsters and the elders and the community at large for participating today"". The council said it had contacted the mosque to ""seek urgent clarification"" after reports about age and gender restrictions. Reuters Steve Reed said it was ""absolutely unacceptable"" for women to be barred from the event An EHRC spokesperson said each complaint was considered carefully and that there are certain exceptions under equality law that can apply to charities and belief organisations, including potentially restricting events to one sex only. A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: ""This was an independent event held in Victoria Park, not organised by the council. ""Like many local charitable events, it made use of the park space. We are firmly committed to ensuring leisure and sporting activities in Tower Hamlets are inclusive and accessible."" Last weekend's event was the mosque's 12th annual charity run. A spokesperson for the mosque said: ""ELM encourages women to take part in sporting activities.

ce52c3819bdf,"Boris Johnson 'chose NHS over children', ex-minister tells Covid inquiry",,"Boris Johnson 'chose NHS over children', ex-minister tells Covid inquiry Vanessa Clarke Education reporter Getty Images Gavin Williamson's evidence to the Covid inquiry highlighted a number of disagreements with then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson Former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson accused ministers of ""not putting children first"" when making the ""unnecessary"" decision to close schools in January 2021, the Covid inquiry has heard. He said one argument made in favour of closing schools at the time was that it was ""like smashing a Ming vase on the floor to get people's attention"", which he said pointed to a ""lack of seriousness"" in government. He said then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson ""chose the NHS over children"" at the time, adding that he believed ""the consequences for children weren't properly taken into account"". This part of the inquiry is looking at how the pandemic impacted children and young people. Williamson told the inquiry on Tuesday he had thought he had ""won the argument"" around children going back to school in January 2021, ""but events overtook"". The inquiry was shown an expletive-laden text Williamson sent to the then-prime minister that February, in which he said he had taken ""abuse"" for the government's decision to shut schools one day after they reopened. It was one of several disagreements with the prime minister which were highlighted in Tuesday's evidence. He also accused Johnson of giving parents ""a false sense of hope"" when he announced a phased return to school in May 2020. He said this promise was ""destined to fail"" because of social distancing rules at the time. ""There was no physical way we could do it [reopen schools] without asking every school to basically break the law,"" Williamson said. Getty Images Schools were closed on 5 January 2021, one day after they reopened Elsewhere, the former education secretary said he regretted the lack of planning that went into school closures at the start of the pandemic. ""I readily accept that there were many mistakes that were made,"" he said. He apologised to the inquiry for failing to pay more attention to scientific evidence published in February, which suggested school closures could delay or reduce the peak of the pandemic. The government should have ""bitten the bullet"" and made a plan for school closures, he said, adding that he had made an error by ""sticking with the plan"" to keep schools open, as that was the focus of the government in March 2020. It was only overnight on 17 March 2020 that a plan was put together to close schools, before an announcement was made the next day. ""I regret that and wish we had very much done it differently,"" Williamson told the inquiry. ""But we were at the time acting in what we believed was the best interest and under the best guidance."" He also said it probably would not have been ""allowed"" to start preparing for the closure of schools without approval from Downing Street. ""Something like Covid is being directed from the centre, in terms of different departments' responses,"" he said. ""You don't have quite the freedom just to go and start going out and consulting with lots of people."" Over the last two weeks, the inquiry has heard from various head teachers who said they started making their own plans for school closures weeks before any announcement was made. Lyndon Lewis, a head teacher in Wales, said he and three of his staff met an IT expert at a service station on the M4 to find out how to use Google Classrooms. Sir Jon Coles, from United Learning, who has previously worked at the Department for Education, told the inquiry he started planning for school closures a week before the announcement for the more than 50,000 children in his trust. He said he ""fell off his chair"" when he heard Williamson's submitted written evidence which said the government had no plan in place. On Tuesday, Williamson rejected Sir Jon's accusation that the lack of planning represented a ""dereliction of duty"", but conceded that ""the depth of the challenge we were facing hadn't been properly grasped"". ""I readily accept I am secretary of state and it was my responsibility,"" Williamson said on Tuesday. Getty Images Gavin Williamson was the education secretary in 2020 and 2021 when exams were cancelled due to the pandemic Tuesday's evidence also touched on the exams debacle of August 2020, in which the government had to U-turn on its model for awarding grades after exams were cancelled earlier that summer. Williamson admitted he knew ahead of time that ""there were some students who wouldn't get the grades they would deserve"". That was ""not the right approach"", Williamson told the inquiry. Students were ultimately awarded teacher-assessed grades, which led to a boom in top marks. But Williamson said Ofqual, the exams regulator, was responsible for some of the fiasco, saying that if he had pushed them to use teacher-assessed grades in the first place, they would have ""resigned"".

fad7a9b8ad7e,Migrants will need A-level standard English to work in UK,,"Migrants will need A-level standard English to work in UK Reuters Some migrants coming to the UK will need to speak English to an A-level standard under tougher new rules set to be introduced by the government. The changes, which will come into force from 8 January 2026, will affect those applying for skilled worker or scale-up visas, which are for people employed by fast-growing businesses. The new rules  form part of wider plans to cut levels of immigration to the UK outlined in a white paper in May. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: ""If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part."" ""This country has always welcomed those who come to this country and contribute,"" Mahmood said. ""But it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life."" Applicants will be tested in person on their speaking, listening, reading and writing at Home Office-approved providers, with their results checked as part of the visa process. Those applying for skilled worker, scale-up and high potential individual (HPI) visas will be required to reach B2 level - a step up from the current B1 standard which is equivalent to GCSE. To come to the UK on the skilled worker visa, migrants have to work for a government-approved employer and earn at least £41,700 a year, or the ""going rate"" for their type of work, whichever is highest. The scale-up visa is open to migrants coming to work for a fast-growing UK business. Migrants can apply for a high potential individual visa if they have been awarded a qualification from a top global university within the last five years. According to the British Council, which offers English language courses, learners who achieve B2 level can ""understand the main ideas of complex texts on concrete or abstract topics."" They can express themselves ""fluently and spontaneously"" and communicate comfortably with other English speakers. They can also produce ""clear, detailed text on many subjects and explain a complex viewpoint"". Further English language requirements for other visa routes and family dependants are expected to be introduced in due course, Home Office Minister Mike Tapp told Parliament on Tuesday. The prime minister previously said the changes outlined in the white paper would make the UK's immigration system ""controlled, selective and fair"". Home Office estimates suggest the measures could reduce the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year. Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - fell to 431,000 in 2024, down almost 50% on the total in 2023, when it reached a record high of 906,000. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the government faced a ""trade-off"" between ""ensuring migrants speak good English and enabling employers to recruit workers who are expected to bring economic benefits."" Many graduate jobs already require language skills above A-level standard, she said. The new language requirements will have ""more impact in middle-skilled jobs involving technical and manual skills, where employers sometimes do not require high language proficiency"". Immigration lawyer Afsana Akhtar told BBC News she thought it was ""unfair"" that migrants had to reach such a high standard of English ""because even many people in the UK probably wouldn't be able to pass English A-level"". ""This would rule out even skilled workers who want to come and contribute to our British economy,"" she said. ""The GCSE standard is sufficient - and then when they come live here, [and] integrate into England and the English way of life, their English will improve inevitably."" Other measures in the white paper include cutting the time period international students can stay in the UK to find a graduate job after their course ends from two years to 18 months, which will take effect from January 2027. Students will also have to meet higher financial requirements, raised to £1,171 per month outside London (from £1,136) for up to nine months. The Global Talent visa, for high achievers in technology, arts and academia fields has also been expanded to include winners of more prestigious prizes. Further plans in the White Paper include, the immigration skills charge for UK employers to pay when sponsoring foreign workers on specific visas has also been  increased to £480 per person per year for small organisations or charities, and to £1,320 for medium and large organisations. This is raised from £364 and £1,000 respectively. As part of the government's efforts to attract highly skilled people to the country, the HPI route will be expanded. The number of migrants on the visa is expected to double from 2,000 to 4,000, but there will be a cap of 8,000 applications each year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8679q0pe57o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0fde/live/5730d520-a919-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-14T18:10:29.122000+00:00,6f20a35d4b16db077a934835d69a60745a761ad7

It follows another public intervention from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which has made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put their evidence in the public domain. On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them to do so would be ""inappropriate"". Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. Both men deny the allegations. The director of public prosecutions said the case collapsed because evidence could not obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. This row within a row relates to the three witness statements submitted by Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins, on whether China had been regarded as a threat at the time of the alleged offences under the previous Conservative government. The CPS has now said: ""The statements were provided to us for the purpose of criminal proceedings which are now over. ""The material contained in them is not ours, and it is a matter for the government, independently of the CPS, to consider whether or not to make that material public."" Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp told the BBC: ""The government should now urgently release Matt Collins's witness statements and the correspondence around them in the interests of full transparency. ""Since this evidence would have been cross-examined in court, it cannot be secret. ""Otherwise, there will be legitimate questions about what exactly the government is hiding."" Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Calum Miller also called on Labour to release the full witness statements. ""If ministers have nothing to hide they have nothing to fear,"" Miller said. ""Failure to come clean will just confirm people's suspicions of a cover-up and that ministers are more worried about cosying up to China than protecting our national security."" On Sunday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch wrote to the prime minister asking him to address ""unanswered"" questions about the collapsed case. In her letter , Badenoch accused Sir Keir Starmer, or his ministers, of being ""too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security"", claiming the government had sought to ""appease China"". Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, visited China earlier this year There is every possibility Sir Keir will for the first time face sustained public scrutiny on the case on Wednesday, when he appears at the first Prime Minister's Question time for several weeks, after the parliamentary recess for party conferences. The Labour leader previously said ministers could only draw on the last government's assessment of China, in which the country was called an ""epoch-defining challenge"", and his government has maintained it is ""frustrated"" the trial collapsed. The Tories have asked the CPS if it would be able to restart prosecutions against the two men, if new evidence is brought forward by the government declaring China a threat to national security. But there is an exceptionally high bar to prosecuting someone for a second time after an acquittal in court - and it is not possible to do so for people charged under the Official Secrets Act. That protection against what is known as ""double jeopardy"" is a basic legal principle that has existed for 800 years.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql9v6x4wpzo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a266/live/5582c670-a95a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-15T02:00:00.699000+00:00,e3c0606a97d0f53ed36929b4b5a80c4dffdf12c3

Wednesday marks four years to the day since Sir David, the Conservative MP for Southend West, was stabbed to death while holding a surgery in Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Sir David's daughter, Katie Amess, who wants a public inquiry into his death, told the BBC: ""We went back to Keir Starmer and he's just ignored us ever since, despite promising us that he would meet with us again if we weren't happy.""

""This was a murder that struck at the heart of our democracy,"" Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said. The Anderson Review into the government's de-radicalisation programme, known as Prevent, found this summer that ""in the case of Ali Harbi Ali, there was a string of failures"". Lord Anderson said this was down largely to ""human error"". PA Media Katie Amess (centre), who met the prime minister in Downing Street in March, wants to meet with the government again The Amess family lawyers wrote to the home secretary, who was Yvette Cooper but is now Shabana Mahmood, in July outlining specific questions: Were any checks made with the school before exiting Harbi Ali from Prevent? What did the security services know in the five years between Prevent and Sir David's murder? What social media checks were carried out? To access documentation and interview the individuals who dealt with Harbi Ali a decade ago To find out why Harbi Ali was assessed to be dropped from Prevent and who made that decision. They are now calling for a full public inquiry. ""There's grief, there's trauma, and there's also anger as to why nobody is helping us get these answers,"" Ms Amess said.

He added: ""It would be speculative to assume that national security services do, should or could, detect and track every Islamic State sympathiser."" In July 2024, Mr Brookes turned down their request to reopen the hearing. He concluded: ""The fact that the perpetrator's case was not handled as well as it should have been in Prevent does not of itself amount to any evidence that Sir David's death was possibly or probably preventable five years later had his case been handled better.

""We very much hope this will help the family to get the answers they deserve."" The government has indicated ""a senior figure"" will be appointed to look at the reviews.

The Tillbridge Solar project, which would cover around 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares),   is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, meaning the decision to allow the plan is determined by the government. The applicants said the scheme - close to the village of Glentworth and south of the A631 between Gainsborough and Caenby Corner - would be able to power about 300,000 homes, making it larger than any currently built. Opponents have said it would ""industrialise the countryside"". Tillbridge Solar The farm would be located near the village of Glentworth, south of the A631 A letter outlining the decision said the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband had concluded the benefits of the proposed development outweighed any potential adverse impacts. The decision marks the 17th nationally-significant clean energy project approved by the government since July 2024. Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: ""Families across Lincolnshire and the rest of the country have seen their energy bills go through the roof as a result of our exposure to volatile gas prices. ""Solar is one of the cheapest and quickest power sources we can build, it is crucial in our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower – giving us energy security, good jobs and growth across the country."" 'Thin end of the wedge' In 2024, the government approved two other major farms in Lincolnshire – Gate Burton in West Lindsey and Mallard Pass in South Kesteven. In an impact report , West Lindsey, the local authority for the Tillbridge project, highlighted ""significant concerns"" regarding the cumulative impact of the scheme. Councillor Tom Ashton, portfolio holder for planning at the neighbouring East Lindsey authority, previously described the project as ""the thin end of the wedge of climate madness"" and said: ""Its scale and mass beggars belief."" Officials in Lincolnshire have also complained that developments have been unfairly concentrated in the county, with one complaining it was becoming a dumping ground for green energy projects which benefit other parts of the country. Local resident Lorraine Broadbent said she was disappointed by the decision Glentworth resident Lorraine Broadbent said she was frustrated by the decision, knowing ""there is nothing we can do about it. ""It will completely change our lives because we love the peace and quiet,"" she added. Alexandra Carter, who moved to the village about a year ago, questioned whether there would be any benefits for local people. She said she was also worried about the impact on the rural landscape. ""I'm not against solar - I think it's a good thing - but it's when it overtakes everything I think it's a problem."" Jacqueline Martin said she was concerned about the ""destruction"" of the countryside and the impact on the peace and quiet of the village.

In an interview with BBC Radio Lincolnshire, Sir Edward said solar was the least efficient source of energy.

Meanwhile, Greenpeace UK's senior climate campaigner, Paul Morozzo, welcomed the news, but said the government also needed to end ""the rigged system"" that enables the price of gas to dictate electricity prices.

a2cd45d6754b,Reeves acknowledges she is looking at tax rises ahead of Budget,,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has acknowledged she is ""looking at tax and spending"", ahead of her autumn Budget next month. Reeves said she would ""always make sure the numbers add up"", in an interview with Sky news against a backdrop of slow economic growth and mounting government debt. The chancellor has previously hinted at tax rises, and economists have said they expect taxes to go up in the Budget if the chancellor wants to meet her self-imposed rules on borrowing. With this comment, the chancellor has also signalled that spending cuts could be a consideration. The Budget in November is the moment when the chancellor outlines the UK government's plans for the economy. Reeves has faced repeated questions about the prospect of tax rises in her Budget. Some analysts have estimated that the chancellor will have to increase taxes or cut spending to fill a hole in the public finances, estimated to be £20bn-£30bn. Reeves received the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) assessment of the economy on 3 October. Now the chancellor's brief comments make more explicit what has been assumed across Westminster for many months – that tax rises in the Budget are inevitable. It is likely that in the weeks before the Budget, as Reeves learns more about how much money she needs to raise and makes decisions about how to do it, she and other ministers will become more explicit still about the direction of travel. Speaking to the BBC, Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said he wouldn't speculate on what might be in the Budget. ""The chancellor makes all her decisions on Budget day on 26 November and sets out her package there,"" Murray said. ""Yes, a budget focuses on tax and spend and we'll set out how we're keeping a tight grip on public spending."" The additional suggestion of spending cuts by Reeves is intriguing - many Labour MPs believe that spending cuts in most areas would be politically unviable after the failed attempts at welfare cuts earlier this year, although the government could promise to cut spending in four or five years. Reeves told Sky News the effects of Brexit, austerity policies and former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget had damaged the UK economy. Sky News reported that when asked how she would deal with the country's economic challenges, Reeves said: ""Now, of course, we are undoing some of that damage by the deal that we did with the EU earlier this year on food and farming, goods moving between us and the continent, on energy and electricity trading, on an ambitious youth mobility scheme, but there is no doubting that the impact of Brexit is severe and long-lasting."" In her speech to Labour conference last month, Reeves said the government was facing difficult choices and promised she would not take risks with the public finances . The chancellor pledged to keep ""taxes, inflation and interest rates as low as possible"". Labour promised in its 2024 manifesto ahead of last year's general election not to increase taxes on ""working people"", saying the party would not ""increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT"". On Monday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the UK was set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year. But the IMF also predicted the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said needed to get a grip on public spending, rather than raise taxes again. He said: ""Be in no doubt, this tax doom loop is down to the Chancellor's economic mismanagement. ""Under Rachel Reeves we have seen inflation double, debt balloon, borrowing costs at a 27-year high, and taxes up - with more pain on the way in the autumn.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drpzxpkp3o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a9de/live/588597d0-a9aa-11f0-97ec-91b89bd10dfa.jpg,2025-10-15T10:26:58.165000+00:00,061e770fab4a741b8eb72cd2b493fceffe591081
d589ef6fe9ee,Tory leader relives acid attack as he hits out at parole system,,"Tory leader relives acid attack as he hits out at parole system BBC Russell Findlay, seen here shortly after the attack, had sulphuric acid thrown at his face but avoided permanent scarring Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay has hit out at Scotland's parole system as the man who attacked him with acid 10 years ago is considered for release. Findlay was working an investigative journalist for the Sun newspaper when William Burns knocked on his door disguised as a postman and threw corrosive liquid at his face. As Burns makes a bid for parole, Findlay criticised the lack of transparency in the system which considers when inmates are freed. He told BBC Scotland News that crime victims across Scotland were being denied ""basic information"" and the process needed to be ""dragged into the 21st Century"". Findlay recalled the incident in December 2015, when he opened the front door of his Glasgow home to Burns two days before Christmas. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""He distracted me by getting me to sign a document. ""As I was looking down, he threw what turned out to be sulphuric acid into my face. ""I was extremely fortunate in that it only caught half my face. ""I was even more fortunate when the police turned up and the knife he was carrying was lying on the threshold."" ""And I was even more fortunate in that my daughter, who was then aged 10, raised the alarm. Findlay was able to quickly wash away the acid with water, meaning he avoided any permanent scarring. He added: ""I was able with a bit of good luck to detain Burns until the police arrived to take him away. ""Every single thing that could have gone right in those moments did."" William Burns was jailed in 2017 for 15 years over the acid attack Findlay, who became an MSP in 2021, often worked on stories about organised crime and ""dangerous individuals"" during his previous 30-year career in journalism. He took precautions such as never allowing his photograph to appear on his stories. He said: ""Organised crime in Scotland is deep-rooted, wealthy and powerful. ""We've seen in the past decade they've gone after prisoners, they've gone after police officers, they've gone after lawyers - they're capable of anything."" The publicity after the acid attack raised his profile but he took the view that if ""keeping your head down"" was unable to keep attackers away from his front door, then maybe it was better to speak out. ""There's no point in hiding away, so perhaps being visible and being outspoken is the best form of defence,"" he said. At his trial Burns said he only intended to ""beat up"" Findlay who he claimed had told him he had a compromising photo showing him with a young blonde woman. The jury rejected his suggestion that Findlay had thrown the acid at himself, and the judge jailed him for 15 years, with a minimum custody term of 10 years. The attack took place months after Burns was freed early from a previous15-year jail term for shooting a woman during a post office robbery. Burns was also accused of involvement in a gangland shooting in Bishopbriggs earlier in 2015, but was later acquitted after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence. Getty Images Findlay, who became an MSP in 2021, says the parole system needs ""dragging into the 21st Century"" Findlay said he accepted Burns would be released from prison at some point but he was annoyed by the lack of transparency around a parole process which he said denied victims ""the most basic information"". ""All I get to know is whether a decision to grant to deny parole is made,"" he said. ""I'm not allowed to know where the hearing takes place, who sits on the board, I'm not allowed to know what evidence is led by him - so therefore cannot challenge it. ""I'm not allowed to know the reasons why a decision is reached and that's not just about me complaining about a lack of transparency. ""That applies to crime victims the length and breadth of Scotland."" Findlay said the early release of prisoners risked undermining public faith around sentencing and he pointed out that in other parts of the UK victims of crime are allowed to attend parole hearings. ""We just need to be dragged into the 21st Century,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The parole system could work better for everyone, which is why we are making changes through the Victims, Witnesses, and Justice Reform Bill, and why we currently have a public consultation on parole reforms that includes key areas of communication and transparency. ""It will be informed by direct engagement with victims and their families as well as other justice partners. ""Hearing about direct experience is essential to developing a more person-centred, trauma-informed system.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2d4dnl1dyo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dc9d/live/119e7af0-a9bc-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-15T11:46:25.930000+00:00,308b8a3accb23bc8fa61dd36292fb9a5960dde28
27d04d1e963c,Post-Brexit rules mean customers pay more – catering boss,,"Post-Brexit rules mean customers pay more – catering boss BBC Andrew Lynas said it was ""difficult to figure out"" the Windsor Framework It is ""reality"" that the cost of the Windsor Framework has to be passed onto customers, one of Northern Ireland's biggest catering suppliers has said. Andrew Lynas, of Lynas Foodservice, said Brexit paperwork, certificates, staffing, and additional costs from suppliers in Great Britain have led to customers paying more, adding he ""doesn't want and doesn't like it"". It comes as the House of Lords' Northern Ireland Scrutiny Committee found the Windsor Framework is ""impossible to navigate"". The government said the framework was ""the only workable solution"" that safeguards Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market and EU single market, and ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland. The Windsor Framework is a Brexit deal for Northern Ireland that was formally adopted by the UK and EU. It is designed to make trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK easier. The report said the UK government must address the difficulties businesses are facing. Mr Lynas told BBC News NI that it was ""still difficult to figure out the whole Brexit Windsor Framework agreement"". ""The reality is we do pay more, there is more paperwork, there are more health certificates, lots of checks, different things. ""Our stock holding is up half a million pounds because of it and I would say that the cost of goods is an extra 1% to 3% versus what you would pay in the mainland."" He said he has been working through the ""different iterations"" of protocols for nearly five years. Mr Lynas said the additional cost that suppliers, particularly in Great Britain, put on businesses had passed through to the customer. He said it had been a tough 12 months, which included the budget in October 2024 and national insurance changes. What did the Windsor Framework report say? Brexit paperwork, certificates, staffing, and additional costs from suppliers in Great Britain have led to the rising costs of goods The Northern Ireland Scrutiny Committee found the arrangements under the Windsor Framework are ""overwhelmingly complex and impossible for stakeholders to navigate"". Chair of the committee, Lord Carlile, told BBC News NI the Trader Support Service (TSS) must be redesigned. The TSS was set up in 2020 to help businesses deal with new customs processes. Lord Carlile said it should be ""simplified"" and supervised by the Cabinet Office. ""It should ensure that there is a one-stop shop to which businesses and social enterprises in Northern Ireland can go, and indeed social enterprises and businesses elsewhere trading with Northern Ireland, so that they can obtain speedy answers to avoid the complexities,"" he added. Lord Carlile said the committee was keen to see the introduction of a hotline relating to EU laws applying in Northern Ireland, so people can access information easily. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) has been approached for a response. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) peer, Lord Dodds, said the findings of the committee ""confirm what many in Northern Ireland and across the United Kingdom have long warned"". ""Every day that this situation is allowed to persist further erodes Northern Ireland's constitutional position, harms consumer choice, and imposes unnecessary costs and burdens on businesses,"" he added. ""It is vital that this undemocratic framework is dismantled."" Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland has been forced out of the European Union without consent since Brexit. She added that the post-Brexit reality meant that there has to be special arrangements, that come in the form of what is now the Windsor Framework. ""There are some issues that need to be resolved, but there just needs to be some pragmatism around ironing out the kinks that are there,"" she said. Mr Lynas said it had been a tough 12 months following the budget in October 2024 and national insurance changes Mr Lynas said if you are an all-island business, the system of red lanes - set up for goods at Northern Ireland ports as a result of the Windsor Framework - does not work. ""The green lanes work brilliantly if you're a retail business in Northern Ireland - if you're bringing goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland it's been a big improvement,"" he said. ""But the reality is if you're an all-Ireland business in any shape or form [and have to use the red lanes] then it doesn't work."" Talks between the UK and EU are resuming this autumn. Mr Lynas said: ""I think we need to have ambition in these next sets of talks to say, how can we eradicate that? How do we use technology? How do we use AI? ""How do we build on the trust that is there and say, let's actually make this work for the long term? And so we have an agreement for the next five to 10 years."" A government spokesperson said the Windsor Framework is ""the only workable solution for Northern Ireland, safeguarding Northern Ireland's place in the UK Internal Market and the EU Single Market, and ensuring no hard border on the island of Ireland"". They said the government regularly engages with businesses and people in Northern Ireland ""as we work to deliver greater prosperity and security"". ""We will now consider the committee's findings and respond in due course."" What are the red and green lanes? Red lanes and green lanes were set up as a result of the Windsor Framework to ease trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Goods arriving into Northern Ireland with minimal checks go into the green lane. Those which could go across the border into the Republic of Ireland – and therefore the EU – use the red lane.

6741c2c5ddf7,What more do we know about the collapsed China spy case?,,"What more do we know about the collapsed China spy case? Helen Catt Political correspondent and Chris Mason Political editor Watch: PM says government will publish witness statements in China spy case The row over why the case of two men accused of spying for China collapsed continues to rumble on and on for the government (not least, of course, because the opposition senses it is worth stoking). The government does seem to have painted itself into a corner over the release of witness statements related to the case. Suggesting that the Crown Prosecution Service was stopping their release, only for the CPS to say they weren't, makes it very awkward to do anything other than publish them. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer clarified that the government would do just that . The PM saw those documents for the first time this morning. It was an unusual start to the weekly question session - with the prime minister making that pledge in a statement, rather than in response to questions from the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch - something Badenoch was not expecting. There is an additional question, though, over whether the statements will really change anything. Unless they show something radically different to the situation that has so far been discussed, the central allegation here hasn't been that the government toned down evidence, but that it perhaps could have provided more and chose not to. The government maintains that's not the case and the publication of the statements may not shed any more light on that. Of course, these documents could put some more pressure on the CPS, as opposed to politicians. Let's see. Barring any surprises, it is unlikely to draw a line under this story - for the government or for those asking the questions. The Conservatives have been keen to keep up the pressure. There is danger though. The government's response throughout this has been to claim it was the Conservatives' position on China and the state of legislation which they did not change that is to blame. AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of spying for China After PMQs, there are briefings with the prime minister's team and Badenoch's team. This week, they lasted around an hour and 20 minutes. That, for the avoidance of doubt, is a long time by the standards of these things. It looks as though the documents will be coming later. What else have we learnt? The final submission of evidence from the government's deputy national security adviser was submitted on 4 August this year. On 1 September, the National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, and the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office, Sir Oliver Robbins, held a meeting in which what is described as the ""bilateral handling"" of the then forthcoming court case was discussed. In other words, how to deal with China when a big, high profile court case about alleged spying is under way. The government maintains that this meeting didn't get into the evidence relating to the case. The Conservatives say hang on, No 10 hasn't always been clear about this meeting — and it is a meeting that happened before the case collapsed on 15 September. They are now demanding the minutes of that meeting are published. The prime minister did find out the case was collapsing two days before it did, but those in government won't say how he found out. All of this just reinforces how complicated the detail of this story is and how much longer the questioning of it might go on.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09ezx0qn4o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/45e2/live/aa0dcc70-a9d3-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-15T14:28:57.689000+00:00,a65c29e70749e002710ce32edd2c54a0da146b0a
f66516561114,Controversial UK oil field publishes full scale of climate impact,,"The UK's largest undeveloped oil field has revealed the full scale of its environmental impact, should it gain approval by the government. Developers of the Rosebank oil field said nearly 250 million tonnes of planet warming gas would be released from using oil products from the field. The amount would vary each year, but by comparison the UK's annual emissions in 2024 were 371 million tonnes. The field's developer said its emissions were ""not significant"" considering the UK's international climate commitments. But opponents called it an ""admission of the vast climate change damage"" that the project will cause. Rosebank is an oil and gas field which lies about 80 miles north-west of Shetland and is one of the largest undeveloped discoveries of fossil fuels in UK waters. It is said to contain up to 300 million barrels of oil and some gas, and is owned by Norwegian energy giant Equinor and British firm Ithaca Energy. The field was originally approved in 2023, but in July a court ruled that a more detailed assessment of the field's environmental impact was required, taking into account the effect on the climate of burning any fossil fuels extracted from it. A public consultation has now been opened, and will run until 20th November 2025. The final decision on whether to approve the field will be made by the Energy Secretary. Greenpeace UK's senior climate campaigner, Paul Morozzo, said the new figures were: ""a brazen admission ... of the vast climate damage that would be caused from burning Rosebank's oil and gas."" Until recently such projects were only required to consider the impact on the environment from extracting the fossil fuels. But in June last year the Supreme Court ruled that authorities must take account of the impact from also using the products, after a woman in Surrey challenged the development of her local gas project. This ruling was then used in a further challenge to the Rosebank oil field by environmental campaigners Uplift and Greenpeace - which was subsequently successful in January. Equinor was required to recalculate the ""full impact"" of the field and it now estimates that it will contribute an additional 249 million tonnes of the planet warming gas CO2 over the next 25 years. This is more than 50 times greater than the original figure of 4.5 million tonnes it gave from extracting the oil and gas. Tessa Khan, executive director of environmental campaign group Uplift, said Rosebank would be the test of the government's credibility on climate change. ""This enormous oil field is not consistent with the UK's climate commitments. The world already has so much more oil than is safe to burn,"" she said. The UK has a target to produce no additional emissions by 2050 and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has been vocal about the need to move away from fossil fuels. On Tuesday, he told an industry conference that the UK's dependence on fossil fuels was its ""Achilles' heel"" and argued clean power was the only way to reduce bills. The fossil fuels for the Rosebank field are not guaranteed to be used in the UK but would be sold on the international market. As such the project is unlikely to have an impact on lowering gas prices. The UK's independent climate advisors said in 2022 that any more domestic oil and gas extraction would have ""at most, a marginal effect on prices"". But Arne Gurtner, Equinor's senior vice president for the UK, has previously said that: ""If the UK needs Rosebank oil, it will go to the UK through open market mechanisms.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xzgdqw3ro,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4ce7/live/c12f9c60-a9d0-11f0-aa31-b1f6905de5c6.jpg,2025-10-15T14:44:09.015000+00:00,61a3b4614b1f338b460ce4cfb13c3d80afda00f2

In his 15-page review, Lord Morse concluded that a decision to limit building work to times when the House of Lords was not sitting was key factor in the delays. He also said the project had been further postponed by the death of Queen Elizabeth and the subsequent coronation of King Charles, during which time work could not be carried out. The process to upgrade the entrance began in 2023 and had been expected to take 39 weeks at a cost of £6.1m. However, it ended up being delayed by 100 weeks and costs rose by more than £3m. In July, following complaints by peers in the House of Lords, the Lord Speaker asked Lord Morse, a former auditor of government projects, to investigate the reasons behind the delay. In his report, Lord Morse said that in February 2022 the cost of the project had been calculated based on the assumption that building work would ""proceed continuously from start to finish"" and that the entrance would be closed for use. However, the costs were pushed up when, in October 2022, a decision was made that the entrance should be kept open ""at all times"" when the House of Lords was sitting. Lord Morse said the original assumption about the entrance ""proved incorrect and materially increased the cost of delivery"". He said additional costs included a redesign, which had to take place when ground surveys revealed ""unknown voids"" beneath the foundations of the entrance. In September 2022 the project was disrupted following the death of Queen Elizabeth and her subsequent lying-in-state, which took place in Westminster Hall on the parliamentary estate. The construction site was dismantled and work was paused for two weeks. Lord Morse said such disruptions ""might reasonably have been anticipated"" but were ""not directly attributable to the way in which the project was managed"". He said the decision to limit major construction to times when Parliament was not sitting had the largest impact on the delays. The entrance was reopened in December 2024, but immediately ran into problems including power supply issues and difficulties for wheelchair users. In June and July, peers raised concerns in Parliament. Lord Forsyth described the project as ""a complete white elephant and a disaster"" and Leader of the House Baroness Smith of Basildon called the situation ""unacceptable"". Former transport secretary Lord Howell warned that the need for staff to manually operate the door meant Parliament was ""haemorrhaging money"". In his conclusion, Lord Morse said that security had been the ""primary driver"" behind the project. He recommended future projects should be governed by a ""clear framework that recognises the interdependence of security, health and safety, access, value for money and reputation"". Lord Morse also said the project lacked an independent figure, who could balance these priorities and make decisions that were ""in the best interests of Parliament as a whole"". He said future projects should have one single, controlling figure to make such judgements. He suggested that if such a role had existed during the project, the contract stating that work could continue while Parliament was sitting might not have been signed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kpd9lx1j0o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c03f/live/d69551f0-47b8-11f0-96d7-795fe3aefdde.jpg,2025-10-15T16:11:01.297000+00:00,88b27a0c0f48b1e8e524aaa79d9c001d939c8891

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says its new code of practice must be brought into force ""as soon as possible"" because some organisations are using old guidance, which is unlawful. The updated code sets out how gyms, clubs and hospitals must judge certain spaces in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling in April. The watchdog shared the guidance with Phillipson six weeks ago, but it has yet to be implemented. The government says it is taking its time to study the 300 page document. ECHR chairwoman Baroness Falkner has written to Phillipson, who is also education secretary, for the approval process to be speeded up to prevent organisations relying on outdated advice. The revised guidance can only gain legal force after it has been signed off by ministers, and laid in Parliament for 40 days. ""We have been told by some organisations that they intend to continue using this now unlawful code until the revised code is published, therefore allowing practices inconsistent with the law to persist,"" Falkner says in her letter. ""Our updated code of practice accurately reflects the law and is informed by the two public consultations we ran to ensure it is as clear as possible."" Baroness Falkner asked that the current code be revoked ""as soon as possible"" now that Parliament has returned from its party conference recess, so ""that courts, tribunals and duty bearers are clear that it is no longer to be relied on"". Approval of an updated code was ""particularly urgent considering the spread of misinformation and misleading information on the law following the Supreme Court judgment which continues to circulate widely,"" she added. Draft guidance According to the draft ECHR code, a birth certificate could be requested by a sports club or hospital if there is ""genuine concern"" about what biological sex a person is. It also said trans people can be excluded from competitive sport ""when necessary for reasons of safety or fair competition"", and gave an example of how some services might be able to adapt to ""offer toilets in individual lockable rooms to be used by both sexes"". The Conservatives have accused Phillipson, who is running to be Labour's deputy leader, of delaying publication of the guidance to avoid losing support during the contest. Shadow women and equalities minister Mims Davies has accused Phillipson of ""her own career opportunities ahead of women's rights"". A source close to Phillipson described claims that the timing of publication was politically motivated as ""utter nonsense"". ""Our only consideration is ensuring this guidance protects the dignity and wellbeing of everyone in society,"" the source added. 'Robust conversation' Thirty two Labour MPs have written to the ECHR to reconsider its draft guidance, which they say will ""open the door to discrimination and harassment against trans people"". Lucy Powell, Phillipson's deputy leadership rival, has said she believes the ECHR guidance goes too far - and has called for MPs to be given a vote on it. Speaking at a fringe event Labour's annual conference last month, Powell said: ""I think we have got some of the language not right on this, and particularly around some of the guidance that's coming forward. ""I really strongly feel like we need a robust and transparent parliamentary conversation about that, because when we're looking at applying the law as parliamentarians, we should have a say on that and that's something I'll be pushing for as well."" A government spokesperson said: ""The government is considering the draft updated code and, if the decision is taken to approve it, the minister will lay it before Parliament. ""The proposed code of practice is over 300 pages long, so it is important that the correct process is followed.""

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) won a legal case earlier this month against PPE Medpro , a consortium led by Lady Mone's husband Doug Barrowman, over claims the PPE did not comply with relevant healthcare standards. A High Court judge ruled some of the company's gowns they supplied were not ""sterile"". Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said the government would ""pursue PPE Medpro with everything we've got to get these funds back"" after the company failed to pay the damages cost by 16:00 BST on Wednesday. PPE Medpro entered administration on 30 September, the day before the court judgement. Streeting said: ""At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers' hard-earned cash. ""PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay - they still owe us over £145 million, with interest now accruing daily."" The firm was ordered to pay interest of £23.6m, which means the total sum owed is £145.6m. According to the DHSC, this sum will accrue interest at 8% per year from Thursday until it is fully paid. Forvis Mazars, one of the joint administrators appointed to take control of the business and recover money owed to creditors, declined to comment. The National Crime Agency (NCA) previously said it was investigating the PPE Medpro case. Mr Barrowman's spokesman had said £83m of the government deal was paid to other companies but it is unclear whether they are being looked at by the NCA. PPE Medpro was awarded a government contract in 2020 to supply PPE after being recommended by Baroness Mone. However, after ordering 25 million sterile gowns from PPE Medpro, the government later launched legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract. PPE Medpro argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile. According to the company's most recent accounts for the period ending 31 July, the business had £666,025 in net assets. The document filed to Companies House also mentioned how the firm had used about £4.2m in reserves to fight the legal dispute. Since the court judgement, Baroness Mone has faced cross-party calls for her to be stripped of her peerage.

A second witness statement written by Matthew Collins in February 2025 as evidence for the case of two men accused of spying on MPs, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, said China's spying threatened ""the UK's economic prosperity and resilience"".

But the second two statements made clear the government was ""committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China"". Both Mr Cash and Mr Berry have denied the allegations against them. All three statements by Collins were published by Downing Street on Wednesday night as the government continued to face questions after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against the two men last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. The first of the three statements by Collins was given to prosecutors in December 2023, when he was serving under a Conservative government. The second and third statements were submitted this year after Labour had taken power. Previously, the director of public prosecutions said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer said he would publish the deputy national security adviser's statements after Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of a ""cover-up"". The documents show that in December 2023, Collins concluded: ""The Chinese Intelligence Services are highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK and other international partners to advance the Chinese state's interest and harm the interests and security of the UK."" In February 2025, he said: ""China is an authoritarian state, with different values to the UK. This presents challenges for both the UK and our allies. China and the UK both benefit from bilateral trade and investment, but China also present the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security."" And in a third statement this August, he said China's ""espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience, and the integrity of our democratic institutions"". He pointed to a number of actions which UK authorities believe Beijing was behind, including a cyber-attack on the UK electoral commission between 2021 and 2023. In his 2025 statements, Collins made clear the government sought a good economic relationship with China, writing: ""It is important for me to emphasise, however that the government is committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China. ""The government believes that the UK must continue to engage with international partners on trade and investment to grow our economy while ensuring that our security and values are not compromised."" When the second statement was originally signed by Collins, it was dated in error as February 2024. But the government said it had actually been signed and submitted to prosecutors in February 2025, by which time Labour were in power, and this had been clarified to the CPS at the time. BBC News understands that Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue when he submitted his third witness statement in August 2025. A government source pointed to comments made by him where he described ""the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK"" as an example of why he believed he had said enough to satisfy the CPS's threshold for prosecution. It is also understood that the CPS contacted Collins after his first witness statement to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, but that they were not explicitly clear what the official would need to say in subsequent statements, in order to meet the CPS's threshold. New details of alleged spying In his first statement, Collins wrote in detail about the allegations made about Mr Cash and Mr Berry he said were based on information provided to him by counter terrorism police. Collins said in this 2023 statement ""it had been assessed that the Chinese state recruited Mr Berry as an agent and successfully directed him to utilise Mr Cash"" who had access to the Commons China Research Group (CRG) and other MPs. Mr Cash worked as a parliamentary researcher and was involved with the CRG, which was set up by a group of Conservative MPs looking into how the UK should respond to the rise of China. In his statement, Collins said that in July 2022, Mr Berry met with a senior Chinese Communist Party leader and that he understood Mr Cash was made aware of the meeting by Mr Berry. Collins said Mr Cash responded to Mr Berry with multiple messages, including one reading: ""You're in spy territory now"". Collins also said information gathered was passed to an individual named ""Alex"" who was believed to be an agent of the Chinese state. He said in assessing whether this was prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state, he had proceeded on the basis the facts, as alleged, by counter terrorism police were true. This included information about the prospect of Tom Tugendhat MP being made a minister and the likelihood of Jeremy Hunt pulling out of the Conservative leadership race. In a new statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Cash said he wanted to reiterate that he was ""completely innocent"". He said: ""I have been placed in an impossible position. I have not had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence, and I should not have to take part in a trial by media. ""The statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial."" While Mr Berry has previously denied spying for China, he has not commented since the day the case ended. House of Commons Sir Keir Starmer committed to urgently publishing the documents in the Commons on Wednesday Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. The director of public prosecutions has said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a ""threat to national security"" at the time of the alleged offences. The Conservatives have claimed the government did not provide sufficient evidence because it does not want to damage relations with Beijing. However, the Labour government has argued that because the alleged offences took place under the Conservatives, the prosecution could only be based on their stance on China at the time. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Under this government, no minister or special adviser played any role in the provision of evidence."" The publication of the documents followed pressure from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who had called for them to be released. On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them publishing the witness statements would be ""inappropriate"". But the CPS later made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put the government's evidence in the public domain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ex172rxwzo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a266/live/5582c670-a95a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-16T01:31:45.583000+00:00,a6f2950f9534b8af442f4f21a5b569eef292f8d3
cd9f66c70c72,Cabinet Office rejects Cummings' China breach claim,,"The Cabinet Office has rejected Dominic Cummings' claim that China breached high-level systems used to transfer sensitive government information. In an interview with the Times, Cummings said China obtained ""vast amounts"" of ""extremely secret"" information from the UK intelligence services and parts of Whitehall. He told the paper the breach was covered up after he was briefed on the compromised data in 2020 while a senior aide to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In response, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""It is untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised."" Cummings said China breached high-level systems used to transfer so-called Strap material, a government classification for highly sensitive intelligence data. In the interview, he said the compromised information included: ""Material from intelligence services. Material from the National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. ""Things the government has to keep secret. If they're not secret, then there are very, very serious implications for it."" He told the newspaper: ""The cabinet secretary said, 'We have to explain something; there's been a serious problem', and he talked through what this was. ""And it was so bizarre that, not just Boris, a few people in the room were looking around like this - 'Am I somehow misunderstanding what he's saying?'"" He added: ""What I'm saying is that some Strap stuff was compromised and vast amounts of data classified as extremely secret and extremely dangerous for any foreign entity to control was compromised."" Cummings also claimed the breach was covered up. ""If the MPs want to finally have an inquiry about it, I'd be happy to talk about it,"" he said. A former government security official told the BBC he was ""mystified"" by Cummings' claims. Professor Ciaran Martin became the first chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre in 2016 and stood down in August 2020. Speaking on Radio 4's The World Tonight programme, Prof Martin cast doubt on Cummings' claim that the so-called Strap system was breached. ""This is, to the best of my knowledge, categorically untrue,"" he said. ""That would have fallen to the National Cyber Security Centre to lead and there was no such investigation."" Prof Martin added: ""China is a consistent and serious cyber security threat… but these systems are entirely different. ""They're built, monitored, secured and operated in an entirely different way than normal internet-based systems. ""It doesn't follow that… they [China] can somehow penetrate these entirely bespoke systems and there wasn't any evidence in 2020 that they did so.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xz607dpro,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c52e/live/c16db960-aa29-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-16T04:19:49.383000+00:00,4d75d56a7550cc4cd59f139768e86a629f650e90
1b00bb64156b,Digesting the key segments and changes in China documents,,"Digesting the key segments and changes in China documents Chris Mason Political editor Reuters At just after half past nine on Wednesday night, the documents appeared on the government's website. There were three submissions from one of the government's Deputy National Security Advisers, Matthew Collins. The first one from December 2023, under the Conservatives. And two more. The second one is dated February 2024, also when the Conservatives were in power and the third August 2025, when Labour were. But it turns out, we learned in a later hastily published clarification, the date was a year out in that second document and it was actually submitted in February 2025, under Labour – arguably a crucial distinction when one element of the language used is examined. Firstly, then, to the first document. It includes lots of detail relating to the specific allegations against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who have always denied the allegations against them and who are not facing any criminal proceedings. Mr Cash, through his solicitor, has already put out a statement reiterating his innocence and reflecting that he hadn't had ""the daylight of a public trial"" and adding that he shouldn't have to take part ""in a trial by media."" In the first document, Mr Collins sets out that the government at the time saw China as an ""evolving and epoch defining challenge"". That was the language government ministers were always careful to use at the time. It adds that the government ""will increase our national security protections where Chinese state actions pose a threat to our people, prosperity and security"". There is then a segment that is a little warmer towards Beijing: ""We will engage directly with China bilaterally and in international fora so that we leave room for open, constructive and predictable relations."" But it is blunt, too: ""The Chinese Intelligence Services are highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK and other international partners to advance the Chinese state's interests."" He concludes: ""It is my assessment that the suspects' alleged activities were prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK, and the information and material passed would be directly or indirectly useful to the Chinese state."" So, he talks about espionage, he talks about threats and he talks too about being open and constructive. Fast forward to February of this year and the language is similar, but it does appear to reflect the change in government and its outlook on relations with China. Mr Collins says China presents ""the biggest state based threat to the UK's economic security"" but adds a few paragraphs later ""it is important for me to emphasise, however, that the government is committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China. The government believes that the UK must continue to engage with international partners on trade and investment to grow our economy while ensuring that our security and values are not compromised."" That word ""positive"" hadn't featured in the earlier document. And then in the final submission, from just a few months ago in August of this year, the word ""positive"" features again, but so does this: ""China's espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience and the integrity of our democratic institutions."" And, crucially, he points out that between 2021 and 2023, the crucial years under the last government when these allegations relate to, ""the UK government publicly articulated…the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK"". The BBC understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue, when he submitted that third and final witness statement. We are also told that after submitting his first statement, when the Crown Prosecution Service went back to him to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, they were not explicitly clear what Mr Collins would have needed to say in order to clear that threshold. So what can we deduce from all of this? This government and its Conservative predecessor had a deep and ongoing worry about Chinese espionage. But both also wanted an economic and diplomatic relationship with Beijing. Labour folk tell me it justifies the prime minister's argument – as punchy a case as could be made was made, within the confines of government policy a few years ago and now. Some Conservative folk note Mr Collins' language in the submissions since the general election quote language that featured in Labour's manifesto: ""We will cooperate where we can, compete where we need to and challenge where we must."" The Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp told me: ""This is wholly contrary to what the prime minister has been saying – which is that all of the evidence submitted related to the 2021-2023 period."" We await Downing Street's response. And one final thing. There are MPs digesting all of this who are struggling to understand why this case didn't come to court. It is the Crown Prosecution Service's role to judge the likelihood of securing a conviction and in this instance they didn't think that likelihood was high enough – and it is their job to determine that. But there is enough in these documents to ensure that element of this debate continues, as well as the approach taken by both the previous government and by this one.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyvq754q0o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/128c/live/a8d441c0-aa25-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-16T06:07:01.545000+00:00,714054e8bfa034015336a9dc034a68a321f574a5
136db809ef92,Former MP suspects he has been spied on by China,,"Former MP suspects he has been spied on by China Getty Images Former MP Tim Loughton had sanctions imposed on him in 2021 by China A former MP and government minister has said he suspects he was the victim of Chinese spying, having been sanctioned by the nation back in 2021. The UK government continues to face questions after charges were dropped against two men accused of spying for China. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham for more than 27 years, expressed concerns that he was ""involved in the files that have been passed over, allegedly, by these two people"". All claims have been denied by China , with foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stating: ""We firmly oppose peddling China spy narratives and vilifying China."" Mr Loughton told BBC Radio Sussex : ""I've been involved with China for a long time. ""I've called out China's human rights abuses, I was one of those who put forward amendments to make sure Chinese government companies weren't involved in our infrastructure projects, as a result of which I'm a subject of interest to them."" The former MP, who stood down last year, also highlighted an incident in 2024 when he said he was deported during a trip to Djibouti . He claimed that it was because of the east African country's close ties to China. 'Interpol's red list' Mr Loughton was one of seven parliamentarians sanctioned by China in 2021, with the remainder still in parliament. ""The real fear is that we could be on Interpol's red list, and if we find ourselves in a country which has repatriation agreements with China, we could be arrested and find ourselves on a plane to Beijing,"" Mr Loughton said. He also highlighted that he no longer had the ""certain protections"" afforded to parliamentarians, requiring him to be ""even more wary"". The proceedings against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat , according to the director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson. Mr Loughton said the outcome was ""exceedingly mysterious and concerning"", claiming that he had been given briefings which said that it was ""a very clear-cut case"".

f583afe14909,When is the Budget and what might be in it?,,"When is the Budget and what might be in it? Reuters Chancellor Rachel Reeves has acknowledged she is considering tax rises and spending cuts ahead of her autumn Budget on 26 November. Before the 2024 general election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says she will ""almost certainly"" have to raise taxes to make up a £22bn shortfall in the government's finances. What happens during the Budget and what time will it take place? The chancellor of the exchequer's Budget statement outlines government plans for raising or cutting taxes. It also includes big decisions about spending on public services such as health, schools and police. The statement is made to MPs in the House of Commons. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time - after Prime Minister's Questions - and lasts for about an hour. The Leader of the Opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will give an immediate response. MPs will then debate the measures for four days, before voting on them. What might be in the Budget? There has been a lot of speculation that Reeves will have to raise taxes because she needs more money in order to meet her self-imposed rules for government finances. She has two main rules, which she describes as ""non-negotiable"": Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament The IFS said finding £22bn would allow the government to maintain the £10bn buffer it currently has, but argued there was a ""strong case"" for trying to increase it further . The £10bn margin Reeves left herself after her Spring Statement in March was one of the lowest a chancellor has given themselves since 2010, with the average for the period standing at £30bn. Income Tax and National Insurance The government could extend the current freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028. Freezing the thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax or qualify for higher rates. This is often referred to as a ""stealth tax"". Speaking to the BBC in September, Reeves did not rule out extending the freeze. The Resolution Foundation think tank - which has close links to some members of the government - says some personal taxes will have to rise. As part of a package of measures, it recommended cutting 2p from the employee NI rate, while adding the same amount to income tax. Such a move would potentially affect pensioners, landlords and the self-employed more than workers. This is because their tax would increase but they wouldn't receive a matched cut to NI. Value Added Tax (VAT) The Sunday Times reported that the government was considering scrapping VAT on domestic fuel bills - cutting the current 5% rate to zero. Health Secretary Wes Streeting ruled out introducing VAT on private healthcare . Property taxes Reports suggest the government may reform property taxes . This could include replacing stamp duty - a tax buyers pay on properties above a certain value in England and Northern Ireland - with a property tax. Landlords could have to pay more taxes, and council tax could be replaced. Some people selling their main residence may have to pay capital gains tax. Youth employment guarantee In September, Reeves said that young people who have been out of work for 18 months will be given paid placements to help them secure full-time employment . Isa reform In July, the chancellor ruled out any immediate reform to cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts). There had been speculation that she wanted to reduce the annual allowance to push people into investing in shares instead. However, the FT has reported that she may announce a cut in the cash ISA limit from the current £20,000 to £10,000. Pension changes There has also been speculation about possible changes to pension rules, such as the level of tax relief available to savers and the size of the cash lump sum which can be withdrawn. Cutting the higher rate tax relief on pension contributions would save the Treasury money, but may make pension savings less attractive. Business taxes The TUC, the umbrella group for trade unions in the UK, has called for higher taxes on online gaming companies and on banks' profits . How is the UK economy doing? The Labour government says that boosting the economy is a key priority. A growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. The UK economy has been slowing in recent months after a strong start to 2025. The latest figures show that the economy grew by 0.1% in August , after a 0.1% contraction in July. Over the three months to August, UK GDP grew by 0.3%, down from the 0.6% growth seen between March and May. Meanwhile, government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - reached £18bn in August. That was the highest level seen for the month in five years , driven by higher spending on public services, benefits and debt interest. Prices are also rising faster than expected. Inflation was 3.8% in the year to August , the same as in July, which is above the Bank of England's 2% target. In August, the Bank cut interest rates for the fifth time in a year, taking the cost of borrowing to the lowest level for more than two years. It made the cut because of concerns that the jobs market was weakening, with data showing job vacancies were continuing to fall and wage growth was slowing. However, the Bank held rates at its next meeting in September , arguing the UK was ""not out of the woods"" on inflation. In October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that the UK was set to be the second-fastest-growing major economy in 2025 . However, it also predicted that the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations in both 2025 and 2026, driven by rising energy and utility bills. What happens after the Budget speech? If approved by MPs, any tax changes in the Budget can come into effect immediately. However, the government must pass a finance bill to make them permanent. Further details about Budget measures - and what they cost - are published by the Treasury, the government's economic and finance ministry. The OBR also publishes its assessment of the health of the UK economy and a forecast of what it thinks will happen in the future.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4w44w42j5o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8376/live/c5070a20-96b3-11ef-99af-372359b57a36.png,2025-10-16T09:50:28.110000+00:00,1b961981a6ce958dd3a9738c1e136c861172a830

890ffcc2788e,UK economy grew slightly in August ahead of key Budget,,"UK economy grew slightly in August ahead of key Budget Nick Edser business reporter Getty Images The UK economy grew slightly in August, official figures show, as focus intensifies on what measures the government might unveil in next month's Budget. An increase in manufacturing output helped the economy expand by 0.1%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, but the figure for July was revised down from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%. The government has made boosting the economy a priority, but economists predict growth will remain sluggish partly due to people waiting to see what  measures Chancellor Rachel Reeves announces in the Budget. Many analysts expect that tax rises or spending cuts will be needed to meet the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is projecting Reeves will need to find £22bn to bolster the government's finances and meet her rules, and will ""almost certainly"" have to raise taxes. But the influential think tank said the chancellor should be ""bold"" in next month's Budget, and build up a large financial buffer to avoid future spending cuts and tax rises. On Wednesday, Reeves said she was ""looking at further measures on tax and spending, to make sure that the public finances always add up"". Her comments were seen as the clearest sign yet that tax rises will be in the Budget, with speculation growing over what measures she might take . The main driver of economic growth in August was the manufacturing sector, which grew by 0.7%. However, the key services sector - which covers businesses in sectors such as retail, hospitality and finance - saw no growth during the month. Monthly growth figures can be volatile, as seen by the downgrade for July, and the ONS is focusing on growth over a rolling three-month period. In the three months to August the economy expanded by 0.3%, which was a small improvement on the 0.2% growth in the three months to July. ""Economic growth increased slightly in the latest three months. Services growth held steady, while there was a smaller drag from production than previously,"" said Liz McKeown, ONS director of statistics. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that while the economy had returned to growth in August, the ""outlook remains weak"". She said households were facing higher costs for essentials such as food, while uncertainty about potential Budget tax rises was ""expected to weigh on activity for both households and businesses"". ""As a result, we anticipate growth to remain sluggish over the coming months."" Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, called August's growth ""meagre"". She said the increases in taxes for businesses that took effect in April - such as the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions - were ""undoubtedly playing a part in restraining growth"". ""There is little reason to think GDP growth will accelerate much from here,"" she said. ""The disruption to the auto sector caused by the Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack probably meant the economy went backwards in September."" Despite weak growth in the economy, analysts are not expecting the Bank of England to cut interest rates when it meets next month, as inflation in the UK remains high at 3.8%. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year. However, it also said the UK would face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, as result of rising energy and utility bills. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We have seen the fastest growth in the G7 since the start of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck. ""The chancellor is determined to turn this around by helping businesses in every town and High Street grow, investing in infrastructure and cutting red tape to get Britain building."" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the latest figures show that ""growth continues to be weak and Rachel Reeves is now admitting she is going to hike taxes yet again, despite all her promises"". ""If Labour had a plan - or a backbone - they would get spending under control, cut the deficit and get taxes down."" Daisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said the government was ""simply not doing enough to kickstart growth"".

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is projecting Rachel Reeves will need to find £22bn to make up a shortfall in the government's finances, and will ""almost certainly"" have to raise taxes. Finding this amount would allow the government to maintain the £10bn of headroom it has built into the system - but the IFS says there is a ""strong case"" for trying to increase it beyond this amount. IFS director Helen Miller said the lack of a bigger buffer brought with it instability, and could leave the chancellor ""limping from one forecast to the next"". ""A key challenge is ensuring that fiscal groundhog day doesn't become a twice-yearly ritual,"" Ms Miller said. She said the position the chancellor finds herself in was ""to a large extent, a situation of her own making"". ""When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course,"" Ms Miller added. The £10bn margin Reeves left herself after her Spring Statement in March was the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at £30bn. The guidance from the IFS comes as latest figures show the UK economy grew slightly in August . The think tank pointed to rising borrowing costs, weaker growth forecasts and spending commitments made since the spring as reasons for the government's tight position. It said Reeves needs to make up that shortfall so she can meet her own fiscal rules, which she has called ""non-negotiable"". The two main rules are: Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament Ms Miller added that the ""constant obsession with the headroom"" was a distraction from important debates on how policy could bolster economic growth and the reform of the tax system. Speaking on Wednesday, Reeves gave the strongest indication to date that she is planning to raise taxes in the Budget. The IFS's green budget looks ahead to some of the decisions the government will have to make in its 26 November Budget. The report is funded by the Nuffield Foundation and produced in association with Barclays. In a chapter of its report published earlier this week , the IFS said Reeves could raise tens of billions of pounds a year more in revenue without breaking manifesto promises, but this would not be straightforward. During last year's election, Labour said they would “not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT"" - which the IFS flags as the simplest ways to raise revenue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n8v34jvlo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f54f/live/8f97b450-a9c9-11f0-a5c2-cb318711a6b0.jpg,2025-10-16T08:36:46.671000+00:00,e16b93ec87dedb5e27279ccf53f13082707d9e03
2398e9b73172,"BBC viewers worried about political interference, boss says",,"BBC viewers worried about political interference, boss says Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter Watch: Tim Davie told BBC Breakfast the BBC was seen globally as a 'glowing light' of independent broadcasting The BBC director general has said viewers are worried about political interference in the corporation, following the results of a major questionnaire about the broadcaster. More than 870,000 members of the public answered questions online about the BBC and its place in society. Fewer than half - 43% - said they thought the corporation was effective at being independent from government, while 38% thought it was ineffective. ""Yes, that is what people worry about,"" Mr Davie told BBC Breakfast. ""They worry about, is the BBC being unduly influenced?"" Of the respondents, 91% said it was important for the BBC to be independent from the government of the day. Mr Davie said the BBC is ""absolutely not"" unduly influenced by the government, and that the corporation's independence is ""absolutely sacrosanct"". ""I can reassure everyone we are independent editorially. We absolutely act without fear or favour,"" he said. Asked about instances when government ministers call him to complain about the BBC's output, he said: ""Very, very rarely will somebody call me on an editorial issue, because broadly speaking, it is respected that we have editorial independence."" The BBC is perceived globally as being a model of independent broadcasting, he noted. The BBC invited audience members to have their say in a series of on-air promotions across TV and radio. It also sent emails to 40 million BBC account holders. The results of the Our BBC, Our Future questionnaire come after the relationship between the BBC and the government has been in the spotlight. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy appeared to call for Mr Davie's resignation this summer after a string of scandals, including antisemitic comments by punk duo Bob Vylan at Glastonbury being broadcast on iPlayer, and the revelation that a Gaza documentary was narrated by the son of a Hamas official. In August, former BBC director of news James Harding told the Edinburgh TV Festival that Nandy's involvement in the Bob Vylan scandal was ""chilling"", and criticised ""political interference"", or the perception of it, at the BBC. Last year, BBC chair Samir Shah said there was ""an almost perpetual government review over the BBC"" as a result of the requirement for ministers to renew the broadcaster's royal charter every 10 years. Meanwhile, questions about the BBC's independence were raised when former Tory donor and Rishi Sunak's ex-boss Richard Sharp was named BBC chair in 2021. Mr Sharp resigned two years later over his links to Boris Johnson. Also in 2021, Theresa May's former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb was appointed to the BBC board. Asked if he listens to any concerns raised with him, Mr Davie replied: ""We listen to it, but we're not reacting to one lobby or the other. ""What we're trying to do is, if someone raises a valid point or a factual inaccuracy, we can check that. So I think the idea that the BBC's not listening or we wouldn't take a call is ridiculous."" He added: ""If you talk to any of our leaders in the newsroom, our orders are very clear - report against the editorial guidelines, without fear or favour. ""People will call and say things, but I don't think we're influenced by that. What we're influenced by is our standards, our editorial guidelines."" He concluded: ""It's not an invalid concern to be worried about governmental interference in broadcasting and free journalism. I would say the BBC is a glowing light on that, and that is what we need to fight for, and it is a worry."" One other major gap identified by the questionnaire results was the percentage of respondents who felt the BBC should reflect different parts of the UK and the people who live there (76%), and the percentage who felt it actually did (51%). ""These are gaps that will need to be worked on and addressed as a priority as the BBC's future is debated and we plan how to serve the public better,"" the BBC said. The questionnaire also found: 80% of respondents said it was important for the corporation to offer high-quality digital services, while 78% said the BBC should offer something for everyone 82% said it was important to provide a valuable public service, while 76% said it should be an asset for the UK around the world 83% said it was important that the BBC continued its mission to inform, educate and entertain In a statement released with the questionnaire results, Mr Davie described the response to the questionnaire as ""incredible"", which he said ""shows just how much people care about the BBC"". ""I strongly believe the BBC has never been more needed, both in the UK and around the world,"" he said. ""The results of the questionnaire are clear – our audience wants an independent BBC, delivering high-quality programmes and content that they can trust; that tells the stories that matter to them and that reflect their lives."" Mr Davie thanked those who took part, adding: ""We are here to deliver for audiences across the UK and we will be taking everything they have told us with us as we shape the future of the BBC.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9pld9g61o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/31b3/live/9d990310-aa7d-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-16T10:48:24.788000+00:00,2a7c2d7f4dbaa6500f78de3afce80cbebc621bad

Devon County Council members Neil Stevens, his brother Tony Stevens and their agent Rob Sheridan all faced claims of overspending in the May elections. The police launched an investigation in June after another Reform councillor, Ed Hill, reported his concerns to the authorities. Devon and Cornwall Police said no further action would be taken after the Stevens brothers and Mr Sheridan successfully took a civil case to the High Court on Tuesday where Justice Martin Spencer decided any mistakes made were not ""in bad faith"". A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: ""As a result of the judgement, the individuals in question will face no further police action."" The court heard on Tuesday issues included confusion over who should pay for podcasts, over which expenses for election leaflets needed to be declared and over who the election agent was for the Stevens brothers.

5b45c3d3d496,The real problem with Britain's asylum hotels - and the woman with a bold plan to solve it,,"The real problem with Britain's asylum hotels - and the woman with a bold plan to solve it Tom Symonds News correspondent BBC Kate Wareing has dedicated her career to helping people who find themselves in a crisis because they have nowhere to live. It's clearly personal. She worked as a housing officer at the age of 18, remembers sleeping on a sofa herself when a relationship broke up, and now in her early 50s, feels she is only a home owner because of ""luck and age"". ""Everybody needs the security of a home,"" she says. And now Kate, who is the chief executive of an Oxfordshire housing association, has an idea that she thinks could help the government with one of its most pressing challenges: how to empty asylum hotels by 2029. The pledge to empty them was made by Labour when tensions and anger rose during the summer, in communities where some regard asylum seekers as a threat to local safety. The cost of putting asylum seekers in local hotels is also ""cripplingly expensive,"" points out Kate - and she makes a bold claim: the cost could be cut from about £54,000 a year to just £4,000, for each asylum seeker, by moving them to social housing. AFP via Getty Images Protests and counter-protests outside the Bell Hotel in Epping Instead of paying private contractors to provide hotel rooms, as it does now, she wants the government to pay councils and housing associations to buy more properties, adding them to the nation's social housing stock, to benefit migrants and others in need of a home. The BBC has been told her proposal has been discussed with several government departments, including the Treasury and the Home Office. Officials are talking to nearly 200 councils about a series of pilot projects, though the Home Office won't give details. The question is, could it really work - if private companies haven't managed to source enough accommodation for asylum seekers, what's to say a council could? Under Kate Wareing's plan, the government would give a council or housing association an average of £80,000 to buy and do up a property And would this alternative really help to calm the strident public debate, in the wake of the protests and counter-protests outside the Bell Hotel in Epping and elsewhere - or might it exacerbate it? The pandemic fuelled the problem There is no doubt tensions have been increasing. In July 2015 a coastguard in Dover told the BBC that two migrants had been rescued from a dinghy just offshore in the Channel. It was so surprising that it made the news. At that time people typically hid in lorries to get across the Channel. But during the Covid-19 pandemic, there were fewer lorries and would-be stowaways increasingly began using inflatable boats instead. Small boat arrivals accounted for a relatively small 4% of total immigration to the UK for the year to June 2025, but the numbers are rising. The pandemic also rapidly increased the use of hotels to house asylum seekers. Successive administrations have banned asylum seekers from working for their first year in the UK - they didn't want the opportunity for a job to become a ""pull factor"" - so it falls to the government to support them. The Conservatives turned to the private sector for help, handing contracts to three companies - Serco, Clearsprings Ready Homes and Mears - to provide beds. The problem was, they ran out. Then, as lockdowns struck, hotels emptied, providing a useful source of emergency accommodation. The rooms are, however, more expensive than renting houses. In October 2025, the government was spending £5.5m per day on them. At one point, under the Conservatives, there were 400 hotels in use but they managed to reduce the number over time. While Labour has closed three hotels since July 2024, there are still 210, housing around 32,000 people. 'Put them in a camp' This summer, the argument moved to the streets, with protesters demanding the closure of asylum hotels. Lorraine Cavanagh, campaigning outside the Britannia Hotel in London's Canary Wharf, told me: ""I don't know who they are. They have no background, they have no passports, they are unidentified men who can walk around and do what they want to do with no consequences. ""Their beliefs are not the same as ours. They are coming in and trying to disturb and change things, that we are not used to."" AFP via Getty Images Several protests about asylum hotels have taken place across the country, including in Canary Wharf, London Some protesters have another suggestion: put them in a military camp. Rakib Ehsan, a senior fellow at the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank, agrees this could be useful on a temporary basis. ""At least they would be somewhat separated from local communities,"" he says. Two large former Ministry of Defence sites are currently being used for asylum seekers - Napier Barracks, near Folkestone, and a former RAF base at Wethersfield in Essex. In 2021 the High Court found Napier Barracks, which is capable of housing 300 male migrants, to be overcrowded and filthy, requiring the government to take action. The other facility, Wethersfield, which contains bedrooms, recreational areas and places for worship, is being expanded. Eventually more than 1,200 beds will be available. Residents can come and go, but the High Court was previously told Wethersfield was like a prison. Three migrants bringing a case against the former Home Secretary described ""tensions and outbreaks of violence"" within its walls. These ""large sites"" are not cheap either. The government spent £49m refurbishing Wethersfield, far more than had been estimated. A programme to open accommodation at RAF Scampton was also abandoned in 2024 after the cost ballooned to £60m. The public financial watchdog, the National Audit Office, concluded in March 2024 that these large sites would cost even more than hotels. Questioned by MPs in June 2025, the Environment Minister Angela Eagle said the government was moving away from ""asbestos-filled buildings, poisoned land, unexploded ordinance and all those sorts of things on old army bases"". But then in September 2025, Defence Secretary John Healey popped up, during the wave of anti-migrant protests, and revealed he had tasked his planners with identifying more military sites. Did the need for beds become greater, or did the rhetoric around using barracks for people who claim to be fleeing persecution become more acceptable, as Reform edged up in the opinion polls? Possibly both. Plans are yet to be revealed. Either way, what the government really needs now, is lots of cheaper, and better places for them to stay. Private sector problem Hotels and military bases are used for ""emergency accommodation"" when there isn't enough so-called ""dispersal accommodation"" in communities around the country, which often takes the form of Houses in Multiple Occupation, or HMOs. This is where at least three people ""not from the same household"", live together, sharing a bathroom and a kitchen. Three main private contractors use public money to find HMOs on the open market. One, Mears, went on a spending spree across the north-east of England in 2023 and early 2024 buying 221 properties for more than £20m. But many flats and houses are rented from private landlords. Another provider, Serco, has 1,000 leased properties for asylum accommodation. The third, Clearsprings Ready Homes, has made £187m in the last six years supporting 30,000 migrants, though half of them are in hotels. So these companies are competing with all of us, and local councils, for suitable properties. Planning applications for HMO status have been rising steadily since 2009, according to the property data company Searchland, though smaller HMOs don't need planning permission. There can be public opposition to attempts to use HMOs for migrants, just as there is with hotels, which is one factor contributing to a shortage. Another is that in some areas few rental properties are available at the very low rents the government contracts will pay. Renting or buying? This could be seen as a challenge to Kate Wareing's plan for housing associations and councils to provide properties instead. If the three private companies contracted by the government struggle, won't councils and housing associations have the same problem? ""We would shop in a different way,"" she says. Often the asylum accommodation companies are looking for the cheapest private rented houses, usually in areas with lots of asylum seekers already, she says, fuelling community tensions. But councils and housing associations could plan more carefully where to go shopping, she argues, and there are other sources of property they might be able to get hold of more easily. For example, they could buy up property in housing developments. Builders usually have to offer social housing as part of any new development, in order to get planning permission. There has been a drop in first-time buyers recently. Getty Images Small boat arrivals account for a relatively small percentage of total immigration to the UK ""We've got builders approaching us asking if we want to buy more homes on some new-build sites than we would normally be being offered,"" she says, estimating that might make another 5,000 properties available in the next few years. Her housing authority alone buys 20 a year, and purchases would be spread across the country. Other experts the BBC spoke to thought this was a reasonable target. In outline, her plan would work like this: the government gives a council or housing association an average of £80,000 to buy and do up a property. They would also need to borrow some money on top of that, but the interest they pay is usually less than a company would. These properties would be used for current social housing tenants, and when they move out of their existing houses, asylum seekers would move in - after any necessary repairs had been made - with the government paying their rent to the councils and associations to cover their costs. ""We'll have 10 new houses that we can use to relieve some of the needs of our existing residents and then we can also move asylum seekers into any houses that they are vacating,"" she argues. In the longer term, ""there will be 10 more houses to let to the local population or to use for other types of homelessness need."" She calculates an investment of £1.75bn could enable the purchase and renovation of 14,000 to 16,000 homes. The costs of rent would be similar to the cost of the housing benefit asylum seekers are not allowed to claim. Her analysis was checked by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which has its own model for assessing development opportunities being considered by housing associations. They said it ""stood up fine"". 'An asylum system in chaos' Rakib Ehsan of Policy Exchange argues there should be more social housing, but for British citizens not asylum seekers. But Kate Wareing says that under her plan, there would be homes for both. Rakib Ehsan also emphasises the concerns some people have over public safety, as long as most migrants continue to be young men from ""deeply patriarchal societies"". ""If we look at the demographic characteristics associated with small boat migrants in particular who went to the UK, they tend to originate from parts of the world which have a very different view when it comes to the treatment of women and girls,"" he says. But Kate believes her plan would be politically acceptable, because it makes newly refurbished homes available for local people who need them. Plus she argues asylum seekers could end up sharing a home with others in need, potentially reducing social tensions. Getty Images Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, is being expanded If the government wants to change tack, it has a chance next year, when there is a break point in the 10-year contracts with the three asylum housing providers. John Perry, policy adviser to the Chartered Institute of Housing says: ""That's why this idea has currency. It is very encouraging local authorities appear to want to work with the government."" There is a risk, though, that a version of Kate Wareing's plan would take too long to put into effect, if it is to help the government meet its 2029 deadline. The Home Office insists the government inherited ""an asylum system in chaos"" and that it has reduced the backlog of claims by 24%, returned 35,000 people ""with no right to be here"", and cut hotel spending by over half a billion pounds. ""We are looking at a range of more sustainable, cost-effective and locally led sites including disused accommodation, industrial and ex-military sites, so we can reduce the impact on communities and taxpayers,"" a spokesperson said. If the government can meet its pledge to close the asylum hotels, the prize would be saving of £1bn per year, according to the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. But failure would give the government's main opponent, Reform, a big stick with which to beat it, at the next election. This issue could help decide the outcome.

16e14d0fcc1c,Reeves plans 'targeted action' on bills in Budget,,"Reeves plans 'targeted action' on bills in Budget Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said she is planning ""targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges"" in next month's Budget. Speaking to the BBC, she said it was the job of both the government and the Bank of England to reduce inflation. The UK's inflation rate is forecast to be the highest among the G7 group of developed nations this year and next. The BBC understands that the government could intervene to bring down energy bills, for example, by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy. Another option is to reduce some of the regulatory levies currently added to bills. The government will receive the next draft from the official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Monday, which will reveal how much space there is for such a measure. The expectation from most analysts is that Reeves will have to announce tax rises or spending cuts in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules Earlier on Thursday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated there was a £22bn gap for the chancellor to fill, which is at the lower end of expectations. ""There's a shared job between the Bank of England and the government to bear down further on some of the causes of inflation,"" Reeves told the BBC in Washington, at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. While much of the focus has been on likely tax rises, the chancellor said the latest information from the OBR had not changed her commitment to manifesto promises not to raise rates on income tax, VAT or National Insurance. She blamed an ""uncertain world"" with rising geopolitical and trade concerns for the Budget tax moves, likely to be focused on those ""with the broadest shoulders"". Referring to the concerns about the UK's economic relations with China she said: ""Our national security always come first."" Last week's announcement by China to tighten export controls on rare earths and other materials that are key for advanced tech manufacturing led US President Donald Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on imports from China, raising the prospect of an all-out trade war between the two economic giants. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called China's move ""economic coercion"" and ""a global supply chain power grab"". Asked about accepting the US offer to join it in its battle with China, Reeves said she was ""very concerned"" by China's actions and urged the Chinese government ""not to put up barriers and restrict access"". She said the move was ""bad for the global economy and creates further headwinds"". ""I believe there are areas where we must challenge China, but there are also important opportunities to sell into Chinese markets, including financial services and other areas of the economy. We've got to get that balance right."" The chancellor also confirmed she was working with G7 counterparts ""on our own critical minerals strategy, so that we are less reliant"". Reeves also acknowledged that the price the NHS pays for medicines could go up as a result of ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration and its drugs companies, in return for lower tariffs and investment. Some of the world's largest drug companies have said recently that they are either pausing or scrapping projects in the UK , with some blaming the low prices they are receiving. Last month, Science Minister Patrick Vallance said the price the NHS pays for medicines would need to rise to stop companies and pharmaceutical investment leaving the UK. Reeves told the BBC: ""We have seen because of the pricing regime, that clinical trials, new drugs have not been offered in the UK in the way that they are in other European countries. ""We want to make sure that people getting treatment from the NHS are able to access the best life-saving drugs in the world.

Housing Secretary Steve Reed had been due to rule on the application by 21 October, but the deadline has been pushed back to 10 December. It is the second time the government has delayed a decision on the controversial site. A ruling had originally been due by 9 September after ministers took control of the process from Tower Hamlets, the local council, last year. China bought the site of the proposed new embassy, at Royal Mint Court, near the Tower of London, for £255m in 2018. At 20,000 square metres, the proposed complex would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead. But Beijing's plans for the sprawling new embassy have sparked fears its location - near London's financial district - could pose an espionage risk.

cb9a4d297a9b,"'Wrong' to block Tel Aviv fans from Aston Villa match, says PM",,"Blocking Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an Aston Villa match is the ""wrong decision"", the prime minister has said. Followers of the Israeli team will not be allowed to attend the Europa League match between the sides on 6 November because of safety concerns, the body responsible for issuing safety certificates for matches said on Thursday . Sir Keir Starmer criticised the move, saying ""we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets"" and that the role of police was ""to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation"". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch branded the decision a ""national disgrace"" and suggested Sir Keir should act to reverse it. She wrote on X that Starmer should ""guarantee that Jewish fans can walk into any football stadium in this country"". ""If not, it sends a horrendous and shameful message: there are parts of Britain where Jews simply cannot go."" West Midlands Police said the game had been classified as high risk and that it had concerns about its ability to deal with potential protests at the match at Villa Park. It said this was based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including ""violent clashes and hate crime offences"" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024. More than 60 people were arrested over the violence which city officials described as a ""toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger"" over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East. The Safety Advisory Group, which issues safety certificates for matches, told Aston Villa that no travelling fans would be permitted at the match in Birmingham. Aston Villa said it was in ""continuous dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities,"" with the safety of supporters and local residents ""at the forefront of any decision"". Football's European governing body Uefa said it wanted fans to be able to travel and support their team in a ""safe, secure and welcoming environment"". Uefa told Reuters: ""In all cases, the competent local authorities remain responsible for decisions related to the safety and security of matches taking place on their territory."" Ayoub Khan, the independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, welcomed the decision: ""From the moment that the match was announced, it was clear that there were latent safety risks that even our capable security and police authorities would not be able to fully manage."" Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called the decision ""shameful"" and urged officials to reverse it. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was ""a serious mistake,"" adding: ""You don't tackle antisemitism by banning its victims. This decision must be reversed."" Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the move ""takes racial discrimination to a whole new level"". Various sporting events have seen protests over the war in Gaza, including when Israel's national team played Norway and Italy in recent World Cup qualifiers. Earlier on Thursday, the prime minister said it was his ""responsibility"" to address how many in the Jewish community were feeling ""insecure and unsafe"", particularly after the attack at a Manchester synagogue in early October that killed two men. During a visit to the Community Security Trust (CST) - a charity that provides security at Jewish sites such as synagogues and schools - he told Jewish News : ""We have heard loud and clear in the last few days and weeks that words are not enough.

f74c8f39dba6,"UK emissions would rise under Tory energy plan, Coutinho says",,"UK emissions would rise under Tory energy plan, Coutinho says Joshua Nevett Political reporter ""Emissions would go up domestically"" under Tory plans, says Claire Coutinho The Conservative shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho has admitted carbon emissions would rise in the UK under her party's plan to scrap net zero policies. In a BBC interview, Coutinho defended her party's pledge to axe the law that legally requires the UK government to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. Coutinho argued net zero had become a ""religion"" that had increased electricity costs and made climate change ""worse"" by exporting emissions abroad. She said a Conservative government would be focused on lowering energy bills and expanding the UK's oil and gas sector in the North Sea. Coutinho spoke to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast after announcing her party's plan to reduce energy bills at its conference earlier this month. The Conservatives said they would repeal the Climate Change Act 2008, ditch carbon taxes on electricity generation and cut a funding scheme for renewables. When asked if she accepted emissions would go up under this plan, Coutinho said: ""So emissions would go up domestically but I would argue not necessarily globally. ""And this is the problem that we've got. The Climate Change Act is specifically focused on domestic emissions."" The UK's legally binding targets are set on the basis of emissions within the country's territorial borders. That means emissions associated with imports to the UK, such as gas, steel or cement from abroad, are not taken into account. Coutinho said: ""So if you don't have AI in Britain, that's great for the Climate Change Act. But it doesn't make a bit of difference to global emissions."" The shadow energy secretary said the question of whether her party's plan ""would be a better or worse decarbonisation path I think is actually up for grabs"". The Conservatives have not stated how they intend to lower emissions globally or how they would measure greenhouse gases released beyond the UK's borders. This week, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed that 2024 had seen a record rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. In its latest progress report , the Climate Change Committee (CCC) said ""emissions in the UK have been steadily decreasing, with levels in 2024 50.4% below those in 1990"". The CCC, which is the UK's government climate adviser, said data from 2022 showed imported emissions were at their highest level since 2007. But the committee added: ""The reduction in territorial emissions since 1990 significantly outweighs the increase in emissions from imports over that period, reflecting the fact that emissions reductions in the UK have largely occurred without offshoring emissions."" The net zero target was passed into law by the government of Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019. Since then, the political consensus on net zero has broken down, with the Conservatives and Reform UK blaming green policies for higher energy prices. In contrast, the Labour government is aiming for clean power to meet 95% of electricity demand by 2030, and Miliband has pledged to lower average bills by £300 by that date. The BBC understands Chancellor Rachel Reeves is considering action to bring down energy bills, for example, by reducing levies. Coutinho was the energy secretary in the previous Conservative government and during her tenure in 2023, she said ""nothing will distract us from achieving net zero or driving forward renewables"". But Coutinho told Political Thinking she had been on a ""journey"" since then. ""I thought this was a good thing and we needed to be careful about how we were doing it,"" Coutinho said. ""But the more I got under the bonnet, the more I realised, actually, what we're doing is counterproductive."" A Labour spokesperson said accused the Conservatives of leaving ""families and businesses exposed to the worst cost-of-living crisis in memory"". ""Instead of learning their lessons, they now want to double down on their failure and strap Britain even further onto the fossil fuel rollercoaster,"" the spokesperson said. ""The only way you take back control of our energy is with this government's clean energy mission, with record investment in renewables and nuclear power."" Integration comments Coutinho, who is also shadow minister for equalities, was also asked her views on immigration, integration and comments made by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick. In a speech in March, which was secretly recorded and subsequently published by the Guaridan newspaper, Jenrick said the Handsworth area of Birmingham was ""one of the worst-integrated places"" he had ever been to. He said he had spent an hour-and-a-half there and not seen ""another white face"" during his visit, adding: ""It's not about the colour of your skin or your faith, of course it isn't. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives."" When asked if she would have made those comments, Coutinho said: ""Yes, I would. ""I think this again is where people get things wrong. We can be very clear about what it means to be a member of our nation state."" She added ""that shouldn't make us unafraid to use language and speak plainly about things which are worrying"". You can listen to the full episode of Political Thinking on BBC Sounds.

About 1.8 million veterans are eligible to download the new digital ID to a smartphone - with ministers saying the rollout can serve as a ""case study"" to show the public how the technology for a planned scheme for all British citizens and residents will work. Physical veterans' cards will continue to be issued, but the digital version will allow holders to prove their status more easily to access to public services, the government says. Digital government minister Ian Murray said the veterans' digital ID could also help address ""legitimate concerns around privacy and security"" of the UK-wide scheme. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the plans for the wider scheme last month as part of efforts to clamp down on illegal working. It will be introduced by 2029 and mandatory in order to work. The digital veteran card is optional but the government says it will allow former service personnel to show their entitlement to services such as GP and mental health support, supported housing, careers advice as well as reduced entry prices at museums and money off their shopping. Murray said the veterans ID was ""probably a demonstration to the public by default... on the basis that this is the first use case for having a digital credential on your smartphone, and that digital credential is the first sort of verifiable one that government have now launched"". Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: ""We are modernising our public services so they work around people's lives and keep pace with the digital world we live in. ""The digital veterans' card will help remove barriers, reduce red-tape and make it easier for people to access the public services they need.""

86c0e19f88ea,Reform UK-led council refuses fracking ban call,,"The Reform-led Lancashire County Council has refused to call on the government to permanently ban fracking. It comes after they were asked to back a ban in a motion put forward by the Labour group leader Mark Clifford at a council meeting. He said recent comments by Reform UK deputy leader MP Richard Tice about lifting bans on the controversial process have caused ""deep concern among Lancashire residents"". Fracking was effectively banned in 2019 after a moratorium was introduced following a series of earthquakes at the Preston New Road site in Fylde. Lancashire's Reform UK-led administration insists it is being 'pragmatic' in case the situation changes around fracking and have previously ruled out a return to drilling. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband announced at this year's Labour party conference that the government is planning to pass a new law that would ban fracking for shale gas permanently in England. At a meeting of the full council on Wednesday, councillors voted for an amended motion from Reform UK County Councillor Joel Tetlow which removed the word 'fracking' and replaced it with 'extracting shale gas'. The amended motion also called for the ""continuation of the moratorium, while commissioning a full independent review of domestic energy sources"". Councillor Mark Clifford said: ""There was nothing to even amend, it was ridiculous, the people of Lancashire have already spoken. ""We do not want fracking in Lancashire, why does Reform UK want to see the return of fracking?"" The leader of Lancashire County Council, Reform UK's Stephen Atkinson said: ""This was purely a political motion put forward to try and scaremonger the people of Lancashire, what we did was to make it sensible. ""In the Fylde coast it didn't work, but there is new technology coming all the time and Reform's position is let's do this scientifically, so if it's not safe, it'll not happen.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy517l3y7do,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7315/live/f4e1cb50-aabb-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg,2025-10-17T05:40:41.247000+00:00,2e15aa775b1e43355856c53336ac0e27967b4ce0
01aee1479147,MPs demand chief prosecutor explain China spy case collapse,,"MPs demand chief prosecutor explain China spy case collapse Paul Seddon Political reporter PA Media Stephen Parkinson has been criticial of Sir Keir Starmer's time as head of the CPS The director of public prosecutions is facing mounting pressure to further explain the collapse of a case against two men accused of spying for China. MPs are demanding Stephen Parkinson give a ""fuller explanation"" of why charges against parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33, were dropped last month. Both men deny the allegations. Parkinson has blamed the collapse of the case on a failure by the government to provide enough evidence showing China was a threat to the UK's national security. But calls for clarification have grown after the government published witness statements on Wednesday outlining the threat posed by Beijing. The chairs of four parliamentary committees have given Mr Parkinson, the boss of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), until Friday next week to answer a series of questions about why the case collapsed. He is also likely to hauled before MPs to give evidence, with a joint national security committee of MPs and peers also launching a formal inquiry. Labour MP Matt Western, who chairs the committee, said there were ""many questions yet to be answered"" by both Mr Parkinson and the government. Western added that the committee would hope to hear from ""the government and officials"" as soon as possible. Another parliamentary group, the intelligence and security committee, has launched a separate probe into how classified material was used during the case. Witness statements Mr Cash and Mr Berry were charged last year under the 1911 Official Secrets Act, accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. This legislation requires prosecutors to prove that suspects have passed on material that could be ""directly or indirectly useful to an enemy"". In a letter to MPs last week, Mr Parkinson said a court ruling in a separate case following the charges meant this included countries deemed to pose a ""threat to the national security of the UK"" at the time of the alleged offences. He added that CPS lawyers had dropped the case after failing to obtain sufficient evidence from the government describing China to this effect. It prompted a row with ministers, with Sir Keir Starmer saying he was ""deeply disappointed"" the prosecutions did not go ahead and taking the unusual step of publishing government witness statements given to the CPS. The three statements, written by deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, are clear that the Chinese are carrying out spying operations against the UK. In the documents, he said China was carrying out ""large scale espionage"" against the UK and was ""the biggest state-based threat to the country's economic security"". Criticism of Starmer Mr Parkinson met senior MPs on Wednesday, and is reported to have told them the government's evidence fell ""5%"" short of what would have been required to stand a chance of getting a conviction. But some MPs have continued to question why the CPS did not deem it had enough evidence to continue the case. It has thrust Mr Parkinson, who was appointed director of public prosecutions in September 2023 under the previous Conservative government, into the heart of an abnormally public row with ministers. The episode is especially unusual because Mr Parkinson is himself a successor to Sir Keir, with the prime minister having led the CPS between 2013 and 2018, before he first entered Parliament two years later. A former senior partner at law firm Kingsley Napley, Parkinson initially trained as a barrister before switching to become a solicitor in 2005. Before his appointment as director of public prosecutions, he had been critical of Sir Keir's own time in the role, describing the now-prime minister as ""an average DPP"" in a May 2023 interview with The Times. He was quoted as saying the Labour leader ""was over-reliant on advice given by others; he had no in-depth experience of prosecuting… he was a defence and human rights lawyer"". In an interview in April , Mr Parkinson described how he had initially not applied to university due to poor predicted grades, before deciding to reconsider after his actual results turned out to be better than expected. He took a year out to apply to study law, during which he worked as a dustman, on a kibbutz and as a ballpoint pen salesman in South Africa.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgd5jgzdweo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5c0d/live/d66487c0-ab3e-11f0-86b3-2dd47a6542fa.jpg,2025-10-17T11:31:08.840000+00:00,0078912558c6bdc89d369e7e2fc51660914b7093
85bd66310eff,Government loses bid to block Palestine Action ban appeal,,"The government has failed in its attempt to block a challenge against its decision to ban Palestine Action under terrorism laws. In a highly significant ruling, the Court of Appeal paved the way for the review of the ban before a High Court judge next month. The co-founder of Palestine Action, Huda Ammori, had won permission earlier this year for that judicial review of the Home Secretary's ban. Ministers then tried to stop the hearing from going ahead, arguing that Parliament had set out a specific and alternative process for appealing against banning orders. The ban, which started on 5 July, makes membership of, or support for, the direct action group a criminal offence. More than 2,100 people have been arrested in demonstrations since the group was banned. During those protests, they have held up signs reading ""I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action"". Some 170 of the protesters have been charged with allegedly showing support for the group, which can lead to six months in jail. Under terrorism laws, any group that is banned by ministers can ask to be ""deproscribed"" through a complicated internal review by the Home Office. That process that can take months to complete. If ministers decide the ban should still remain in force, the order can be reconsidered by judges in a special semi-secret court, the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission (POAC). In practice, this means that any group that is banned, but believes it can show it is not involved in terrorism, would spend potential one year or more fighting its case. Lawyers for Ms Ammori argued that the unusual circumstances of the group's ban - and the level of public support for the direct action group - meant that process was not fair and the ban should be immediately reviewed by the High Court. They said Parliament had not explicitly ruled out a faster process to immediately challenge a ban, even though it had created the alternative slower appeal process. Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, said Ms Ammori could lawfully bring her challenge to the initial decision to proscribe Palestine Action, rather than have to wait for the outcome of the longer POAC process. ""An application to deproscribe, with a right of appeal to POAC, was not intended to be a means of challenging the initial decision,"" she said in her ruling on Friday morning. She said a judicial review would be a ""quicker means of challenging the order proscribing Palestine Action, than applying to deproscribe"". ""Judicial review would enable the High Court to give an authoritative judgement on whether or not not it was lawful to proscribe Palestine Action. ""That judgment could then be relied on in criminal courts hearing charges against any person arrested in connection with their support of Palestine Action."" Ms Ammori also won a second related application to expand her case in November. This means she has permission to present wider grounds to the High Court about why she says the ban is unlawful.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9dg5v43vmo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8426/live/b75f8090-ab53-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg,2025-10-17T12:38:20.221000+00:00,8d6e0a763dc82364afa5a292defccdd34963f388

Funding is currently controlled by the Department for Education, but is to be transferred to the Greater Lincolnshire Combined County Authority (GLCCA) as part of the government devolution deal. Dame Andrea said: ""This money is far better spent across the county where everybody can access literacy."" According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service , the mayor told a GLCCA meeting: ""I think we need a more inclusive scheme which actually goes to the Lincolnshire people. ""We've got to upskill them because they are left behind, very sadly. ""As a combined authority I think it would be wonderful to have a scheme which focuses on literacy and numeracy to upskill everybody.

a278aa84916a,China warns UK of 'consequences' over mega-embassy delays,,"China has warned the UK of ""consequences"" amid an escalating row over its delayed application to build a mega-embassy in London. It comes after the government confirmed it had pushed back a decision on the controversial site for a second time, to 10 December. On Friday, Beijing's foreign affairs ministry said the delay went ""entirely against the UK's commitments and previous remarks about improving China-UK relations"". Downing Street said it did not ""recognise any claims of commitments or assurances"", adding that the planning process was independent of ministers. Asked about the latest delay on Friday, Beijing's ministry of foreign affairs accused the UK of ""constantly complicating and politicizing the matter"". Spokesman Lin Jian said the UK had ""repeatedly put off the approval of the project citing various excuses and linked the project with other issues"". ""That goes entirely against the UK's commitments and previous remarks about improving China-UK relations,"" he added. ""We once again call on the UK to fulfill its obligation and honor its commitments at once, otherwise the consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by the UK side"". Downing Street hit back at Mr Jian's comments, saying: ""We do not recognise any claims of assurances, and I can't explain the statement they've set out."" The PM's official spokesman added: ""Protecting the UK's national security is our first duty. ""In terms of the planning process, as set out yesterday, this is a decision that is independent of the rest of government. ""It would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment further on cases before MHCLG (Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government) ministers. "" China bought the site of the proposed new embassy, at Royal Mint Court near the Tower of London, for £255m in 2018. At 20,000 square metres, the proposed complex would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead. The pending decision on whether to approve the new embassy has attracted close scrutiny because of concerns about the security implications of the plan, including the location, size and design of the building. There are concerns held by some opponents that the site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into nearby fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London. Beijing's application for the embassy was initially rejected by Tower Hamlets Council in 2022 over safety and security concerns. However, it was taken over by the government last year, after China resubmitted an application one month after Labour came to power. Sir Keir Starmer said last year that Chinese President Xi Jinping had raised the embassy issue during their first leaders' phone call in August. Speaking in November, the prime minister told China's leader ""you raised the Chinese embassy building when we spoke on the telephone, and we have since taken action by calling in that application"".

5851794eea24,Two men plead not guilty over fires at homes linked to PM,,"Two men have pleaded not guilty to plotting a series of arson attacks at properties connected to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Ukrainian nationals Roman Lavrynovych, 21, and Petro Pochynok, 35, were accused of targeting two properties and a car linked to the PM, along with Ukrainian-born Romanian national Stanislav Carpiuc, 27. The men appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from HMP Belmarsh in south-east London on Friday. The charges relate to three incidents: a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address where he previously lived in north-west London. Mr Lavrynovych, of Sydenham, and Mr Pochynok, of north London, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. The charge alleged that the men ""together with others"" conspired to damage by fire property ""belonging to another and intending to endanger the life of another or being reckless as to the life of another would thereby be endangered"". Mr Carpiuc, of Romford, was not asked to enter his plea for the same charge. The prosecution indicated that the case was not being treated as having a terrorist connection.

c920ae8abc3a,"UK should shoot Russian jets in Nato airspace, says Farage",,"UK should shoot Russian jets in Nato airspace, says Farage Sam Francis Political reporter EPA Reform UK leader Nigel Farage says Britain should shoot down Russian jets if they enter Nato airspace, as he hit back at claims he admired Vladimir Putin. Speaking to Bloomberg news, Farage said he would send British troops to Ukraine as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force if he became prime minister. Farage has been dogged by accusations of sympathy for Putin since saying in 2014 that he ""admired"" the Russian president ""as an operator"" and that the West provoked Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is Putin's longstanding position. Labour Party Chair Anna Turley accused Farage of ""panicking and desperately trying to backtrack"" on his views about Putin. Turley said Farage ""can't help himself"" and was ""still peddling the Russian line on their illegal invasion of Ukraine being the fault of the West,"" in the interview with Bloomberg's Mishal Husain. ""Putin doesn't have to pay Nigel Farage to spout Russian talking points - he does it for free."" According to Bloomberg, Farage reiterated arguments that Nato and the EU's ""endless eastward expansion"" helped drive Russia to invade Ukraine. But he significantly hardened his position on Putin, who he called ""a very bad dude"" in the interview. Asked if he would back the prime minister's commitment to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire in the war with Russia, Farage said: ""I'd be very cautious about doing that."" While he said he would not want ""badged"" British Army soldiers there, he could support their presence as part of a UN peacekeeping force. Asked what he would do if Russian jets crossed into allied airspace, Farage replied: ""Gotta shoot them down."" On 10 September, about 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting Nato jets to shoot some of them down. Following the incursion, Royal Air Force (RAF) jets were deployed to fly air defence missions over Poland to counter aerial threats from Russia. Farage said he would support spending frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine. He also criticized Putin for not joining US President Donald Trump's efforts to stop the fighting. ""I was really hoping that Trump would bring Putin to heel, that some kind of compromise could be struck, as it's just been recently struck with Gaza and Israel. Clearly, that is not going to happen. ""I suspect what you will see over the course of the coming months, the Americans beginning to deliver Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv,"" Farage said. ""I think Trump feels that Putin has made a fool of him."" Farage's interview with Bloomberg came only hours before Trump announced plans to meet Putin in Budapest to discuss the war. In social media video ahead of his Bloomberg interview, Farage said he hoped it would put an end to the ""old Russia hoax stuff that comes up again and again"". In the post he said: ""If Russian planes encroach over Nato territory, Britain should shoot them down."" In late March 2014, GQ Magazine published parts of an interview with Farage, who was then the leader of UKIP. In response to a question about the current world leader he admires the most, Mr Farage said: ""As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. ""The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?"" Farage's position on Putin has faced fresh scrutiny this week after Reform UK's ex-Welsh leader admitted taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia while a UKIP Member of the European Parliament. Last month, Nathan Gill, pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. Gill was one of seven UKIP politicians elected to the Senedd in 2016 when the party was led by Farage and then became Reform's leader in Wales. Following the revelation Farage said he knew Gill as a ""God-fearing Christian, somebody that you would think was the least corruptible person"". While campaigning in Wales, Farage said he was ""stunned"" to learn of Gill's crimes and insisted he ""didn't know anything about"" his pro-Russian statements. Farage's remarks to Bloomberg echoed Trump's call last month for Nato forces to shoot down Russian planes that breach their airspace. Shortly afterwards, Polish Foreign Affairs Minister Radosław Sikorski responded to a clip of Trump's comments, saying ""Roger that"". Trump's own stance on Russia has toughened since he began his second presidential term expressing trust in Putin, and heavily criticising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a fiery meeting in the White House in February. Following Russia's incursion into Polish airspace, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said ""the UK will support Nato's efforts to bolster its eastern flank through Eastern Sentry"". The RAF aircraft ""are not just a show of strength, they are vital in deterring aggression, securing Nato airspace, and protecting our national security and that of our allies,"" he added. Since then, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the option of shooting down a fighter jet that is intruding into Nato airspace is ""on the table"". Earlier this week, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte met defence ministers to discuss easing rules so troops can shoot down Russian jets.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051z2dm357o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a83d/live/7947d710-ab50-11f0-b8f7-53e42d500151.jpg,2025-10-17T13:24:17.600000+00:00,38b1e95144868ab851a6c2e50f21794528c897c7

The party took the seats of Guildford South East, Caterham Valley and Camberley West on Surrey County Council. They also won three borough and district council ward by-elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey said that ""what remains of the Blue Wall is crumbling away."" Lib Dem candidate Catherine Houston won Guildford South East by polling 638 more votes than the Conservatives and gaining the seat from the Residents 4 Guildford and Villages group. In the Camberley West division, Alan Ashbery picked up the seat with 1,617 votes, which was another gain, this time from the Conservatives. At Spelthorne Borough Council, Laura Barker gained the Staines Ward from the Green Party. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats also retained the seats they already held in the Caterham Valley division at SCC, as well as the wards of Meadvale and St John's at Reigate and Banstead Borough Council and Whyteleafe at Tandridge District Council. Conservative leader of Surrey County Council Tim Oliver said the results were ""disappointing"" Reform UK came second in four out of the six by-elections. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said:  ""What remains of the Blue Wall is crumbling away. People across Surrey and beyond have voted for true community champions who will put them first. ""The Liberal Democrats are winning against the Conservatives, but also Labour, Reform and the Greens."" The Conservatives had previously lost their majority at SCC following two by-elections in August. The council leader, Tim Oliver, told BBC Radio Surrey: ""My focus is on delivering the best quality services that we can for our residents. ""Yes, it's disappointing, but at the end of the day I'll carry on doing the best job I can.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7819gl3j61o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e4c2/live/b08afa30-ab65-11f0-8210-51f58cb86203.jpg,2025-10-17T15:10:32.231000+00:00,1f6791cc552b5959716d078f72e49d59b84a7e00
6c9748032fd3,Is the Scottish government softening on oil and gas?,,"Is the Scottish government softening on oil and gas? Phil Sim Scotland political correspondent Getty Images At first glance, the Scottish government declining to take a position on something isn't hugely exciting. But the determination of ministers to stay out of the debate about the Rosebank oil field has been welcomed by business groups in Aberdeen. Norwegian oil giant Equinor has submitted a fresh application for permission to develop the field off Shetland, which could yield 300 million barrels of oil. Asked for a response by the Times newspaper, a Scottish government spokesman simply said these decisions are reserved to the UK government. John Swinney later told BBC Scotland that this was in line with a longstanding position. But the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce called it a ""subtle, nuanced, but nonetheless important signal from the Scottish government"". It does feel a far cry from the days when Nicola Sturgeon was declaring a climate emergency and hosting a global summit aimed at ending reliance on fossil fuels. But has there actually been a radical change in policy here? Getty Images John Swinney has said the position on oil licensing is ""complex"" It's actually quite hard to decipher whether something has changed, because the Scottish government currently doesn't have an energy strategy. A draft was published in 2023, including talk of a ""presumption against"" new oil and gas developments, but when Swinney became leader the following year the finalised plan was postponed until after the general election. That's more than a year ago now and there is still no hint of a definitive version coming forward, so we have to piece together the government's position somewhat from what ministers have told us in speeches and interviews. So let's follow the trail of breadcrumbs back a little. The licensing of offshore oil and gas fields, whether for exploration or extraction, is a matter reserved to the UK government. Unlike with fracking or new nuclear developments, which Scottish ministers can block using devolved planning powers, there is no opportunity for Holyrood to intervene. But that hasn't stopped ministers taking a view in the past. When the UK government consulted on its own climate strategy in 2022, the net zero secretary at the time, Michael Matheson, made a written submission talking about the ""fastest possible managed and just transition away from dependence on oil and gas"". Getty Images Renewable energy like onshore and offshore wind is the Scottish government's priority He also talked about a presumption against new exploration, something which was then talked about in the draft energy strategy published in January 2023. Specifically, the paper talked about ministers consulting on whether ""in order to support the fastest possible and most effective just transition, there should be a presumption against new exploration for oil and gas"". It's worth noting that the exploration has already been done in the case of Rosebank, over 20 years ago in fact - what's being applied for is a licence to develop the field, which would not fall foul of a presumption against new exploration . There are similarities here with the Labour UK government's position - that it opposes new exploration, but that North Sea production could continue for decades by exploiting already identified or established fields. Scottish government officials have also previously pointed out that a presumption against something doesn't necessarily mean you never do it. In the absence of a finalised energy strategy, Swinney has pointed to a "" Green industrial strategy "" published in September 2024 as making the government's position ""crystal clear"". But there is scant reference to oil and gas in the paper, and nothing at all on licensing. Away from the paper trail, has the political rhetoric changed over recent years? As noted, Sturgeon made climate policy a high priority - declaring a climate emergency in 2019 and later bringing the Greens into a partnership government. She notably took a stand against Cambo , another controversial development off Shetland, saying in 2021 that it ""should not get the green light"" because it ""could not and should not pass any rigorous climate assessment"". But she was actually criticised by climate campaigners for not opposing Rosebank in similar terms - even when doorstepped by young activists at COP27 in Egypt. Allow X content?

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’ . Accept and continue Sturgeon would harden her position after leaving office, retweeting a message from Green MP Caroline Lucas describing consent for Rosebank as ""the greatest act of environmental vandalism in my lifetime"". And her successor Humza Yousaf - for all that he dropped the government's climate targets and kicked the Greens out of office - also said consent for the field was the ""wrong decision"". But Friends of the Earth Scotland maintained that the government had never formally opposed Rosebank. And when John Swinney took over from Yousaf, he was keen to make the government far more business-friendly - bringing Kate Forbes back into the fold to front a charm offensive. Within a month of becoming deputy first minister, she announced that the SNP was positioned ""in between"" Labour and the Conservatives on licensing, and that applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis . Swinney himself declined to commit to a presumption against new developments, saying the issue was ""complex"" . To be clear, renewables are still very much the priority for the Scottish government. That's been underlined repeatedly while Labour have been pushing for new nuclear developments - long term, Swinney remains committed to a transition away from oil and gas and towards the likes of wind, wave and hydrogen power. Getty Images Kate Forbes was brought into government in part to try to win over businesses When questioned on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister stated that ""any development taken forward must be compatible with our journey of climate action"". But once again he ducked the specific question of whether there is a presumption against new oil developments, saying that ""there are a whole number of different developments we are still considering as we finalise the energy strategy"". It's worth remembering that one of Swinney's first projects was to distance the SNP from any particularly controversial topics. His administration dropped any support for the gender reforms pursued by the Sturgeon regime. A proposed ban on conversion therapy has been pushed down to Westminster for a UK-wide response - essentially making it someone else's problem. And there are echoes of this in the position on Rosebank, where Swinney stressed that there is a ""due process"" underway. Why take on the controversial story if it's ultimately someone else's decision? Getty Images Aberdeen and its oil industry hub is a key political battleground between the SNP and Conservatives There is also an election on the horizon and oil and gas is likely to be a key campaigning point in north east Scotland, where seats are chiefly contested between the SNP and the Conservatives. The Tories are already banging the drum for what they happily refer to as a ""drill, baby, drill"" approach. Leader Kemi Badenoch told an event at the Tory conference that passengers on a flight to Aberdeen had appealed for help for a city which is ""dying"" . The SNP seem keen to meet this head on. Stephen Flynn, the party's Westminster leader who is seeking to move to Holyrood in an Aberdeen constituency, last week claimed workers were being pushed off a ""cliff edge"" by Sir Keir Starmer. And Kate Forbes used her SNP conference speech to demand the Chancellor replaces the ""destructive"" windfall tax on oil and gas firms at the next budget. Some at Holyrood are sceptical that we will see a finalised energy strategy this side of the election, because the lack of one allows the SNP to campaign as they please. Again, this all has to be taken in the context of a government which remains firmly committed to a renewable energy future for Scotland. But the position on oil and gas has always been pretty nuanced - and Swinney is unlikely to see this as the moment to make any radical moves.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl2nwk7424o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0610/live/52d85240-ab4f-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg,2025-10-17T13:04:28.282000+00:00,a81347582f3b7afaf27a1e59b5dae7baa10d5cad
f61c6dea99b2,Tories give ex-Reform MP Lowe seat on top committee,,"The Conservatives say they will hand ex-Reform MP Rupert Lowe a seat on an influential Commons committee as he ""shares our values on cutting waste"". The Great Yarmouth MP will take one of the three seats reserved for Tories on the public accounts committee, which oversees government spending. Lowe was elected in 2024 as Reform UK MP, but was thrown out in March after a major falling out with the party leadership. The MP said he was ""delighted"" with the appointment to the committee and will use the ""opportunity to directly scrutinise senior figures from across the public sector on how your tax is being spent"". In a post on social media, Lowe said: ""I am acutely aware of how hard British men and women work to pay their tax, an always-increasing amount. ""All of us in Parliament must treat it with the utmost care. ""I have committed a huge amount of time and energy to working on a cross-party basis in Westminster to deliver on a number of important campaigns. This is a continuation of that. ""I won't shy away from asking the awkward questions, I promise you that."" The 16 member public accounts committee, which is widely seen as one of the most powerful at Westminister, has a Labour majority but is chaired by Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. The BBC understands Lowe will take the place of Biggin Hill MP Peter Fortune, one of the two other Conservatives on the committee, so Fortune can focus on supporting the shadow science and technology team and his constituents. This is not the first time the Tories have offered MPs of different political affiliations one of their spots on a parliamentary committee. Rosie Duffield, the Canterbury MP who quit Labour after clashes over the party's stance women's and transgender rights, now holds a Conservative seat on the Women and Equalities Committee. DUP MP Sammy Wilson, who has expressed scepticism about man-made climate change, occupies one of their spots on the Environmental Audit Committee. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""As Kemi Badenoch demonstrated when she made the offer to sit-down with Keir Starmer to help get proper welfare savings through Parliament, the Conservatives will work cross-party if it is in the national interest. ""We want the Public Accounts Committee to do its job of ensuring taxpayers get better value for money from the state, as well as identifying areas of government waste. ""Having someone who has run a business and shares our values on cutting waste on this Committee will help meet that goal."" Since his exit from Reform, several Conservatives have struck up closer ties with Lowe. Conservative ex-cabinet minister Sir Gavin Williamson has joined the advisory board of Restore Britain, the ""political movement"" set up by Lowe. While Esther McVey, another Tory ex-minister, joined the panel of Lowe's Rape Gang Inquiry, looking into gang-based sexual exploitation across the UK. The investigation is running in parallel to the government-backed national inquiry into grooming gangs launched in June.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40g5x4j3vo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/53b8/live/76f9bad0-ab70-11f0-9045-ff945a3371d8.jpg,2025-10-17T16:05:39.233000+00:00,dca3ec4fd1a0400cd83a2d4267df7c9472231e79
