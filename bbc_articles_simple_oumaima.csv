a9dcc18ffdf6,Gerrard rejects chance to return as Rangers boss,,"Following the takeover by a US-based consortium in the summer - led by now-chairman Andrew Cavanagh - Rangers decided Martin was the man to lead the team forward on a three-year-deal. The former Rangers and Scotland defender got Southampton promoted to the Premier League, but was sacked after 13 defeats in their opening 16 Premier League matches the following campaign. The reception from supporters to Martin's appointment was frosty at best and he failed to win them over at any stage of his tortured 123-day tenure. The 39-year-old's final match was a 1-1 draw at Falkirk before the international break, following which he was given a police escort away from the stadium after fans tried to stop the team bus leaving. It took Rangers until late September to win in the league and the club were humiliated 9-1 on aggregate by Club Brugge in the Champions League play-offs. Martin left with the club 11 points behind leaders Hearts and nine behind Celtic, having earned just five victories in all competitions. Rangers' search for a replacement quickly alighted upon Gerrard, who was of interest to club's American owners in the summer, before a number of issues resulted in him withdrawing from the running. In a podcast recorded prior to Martin's sacking but released on Wednesday - Gerrard told former England team-mate Rio Ferdinand that he was keen to return to management. In that interview, Gerrard also said he wanted ""to be at a team that's going to compete to win because I think that suits me better"".

6808bebac505,Forest to consider Dyche if Postecoglou sacked,,"The 54-year-old Dyche has been out of work since leaving Everton in January. He was linked with the vacant manager's job at Rangers last week, but sources have told BBC Sport he is unlikely to be interested in that role. Forest, however, are likely to be of greater interest to Dyche, who lives in relatively close proximity to Nottingham and was a youth player at the club at the start of his career. Former City Ground favourites Ian Woan and Steve Stone have also been long-term members of Dyche's coaching staff during his managerial spells at Burnley and Everton. Forest will not be required to pay any compensation should they move for Dyche.

fdd09acd83ad,Hull KR beat Wigan in Grand Final for historic treble,,"Whereas the 2024 final was a tense and a low scoring affair, Hull KR flipped that script on its head with this year's war of attrition. Gone was the caginess of last year. And nerves? What nerves? This was a side made for the occasion, that knew they were on the cusp of greatness and took their opportunity. Yet it might not have been that way as they were off the pace in the opening stages, and were lucky not to fall behind when they failed to pick up French on the turnover prior to his score being chalked off. Other than that if they seemed unnerved by the occasion, knowing they were 80 minutes from a history-making treble, they did not seem to show it. Much had been said in the build-up to the game about Hull KR's recent and distant past - whether that is relegation in the Million Pound Game in 2016 or finishing bottom of Super League in 2020. Indeed, outside of some second-tier honours, you had to go back 40 years to the last time the Robins reigned supreme. Bolstered by the retiring Waerea-Hargreaves - who almost missed the game through suspension prior to KR's successful appeal this week - and Micky McIlorum, they soon carved open Wigan and never looked back. Robins talisman Lewis has gone from strength to strength in recent seasons but, much like his team, this feels like the moment in his career where he truly came alive. But this was a team performance. It was not won by individual moments of brilliance. It was a display befitting a treble-winning side and masterminded by an elite coach in Willie Peters. Hull KR have got better every season under Peters' tutelage and, on this evidence, it makes you wonder if they could be even more formidable in 2026.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/cx2jw497jpzo,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/3207/live/ccb3d220-a6df-11f0-acf6-8f6b3e7c0d55.jpg,2025-10-11T18:58:19.094000+00:00,c425c7c35925d011d958275ebf6238e0f564ec7e
5a9896552b65,'England's world-class duo put rivals on notice',,"They might be underdogs, but they possess two of the world's best. England were not favourites going into this World Cup, but if captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was fully fit and firing, and if spinner Sophie Ecclestone could exploit turning pitches at her disposal, there was a nagging sense of 'what if?'. Both hopes have come to fruition after their three opening games, with England sitting top of the table unbeaten and, though there was a near-miss against Bangladesh, it has mostly been smooth sailing. Yes, the fixtures have been kind to Sciver-Brunt's side, but they are doing all that is in their control, which is to simply keep winning. Beat Pakistan on Wednesday, as they should, and they will be in a very promising position to seal a semi-final spot without having yet played favourites India or Australia. Regarding the latter of those two teams, England have scars after the 16-0 Ashes thumping at the beginning of the year, but under coach Charlotte Edwards they are beginning to heal. Sciver-Brunt is the quiet, composed captain who lets her cricket do the talking - exemplified by a sparkling 117 against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Saturday. Her ability to bowl again after injury has also completely rejuvenated the balance of the side. Her fifth World Cup century is a women's cricket record, celebrated by honouring her baby boy Theo in the crowd - testament to a life-changing year that has seen her become a mum and England captain in the space of a few months. Ecclestone, who took 4-17 in the Sri Lanka win, is the teenage prodigy who rapidly became world number one, still just 26 years old, but already fifth on the list of all-time wicket-takers in the women's game. A difficult Ashes for Ecclestone personally led her to consider quitting, but on the biggest stage she is shining again. ""To be able to hand the ball to her and bowl 10 overs straight without going for many runs and pick up four wickets, it is really special,"" said Sciver-Brunt. ""From the time she was 16 and came into the team, we knew we had something special on our hands. ""She has really grown in the last couple of months as well - I suppose we challenged her to really improve herself and to really make a mark on this team, so I am very pleased with her.""

2ec404cc7fd7,Sciver-Brunt and Ecclestone star as England go top,,"England remain unbeaten in the Women's World Cup after Nat Sciver-Brunt's sensational century and a remarkable spell of 4-17 from Sophie Ecclestone set up a crushing 89-run win over Sri Lanka in Colombo. Having put England in to bat, Sri Lanka were left to rue dropping Sciver-Brunt on three, as she punished them with a run-a-ball 117 in England's competitive 253-9. The game was delicately poised with England 179-6 after 40 overs, but the captain timed her acceleration to perfection with 49 runs coming from the last five. In reply, Sri Lanka's captain and key batter Chamari Athapaththu retired hurt early in their innings, but fellow opener Hasini Perera and Harshitha Samarawickrama led a promising recovery to 95-1. But the co-hosts' lack of batting depth cost them, despite Athapaththu's return to the crease before she fell for 15, and they finished 164 all out in the 46th over, Ecclestone's often-unplayable spell of turn and bounce doing the damage. England's third win in a row puts them top of the eight-team table, one point above defending champions Australia. Earlier, Sciver-Brunt played a lone hand as the rest of England's top order made promising starts but were unable to capitalise, with opener Tammy Beaumont's 32 the next-highest contribution. Amy Jones was run out for 11 and Beaumont was caught in the covers, before Sciver-Brunt and former captain Heather Knight consolidated with a patient stand of 60. Knight was caught sweeping for 29 and England suffered another middle-order wobble to spin, including the loss of Emma Lamb and Alice Capsey to Inoka Ranaweera in the 35th over. The discipline of Dean stabilised England again as she added 38 for the seventh wicket with Sciver-Brunt, which allowed the skipper to kick on at the death and ensure they had set a winning score.

029e9f535964,Wilshere top choice to take Luton job,,"Former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is the number one choice of the Luton Town board to take over as manager at Kenilworth Road.

The 33-year-old has held talks with the Hatters and is in pole position to replace Matt Bloomfield who was dismissed earlier this week.

Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens made it down to the final two but Wilshere is close to landing the job. A deal is yet to be finalised.

His last role was as interim coach at Norwich at the end of last season where he took over for the final two games following Johannes Hoff Thorup's sacking.

Wilshere was then overlooked for the permanent job, with the Canaries appointing Liam Manning, and was also linked to Plymouth Argyle before Tom Cleverley took charge.

Luton, who have suffered back-to-back relegations, have experienced a poor start to the 2025-26 campaign with five defeats from their opening 11 games to leave them 11th in League One.

Wilshere was under-18 coach at Arsenal before joining Norwich and was a contender for the Gunners' Under-21 role in the summer before withdrawing.

226cc9f4258b,Five-try Bath dominate Gloucester to top Prem,,"The Prem

Bath (28) 38

Tries: De Glanville, Dunn, Lawrence, Richards (2) Cons: Russell (5) Pens: Russell

Gloucester (7) 17

Tries: Joseph, Thorley, Loader Cons: Byrne

Bath moved to the top of the Prem table with a dominant win over West Country rivals Gloucester at the Recreation Ground.

The home side called upon British and Irish Lions Finn Russell and Will Stuart for the first time this season, with talismanic fly-half Russell playing a key role in Tom de Glanville's early try.

Further first half-scores followed for Tom Dunn, Ollie Lawrence and Ewan Richards before Will Joseph finally got the visitors on the board.

Ben Loader scored to give Gloucester hope early in the second half following excellent work from Joseph before Richards added his second to snuff out any chance of a comeback.

Both teams came into the match with injury worries, with Gloucester particularly badly affected as 14 players including Jack Singleton, Lewis Ludlow and Arthur Clark remained unavailable.

Bath took advantage of that lost experience early on, De Glanville scoring the game's opening try.

Russell's tackle in midfield dislodged the ball, allowing Lawrence to kick ahead. Henry Arundell then outpaced two Gloucester defenders to the ball and offloaded to De Glanville who picked his spot to dot down.

Bath's second duly followed, with Dunn the beneficiary of a rolling maul in the Gloucester 22 which slowly but surely crept towards the Gloucester line.

The home team scented blood and scored their third soon afterwards.

Arundell eluded a tackler in midfield, kicked ahead and then regathered before offloading to Tom Carr-Smith.

The scrum-half failed to make the line, but Bath recycled and with the Gloucester defence still reeling, Lawrence snuck through to increase Bath's lead.

A fourth try appeared inevitable and when it came it was irresistible and had Russell's fingerprints all over it.

Following a Gloucester infringement, the fly-half instantly kicked ahead. Ross Byrne was unable to gather and Richards kicked through before regathering to slide over the line.

Gloucester restored a measure of pride through Joseph's inspired solo score as half-time beckoned, but it had been a chastening 40 minutes for the Cherry and Whites.

In a moment of madness, Russell kicked the ball while lying in the ruck following the restart and was yellow-carded, but Gloucester were unable to immediately capitalise, losing the ball at the following lineout.

With Bath's new attack coach, Martin Gleeson , watching on, the home side rang the changes but the new additions were unable to prevent a second Gloucester try.

For a simple set-piece move, a miss-pass found Ollie Thorley on the outside to stride over with Bath's 14 men overstretched.

A comeback looked like it might be on the cards when Loader scored in the corner following a burst from the electric Joseph, but further reinforcements including ex-Cherry and Whites Santi Carreras and Chris Harris turned the tide back in Bath's favour.

First, Russell settled the nerves with a short-range penalty before the hugely impressive Richards strode through following a break from Miles Reid as the Gloucester defence fragmented.

Bath thought they had a sixth try through Joe Cokanasiga, which was ruled out for an earlier knock on, but Gloucester suffered a greater blow when Seb Atkinson was forced off late on to add to George Skivington's already lengthy injury list.

The result leaves Gloucester in eighth, two points ahead of bottom-placed Newcastle Red Bulls.

Bath head coach Johann van Graan told BBC Radio Bristol:

""We're very happy with that, I thought our first 20 minutes were excellent. We were clinical, we kept on turning them around, we had control, we scored some fantastic tries.

""We were really positive tonight, unfortunate about the try just before half-time. The yellow card put us under pressure, but I thought our impact [players] at the end of the game did really well and we controlled the game for the 80 minutes.""

Bath second-row Ewan Richards spoke to BBC Radio Bristol:

""I had to fill some big boots, [with] Quinn Roux missing, Charlie Ewels and Ted Hill also. I took my chance, I love being out here with the boys, it's special when it's at home and a derby day.""

On scoring his second try, Richards said:

""I wasn't really expecting it, but I just ran hard, luckily the ball bounced, I kicked it through and I got on the end of it. It was Finn who did the hard work and me just running through the line.""

Gloucester head coach George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

""It was a tough first half, they had all of the pressure, all the momentum, we were camped in our own 22.

""We had a good chat at half-time and for that first 20 minutes of the second half the boys really changed the momentum of the game and put a lot of pressure on Bath.

""We had some opportunities to get that fourth try but we weren't quite accurate enough, and at the end Bath had a flurry.

""Ultimately there are areas where we're just not accurate enough at the moment. We're not going to pretend that we're fizzing yet, we're not.

""There are moments and I think some of the players like Will Joseph are starting to find their feet now and combinations.""

It is not a number randomly picked by statistics boffins, but by Premier League history.

Northampton (17) 32

Tries: Smith, Todaro, Pearson, Belleau 2 Cons: Smith 2 Pen: Smith

Leicester (13) 26

Tries: Steward, Wells Cons: Searle 2 Pens: Searle 3, O'Connor

Northampton Saints claimed the early season bragging rights  with a see-saw 32-26 victory over local rivals Leicester Tigers at Cinch Stadium at Franklin's Gardens.

Bolstered by the return of Fin Smith, Alex Mitchell and centurion Tommy Freeman from their post-British and Irish Lions break, Saints took an early lead through Smith, before being pegged back by Freddie Steward's effort.

Billy Searle's kicking kept the visitors in touch, but tries from Edoardo Todaro, Tom Pearson and a brace from Anthony Belleau put the game beyond the visitors.

Despite the win, Saints fans will be worried about the state of their backline, with both Freeman and George Hendy forced from the field with injuries.

With Searle's early penalty obscured by the pre-match pyrotechnics, the first real action observed by the packed stands was the departure of referee Luke Pearce, who, suffering from a cramping calf, was replaced by Alex Thomas.

When the action resumed, it was the home team who took the initiative.

Mitchell darted down the short-side from a scrum and kicked ahead. Adam Radwan looked on helplessly as the ball bounced back over his head and was recovered by the scrum-half, who fed Smith for Saints' first points of the day.

That lead was not to last long, however.

Emeka Ilione burst through a hole in the Northampton line, but failed to pass before he was cut down by Saints defenders.

It proved not to matter, as Saints failed to number up appropriately in defence, allowing Steward to stride over untouched in the ensuing phase.

Before he was forced from the pitch, Freeman found himself in the thick of the action for the home side's second try.

A well-executed set-piece move saw the winger combine with Tom Litchfield to charge into Leicester territory. Freeman was eventually tackled, but the ball was recycled with Todaro the beneficiary to touch down in the corner.

With the clock in the red, the Saints struck again.

Todaro this time provided the assist, breaking through some poor tackles to feed Pearson, much to the delight of the home fans.

Saints were looking for defensive stability as the second half began, having shipped 54 points after the break in their two games so far this season.

But those familiar defensive frailties appeared once again when Harry Wells powered over from short range after successive rolling mauls in the Saints 22.

Losing the lead seemed to inspired Saints though and their next score was a vintage Northampton try.

An end-to-end counterattack involving Fraser Dingwall and Rory Hutchinson saw multiple quick off-loads as Leicester's defence reeled.

The talismanic Mitchell eventually laid hands on the ball, feeding Belleau to fight his way through three tacklers to score in the corner.

The lead changed for the eighth time following another Searle kick, before Dingwall had a score ruled out for an earlier knock-on.

Belleau then scored his second in spectacular style - kicking over the top and regathering to score, as Tigers' defenders watched on in desperation.

Debutant James O'Connor's penalty brought the visitors within six, but stout home defending denied them anything more than a losing bonus point.

The result leaves Saints top of the Prem table, before Bath's match against Gloucester at 17:30 BST.

Fellow Briton and world silver medallist Georgia Hunter Bell was second again in 1:58.33, while St Vincent's Shafiqua Maloney (1:58.57) was third.

Glasgow Warriors (14) 49

Tries : Steyn, Horne 2, Brown, Hiddleston, Matthews, penalty try Cons : Hastings 4, Horne, Lancaster

Dragons (0) 0

Glasgow Warriors plundered seven unanswered tries at Scotstoun as they crushed Dragons in the United Rugby Championship.

Captain Kyle Steyn and George Horne both crossed in the first half for Franco Smith's side, who were beaten at the death by Benetton last week.

There were further tries after the interval for Gregor Brown, Gregor Hiddleston, Horne and Johnny Matthews - as well as a penalty try in the final play - as Glasgow sealed their second league win from their opening three matches.

Warriors are third in the nascent league table, while winless Dragons are 14th of 16 teams.

After a disappointing second half in Italy last time out, Glasgow were again below their best level in the opening 40 minutes back at home.

They hit the front after 10 minutes, though, as Scotland centre Sione Tuipulotu took the ball to the line and released the onrushing Steyn inside him to score under the posts.

Brown - who was Glasgow's standout performer on the night - set up the second score by handing off one defender and then offloading superbly to Horne, who raced into the corner.

Dragons had their moments in the opening period but lacked a clinical touch.

Their best chance came and went when full-back Huw Anderson fizzed an unsympathetic pass out to wing David Richardson, who was unable to cling on with space in front of him.

Glasgow were much improved after the half-time break and Brown crashed over for his first try for the club soon after the restart.

Hooker Hiddleston then scored at the back of a rolling maul to secure the bonus point following a magnificent kick to touch by fly-half Adam Hastings.

The tries continued to flow as Steyn burst through two would-be tacklers before giving Horne a stroll under the posts for his 61st Glasgow try.

Dragons visibly tired as the half went on and Glasgow didn't let up, with replacement hooker Matthews sniping from close range to cross on his 100th Warriors appearance.

Then, in the game's final play Jamie Dobie was wiped out by Rio Dyer after a perfectly judged kick from Dan Lancaster. A penalty try was the result, wrapping up a comfortable victory for the hosts.

Wilson took command from the start with breaks of 74, 101 and 79 putting him 3-0 up, but fouls in the fourth frame gave O'Sullivan a way back into the match and he also won the fifth frame to cut the lead to 3-2. However, 40-year-old Englishman Wilson turned the tide with a 120 break in the sixth frame and although the seventh went down to the wire, he managed to book his place in the semi-finals.

f3c36f65eb05,Ospreys seal first win of the season against Zebre,,"United Rugby Championship: Ospreys v Zebre

Ospreys (14) 24

Tries: Cokanasiga, Morse, Ratti Cons: Edwards 3 Pen: Edwards

Zebre (0) 0

Ospreys enjoyed a first victory of the United Rugby Championship season by beating Zebre convincingly in Bridgend.

Tries from centre Phil Cokanasiga, number eight Morgan Morse and lock James Ratti and nine points from fly-half Dan Edwards delivered the win.

Ospreys stopped a sequence of four straight league defeats since beating Dragons in Swansea in April.

Zebre won their opening two games against Edinburgh and Lions but were poor opponents on this occasion, with the Italian side having now only won twice in 41 league matches in Wales.

Ospreys host Glasgow Warriors next Saturday, while Zebre are at home to unbeaten Stormers.

Ospreys lost their opening two games against Bulls and Stormers on their mini tour of South Africa.

They returned home for a first home match of a season at the Brewery Field, where the Ospreys are playing this season, with a crowd of 4,519 attending the contest against Zebre.

Ospreys hope to move into a redeveloped St Helen's in Swansea for the 2026-27 season, but they are still waiting on the Welsh Rugby Union review into the future of professional rugby, which could result in sides being cut.

It was a proud moment for Bridgend boy Dewi Lake to captain the Ospreys side in the absence of Wales flanker Jac Morgan who is still suffering from a calf injury.

Ospreys made two personnel changes to the starting side that lost to Stormers with Morse and prop Tom Botha coming in for Rhys Davies and Rhys Henry.

Flanker Harri Deaves led the side out on his 50th Ospreys appearance and the hosts opened the scoring with a well-worked try, finished by Cokanasiga, who dummied his way through the Zebre defence.

That was soon followed up by a wonderful move that was finished off by number eight Morse.

The flowing passage of play included clever offloads from player of the match and full-back Jack Walsh, centre Keiran Williams and Edwards, who also slotted over the conversion.

Ospreys suffered a blow when Wales scrum-half Kieran Hardy was forced off injured and replaced by Reuben Morgan-Williams.

The Ospreys scrum, which had struggled in the opening couple of games, was on top in the first half as the home side led 14-0 at half-time.

A quiet second half was almost brought alive by a well-worked try for centre Williams, but he was denied because of a knock-on.

Another scrum penalty saw Edwards slot over a penalty before Ospreys initially spurned a third try after replacement centre Tom Florence burst through before inexplicably failing to deliver a try-scoring pass to Morgan-Williams.

The hosts did not have to wait too long as Ratti, having moved to the back row, crashed over before Ospreys were denied a bonus-point try.

Ospreys head coach Mark Jones : ""I am very happy. When you get your first home game, especially in your new home or temporary home for this season, you want to get off to a good start.

""You only get one chance to make a first impression and I thought in all areas of our game today, we showed high quality.

""I suppose the only maybe slight down is we didn't get the five points but to have a zero next to your name is good.

""We spoke about improving our defensive performance and continuing with the good attack stuff.

""I think we made another step forward in all those areas, which is why I'm very happy for the players.""

523cb7a70e4d,Bristol fight back to edge past Exeter,,"The Prem

Bristol (8) 18

Tries: Mata, Oghre Con: Worsley Pens: Jordan, Worsley

Exeter (14) 14

Tries: Slade, Hammersley Cons: Slade 2

Bristol Bears fought back to pip Exeter Chiefs 18-14 in a fiercely fought West Country derby at Ashton Gate.

A Tom Jordan penalty and Viliame Mata's score put the Bears 8-0 up, but Henry Slade crossed and, after Jordan was shown a red card, Ben Hammersley's try made it 14-8 to Exeter at the break.

Bears started the second half better and took back the lead moments after returning to full strength as Gabriel Oghre dotted down.

Exeter piled on the pressure, but saw a Harvey Skinner try overturned with 10 minutes left before Sam Worsley kicked a last-gasp penalty to seal Bristol's second Prem win of the season.

The sides shared 24 tries in their two meetings last season, and piled up 90 points the last time they met at Ashton Gate.

But an injury-ravaged Bristol showed a different side to their usual attacking flair to inflict a first Prem defeat of the season on Exeter. The win moves them up to fourth, as the Chiefs drop to fifth.

England prop Ellis Genge's return gave the Bears some relief from relentless early season injury woes, and he forced the penalty for Jordan to boot the Bears ahead within 90 seconds.

The visitors boasted almost 90% territory in the opening 20 minutes but ferocious home defence kept them pointless, with Slade also missing a makeable penalty.

By contrast, the Bears were clinical with their sparse attacking possession as the game burst into life after a slow-burning first 26 minutes.

Exeter's defence lost its shape as the ball was worked quickly to the right and Mata stepped away from two challenges to run in.

But Chiefs hit back immediately, as breaks from Skinner and Will Goodrick-Clarke pulled Bears out of shape, and Slade finished off a two-on-one.

Rob Baxter's side then hit the front two minutes after Jordan was shown a red card for putting a shoulder into Ross Vintcent's head.

The red card was introduced to The Prem this season for foul play not seen to be deliberate or intentional. The recipient is not allowed to return, but his side can replace them after 20 minutes.

Skinner's flat pass sent Paul Brown-Bampoe scampering away before Hammersley dummied past Santiago Grondona for a second converted try in four minutes.

Bears survived the rest of Jordan's red card without further damage and began to put Exeter's defence under sustained pressure.

Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Steve Varney did well to hold up Oscar Lennon over the line, but the visitors had no answer to a powerful driving maul as Oghre peeled off to dot down.

Just moments after wrestling back the lead, Bristol were a man down again as Max Pepper saw yellow for a deliberate knock-on.

Genge then walked gingerly off the pitch, 64 minutes into his return, as Bears were forced to defend their line under almost incessant pressure before the game's turning point in the 71st minute.

Bristol looked to be staring down the barrel when Skinner forced his way over for a score, with Fitz Harding shown a yellow card as the hosts coughed up a succession of penalties.

But TMO David Rose overturned both for an earlier Exeter line-out infringement, galvanising the hosts, who added gloss to a narrow win as Worsley split the posts with a brilliant penalty.

Bristol Bears director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol:

""Talk about real fight from this group, real Bears character.

""We talked at half-time about what we needed to do in the next 10 minutes [after Tom Jordan's red card] and the boys executed it so well.

""That is probably one of the highlights of my time here. I'm so proud of the boys.

""It wasn't pretty, we missed opportunities, but the guts were unbelievable.

""The forwards can see the issues with the backs and they said to the backs 'don't worry we'll give you the platform' and they certainly did that.""

Exeter Chiefs director of rugby Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:

""I'm less annoyed with the end than I am the 15 minutes after half-time.

""We zombie-walked our way into going behind. The period when we should take control of the game, we come out after half-time we should be energised and Bristol are down to 14 men.

""But they take the game by the scruff of the neck and we just kept giving away penalties until Bristol pretty much walk it over the try line.

""Bristol are always going to stand and fight at home with their numbers up or down, as I'd expect our lads to, and they fought long enough and hard enough to come through with the result, so you've got to say fair play to them.""

9c74b49e6643,England 'have great chance' to win Ashes - Woakes,,"Former England bowler Chris Woakes says Ben Stokes' side ""have  a hell of a chance"" of winning the Ashes in Australia for the first time since 2010-11 this winter. Woakes retired from international cricket last month after a shoulder injury sustained in his 62nd and final Test against India this summer ruled him out of the tour. The 36-year-old was part of two Ashes tours in which England failed to win a Test but is confident of a better showing this winter. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Going to Australia is a different beast. I'm hoping the guys can go and do a good job and we've got a great chance this time. ""We have great depth and a great squad. The lads in the first XI, if they can stay fit and on the field we have a hell of a chance. ""Ashes cricket is played with more venom behind it but these players have played a lot of international cricket and enough to know what it's about. ""We have been building nicely over the last few years but not quite got over the line in the big series, but it doesn't get any bigger than this. ""We are due a competitive performance down under and these guys have got that in the locker."" Woakes called time on his career when it became clear he would not be fit to make the Ashes tour. But he thinks he would have been selected without the injury - which famously saw him come out to bat against India with his arm in a sling -  and says he is 'on track' to make a playing return in franchise cricket by the end of the year. He said: ""From the moment I was injured it would have been a real push to get fit for the Ashes and they needed to select the squad. It was clear I wasn't going to make it. ""In my mind I would have made the squad if I didn't get injured, I have a lot to give and it's always good to have guys who have done it in Australia and know what is expected. ""Physically I feel great apart from a freak accident with the shoulder and it's repairing nicely and getting stronger. ""I have made big progress in the last few weeks and am hoping to play some franchise cricket in December.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c5y4y7yvy4lo,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/a99c/live/f92732c0-a6c1-11f0-a5ba-c17536b4c2c1.jpg,2025-10-11T09:11:09.833000+00:00,8caf321291d0cd3bef355340c0b27e5a861b901a
1a07cbff8251,Leinster cruise past Sharks for first win of season,,"United Rugby Championship

Leinster (21) 31

Tries: Osborne, O'Brien, Van der Flier, Deegan, McCarthy Cons: Byrne 3

Sharks (5) 5

Try: Hooker

Leinster shook off their early-season woes to secure a deserved bonus-point United Rugby Championship win over the Sharks at Aviva Stadium.

Having fallen to the Stormers and Bulls in South Africa, the URC holders quickly seized control and led 21-0 inside 27 minutes through Jamie Osborne, Jimmy O'Brien and Josh van der Flier tries.

South Africa international winger Ethan Hooker pounced on a Harry Byrne mistake to bring the Sharks back into the game before half-time.

However, Max Deegan and Gus McCarthy scored the only tries in a low-key second half to ensure a comfortable return to winning ways for Leinster.

Leo Cullen's side host Irish rivals Munster at Croke Park next week, while the Sharks will target a first win of the season when they welcome Ulster to Durban.

Bolstered by the return of five British and Irish Lions, Leinster looked slick with ball in hand in a performance that will please both Cullen and Andy Farrell, who names his squad for Ireland's autumn Tests on Wednesday.

James Lowe - a key cog in the Ireland team - was instrumental in Leinster's opening try, with his neat grubber kick putting Osborne through for the opening try in the 11th minute.

The hosts were initially frustrated in their search for a second when Robbie Henshaw was held up over the line. Moments later, though, they launched a rapid play from a scrum as half-backs Fintan Gunne and Harry Byrne combined to tee up an onrushing O'Brien.

And when returning Lion Van der Flier marked his first outing as Leinster captain with the home side's third, it looked a long way back for the Sharks.

However, a loose pass from Byrne - who replaced Sam Prendergast in the line-up - allowed Hooker to intercept and give the South Africans a glimmer of hope before the break.

Following a scrappy start to the second half, Leinster were given the chance to kick to the corner when prop Ruan Dreyer was penalised for a head-on-head tackle on Van der Flier.

While Dreyer avoided a yellow card, Leinster pounced from the resultant line-out as Osborne put Deegan through in the corner to crush the Sharks' slim hopes of a second-half fightback.

With the visitors' challenge already having fizzled out, replacement hooker McCarthy dotted down a gift of a try after Bongi Mbonambi's line-out throw eluded his team-mates.

While Jack Boyle was yellow-carded for an infringement in the scrum, Leinster enjoyed a stress-free finish to the game as they returned to form in time for next week's inter-provincial derby.

Leinster: Osborne; J O'Brien, Henshaw, Frawley, Lowe; Byrne, Gunne: P McCarthy, Kelleher, Furlong, Deeny, Baird, Soroka, Van der Flier (capt), Deegan.

Replacements: G McCarthy, Boyle, Clarkson, Mangan, Culhane, McGrath, Cooney, Kenny.

Sabalenka had won in Wuhan in each of the past three tournaments and looked set to reach the final again when she broke twice to take command of the third set. But 31-year-old Pegula dug deep to win four games in a row. Sabalenka survived two match points to force a tie-break but had nothing left as American Pegula won 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-2). ""For what I did in the tie-break, I'm just really proud of myself,"" Pegula said. ""I've played so much tennis the last few weeks, so many three-set matches, but I feel like I'm very tough right now and I'm just using that [feeling] as best as I can."" Earlier, French Open champion Gauff put in a stuttering performance but secured victory over Jasmine Paolini to reach the final. The 21-year-old beat the Italian seventh seed 6-4 6-3 in a match featuring 11 breaks of serve in a row to reach her first final since her win at Roland Garros in June. Gauff may have won in straight sets but struggled on serve, being broken five times and serving seven double faults. ""I'm really happy with how I played today. It was tough, especially playing on the serve, but I did what I needed to do to get through,"" Gauff said. ""Sabalenka and Pegula are great players, and I've lost to them both before. But overall, I'm just going to focus on my side of the court and try to control the things I can control.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c0595lrej50o,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/f66d/live/b834f0d0-a6a4-11f0-a409-e197032d359e.jpg,2025-10-11T10:42:03.855000+00:00,24c2ee8c85b3a16aa67054c3a457dcd2352f584c
52c8943cf615,Clarke 'greedy' as Scotland boss set for new record,,"After recovering from a different first hour or so to come back and beat Greece 3-1 on Thursday, Scotland will make changes for what will be a different kind of test. Lewis Ferguson and Ryan Christie are suspended and Aaron Hickey injured, meaning Billy Gilmour, Lyndon Dykes and Tony Ralston could be in line to start. Clarke expects Belarus to sit deep at Hampden and make it difficult for Scotland, but said the onus was on his side. ""In my time here, we've done well against the so-called lesser teams and it's very important you get the points off them,"" he said. ""They'll come here and be organised, they'll be difficult to break down and until you break them down, it'll be a long night. ""It's up to us to approach the game properly, which we will. It's up to us to create enough chances to get the crowd excited, which we hopefully will."" Clarke also insisted he was not thinking beyond Sunday's match, with a trip to Greece and a home match against the Danes following next month. ""All I ever try to emphasise is that if you want to qualify, these are the games you have to win,"" he said.  ""If you drop points to the teams ranked below you, it makes qualification difficult. ""No room for complacency. At no point am I looking too far ahead. ""I've been in the game a long time and if you look too far ahead, sometimes you trip up - a little bit like [assistant coach] Steven Naismith did in training today when he joined in.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c20v09qz93no,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/8bbb/live/4d0f6eb0-a6af-11f0-b55a-e7725355d83f.jpg,2025-10-11T14:40:34.127000+00:00,725dd4e865d36de2367e1d40b7ceebc34aa56c0b
22240d6ff7a5,Moore aims to graduate from pitch to boardroom,,"Moore has not yet thought about where any post-playing job would be. He jokes that had he started the directorship course - ""two years and very demanding like any education"" - sooner, he could have looked after his own contract talks this summer when he joined Wrexham. Moore was among 13 summer signings, and while a fourth successive promotion may prove too much to ask, the club's ambition is obvious. ""The sky is the limit. You only to look at what's happened over the last few years, the stand they're building and infrastructure being put in place,"" he said. ""The club is definitely destined for the Premier League. When a club comes up from League One and spends Â£30m it shows the intent of what they want to achieve."" Moore appears perfectly suited to Phil Parkinson's team, as indicated by five goals in 10 appearances so far that have helped fill the void left by the departure of fan-favourite Paul Mullin, who has left for Wigan having previously been Wrexham's key striker. Moore's encouraging start to life in north Wales has come while trying to ignore the documentary cameras following every day's work at Wrexham, from training ground to dressing room. ""There's a bit of added pressure with the attention the club gets, but I've always loved having that burden of responsibility and think it's a massive honour,"" he said. ""The people we've brought in are exceptional. It's taking us a bit of time to hit our stride but when everything comes together, we'll creep up that table.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0q7ke5nn1lo,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/e293/live/5eeb7400-a39c-11f0-95e7-93813d968835.jpg,2025-10-11T11:11:56.794000+00:00,90c52c2eea1a996de72e68e4e356aa25d6dc0877
b7c9a0923314,'Terrific' Bradley will be big loss in Germany tie,,"Now, the side face the prospect of taking on the group favourites without their best player. Bradley, who has also been booked three times in five Premier League appearances this term, was shown his second yellow card of the qualifying campaign in the 76th minute for a tackle on Lukas Haraslin. O'Neill described the decision as ""extremely disappointing"" and felt his player had tried to pull out of the challenge. ""There were worse tackles in the game and one just before that was particularly poor on Isaac Price that the referee let go,"" he said. ""To produce a yellow card for that was disappointing."" Speaking on BBC Sport NI, former Northern Ireland and Leeds United defender Stuart Dallas said Bradley had given ""the referee a decision to make"" but agreed with his old international boss that the decision ultimately was harsh. If not for the resulting suspension, it would have been a mere footnote in an otherwise excellent performance. Bradley was one of four players in the starting XI who went into the game knowing a booking would rule them out of Monday's game, but Hume said they do not wish to curb his aggressive edge. ""We spoke before the game about the boys who were on yellows trying not to get one, but it's one of those things,"" he explained. ""You can't go into a game trying not to get booked. You've got to play to your strengths. ""He's full throttle. He's 100% all the time."" Since making his full Premier League debut in January 2024, Bradley has started 15 of his country's 17 games, missing only the friendlies against Sweden and Switzerland in March. Quite how to compensate for his loss gives O'Neill yet another thing to consider as he plots how to pull off what would be the biggest result of his second spell in charge. While there is no like-for-like replacement in the squad, Oxford United's Brodie Spencer figures to fill the void at right wing-back against the four-time World Cup winners. ""You've seen Brodie play left wing-back, right wing-back, he's even played in a back three. We know how strong and athletic he is,"" added Hume. ""Obviously Conor is going to be a big miss, but we're a big group, we're a strong team and we're all together.

13e7a4c4d9f5,Does Gilmour have to start in Scotland's midfield?,,"When Kostas Tsimikas swept in Greece's goal on 62 minutes, it followed a passage of play that involved Greece making 54 almost unchallenged passes over three minutes during which Andy Robertson's glancing header to clear a cross was the only Scottish touch. It typified the passiveness of the first hour. ""I wonder whether Steve will look at bringing Billy Gilmour on,"" McCann had already said at the break. ""I don't think it's worked with Ryan [Christie] and Lewis [Ferguson] playing really narrow and deep, because they've not got on it. We've not been able to build the game going through."" Gilmour did not come on and suddenly grab the game by the scruff of the neck and change things on his own, but nonetheless his influence was there after Christie's equaliser. His first real opportunity to get his head up and pass was on 69 minutes and he fired it through a tight space to Ferguson, whose first-time pass round the corner just evaded Che Adams as Scotland sprung forward quickly. Gilmour's clever free-kick also teed up Adams for a good chance at 1-1 and he ended up with five passes into the final third during his half hour on the pitch. Only Robertson and Ferguson had more - and they played nearly the full game. ""I think Billy Gilmour coming on was pivotal in terms of us getting hold of the ball,"" McCann said at full-time on BBC Scotland's Sportscene. ""He was instrumental in the cross-field pass which Tsimikas takes out Ferguson when he eventually scores."" As McCann described, Gilmour's prints were on the build-up to the second goal as his positioning allowed Grant Hanley to find a pass to him between two Greece players. He turned and moved it forward to Christie, got it back, moved the ball to Robertson, before executing the crucial pass once McTominay returned it to him. Tsimikas fouled Ferguson and the Bologna man did brilliantly to take his chance in the box from the free-kick as Scotland hit the front.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c306g9pgd5yo,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/bda4/live/55b69240-a5d9-11f0-8fc6-8d89d06fa925.jpg,2025-10-11T06:59:35.830000+00:00,4b71c30c7390cb36e8ccb0aba39f638a24a03d1c

At La Vuelta the team were the focus of several pro-Palestinian protests which affected the wider peloton. Riders crashed and were injured by protestors' actions, which included pins being thrown into the road causing several punctures. The final stage in Madrid was cancelled after it descended into chaos when protestors stormed the course and some riders were pushed off their bikes. On stage five Israel-Premier Tech were targeted during the team time trial. Protestors ran across the road with a banner, causing four of the eight riders to take avoiding action and come to a stop. Organisers of La Vuelta even suggested the team should leave the race for safety reasons. The name Israel was also dropped from the team kit during the race. The team have since committed to rebranding without the Israel name after pressure from sponsors. Last week they were then barred from the Giro dell'Emilia race over safety fears. Israel-Premier Tech currently have five British riders on their roster. Alongside Froome, they have Jake Stewart, Ethan Vernon, Stevie Williams and Joseph Blackmore. Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly Israeli civilians, and 251 were taken hostage.

The EFL also said any changes need to be part of a broader package of reforms across all levels of the game, but that the issue remains under consideration.

192dfa7fa05f,Why LA28 is 'just the start' in GB's Olympic dream,,"After finishing seventh at last year's World Championships, then fifth at this year's World Games, GB women retained their European title in Paris last month. Last December, the British American Football Association (Bafa) also received funding from UK Sport for the first time, with Â£500,000 being put towards the development of an Olympic performance programme. That, along with investment from a private benefactor, has allowed Bafa to provide GB players with better support services than ever before and, for the first time, to cover most of their expenses for travelling to this year's events in China and France. After receiving another Â£500,000 from Sport England, Bafa has launched a new strategy to develop the UK game's governance, infrastructure and participation pyramid, which now includes more than 10,000 players and 150 clubs. And since the women's team became back-to-back European champions, more potential sponsors have expressed their interest. ""It's similar to rugby - look what the success of England's women has done for them,"" said Chad Ehlertsen, who became Bafa's chief executive last year. ""I've tried to change the mindset across the group, to make it less focused on winning and more about developing the right culture and values. But if we're getting short-term success it only helps us ensure that flag will be here for the long term and that GB will perform at a high standard."" There was not a men's event at this year's World Games but, after finishing 10th at last year's World Championships, GB's men finished fourth at the Europeans, meaning both GB teams qualified for next year's World Championships in Germany. ""That could be an early qualification route for the Olympics,"" Ehlertsen said.

25f747e21fe0,Was Tuchel right to criticise England fans?,,"Tuchel is well known for being direct and sometimes confrontational in his quotes. In August he apologised for describing midfielder Jude Bellingham's on-field behaviour as ""repulsive"", saying he used the word ""unintentionally"". Tuchel has made friends and enemies at many of the previous clubs he has managed: Mainz, Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich. Is this a cultural thing - and Germans are more direct than English fans are used to - or just a Tuchel thing? German journalist Constantin Eckner believes it is the latter. ""That has nothing to do with Tuchel being German,"" he said. ""That's just how Tuchel thinks and acts. He is very direct, blatantly honest and can be annoyed by certain things. ""He rarely holds back, and is in a sense the new Jose Mourinho, who similarly speaks his mind during press conferences and post-game interviews."" Eckner says some of this comes from Tuchel being used to club football. This is his first international job, starting it at the beginning of 2025. ""It certainly is a deviation from the way Gareth Southgate behaved during his tenure,"" the journalist said. ""Also, I think Tuchel is not yet used to home crowds being that reserved, which can happen at international games. ""During his time as a club manager, the home fans were usually buzzing. Even Mainz had a great home game atmosphere."" After the quotes on Bellingham which were heavily critised, Tuchel said: ""I thought I had a little more credit with you guys [media] that I do all this in my second language."" But this instance is not a case of using the wrong word. Eckner said: ""In a way, people have to live with Tuchel being this direct. His command of the English language is very good.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c20zqll007vo,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/c575/live/3ef6d5f0-a5d0-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-10T12:55:54.717000+00:00,87773650cb10bb4ba51c09ef189775c0048550a2

Manchester United were dominating English football. Hatton was playing his part in the ring and also giving his Manchester City-supporting backers something to cheer while their team struggled in the Red Devils' shadow. In the city centre, a new venue opened and staged a Torvill and Dean performance on its opening night. ""It was fortunate that they built the Manchester Arena when they did,"" said Speak of the indoor venue that welcomed its first customers in 1995. This is where Hatton had 15 of his professional fights. ""It would become his fortress,"" Speak said. By the time Hatton fought Kostya Tszyu in 2005, he was selling out the arena. Hatton stopped the man who was regarded as the world's best light-welterweight to win the IBF title. Danny Jackson, a close friend to Hatton and Manchester City's matchday announcer, delivered an emotional speech in memory of his pal at the recent City-United derby. He gives Hatton credit for putting his beloved football club - now giants of the world game - in the spotlight. ""You look at Rick's time as a boxer, there wasn't a lot to like about City then,"" Jackson said. ""Rick was a bit of a shining light in that period. He got City's brand out there to millions of people."" Retired world champion Anthony Crolla described the Tszyu fight as ""one of the greatest nights Manchester has ever had in any sport"". The next day, Hatton set up camp at the New Inn in Hyde for what had become a regular celebration â nicknamed the not-so-nice shirt nights. ""He didn't want to swan off to celebrity hotspots; he wanted to be around his mates and having a laugh,"" said Jackson. Paul Smith, the Liverpool world title challenger who trained alongside Hatton, remembers one fancy dress party when Hatton dressed as 'Ginger Spice' Geri Halliwell. Those kind of images would get out and help to keep Hatton in the hearts of those from Manchester, because they could see he was one of them. That never changed. This summer, Hatton attended a friend's stag do in Portugal. They set him up by giving him dissolvable swimming shorts to wear in the pool. ""There were a group of lads there from Leeds by the pool idolising him and they were saying 'I can't believe you're doing this to a superstar',"" said Jackson.

There were rumours he would attend parties or go shopping instead - but Landvreugd said that was not true. ""He was in Amsterdam with people working for his clothing company,"" said Landvreugd, who currently manages Den Bosch. ""It took a lot of time off him. He flew over one day or two days mostly doing that and nothing else."" Landvreugd and Schreuder, both popular figures around the club, would take charge of games Davids missed. Fairclough explained: ""The players didn't know what was going on. They didn't know who was manager and who was the coach, who was going to take the next training session."" Hyde tells a story of Davids sitting on the coach ready for an away game, before discovering it was going to take five hours. ""He shut his laptop, picked it up and walked off the coach,"" he said. Davids' camp say this was before the Chester game on 18 January 2014. ""There was another situation that happened just before the team was about to leave on the coach, which was actually the final straw,"" a representative said. The fans loved Davids but grew frustrated with him missing games - and Kleanthous asked him if he could commit fully to going to every game. His exit was announced hours after Barnet lost 2-1 at Chester leaving them 10th in the table. Kleanthous accepts Davids had ""started to lose interest"" at this stage. ""He'd become less committed in my opinion and at that point it was time to shake hands and call it a day,"" said Kleanthous. Hyde added: ""It's funny if it happens once, but two or three times and you get beaten, and it's your livelihoods, then it's not funny anymore. ""We've got a manager who doesn't turn up. In professional football, I don't think that's ever happened."" Davids left Barnet with 25 wins in 68 games as a manager, plus one goal and five red cards in 39 games as a player. Kleanthous concluded: ""I look back on those as great times and I have nothing but respect for what he did.

c0bcb37a406d,'No easy way back for Bellingham as Rogers vindicates Tuchel's strategy',,"Thomas Tuchel may have expressed public displeasure with England's fans after the emphatic Wembley win against Wales, but the performance of his players will have left him feeling only the warm glow of vindication. Tuchel delivered a highly-critical and unusually blunt verdict from any coach in the direction of his own ""silent"" supporters after a 3-0 stroll was effectively wrapped up inside the first 20 minutes. It was, however, another message delivered by the German manager that will carry wider significance as England gather momentum towards next summer's World Cup. Tuchel's words stretched way beyond the shockwaves that greeted Jude Bellingham's exclusion when he named his latest England squad. He made it crystal clear that England's star system was over, that players in possession could cement their places by sheer weight of performances, the biggest names no longer guaranteed an automatic recall. England victory in the Wembley friendly must be placed in the context of Welsh opponents with eyes seemingly fixed on their vital World Cup qualifier against Belgium on Monday, but this was still a night with a large measure of satisfaction for Tuchel's strategy. Tuchel made it clear he is picking an England team, not individuals. He even stated: ""We are not collecting the most talented players. We are trying to build a team. Teams win trophies, no-one else."" Bellingham's superstar status meant Tuchel's selection was laced with risk, even though it was shaped by common sense as he had only started one game for Real Madrid following shoulder surgery. He may have wanted to be included, but on this occasion Tuchel was happy to do without Bellingham, keeping faith with the players who produced the best result and performance of his reign by winning 5-0 against Serbia in the World Cup qualifier in Belgrade. And, to add further credibility to Tuchel's decision-making process, England's outstanding player against Wales was Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, excelling in Bellingham's number 10 role, as he did in Belgrade. Rogers, on the evidence of England's past two games, is fast becoming the poster boy for the new identity Tuchel wants to create. And if Tuchel's measure is applied, the England shirt is now Rogers' to lose, with a further opportunity to cement his place against Latvia in Riga on Tuesday.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8xr0g5kgl5o,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/36fa/live/5546efb0-a559-11f0-85cb-0746a9bf917c.jpg,2025-10-09T22:51:09.989000+00:00,850147ddbc403c8dcda7a20fa865dca29bad9a02
5fc2562ff7cd,'The players will decide' - where next for rugby's civil war?,,"""I think the battle lines have been drawn publicly and everyone knows where the unions stand,"" says sports lawyer Ben Cisneros of Morgan Sports Law. ""The main thing everybody is seeking is a clearer understanding about what the competition looks like and what the future holds. ""If players are going to be entering into new contracts with clubs within this new entity, there are going to need to be a number of assurances that they'll want to have about the viability of the competition, whether indeed it is going to happen, the opportunity to play and be paid and of course to have assurances around matters such as player welfare issues around anti-doping etc. ""I think all parties are right to be raising those questions, including the unions. They've identified that there is a lack of detail out there."" A ban on players representing their country and playing for R360 is one clear detail, but, could that be challenged? ""What the European courts have said is that if you're going to have rules about whether new competitions are going to be sanctioned and whether players can participate in them while remaining part of the eco-system, they have to be clear, objective, transparent, proportionate, and non-discriminatory,"" said Cisneros. ""That's something the lawyers will be scrutinising and whether any potential competition law issue could be justified is another thorny question. ""Recent judgements have suggested a tightening up and applying a more orthodox approach to sport from a competition law perspective. ""So if the rules or the lack of rules is found to be an issue from a competition law perspective then it might be quite difficult for the governing bodies to justify bans. ""It wouldn't be beyond the realms of possibility that rugby might be headed for legal action."" A comment below Mitchell's LinkedIn post suggested the same.

2b57d213939c,How Broncos and 'play-dough' quarterback can end Chiefs' reign,,"New tight end Evan Engram has stepped up big and new running back JK Dobbins is a guy they believe in. He's currently fifth in the NFL for rushing yards (402) and tied-fourth for rushing touchdowns (four). I love that head coach Sean Payton has ""RUN IT!"" at the top of his playcall sheet. , external That shows how the Broncos are a team that wants to run first, because you can do a lot off the back of that. It slows down the pass rush and keeps you in favourable down and distances. It's also helped quarterback Bo Nix, who came into the league as the 12th overall draft pick last year, throwing 29 touchdown passes â second only to Justin Herbert for the rookie record (31 in 2020). Josh Allen and Herbert have the arm strength to throw anywhere, but they don't move in the same way as Nix. He has incredible arm talent, which is different, and he is so athletic. His strengths are his mobility, being able to throw on the run, and finding different arm angles to make the pass when he rolls out of the pocket, the bootlegs. He can throw that layered pass across the middle or over the corner. For a young quarterback, at 25, he's got a lot of poise in the pocket and isn't really fazed by the blitz. He tries to avoid a sack as much as possible and is able to throw under pressure. He has a high football IQ and is very decisive. When you constantly run the ball it eats up the clock and forces the defence to be on the field for longer, and when you've got an athletic quarterback the defence has to cover the field vertically and horizontally. It can be exhausting. Nix has bitten back at Payton on the sideline sometimes and I think the coach likes that attitude, that he's such a competitor. I think it's fun for him to have a young quarterback who's kind of like play-dough. He can really build something up the way he wants to build it. I think it's a special experience for him. Payton has won a Super Bowl and now passed Bill Parcells for career NFL wins (173 - tied 14th overall). He's seen it all. I think the success Denver are having on offence is mostly down to his leadership, his play-calling, his situational awareness â and the combination with Nix helps make him what he is. You wouldn't want a better guy in your ear, to help you through some of the tougher situations and build confidence. I believe in Denver's defence, in Bo Nix's tenacity and composure. But are they good enough to go against an elite team at its best? Because that was not a Super Bowl performance by the Eagles last Sunday. Right now, I don't think the Broncos are incredible. They're working above average, which is a good place to be in their division. All they need to do is maintain this trajectory. They're really good at leaning into their strength, which is running the ball, and that's exactly what they should do against the New York Jets at Tottenham. It's going to be the JK Dobbins show, essentially. The Jets have allowed 140 rushing yards per game (sixth worst in the league), five rushing touchdowns this season (10th worst), and they're the only team yet to win a game. Since the NFL began tracking turnovers in 1933, the Jets are also the first team to be without a single takeaway through five games, which is kind of shocking when you think that their new coach Aaron Glenn was defensive co-ordinator at the Detroit Lions.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/cwyr4ggqlxgo,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/2ea4/live/1b412920-e470-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.png,2025-10-09T08:07:39.845000+00:00,d9d9cd2981177d481238fd9da66ca84419a34dba
b5f310402730,,,"Like many expats in Saudi Arabia, Plumptre lives in a gated community known as a compound. These residential compounds offer a lifestyle more like Western suburban areas and have gyms, pools, restaurants and other amenities in a self-contained area. Some even have unofficial bars which serve alcohol, which is banned in Saudi Arabia. Plumptre says she feels happier and safer as a woman living in Jeddah than she did in the UK. ""I know international players, members of my family and friends who have come out here who genuinely feel safer here and calmer than in the UK,"" she said. ""A friend of mine who was out here, we described it as being like a peace bubble. ""I'll give an example. I had been to the supermarket and I had all these bags. I live in a compound. I had to take all these bags into the elevator, so I left my car out with the door open, engine on and keys in the car so I could take up my shopping. ""In the UK I would never leave my car out with the keys in. Here I have no problem. ""Naturally everyone is a bit fearful walking around at night, but I don't have to check my shoulder all the time. I know this is just the perspective of myself, not of everybody who lives here, but with the safety I feel I can't agree with some of the views the Western world have of this place."" As Plumptre says, this is just one perspective on life for a woman in Saudi Arabia. Some of the most notably unequal practices in the country are no longer in place. Women have been allowed to drive since 2018. A year later those over 21 could apply for a passport. But the concept of guardianship, or 'wilaya', is central to Saudi culture. Traditionally every woman has a 'wali', a male guardian who makes decisions on her behalf. There has been some reform - women over 21 no longer need approval to access healthcare or education - but reports from organisations such as Amnesty International say this is not always practically implemented and women are still heavily restricted in what they can do, wear and say.

3fd1a71f6555,,,"In 2022 Smith was playing at North Toronto Nitros. She ripped League1 Ontario up. By the time the semi-professional league came to an end, she had scored 18 goals in 11 games and it would be the last time playing club football in her home country. That summer she moved south of the border, to Penn State University in Pennsylvania. Again, her time there was fleeting. Despite arriving at Penn State with a serious cruciate ligament injury, sustained at the Under-20 World Cup, and a frail run of form, the calls from Europe arrived by the end of her freshman year. ""It was neat to watch her be able to be an 18-year-old because I don't think there's been a lot of times where she's been able to be her actual age,"" said former Penn State University head coach Dambach. ""Since leaving Penn State she has put herself out there and put herself in uncomfortable situations and I think through those she was able to really grow and develop."" And so, one year on from that season in Canada, she had left college and moved to Portugal to join Sporting, despite heavy interest in France and England. Batlle y Font was instrumental in persuading Smith to move to the relatively obscure Portuguese league - and reaped the rewards. ""I won't say that our project is better than those clubs, obviously it's different,"" said the 30-year-old. ""I think she understood that we really wanted her. ""I think that she chose us because she understood that she would have the same rights and same duties as other players, but she would not be one more player. ""Once she made the decision, we never felt that she was looking at us as a minor club, compared to the other clubs interested in her."" It did not take her long to make an impression in Portugal. ""She was 18 and she was playing against experienced players and she would make a bit of a fool of them. ""When she played we would look at each other and say, 'how did we fool this girl to be here? How lucky are we?'"" Again by the end of another fruitful season, she was packing her bags and Batlle y Font was receiving enquiries from multiple clubs in Europe. ""There were more clubs interested and, to be honest, with better offers than Liverpool, but not the kind of project that Olivia wanted,"" said Batlle Y Font. ""Once again, this shows how very grounded Olivia is."" Her debut season in the WSL saw her score seven goals in 20 games for Liverpool, as well as being named the PFA young player of the year. When she arrived at Arsenal this summer, it was her third club in three years. ""I definitely think it's not comfortable, but you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable,"" said Smith, speaking to reporters in pre-season. ""And it's been quite tough for me personally, not knowing what's going to come next. ""Like my first season, I never expected to leave after one season, especially last season, only having one season in what I think is the best league in the world and then coming here. ""So it's certainly not easy, especially with my family so far away, but it does make transitions easier.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn82lx29558o,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f994e3c0-88e8-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,2025-09-06T06:32:15.132000+00:00,7a298874a599396f75c964b0b7a34683c9d14f35
389f3c0aa25c,Hamas presses Israel to free prominent prisoners as part of Gaza deal,,"Hamas is pressing Israel to include prominent Palestinians in a prisoner-release list -  part of a ceasefire deal that will also see hostages returned from Gaza. Hamas's insistence comes after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 prisoners to be freed, but excluded seven high-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. The men, who are serving sentences after being convicted of involvement in separate deadly attacks in Israel, have long been seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance. Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released before 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday as part of the deal proposed by US President Donald Trump. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that US envoy Steve Witkoff had promised to raise the exclusion of the Palestinian prisoners with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israel has firmly refused to include them. It is not clear whether this could be a sticking point, or impact the timeline for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The releases are due to take place in the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal, approved this week to end the two-year war in Gaza. It is unclear how the hostages will be released this time - on previous occasions Hamas paraded them in public, infuriating Israel and many of its Western allies. The bodies of deceased hostages will also be returned. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown. Israel will also release about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, and another 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza who have been detained. Hamas had submitted a list of prisoners it wanted released that included Barghouti and Saadat. Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders. Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control. Saadat, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an ""illegal terrorist organisation"" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001. Among the 250 prisoners set to be released is Iyad Abu al-Rub, an Islamic Jihad commander convicted of orchestrating suicide bombings in Israel that killed 13 people in the early 2000s. According to the Israeli justice ministry, he will be released either to Gaza or deported abroad. The BBC understands that Hamas is also pushing for some possible additional prisoner releases. These relate to Palestinian prisoners who were released years ago as part of an exchange for the hostage Gilad Shalit - and then were rearrested after 7 October. Hamas argues that since they were part of a previous hostage exchange, they should not be included in the 250 figure. In Israel, hospitals are preparing for the release of hostages as families await their return. The first phase of the Israel-Hamas deal saw a ceasefire take effect on Friday and Israeli forces partially withdraw from parts of Gaza. Hundreds of aid trucks a day are now expected to enter. The next phases are still being negotiated. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned from southern Gaza to Gaza City, weeks after fleeing the Israeli offensive that destroyed much of the city. Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said it is conducting recovery operations and pulling bodies from the rubble, with Palestinians still missing across the territory. Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, 67,682 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

aae9e75b0ed3,Drone strike in besieged Sudan city kills dozens,,"Dozens of people have been killed in a drone strike at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, a besieged Sudanese city on the brink of collapse, activists said. The resistance committee for el-Fasher, made up of local citizens and activists, said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit Dar al-Arqam camp, located within a university, with two drone strikes and eight artillery shells. The RSF has denied it carried out the strike. ""Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,"" a statement from the group said. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as rescuers pulled bodies from the rubble. Sudan Doctors Network said 57 people were killed in the drone attack, including 17 children, and 17 were injured. Activists said at least 60 people had been killed. Hospitals already struggling under months of siege have been overwhelmed, with doctors treating the wounded on floors and in corridors. The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 17 months, in an attempt to take control of the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region. The situation in el-Fasher has ""gone beyond disaster and genocide"", the resistance group said. Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued - creating one of the worst humanitarian crises. The army controls most of the north and the east. El-Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by the army and its allies. The RSF also controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan. If el-Fasher falls the RSF will control the entire Darfur region, where they hope to form an alternative government. In recent weeks, the RSF has intensified its assault on el-Fasher, leading experts to believe the city could soon fall unless the army receives immediate reinforcements. Research showed the RSF had finished building an earthen wall around el-Fasher, bolstering their siege and making it even harder for civilians to escape. The UN said there were 250,000 civilians trapped in el-Fasher, and warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may amount to war crimes. Hunger and disease has spread across the city as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies. Two days ago, at least 13 people were killed after the RSF shelled one of the last remaining hospitals in el-Fasher. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk condemned the continued killing and injuring of civilians on Friday. ""I am appalled by the RSF's endless and wanton disregard for civilian life,"" he said. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rvrn8req4o,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4f4e/live/d92cb460-a69c-11f0-a409-e197032d359e.jpg,2025-10-11T20:25:59.876000+00:00,35f73c41587e760cbfc2aaae485cbc7b90f63be3
725474c64c01,No survivors found after Tennessee explosives plant blast,,"No survivors are expected to be found after a major explosion at a Tennessee munitions factory on Friday that has left 18 people unaccounted for. Recovery teams are still clinging to hope of finding any of the missing alive, but assume they are deceased, said Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis. ""As we get into this, we find it even more devastating than we thought initially,"" he told a news conference. It's still unclear what caused the explosion at the plant in Bucksnort, Tennessee - roughly 56 miles (90km) south-west of Nashville. The facility specialises in the development and manufacture of explosives. More than 300 state and local first responders have been searching the site since Friday morning, Sheriff Davis said on Saturday. ""The expectation of anyone who's inside of that building… we can assume that they are deceased,"" he told media. By Saturday morning, the rescue mission had shifted to a recovery operation, said a visibly choked-up Davis. The FBI is also at the scene conducting rapid DNA tests to identify victims and notify families. ""We're trying to focus as much attention as we can, on taking care of their families,"" Sheriff Jason Craft, from neighbouring Hickman County, told the BBC. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is at the scene helping to investigate the incident. There was a previous fatal explosion at a unit in the same location in 2014. Ann Myers was woken from her sleep by the explosion on Friday morning and feared for the safety of her four children. She wondered if it was a tornado or a road accident. The camper home they live in shook and the electricity went out briefly. ""It was the weirdest thing ever,"" she said. ""So then I'm like, are we in a tornado? Is there, you know, a bomb somewhere? ""But then I thought maybe a tractor trailer, you know, hit somewhere off the interstate. So it's definitely very frightening."" Justin Stover, whose property borders the sprawling AES plant, told the BBC his house shook violently following the explosion. At first, he thought it was a plane crash and he feared his house would collapse. ""Things fell off the wall, items fell off shelves,"" Mr Stover said. ""It was very intimidating, like the loudest thunder you've ever heard in your life and rumble."" Then he saw ""a large cloud of smoke coming from the area of AES"", Stover added. He is still assessing damage to his house and said the explosion may have affected his water well. Stover, who has lived in Bucksnort for 20 years, said AES had about 80 workers. ""It's one of the only businesses in this area,"" he said. ""So it's one of the only places for employment, for locals. ""There's a lot of people that we know that work there and that possibly lost their lives yesterday morning. The tragedy will be devastating for the whole community, he said, as it has already been for families of the victims. Residents farther away from the site also heard the blast, including some in a town about 15 miles (25km) away, Sheriff Davis said on Friday. One local resident who lives about 20 minutes away from the facility told the BBC she was sitting at her daughter's dining table when she heard it. ""All of a sudden we just a heard a loud bang. We didn't know if it was a gun or what,"" she said. Another local resident, Lucy Garton said her husband knows people who worked in the facility. ""I think it will definitely impact the area,"" she said. ""It's a very close-knit community and everyone, they're just simple people, go to work every day, take care of their families and just real a family-oriented community.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2523997p9o,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a40e/live/ecf31290-a6c0-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-11T20:16:12.202000+00:00,8c048a504405c71218b3d71c68f808f77470090e
47931edd9c06,"We're grateful for what Trump is doing for peace, Nobel winner tells BBC",,"We're grateful for what Trump is doing for peace, Nobel winner tells BBC Norberto Paredes BBC Mundo and Alex Boyd Watch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBC Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing ""around the world for peace"". Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate. She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him ""how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy"". Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended . Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the ""Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace"". Machado said she was ""very glad"" to speak to the US president and was ""able to convey to him our appreciation"". The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as ""one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times"". Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for ""her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy"". He added: ""Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions."" Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country. Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González. When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest. Machado told BBC Mundo her award was ""like an injection"" for her political movement. ""It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,"" she added. ""The democrats around the world share our struggle."" She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela. ""The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,"" Machado told the BBC. ""And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities. ""We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror. ""So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls. ""And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now."" Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs. It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in ""narco-trafficking"". They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.

9efd9c3ec3cc,Biden receiving radiation therapy for prostate cancer,,"Former US President Joe Biden is receiving radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, his spokesman has said. The spokesman also said that Biden, 82, was undergoing hormone treatment, without giving any further details. The radiation treatment was expected to span five weeks and marked a new point in his care, a source told NBC News. In May, Biden's office announced that he was diagnosed with a more aggressive form of the disease , which had spread to his bones. The discovery was made after the Democrat politician reported urinary symptoms which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Biden office said at the time that ""he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. ""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management."" A Gleason score of nine meant his illness was classified as ""high-grade"" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK. Biden left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign. His former vice-president, Kamala Harris, ran instead as the Democrat's presidential candidate, losing to current US President Donald Trump. For many years, Biden has advocated for cancer research. In 2022, he and his wife Jill Biden relaunched the ""cancer moonshot"" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047. Biden himself lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015. In recent months, Biden has largely retreated from the public eye. In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was ""difficult"".

Around 16 male reporters were selected to attend a forum on Friday with Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy. Journalists observed women and foreign media being turned away. India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it ""had no involvement in the press interaction"" at the Afghan embassy. A source in the Taliban government admitted women had not been invited to attend. They told the BBC ""female journalists were excluded due to lack of proper coordination and will be invited to next conference if held in Delhi"". Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said by allowing the event to go ahead, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them"". The Editors Guild of India strongly condemned the exclusion and said: ""Whether or not the MEA coordinated the event, it is deeply troubling that such a discriminatory exclusion was allowed to proceed without objection."" It called for India's government to ""publicly reaffirm that press access at diplomatic events held in India must respect gender equity"". Muttaqi is in India for a week of high-level talks with the government. On Friday, he met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would re-open its embassy in Kabul. It was shut after the Taliban returned to power. Since 2021, the Taliban government has imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law which have severely impacted the rights of Afghan women and girls. Following the men-only press event, Rahul Gandhi said on social media: ""In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space."" Indian politician Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked Modi to clarify his position on ""the removal of female journalists"" from the gathering. She asked how ""this insult to some of India's most competent women"" had been allowed in ""a country whose women are its backbone and its pride"". Others expressed shock and said the men who went to the event should have walked out in solidarity with their female colleagues. ""Why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?"" wrote politician Mahua Moitra on social media.

cc22cedeeae3,Trump threatens to impose additional 100% tariff on China,,"Trump threatens to impose additional 100% tariff on China Natalie Sherman Business reporter Watch: 'It was shocking', Trump says of China's tightened export rules for rare earths US President Donald Trump has said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China from next month. In a post on social media, Trump said the US would also put export controls on critical software. In an earlier post on Friday, he hit back at Beijing's move this week to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of ""becoming very hostile"" and trying to hold the world ""captive"". He threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. He later said he had not cancelled it, but that he did not know ""that we're going to have it"". ""I'm going to be there regardless,"" he told reporters at the White House. Financial markets dropped in the wake of Trump's remarks, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April. China dominates production of rare earths and certain other key materials, which are key components in cars, smartphones and many other items. The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials. Carmaker Ford even had to temporarily pause production. In addition to tightening rules for rare earth exports, China has opened a monopoly investigation into the US tech firm Qualcomm that could stall its acquisition of another chipmaker. Getty Images Trump visited China in his first term Although Qualcomm is based in the US, a significant portion of its business is concentrated in China. Beijing has also said it will charge new port fees to ships with ties to the US, including those owned or operated by US firms. ""Some very strange things are happening in China!"" Trump wrote in a post on social media on Friday. ""They are becoming very hostile."" The US and China have been in a fragile trade détente since May, when the two sides agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods that had nearly stopped trade between the two countries. The move left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a new 10% tariff. Officials have held a series of talks since then on matters including TikTok, agricultural purchases, and the trade of rare earths and advanced technology like semiconductors. The two sides were expected to meet again this month at a summit in South Korea. China expert Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Xi's recent actions were a bid to shape the upcoming talks, noting that the recent rare earths directive does not go into effect immediately. ""He's looking for ways to seize the initiative,"" he said. ""The Trump administration is having to play a game of whack-a-mole and deal with these issues as they come up."" He added that he did not think China was worried about US retaliation in response. ""What China took away from the Liberation Day tariffs and the cycle of escalation followed by de-escalation is that the Chinese side had a higher pain threshold,"" he said. ""From their perspective, the Trump administration blinked."" In prior rounds of trade talks, China has pushed for looser US restrictions on semiconductors.

Heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday caused rivers to burst their banks. Hidalgo in east Mexico was one of the worst affected areas, with 16 deaths reported. Thousands of houses have been damaged or destroyed as fast-running water careered down streets, carrying cars, while highways were blocked with debris and electricity cut off. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said the government has deployed 5,400 personnel to help communities, clear roads and hand out aid. She wrote on social media: ""We are working to support the population, open roads and restore electrical service.""

Four of the injured were airlifted to hospital, Lee added. No suspects were in custody, but a police manhunt was under way. Leland was busier than usual on Friday with the local high school scheduled to play a football game to mark homecoming, an annual US tradition, usually in autumn, when former students are welcomed back to celebrate school spirit and community. The mayor said that the shooting did not take place on the Leland High School campus. ""This is an event where we have held yearly for years and hadn't had any incidents of this sort, ever,"" Lee told BBC. ""And we're a city that, not high crime and about 3,700 people.

It will also spend $4.5bn buying 16 more F-35 fighter jets from the US, bringing its total fleet of such advanced planes to 43. ""With this... agreement we significantly strengthen the capabilities of the Danish Armed Forces in the region,"" Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a statement on Friday. The Arctic is at a critical crossroads between North America, Russia and the rest of Europe. The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance. ""The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,"" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were. Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar. Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland. In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. Greenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility. US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are ""all over the place"". Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was ""critical"" for national and economic security. Greenland's prime minister has said the territory is not for sale, adding that ""Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9n790j878o,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f381/live/df5bf250-a643-11f0-968a-efb7a719b7f7.jpg,2025-10-11T01:56:45.905000+00:00,95fac869411f2a68d84ffc50c6d6568a20d3c179
262adfc56d3a,Trump administration starts laying off thousands of workers,,"Trump administration starts laying off thousands of workers Kayla Epstein and Nardine Saad Getty Images Donald Trump's budget chief Russell Vought The Trump administration has begun laying off thousands of federal workers in an effort to pressure Democrats amid the ongoing government shutdown . ""The RIFs have begun,"" White House Office of Management Director Russell Vought announced in a post on X on Friday morning, referring to an acronym for ""reductions in force"". A spokesman for his office confirmed the cuts had started and were ""substantial"". Their size and scope began coming into focus later on Friday, when the administration disclosed seven agencies had started laying off more than 4,000 workers. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to use the shutdown to further his long-held goal of reducing the federal workforce. By law, the federal government must give its workers at least 30-days notice that it is laying them off. After Vought's tweet, major departments such as Treasury and Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed they were issuing notices to employees, and Homeland Security, where many of its employees are considered essential, said it would lay off workers at its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. But exact details were scarce. Two major unions, the American Federation of Government Employees and AFL-CIO, had filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Vought's announced plans to carry out layoffs during the shutdown. On Friday, once he said the process had begun, they asked a federal court in Northern California to temporarily block the move. ""It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,"" AFGE president Everett Kelley said. In its opposition to the temporary restraining order, lawyers for the OMB revealed which agencies and how many of their employees would be affected first, indicating an estimated 4,600 employees would receive RIF notices starting on Friday. ""The President, through OMB, has determined that agencies should operate more efficiently and has directed them to consider steps to optimize their workforces in light of the ongoing lapse in appropriations,"" the justice department attorneys argued in the filing. More than a quarter of the cuts would be made at the Treasury Department, where notices were being sent to approximately 1,446 employees. HHS was notifying between 1,100 and 1,200 employees, the filing said. The Department of Education and Department of Housing and Urban Development intended to lay off at least 400 employees apiece, while the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development and Homeland Security each planned cuts ranging between 176 to 315 employees, according to the filing. There was no indication about how many notices the agencies issued on Friday. The filing also said that 20 to 30 at the Environmental Protection Agency were issued ""intent to RIF"" notice on Friday, notifying them that they may be affected in the future. Other federal agencies might also make cuts. A spokesman from the White House budget office told the BBC on Saturday that the layoffs were just the beginning. ""These RIF numbers from the court filing are just a snapshot in time,"" he said. ""More RIFs are coming."" The government lawyers said the labour unions had failed to establish that their members would be irreparably harmed by the layoffs, which is needed for the judge to grant the restraining order. But they said a restraining order would ""irreparably harm the government"". A temporary restraining order would prevent agencies ""determining how best to organize their workforces"", they argued, noting that the government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the ""dispatch of its own internal affairs"". Getty Images The layoffs are unprecedented. In past shutdowns, furloughed employees returned to work when the government reopened and were paid retroactively for their time away. Both furloughed and ""essential"" workers who must still carry out their job duties are not paid when government funding is temporarily cut off. The current shutdown began 10 days ago, after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on a funding measure to keep the government open. ""They held off for 10 days,"" Republican Senator John Thune told reporters, referring to the White House. ""At some point they were going to have to make some of these decisions and prioritise where they're going to spend money when the government is shut down."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, accused Trump and Vought of causing ""deliberate chaos"". Democrats have refused to vote for a Republican spending plan that would reopen the government, saying any resolution must preserve expiring tax credits that reduce health insurance costs for millions of Americans and reverse Trump's cuts to Medicaid, the healthcare program for elderly and low-income people. Republicans accuse Democrats of unnecessarily bringing the government to a halt, and blame them for the knock-on effects caused by the federal work stoppage. A shutdown meant that ""non-essential"" federal workers would be placed on unpaid leave. It is currently affecting about 40% of the federal workforce - about 750,000 people. Furloughed employees are legally supposed to receive back-pay after a shutdown ends and they return to work, but the Trump administration has insinuated this might not happen. Significantly culling the federal workforce has been a long-term priority for Vought. The president and his budget chief have greeted the shutdown as a unique opportunity to make further firings on top of the thousands of cuts they have made since Trump returned to office in January through a combination of firings, buyouts, administrative leave and resignations. The Partnership for Public Service, a bipartisan group studying the government, estimated the federal workforce had been reduced by about 200,000 employees as of 23 September. Career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, reported last month that the government sector had announced 299,755 planned job cuts this year, of which 289,363 were federal workers impacted by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), the White House cost-cutting effort initially led by billionaire Elon Musk . Before the shutdown, Vought's office instructed federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans aimed at cutting employees or programmes whose funding might lapse or were ""not consistent with the President's priorities"",  Politico reported. One day after the shutdown began, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had met with Vought ""to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mxd1g71vxo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3fda/live/7c459810-a5fd-11f0-9de9-634bcd03313f.jpg,2025-10-11T15:58:17.859000+00:00,a450e579b300b93c9fb7fd7049ead44978fc8b89

He said the facility - where pilots from the Gulf state would be trained to fly F-15 fighter jets - would be established at the Mountain Home Airbase in the north-western US state. ""It's just another example of our partnership,"" Hegseth said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart, Saoud bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, at the Pentagon on Friday. Hegseth also praised Qatar for playing a ""substantial role"" in efforts led by President Donald Trump to secure a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal. On Friday, Hegseth said he was ""proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Airbase in Idaho"". ""The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership. ""You can count on us,"" Hegseth told al-Thani. The Pentagon chief did not say how many Qatari F-15s would be based at the Idaho facility, and when it would become operational. Last month, President Trump signed an executive order pledging to use all measures - including the US military - to defend Qatar. The order amounts to an extraordinary security pact between America and a key Arab ally, almost mirroring aspects of a Nato alliance. The move came after Israeli air strikes targeted Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital Doha on 9 September, leaving several lower-level members of the Palestinian group dead, along with a Qatari security official.

The desert's extreme aridity makes it one of the clearest places on Earth to view the night sky and is famous for being home to the largest radio telescope in the world. But the usually barren landscape has been transformed by a carpet of colourful wildflowers, which have been brought to life by significant rainfall during the southern hemisphere's winter months. This is thought to be an event that only occurs every few years, when above average rainfall soaks the desert floor, causing dormant seeds to spring to life. The Atacama desert typically receives less than 15mm of rain every year. But the area had more than 12mm of rain during August alone - most of which fell on just one day. The desert even saw a rare blanket of snow back in June. AFP via Getty Images/Jose Torres This magnificent bloom is made up of more than 200 different species of wildflowers, some of which do not grow anywhere else in the world. It typically occurs between the end of August and November. Although thought of as rare, this phenomenon also occurred in 2024, following heavy rainfall in the area.

a1ef2aead6fd,Macron reappoints Lecornu as French PM after days of turmoil,,"Macron reappoints Lecornu as French PM after days of turmoil Paul Kirby Europe digital editor AFP Sébastien Lecornu spent just 26 days as prime minister before his dramatic resignation last Monday President Emmanuel Macron has asked Sébastien Lecornu to return as French prime minister only four days after he stood down from the post, sparking a week of high drama and political turmoil. Macron made the announcement late on Friday, hours after meeting all the main parties together at the Élysée Palace, except the leaders of the far right and far left. Lecornu's return came as a surprise, as he said on national TV only two days ago he was not ""chasing the job"" and his ""mission is over"". It is not even certain he will be able to form a government, but he will have to hit the ground running. The new prime minister faces a deadline on Monday to put next year's budget before parliament. The Élysée said the president had ""tasked [Lecornu] with forming a government"" and Macron's entourage indicated he had been given ""carte blanche"" to act. Lecornu, who is 39 and one of Macron's most loyal allies, then released a long statement on X in which he accepted ""out of duty the mission entrusted to me by the president, to do everything to provide France with a budget by the end of the year and respond to the everyday problems of our compatriots"". When he appeared on French TV this week, Lecornu described himself as a ""soldier-monk"", and as he prepared to get to grips with forming a government he said on Friday ""I will do everything to succeed in this mission"". AFP via Getty Images National Rally leader Marine Le Pen (L) was not invited to Macron's talks and went to talk to voters at a livestock show instead Political divisions over how to bring down France's national debt and cut the budget deficit have led to the fall of two of the past three prime ministers in the last year, so his challenge is immense. France's public debt earlier this year was almost 114% of economic output (GDP) - the third highest in the eurozone - and this year's budget deficit is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP. Among the conditions Lecornu listed for taking on the job, one was that ""no-one will be able to shirk"" the necessity of restoring France's public finances. With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%. Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment was a ""bad joke"", from a president ""more than ever isolated and disconnected at the Élysée"". Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election. National Rally is currently leading in the polls. Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might take part. He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and took the next three weeks to put together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministerial appointments. By themselves the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II, and has declared the socle commun (common platform) of centrists and conservatives as dead. Not all his party colleagues agree. But it means the centrist prime minister is also looking to left-wing parties for potential support. In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64. AFP via Getty Images Marine Tondelier (L) of the Greens said she saw no reason not to bring a vote of no confidence in a Lecornu government That risks angering key centrist allies, who fought hard to get pension reforms through. It also falls short of the demands of left-wing leaders as they were hoping Macron would choose a prime minister from their side. Olivier Faure of the Socialists said ""since we've not been given any guarantees, we won't give any guarantee [to back the prime minister] in a vote of confidence"". Fabien Roussel from the Communists said after meeting the president that the left wanted real change, and a prime minister from the president's centrist camp would not be accepted by the French people. Greens leader Marine Tondelier said she was ""stunned"" Macron had offered the left almost nothing, adding that ""all of this is going to turn out very badly"". While Macron and his reappointed prime minister look to slash the government's budget deficit by tens of billions of euros, the head of France's central bank has warned that the political turmoil will set the economy back even further. The bank is forecasting growth this year of 0.7%, but its chief François Villeroy de Galhau says it could have been higher and the uncertainty surrounding the crisis has cost France an estimated 0.2% of extra growth. ""Like many in France I've had enough of this [political] mess,"" he told RTL radio. ""It's time for compromises - that's not a dirty word - even forming coalitions."" If Lecornu fails to form a government, there could be even more instability, and that will cost the French economy even more.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4j9zz54ypo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d88c/live/c47bff30-a615-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T22:00:15.827000+00:00,9742de3c445943a837f95ea8c077901d67689fcd

The First Lady's ""peace letter"" was hand delivered to Putin during his Alaska visit in August. President Donald Trump shared parts of the letter on social media. In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so ""will do more than serve Russia alone"" and ""will serve humanity itself"".

Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting. Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says. The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the ""identities and circumstances"" of each child. The US government ""confirmed the facts"", she said. Mrs Trump said she has ""learned a lot about this matter"" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: ""Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger."" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally. Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was ""a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children"".

Machado, 58, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as ""one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times"". She has campaigned against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate. ""This immense recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer Freedom,"" Machado said in a statement. Among those who missed out was US President Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to get the prestigious award, with public overtures on the seven wars he claims to have ended . Nominations for the award closed in January. A White House official responded by saying the ""Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace"" . CBS News - the BBC's US partner - understands Trump called Machado to congratulate her, saying she deserves the award. Announcing the recipient of the prize at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo on Friday, the committee warned that ""democracy is in retreat"" across the world. Machado - who has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year - was recognised for ""her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy"", Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said. She has been a ""key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis"", he added. ""Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions."" 'I have no words': How María Corina Machado received Nobel news Reacting to the Nobel Committee announcement, Machado said: ""We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve Freedom and democracy. ""Venezuela will be free!"" Machado earlier expressed shock in response to the award, saying in a separate video message that it was the ""achievement of a whole society"". ""I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve this,"" she added. Machado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country. Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González. When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest. González wrote on social media that the prize was ""well-deserved recognition for the long struggle of a woman and of an entire people for our freedom and democracy"". Frydnes was critical of Venezuela's leadership during a news conference after the prize was announced, saying the committee saw the same trends emerging around the world. ""[The] rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation,"" he said. He added that he hoped Machado would be able to attend the award ceremony in Oslo in December but acknowledged the serious security situation. There were 338 candidates nominated for this year's peace prize, according to the Nobel Committee - though the names of the nominees will not be revealed for 50 years, as per tradition. Trump has repeatedly said that he deserves the award, on one occasion declaring that ""everyone says I should get it"". A number of world leaders backed his bid, including Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who publicly revealed a nomination letter while visiting the White House , as well as the governments of Pakistan and Azerbaijan - despite nominations closing in January, just as Trump's second term began. Asked whether pressure from the US president and some in the international community to award Trump the prize had impacted the committee's deliberations, Frydnes said there had been many campaigns and ""media tension"" in the ""long history"" of the Nobel Peace Prize. ""We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,"" he said. Reacting to Friday's announcement, the White House's communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a post on X that the ""Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace"". ""President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. ""He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will,"" Cheung added. The Nobel Prize, which is split into six categories, celebrates the work of people or organisations that have contributed ""the greatest benefit to humankind"".

Kyiv's authorities said power was later restored to more than 540,000 consumers in the city - but many households are still without electricity. Twelve people were injured in the city, said Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko. In the southern Zaporizhzhia region, a seven-year-old boy was killed and seven others injured. Ten people were also injured in the central Cherkasy region. Russia's defence ministry said its ""massive"" strike with high-precision weapons - including hypersonic missiles - targeted energy facilities used by Ukraine's ""military-industrial complex"". Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - has escalated attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities as well as transport infrastructure as winter approaches. Reacting to the latest Russian strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for allies to act decisively to ""defend people from this terror"".

Zelensky said that more than 450 drones and over 30 missiles targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, describing such attacks as ""cynical and calculated"" and against ""everything that sustains normal life"" as temperatures become colder. More than 5,800 residential buildings in Kyiv were without electricity on Friday morning, local officials said. The city's eastern districts were the worst hit. Images of firefighters putting out blazes at a 10-storey building have been released by Ukraine's state emergency services. Residents in more than 7,000 buildings were left for hours without water - but the supplies were restored in the evening, the authorities said. Public transport - including the capital's widely used underground system - was also badly affected, with some stations forced to close after the Russian strikes. So-called ""invincibility"" tents - where people can get hot water and charge their gadgets - have been set up on the streets of Kyiv and other cities. Ukraine's Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said Russia was ""inflicting a massive strike"" and repair crews were working to restore power. ""Exactly three years ago - to the day - on 10 October, our power system experienced one of the first massive attacks. Today, Russia continues to use cold and darkness as a tool of terror,"" she said. Ukrainian officials said they were forced to roll out emergency power outages in Kyiv and the capital region, as well as in the Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad and Zaporizhzhia regions. On Thursday, Zelensky told reporters that Russia was intentionally trying to demolish the country's energy grid, with attacks already disrupting gas facilities. He said energy workers and authorities were bracing for further attacks. Also on Friday, Zelensky told the BBC he would urge UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to join the PURL programme, under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine. While praising the UK's strong support for Kyiv - one of the largest in Europe - he said it should send a clear signal it will take part in the system, as well as imposing more sanctions on Russia. Downing Street later said Sir Keir and Zelensky had spoken, and agreed more sanctions on Russia ""in the coming days and weeks"" would put further ""pressure"" on Moscow.

The US military will establish a multinational taskforce in Israel, known as a civil-military coordination centre, which is likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE, they said. One senior official said no US forces will enter Gaza, adding that the American role was to create a Joint Control Center which will ""integrate"" the multinational force going in. The Israeli government has approved the first phase of a Gaza deal with Hamas, which has led to a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners. The taskforce will be led by US Central Command (Centcom) based in the region, and is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and also help coordinate humanitarian assistance. The multinational force will inform both the Israelis and Hamas via Egypt and Qatar of the situation on the ground and any potential violations of the truce, one of the officials said. The force is being established under the leadership of Adm Brad Cooper, head of Centcom. He joined the American delegation for part of indirect talks in Egypt earlier this week, one of the officials said. Those talks led to US President Donald Trump announcing on Thursday that Israel and Hamas had ""signed off on the first phase"" of a peace plan he unveiled last week. One of the point's in Trump's 20-point Gaza plan included the US working with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy in Gaza but this is yet to be agreed between the sides and would only happen if a hostage and prisoner exchange is completed. Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Since then, Israel's massive military offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. These figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvl97r4e8jo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b586/live/1609fe70-a5b6-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T09:58:12.968000+00:00,f9bab8ae878e76b5c80e4a0d00724909abae1ce3

Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré questioned if the embassy's decision was ""blackmail"" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries. Donald Trump's administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of his crackdown on immigration. The US State Department said it was committed to ending illegal and mass migration and bolstering US border security. The Department of Homeland Security have been contacted for comment. Burkina Faso's leader Capt Ibrahim Traoré styles himself as a pan-African champion, standing up to Western imperialism. His military government seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since. Appearing on state broadcaster RTB late on Thursday, the foreign minister asked: ""Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is... Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion."" He said he had a meeting with the US Embassy on Wednesday in which he rejected the offer - that he said had been made repeatedly - to accept deportees. On Thursday, the US embassy in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou announced on its website that it would temporarily pause issuing immigrant, tourist, student and business traveller visas. Instead, residents of Burkina Faso will have to travel to the US embassy in the capital of neighbouring Togo. Foreign Minister Traoré said he had received a diplomatic note from the US explaining that Burkina Faso was put on a list of countries whose nationals had not respected rules around US visas and referring to the US proposals, according to a local news outlet's transcript of the interview. Several African countries - Eswatini, Ghana, Rwanda and South Sudan - have all accepted people from third countries expelled from the US in recent months. On Monday, Eswatini accepted 10 deportees despite legal challenges , adding to an earlier group of five, which the US had described as serious criminals. However, Nigeria has said it would not take any US deportees . Trump's crackdown aims to deport millions of immigrants in the US illegally.

The allegation comes after two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday. Pakistan had also bombed a civilian market in the border province of Patika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said in a statement on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed. Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied that they launched an attack inside Afghanistan. However, during a press conference held in the city of Peshawar on Friday, a top general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a ""base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan"". ""To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,"" General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry added. Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban, also known as the TTP, to operate from their land. The Taliban government have always denied this. Rumours had circulated that the blasts in Kabul were part of a targeted attack on the TTP's leader, Noor Wali Mehsud. In response, the TTP released an unverified voice note from Mehsud saying he was still alive. Exactly what happened is unclear; BBC Afghan's correspondent saw no signs of an explosion in the suspected location of the blasts on Friday, but did report a heavy Taliban presence and mobile checkpoints. The Taliban Defence Ministry warned in its statement that, should the situation become worse, ""the consequences will be attributable to the Pakistani army"". However, the Taliban's foreign minister - who is currently in the Indian capital Delhi - said they wanted to maintain good relations with Pakistan.

2735039afd69,Peru's president removed from office amid soaring crime,,"Peru's president removed from office amid soaring crime Getty Images Lawmakers have voted overwhelmingly to oust President Dina Boluarte Peru's Congress has voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, hours after a late-night session was called to debate her impeachment. An overwhelming majority of lawmakers from across the political spectrum approved her ousting on grounds of ""permanent moral incapacity"". In an address on national television following the vote, Boluarte questioned the implications it would have on the stability of Peru's democracy. One of the world's most unpopular leaders, with an approval rating of 2-4%, Boluarte's tenure has been plagued by frequent protests, scandals and investigations, as well as a surge in gang violence. Anti-government protests have escalated in recent months amid soaring crime. There was renewed anger earlier on Thursday following a shooting at a concert in the capital, Lima. A total of 122 out of 130 lawmakers voted for Boluarte's removal early on Friday, following votes resoundingly in favour of four motions of impeachment. Congress leader Jose Jeri was sworn in as interim president early on Friday. Peru does not currently have a vice-president. Boluarte did not appear before Congress for the overnight hearing. A crowd of protesters brandishing Peruvian flags outside the Congress building erupted in cheers after the vote was declared. ""At all times I have called for unity,"" she told Peruvians after being removed, adding: ""In this context, I had not thought of myself but of the more than 34 million Peruvians who deserve better."" Protests have punctuated the 63-year-old leader's less than three years in office, which followed the impeachment and imprisonment of her predecessor, Pedro Castillo. Her presidency was overshadowed by several investigations, including a corruption inquiry dubbed ""Rolexgate"" over allegations she accepted Rolex watches as bribes. Another probed whether she abandoned her post when she failed to appoint a caretaker president during an absence for nose surgery. She has denied any wrongdoing. In July, her decision to double her salary to almost 35 times that of the monthly minimum wage in Peru was met with scorn and derision. Her economy minister noted at the time her salary had been the second lowest of 12 countries in South America. Reuters A crowd of protesters outside the Congress building erupted in cheers after the vote was declared Thursday night's successful impeachment bid was the latest in a series of attempts to remove Boluarte from office ahead of elections next April. ""The only way of moving forward is Dina Boluarte's impeachment,"" Congresswoman Susel Paredes said in a post on X on Thursday. Among the lawmakers who voted to remove Boluarte from office were factions once loyal to the president, including conservative parties that had previously supported her. Boluarte rose to power in December 2022, when former President Castillo was impeached after attempting to dissolve Congress to avert his removal. She was elevated to the post as she was vice-president at the time. Peru's first female president, Boluarte was the Andean nation's sixth leader since 2018. Three former leaders are behind bars. In January 2023, weeks after taking office, an inquiry was launched into Boluarte and some of her key ministers on charges of ""genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries"". It followed the death of more than 50 Castillo supporters in a government crackdown on demonstrations calling for her resignation and fresh elections.

fa4ac7f4e653,Zimbabwe lawmaker and poet dies after his car hits an elephant,,"Zimbabwean opposition lawmaker Desire Moyo has died after the vehicle he was travelling in hit an elephant, local media report. The accident happened in the early hours of Friday morning while Mr Moyo and four other MPs were travelling along the Bulawayo-Gweru highway, according to state-owned broadcaster ZBC. He died instantly while his fellow lawmakers were left injured, the news outlet added. Tributes are pouring in for the well-known poet, hailed for his contribution to the arts, who died a day before his 46th birthday. He was a member of the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), and served in the Zimbabwean parliament's sport, recreation, arts and culture committee. The Nkulumane Constituency in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo, which he represented, confirmed the news of his death in a statement and shared its ""deep sorrow and profound shock"". Fellow CCC member and MP Discent Bajila provided more details on the horrific crash to local news site ZimLive.com. He told the publication he had spoken to the injured MPs, who relayed what had happened. ""I spoke to [Madalaboy] Ndebele, who was in the front passenger seat. His recollection is that they hit the elephant on its backside. After the impact, he remembers the elephant turning round and fighting the vehicle. ""This, he believes, is what did the most damage on the top right side of the vehicle and ultimately led to Moyo's fatal injuries,"" Bajila said. The accident took place in an area where elephants are known to roam to and from their home ranges in the north-west of Zimbabwe. Fellow lawmaker Caston Matewu was among those to pay tribute to Moyo, affectionately known as Moyoxide, hailing him as ""one of the hardest working MPs in Parliament"". ""The people of Nkulumani [sic] have been robbed of this great [man],"" Mr Matewu said. The City of Bulawayo, led by mayor David Coltart, said Mr Moyo would be remembered as an ""iconic leader ... and creative"" who ""strove to champion the arts"" in the city and beyond.

4439e64c1307,My one-month-old grandson was killed by police tear gas,,"My one-month-old grandson was killed by police tear gas Sammy Awami BBC Africa, Antananarivo Sammy Awami / BBC Razanasoa Edmondine looking at the photos on her phone of her new grandson Razanasoa Edmondine still looks shell-shocked as she recalls the death of her one-month-old grandson, killed by police tear gas in protests that have rocked Madagascar over the last two weeks. ""It was just a normal Friday. My daughter-in-law was going to the market with the baby when they encountered demonstrators on the road,"" she tells the BBC at the family's home on the northern outskirts of the capital, Antananarivo. ""Not long after, police showed up and started dispersing the protest with tear gas."" It was the second day of youth-led protests, triggered by anger over persistent power and water shortages, and Ms Edmondine's daughter-in-law ran into a nearby building with other protesters to take cover. Police then fired more tear gas canisters into the building, quickly filling it with choking smoke. With the streets in chaos, they could not get to a hospital until the following day. By then, the damage had been done. ""The baby was trying to cry but no sound came out,"" says Ms Edmondine softly. ""It was like something was blocking his chest. The doctor told us he had inhaled too much smoke. A couple of days later, he passed away."" Protest organiser tells the BBC the country needs ""radical change"" Her grandchild is one of at least 22 people the UN says were killed during clashes between police and demonstrators in the early days of the protests, which have since escalated into broader dissatisfaction over corruption, high unemployment and the cost-of-living crisis in one of the world's poorest nations. The government of President Andry Rajoelina has dismissed this figure as misinformation but has not provided its own numbers. However, it has emphasised that the value of property damage exceeds $47m (£35m). The first days of the protests were marked by widespread violence, with cars set on fire, shop windows smashed and a two-month-old, multi-million-dollar cable car station vandalised. Rabe, who only gave the BBC his first name, has accused the police of firing live bullets at peaceful protesters - a few blocks away from where Ms Edmondine's daughter-in-law was hiding. As police launched tear gas, panic spread fast and people fled in every direction, seeking shelter inside any open building, but he says his 20-year-old autistic son did not understand what was happening. ""He must have slipped outside to see what was going on. That's when the police shot him and continued chasing other protesters."" He believes his son was shot from the front, as the bullet left a large open wound in his back - the likely exit wound. ""I don't know much, but as far as I know, when someone raises their hands, it means they haven't stolen anything, they haven't vandalised anything,"" says Rabe. ""He was just there to see what was happening."" Responding to accusations of police brutality, earlier this week President Rajoelina said: ""There have been deaths, we completely agree. And I truly sympathise with the suffering and pain of the families who have lost loved ones. ""But I want to tell you that these deaths are not protesters, they are not students. They are rioters. They are the ones who looted."" AFP/Getty Images The protests were triggered by anger over a lack of access to water and electricity Some business owners say the prolonged protests have disrupted commercial activity and cut into their income, especially for those in city centre neighbourhoods around the University of Antananarivo, from where the protests have been organised. ""I fully support Gen Z, but I don't think protests are the right way to address their grievances. When people demonstrate, I can't do business,"" says Laza Brenda, who runs a roadside mobile phone repair kiosk. For entrepreneur Ulrichia Rabefitiavana, the uncertainty has spooked several of her international clients, who have cancelled contracts for training and seminar events. ""We've had to postpone a major event involving more than 2,000 people that we've been preparing for over six months. It was supposed to take place this week. It's been very challenging for us to postpone everything and lose that money,"" says Ms Rabefitiavana. The tourism sector on the Indian Ocean island, which is famous for its unique wildlife, is among the hardest hit with the situation catching most people by surprise. ""We have received nothing but cancellations. Normally, the period of mid-September and October is the busiest period for us,"" says François van Rens from the Radisson Hotel Group. ""We normally operate around 60, 70% occupancy but we have now dropped down to 10%. So it's like in full throttle and all of the sudden the handbrake."" Sammy Awami / BBC This woman earns $2.30 a week selling doughnuts - with which she must support her young son The anger of the youth movement behind the demonstrations, known as Gen Z Mada, has grown with the protesters now calling for the president to step down. The evidence of young people's frustrations, whether it is unemployment, water scarcity or struggling businesses, is not hard to find across Antananarivo. At the airport, for example, visitors with just a few bags are quickly surrounded by two or three young people eager to help in exchange for a small tip. Anyone leaving their car parked outside a cafe or restaurant will almost certainly be approached by a couple of young men asking for a fee after claiming they have ""guarded"" the vehicle. On the roadside, a young woman selling sweet doughnuts tells the BBC she earns $2.30 a week, money she relies on to feed her four-year-old child. ""I'm only allowed to do business at this spot on weekends because during the week someone else uses it for their own business,"" she says while turning the dough in boiling oil. Driving through the outskirts of Antananarivo, it is common to see families washing clothes in paddy fields, a visible reminder of the severe water shortages in people's homes. Reuters Water is hard to come by for most in the city and people have to buy it from water sellers One of the main protest organisers, who requested anonymity for safety reasons and organised to meet us near the rice fields, told the BBC he had to walk a mile each day to get water from a well – and he considers himself middle-class. ""To be a young person in Madagascar, you have to be tough,"" he adds, explaining that insecurity is rife. ""You live in constant fear of when your house will be broken into, when you will be shot by people, when you'll be stabbed on the streets. It's like your humanity has been stolen from you and taken away."" He demands ""radical change"" to deal with the island's chronic socio-economic challenges. According to Hery Ramiarison, professor of economics at the University of Antananarivo, these are the result of decades of poor economic planning and the government's failure to create inclusive wealth. ""There is a huge employment problem among young people,"" he explains. ""It stems from very low levels of education in the labour force, serious deficiencies in the education system both in quantity and quality, widespread school dropouts, and a near-total absence of training opportunities adapted for them."" The academic finds it striking that after 64 years of independence, three-quarters of the population have an education level below primary school, while only 3% have attained higher education. Sammy Awami / BBC Laza Brenda says he supports the Gen Z demands but says protests are bad for business President Rajoelina has asked the Malagasy people to give him one year to fix the problems driving the protests, saying he will resign if fails to meet the deadline. But Prof Ramiarison feels the president does not understand the complexities of how Madagascar has become trapped in two vicious circles of poverty that feed into each other. One is driven by weak economic growth, the other stems from political instability, which discourages investment and growth and pushes people deeper into poverty, fuelling social unrest. ""To break free from the poverty trap, it is essential to first break the primary vicious circle by addressing its root causes - namely the key determinants of economic growth,"" he says. Madagascar has experienced repeated political turmoil since gaining independence from France, including the mass protests in 2009 that toppled then-President Marc Ravalomanana - the once popular dairy tycoon. That saw the rise of Rajoelina, a former DJ and then the mayor of Antananarivo, who seized power in the aftermath. From his roadside phone shop, Mr Brenda says: ""Once they're in power, they forget us. It's always the same.""

fbfb6815af6d,New York Attorney General Letitia James criminally indicted,,"New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a ""desperate weaponization of our justice system"". ""He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,"" she said. ""These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost."" The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that ""no one is above the law"". ""The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,"" she said. ""The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served."" Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James. James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk. The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or ""timesharing"" of the home. The indictment claims the property ""was not occupied or used"" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead ""used as a rental investment property"", which was being rented to a family of three. The ""misrepresentation"" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim. Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count. James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: ""We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge."" Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. ""We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,"" he wrote. James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress. The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a ""political witch hunt"" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was ""not above the law"". James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment ""is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable."" The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it ""the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9n4xj904o,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e680/live/03955d50-a581-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T02:17:58.022000+00:00,e0a0abd3fb136e65ae2c7b2c8efb86c0e6af2c99
210d1709a095,'We are inventing captivity medicine': Hospital prepares for freed Israeli hostages,,"'We are inventing captivity medicine': Hospital prepares for freed Israeli hostages BBC Dr Steinman says working at the unit has taught her the ""strength of the human spirit"" When the first hostages are released by Hamas in Gaza, taken into Israel and transferred by helicopter to the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Dr Michal Steinman will take them up to the sixth floor, swipe open the glass door and see them reunite with their closest family after more than 700 days in captivity. ""It is a privilege,"" says the head of nursing. ""These are the moments, when I'm 70 or 80, these are the two or three moments I will remember. They symbolise so many values – as a nurse, as a mother, as a woman, as an Israeli."" Twenty living hostages are due to be released under the terms of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. Several of them will be brought to this hospital. It will be the third time that the hostages' unit has gone operational. The BBC visited the unit on Saturday, when the medical team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating. ""There is no such field as captivity medicine, and we are inventing it,"" said Dr Steinman told the BBC on Saturday, after the team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating. The staff have learned two big lessons from the two previous hostage releases in November 2023 and January this year, she says. The first is to be ""a medical detective"", to try to understand what happened in those long days and nights of captivity. With earlier, often emaciated, shackled, beaten hostages, ""they had things in their blood exams, in their enzymes, that we couldn't understand"". They also have learned that symptoms may not present for days or weeks. ""Captivity does things to your body that your body remembers. You see all these layers. It takes time to see what happened to their bodies, to their souls,"" she said. ""We're still taking care of the hostages who came back in January and February, and every week we discover new things."" Reuters It's the third time the hospital's unit has received freed hostages after previous release deals in late 2023 and January this year (file photo) The other lesson is to take time. There are a huge number of professionals from different disciplines: nutritionists, social workers, mental health specialists, along with the full panoply of medical staff. But there is also a ""do not disturb"" card on the door of each released hostage's private room. The echoes of a hotel are deliberate, as are the care packages and soft furnishings and soft lighting to go with the hospital bed and monitors. There is an extra single bed made up for those hostages who don't want to be left alone overnight, so that a partner or relative can sleep alongside them. Their closest family will also have their own bedroom directly across the corridor from the hostage's. ""You know medical people are task-oriented. There's a schedule,"" says Dr Steinman. ""Here you have to give them much more space. You have to decide what's urgent, and what can wait another two days. You have to be humble and flexible, without letting go of your medical responsibility."" Among those responsibilities is determining what the hostages, some of whom may have lost more than half their body weight in captivity, can eat, and how quickly. Their physical recuperation is only part of the story. Karina Shwartz is director of social work at the Rabin Medical Center.  She is another key member of the team, with a responsibility not just for the hostages but for their closest relatives. They need to learn their own delicate calibration of family dynamics – of when to speak and when not to, she says. ""The most important thing is what we're not saying,"" she says. ""Because if we're sitting in the room, and someone tells us something very difficult about how they almost died in captivity, and we stay silent: it's a very loud silence."" But at the same time, there is a need to hold back. ""We can't speak about two years in a week. The hostages need space and time. They also need quiet. We have to listen. To listen to their story."" Karina Shwartz and her team will prepare the hostages to leave the hospital and re-enter the outside world The staff in the hostage returns unit emphasise that their job does not end when the hostages return home. Medical and psychological rehabilitation will continue and the hostages must also be prepared, says Ms Shwartz, for the moment ""when the real world comes in"". The message she and her team try to drill into the hostages and their families is that everyone will want to see them. For two years they have been public figures. ""Everyone will want to be friends.  We tell them: it's okay to say no. It's safe to say no."" For now, the nervous anticipation among the staff is palpable. ""You should see my WhatsApp messages,"" says Dr Steinman, a very Israeli director of nursing with her nose piercing and multiple tattoos. Pretty much every single one of her 1,700 nurses across the medical complex has, she says, volunteered to pull extra shifts on the unit. ""You gain hope again,"" she says. ""Working here you realise that life and human beings are good. You realise the strength of the human spirit."" And yet, the greatest pleasure, she says, will be for that work to be over. ""This is the third time we're opening the unit.  To know that this is the last time: that when we close this place and say the mission is done.  Then we will know that the nightmare is over.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvg8jx7gmo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/167b/live/252b1e00-a6cb-11f0-bf22-9df87c17cee5.jpg,2025-10-11T18:34:31.152000+00:00,2b51feeabe971d17210ba372641ea3818aa41598
0f41a9ccbed6,'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley,,"'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley Lily Jamali Technology correspondent, San Francisco Getty Images Silicon Valley is home to many major tech firms, including Apple's circular headquarters At OpenAI's DevDay this week, OpenAI boss Sam Altman did what American tech bosses rarely do these days: he actually answered questions from reporters. ""I know it's tempting to write the bubble story,"" Mr Altman told me as he sat flanked by his top lieutenants. ""In fact, there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now."" In Silicon Valley, the debate over whether AI companies are overvalued has taken on a new urgency. Sceptics are privately - and some now publicly - asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call ""financial engineering"". In other words - there are fears these companies are overvalued. Mr Altman said he expected investors would make some bad calls and silly start-ups would walk away with crazy money. But with OpenAI, he told me, ""there's something real happening here"". Not everyone is convinced. In recent days, warnings of an AI bubble have come from the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund, as well as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon who told the BBC ""the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds"". And here, in what is often considered the tech capital of the world, concerns are growing. At a panel discussion at Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum this week, early AI entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan told a packed audience he has lived through four bubbles. Getty Images Jerry Kaplan founded Go Corporation, which developed early tablet computers He's especially concerned now given the magnitude of money on the table as compared to the dot-com boom. There's so much more to lose. ""When [the bubble] breaks, it's going to be really bad, and not just for people in AI,"" he said. ""It's going to drag down the rest of the economy."" However, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which has minted its fair share of tech entrepreneurs, Prof Anat Admati says while there have been many attempts to model when we're in the bubble, it can be a futile exercise. ""It is very hard to time a bubble,"" Prof Admati told me. ""And you can't say with certainty you were in one until after the bubble has burst."" But the data is concerning to many. AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year - and Gartner estimates global spending on AI will likely reach a whopping $1.5tn (£1.1tn) before 2025 is out. Tangled web of deals OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, is at the centre of the tangled web of deals drawing scrutiny. For example - last month, it entered into a $100bn deal with chipmaker Nvidia, which is itself the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. It expands an existing investment Nvidia already had in Mr Altman's company - with  expectations that OpenAI will build data centres powered with Nvidia's advanced chips. Then on Monday, OpenAI announced plans to purchase billions of dollars worth of equipment for developing AI from Nvidia rival AMD, in a deal that could make it one of AMD's largest shareholders. Remember this is a private company, albeit one recently valued at a half-trillion dollars . Then there's tech giant Microsoft, which is heavily invested, and cloud computing behemoth Oracle has a $300bn deal with OpenAI, too. OpenAI's Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, funded with the help of Oracle and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and announced at the White House during President Donald Trump's first week in office, grows ever larger every few months. And as for Nvidia, it has a stake in AI startup CoreWeave - which supplies OpenAI with some of its massive infrastructure needs. Getty Images OpenAI boss Sam Altman And as these increasingly complex financing arrangements get more and more common, the experts here in Silicon Valley say they may be clouding perceptions on AI demand. Some people aren't mincing their words about it either, calling the deals ""circular financing"" or even ""vendor financing"" - where a company invests in or lends to its own customers so they can continue making purchases. ""Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented,"" Mr Altman told me on Monday. But, he added, ""it's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast."" OpenAI's revenue is growing quickly, but it has never turned a profit. And it is hardly a good sign that the people I've spoken to keep bringing up Nortel - the Canadian telecom equipment-maker that borrowed prolifically to help finance deals for their customers (and thereby artificially boost demand for their wares). For his part, Nvidia's Jensen Huang defended his deal with OpenAI on CNBC Monday, saying the firm isn't required to buy his company's tech with the money he invests. ""They can use it to do anything they like,"" Huang said. ""There's no exclusivities. Our primary goal is just really to support them and help them grow – and grow the ecosystem."" Telltale signs Mr Kaplan says he sees a couple of telltale signs the AI sector - and therefore the wider economy - could be in trouble. In frothy times, he says, companies announce major initiatives and product plans that they don't yet have the capital for. Meanwhile, retail investors clamour to get in on the start-up action. The surge in AMD stock this week could indicate investors are trying to get a piece of the ChatGPT wealth machine - and while all this is playing out, real physical infrastructure aimed at satisfying the seemingly insatiable hunger for more AI development is being built. ""We're creating a new man-made ecological disaster: enormous data centres in remote places like deserts, that will be rusting away and leaching bad things into the environment, with no one left to hold accountable because the builders and investors will be long gone,"" Mr Kaplan said. Getty Images OpenAI wants to secure $500bn to build a 10-gigawatt complex, under construction in Texas, by the end of this year. But even if we are in a bubble, the hope from Silicon Valley is investments being made now won't necessarily go to waste. ""The thing that comforts me is that the internet was built on the ashes of the over-investment into the telecom infrastructure of yesterday,"" said Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the AI community hub Hugging Face. ""If there is overinvestment into infrastructure for AI workloads, there may be financial risks tied to it,"" he said. ""But it's going to enable lots of great new products and experiences including ones we're not thinking about today."" There are plenty of believers in AI's potential to transform society. The question is whether the money to fund the ambitions of the foremost companies in the sector may be drying up. ""Nvidia looks like the last lender or investor,"" said Rihard Jarc, who founded the UncoverAlpha newsletter. ""Who else has the capacity right now to invest $100 billion in another company?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69qy760weo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bf9b/live/ff11e480-a5e2-11f0-920e-cb66ee1d5eb0.jpg,2025-10-10T23:55:36.318000+00:00,1c46e767dc854e866704c109817240cacdae5b67
29a4688abdb3,What does wording of Gaza ceasefire agreement tell us?,,"What does wording of Gaza ceasefire agreement tell us? Hugo Bachega Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and BBC Visual Journalism team Getty Images A ceasefire has come into effect for the war in Gaza, after the Israeli government approved a US-brokered deal with Hamas in negotiations that had the personal involvement of US President Donald Trump. The full text of the agreement has not been made public - but part of it has been published by Israeli media. It appears to lack details and in some cases is vague and ambiguous - perhaps on purpose. Even its title, ""Implementation steps for President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War"", leaves room for different interpretations. The full title suggests these are steps for the implementation of the 20-point plan that President Trump announced at the White House last week. The document was agreed after negotiations in Egypt over the first phase of the plan, related to a ceasefire, a hostage and prisoner exchange, and a surge in humanitarian aid. However, by highlighting ""Comprehensive end of Gaza war"", the document appears to be announcing the end of the two-year-old war. This paragraph explicitly says the war is over, which sets the scene for future discussions on later stages of the president's plan for Gaza. It appears to suggest that, even if the negotiations reach an impasse, hostilities will not resume. This is crucial as key sticking points remain, including the Israeli demand for Hamas to disarm, the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, and a plan for who will govern the territory. The document does not mention guarantees that could have been given that the conflict will not restart, or what could happen if either side returns to fighting. Speaking after the deal was reached, Hamas's exiled Gaza leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received assurances from the US and other mediators that the war had ended. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly said that the conflict is over. Following the approval of the deal by the Israeli government, Netanyahu released a video in which he appeared to threaten to use force if Israel's demands, including Hamas's disarmament, were not met. ""If this is achieved in the easy way, it's all for the better. And if not, it'll be achieved the hard way,"" he said. The document does not mention the next steps for the full implementation of Trump's plan. This appears to leave room for a return of Israeli troops to areas they had withdrawn from if Hamas is seen as not being fully compliant with the deal. It provides no details about what could constitute a violation. And the text does not explicitly rule out air strikes. Prior to the deal, Hamas officials were concerned that there would be a situation like the one in Lebanon, where a ceasefire deal has not prevented near-daily air strikes on people and targets Israel says are linked to Hezbollah, the Shia militia and political movement. The Lebanese government says Israel's actions are violations of the deal, which was also brokered with US help. Despite the demand that all hostages, alive and dead, should be freed within 72 hours of the partial Israeli withdrawal, the text concedes, although not explicitly, that Hamas is unlikely to be able to retrieve all bodies from deceased hostages within that timeframe, allowing the group to share the information it had gathered about those that could not be located. The text does not say what could happen in case of delays in freeing the 20 captives believed to be alive. This suggests the creation of a mechanism to monitor the deal and report any violations. US officials said separately that the US was moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to co-ordinate the multination force. Assuming the hostage and prisoner exchange is completed, the officials said the intention was for a so-called International Stabilisation Force to be built, although this was yet to be agreed between the sides. Next phase of deal unclear This deal is a significant diplomatic breakthrough led by Trump, who wants to be remembered as the one who brought the conflict to an end. The president employed American leverage to force Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging earlier efforts for a deal, to engage with the negotiations. Hamas came under pressure from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and from a population in desperate need of help. Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The first phase of the president's plan was, perhaps, the easiest one. Netanyahu was also facing growing domestic pressure, with polls consistently suggesting that the vast majority of Israelis wanted a deal with Hamas and the end of the war. Hamas, meanwhile, was apparently convinced that keeping the hostages had become a burden, giving Israel a reason to continue fighting. What happens next, however, is not clear. Progress will only happen if the Trump administration remains engaged, as both Israel and Hamas have reasons to stall the process. There is momentum, but major obstacles remain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyr8e0gl2o,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3fad/live/2ef94db0-a5fb-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T17:25:41.270000+00:00,824b5de6d8f88f9aa6dca1f0fc6d5a224753621e

A judge had ordered Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López to return to court in May, and she believed that meant a reprieve from his potential deportation to Ecuador. Instead, as soon as they stepped out of the courtroom with their children, she was torn from her husband's arms and thrown to the ground by immigration officers as they detained him. ""One of them charged at me so aggressively that I was terrified, and he ended up throwing me to the ground,"" Ms Moreta Galarza told BBC News Mundo in Spanish. ""They treated us like animals."" The incident, which has since gone viral, led to one immigration agent being temporarily suspended. But it is not an isolated occurrence. The BBC witnessed similar incidents at the court house, while others – including an aggressive encounter between Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the media – have sparked public outcry. ICE's operations inside the building have created a charged, tense environment, attorneys said. ""I would honestly sum it up as just traumatic,"" said Allison Cutler, a New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG) attorney who works at 26 Federal Plaza. ""It's traumatic for the clients we're serving, for the families getting ripped apart."" Getty Images Federal immigration officers wearing masks and sunglasses detain a man who appeared for his hearing at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City on 30 July While many of the detentions at 26 Federal Plaza are swift and non-violent, reporters and lawyers have witnessed several chaotic episodes in recent weeks. On a Tuesday in late August, the BBC watched as a dozen officers waiting outside a courtroom descended on a man, two women and a small boy. They quickly detained the man, and a melee ensued as the group fought to stay together. The crying woman, clinging to the detained man, was wrenched away by a federal officer - who appeared to be the same man who pulled Ms Moreta Galarza from her husband - as the man was carted off. The judge closed the courtroom and, as a result, the BBC could not verify details of the case. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide details of the man's current status, but stated that the agency ""takes its responsibility to protect children seriously"". They added that ICE gives parents the option of being removed with their children or having them placed with a designated individual. After the images of the incident with Ms Moreta Galarza spread on social media, DHS reported that the officer involved in the incident had been disciplined. Then last week, immigration officers were captured on video shoving two journalists to the ground as they tried to document a possible detention. One of the journalists could not get up, and was transported to the hospital. ""Nothing like this has happened with journalists before,"" Olga Fedorova, the other photojournalist thrown to the floor, told the BBC. Ms Fedorova frequently reports from the building and said that before the incident, ""we were able to work with federal agents, around federal agents with no incidents 99% of the time"". DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC in a statement that officers were making an arrest when they were ""swarmed by agitators and members of the press, which obstructed operations"". Ms McLaughlin said that ""officers repeatedly told the crowd of agitators and journalists to get back, move, and get out of the elevator"". Chaotic encounters with government officials have played out multiple times in the lower Manhattan building this year, as immigration courts become key sites of a mass deportation initiative ordered by the Trump administration. Half of the 3,320 immigrants ICE has detained in the New York City area between Trump's inauguration and the end of July were arrested at 26 Federal Plaza, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project. The numbers suggest the building's immigration courts and offices are a primary engine of the administration's deportation plans in America's biggest city. About three quarters of people arrested at 26 Federal Plaza since Trump's inauguration did not have past criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the Deportation Data Project numbers suggest. Officers routinely pull multiple detainees from their hearings, without giving them the chance to speak to lawyers. ""We've never seen anything like this,"" said Benjamin Remy, a NYLAG lawyer who spends several days a week working with immigrants at Federal Plaza. Many immigrants no longer show up to court, he said. At one August hearing, a man with a criminal record failed to appear. The judge therefore ordered him removed from the country and threw out his asylum case. His attendance may not have changed the outcome; immigration enforcement was assembled outside that courtroom as well. Non-citizens in the US without a visa or similar documentation have always been subject to removal, said Triciah Claxton, supervising attorney with Safe Passage, an immigration rights group focused on minors. ""There used to be a concentrated effort on those who might have had criminal histories or prior arrests,"" said Ms Claxton, whose clients mostly appear virtually to avoid detention. But now, she said, that net appears to have widened. ""You see a lot of people who are in the process - they have asylum claims pending, they have other forms of relief pending – are still being taken in,"" Ms Claxton said. Getty Images People wait to enter immigration court as federal agents patrol the halls Legal experts say this is an abuse of the courts system and puts immigrants into an impossible position. If they turn up for court hearings, as they are instructed to do, they could be arrested. But if they skip their court date, a judge could automatically order their deportation. The government argues it has broad authority to detain people who are in the US illegally. The administration says it is removing dangerous criminals from the country, and the White House and Department of Homeland Security frequently tout the arrests and detentions of undocumented migrants with violent criminal histories. It says it makes arrests in immigration court for safety reasons. ""DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,"" an agency official said in a statement to BBC. A New York Times/Siena poll found that the majority of respondents, 54%, supported deporting people who are here illegally. Over half (51%) felt the government was targeting the right people. In the case of Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López, whose wife Ms Moreta Galarza was pushed to the floor, the government says he was a violent criminal, and that it was justified in arresting him at court. Ortiz López entered the country illegally on 20 March 2024 and was wanted after being arrested on 18 June for ""assault and criminal obstruction of airway or bloodstream"". ""President Trump and Secretary (of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem will not allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,"" the statement added. ""If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return."" But for Ms Moreta Galarza, the incident at the courthouse reminded her of the injustices she says she fled in her home country of Ecuador. ""I suffered a lot in my country. I had no protection and the authorities there didn't care,"" she tells BBC News Mundo. She adds that she never thought the same thing would happen to her in the US. ""It's very ugly. I feel like I'm worthless now.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0rxrxd444o,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c595/live/806bc710-a68a-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T00:35:36.624000+00:00,3c4803ac04acc76d441ec9cc5274541b42cbd410
5431c66225f0,Can the world's oldest president keep his title and woo a nation of young voters?,,"Can the world's oldest president keep his title and woo a nation of young voters? Paul Njie BBC Africa, Yaoundé AFP/Getty Images The world's oldest head of state - 92-year-old Paul Biya - has promised Cameroon's electorate ""the best is still to come"" as he seeks his eighth consecutive presidential term on Sunday. The nonagenarian has already been in power since 1982 - another seven-year mandate could see him rule for 50 years until he will be almost 100. He defied widespread calls to step down and has been criticised for only showing up for one rally, spending most of the campaign period on a 10-day private trip to Europe. A backlash over his reliance on an AI-generated campaign video, as his opponents actively wooed voters on the ground, saw him rush north on his return home. In the vote-rich city of Maroua on Tuesday he addressed crowds of his party supporters - reaching out in particular to women and young people, promising to prioritise their plight in his next mandate. ""I will keep my word,"" he insisted, urging them to ""give me your valuable support once again"". But political analyst Immanuel Wanah tells the BBC that Biya's primary focus since coming to power has been to stay in power, ""often at the expense of efforts to enhance the living conditions of the country's citizens"". It is a view echoed by Dr Tilarius Atia, another political analyst, who puts this survivalist mindset down to an abortive coup against Biya in 1984. It means that for the vast majority of the population, Biya is the only president they have known - more than 60% of Cameroon's 30 million people are below the age of 25. Young political activist Marie Flore Mboussi is desperate for ""new blood"" as she believes ""longevity in power inevitably leads to a kind of laziness"". ""After 43 years, the people are tired,"" she tells the BBC. The presidential election comes amid growing concerns about inflation, security challenges, poor social services, corruption and unemployment. Youth unemployment has been a particular talking point for most of the candidates running in the election. Nearly 40% of young Cameroonians between the ages of 15 and 35 are unemployed, with 23% of young graduates facing challenges in obtaining formal employment, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). ""Young people are more inclined to emigrate abroad because they tell themselves that inside the country, they do not have the possibility of becoming somebody,"" 26-old-year graduate Vanina Nzekui tells the BBC. ""They tell themselves that all positions are occupied by older people,"" she says, adding that this comes at the cost of using their skills to help develop the country. But Aziseh Mbi, 23, believes age should not be a criterion for leadership. In Biya's case, the civil society activist says, the president has been able to do ""significant things,"" citing several youth initiatives. Reuters President Biya was keen to appeal to women and young people during his only election rally Beyond youth unemployment, the electoral process has also stirred controversy, especially with the exclusion of Maurice Kamto from the presidential race. In July the electoral body barred the 71-year-old opposition leader from running because a rival faction of the party that had endorsed him presented someone else as a candidate. His exclusion, confirmed by the Constitutional Council, was widely criticised as a ploy to prevent any strong challenge to President Biya. After coming second in the 2018 presidential election, Kamto claimed victory and organised street protests. ""The exclusion of Prof Kamto waters down the legitimacy of our democracy because we should have been fair enough to allow for everybody to partake,"" says Dr Atia. Mr Wanah agrees that the absence of the country's main opposition figure ""reinforces the perception that truly fair elections cannot take place in Cameroon"". Twelve candidates were approved to contest for the country's top job, including Issa Tchiroma Bakary and Bello Bouba Maigari - both former Biya allies from the north of the country. They resigned from their ministerial positions in government to take on their boss. Lawmaker Cabral Libii, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) party Joshua Osih and Patricia Tomaïno Ndam Njoya - the lone female candidate - are also in the race. At the launch of the election campaign, two aspirants, including renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna, withdrew their candidacies to support Maigari of the NUDP party. This means 10 people will now compete for the presidency. Michel Mvondo / BBC Two candidates have withdrawn from the race and thrown their weight behind Bello Bouba Maigari, once a Biya ally Prior to the poll - which will only be a single-round vote as the person with the most votes will win - there had been widespread calls for the opposition to present a single candidate to challenge Biya, who has never lost an election. Tchiroma Bakary has secured the support of the Union for Change, a coalition of more than 50 political groups and civil society organisations who presented him as the opposition's consensus candidate. But the initiative has failed to gain unanimity, with others refusing to rally behind him. Kamto said he had held talks with some aspirants, including the two northern figures Tchiroma Bakary and Maigari, encouraging them to unite. As neither seemed ready to step down, he urged Cameroonians to vote for whomever they preferred. Dr Atia reckons the failure to endorse one candidate under a single coalition will cost the opposition at the ballot box. On the campaign trail, 76-year-old Tchiroma Bakary, a former government spokesperson, has been pulling big crowds - with some analysts positioning  the Cameroon National Salvation Front party leader as Biya's main challenger. On Sunday, thousands of supporters waited for hours in the rain to see him in the economic capital Douala. He has promised to reform the system of which he was a part for two decades. Despite Tchiroma Bakary's support base in the north, analysts say Biya is likely to overpower him and the other opposition candidates. ""President Biya just needs a slim majority to win the election, and I see him winning despite the efforts being made by the opposition,"" says Dr Atia. Michel Mvondo / BBC Former government spokesperson Issa Tchiroma Bakary has promised reform and is drawing big crowds In Cameroon's English-speaking North-West and South-West regions, where a long-running separatist conflict continues, an election boycott lockdown has been imposed, paralysing business activities, movement and education. The separatists who have imposed it have threatened to target anyone who does vote. ""We have seen people [who] have been pulled out of their homes and slaughtered in cold blood, before, during, and even well after [previous] elections when they are identified,"" Samah Abang-Mugwa, a resident of one of the Anglophone regions, tells the BBC - adding that he will not risk casting his ballot. Since 2017, those seeking to create a breakaway state have been fighting government forces. They are angered by what they see as the marginalisation of Cameroon's minority Anglophone community by the Francophone-dominated government. The conflict has so far killed at least 6,000 people and forced nearly half a million others from their homes, according to the UN. According to civil society activist Abine Ayah, the likely exclusion of much of the English-speaking community could undermine the legitimacy of the election. Although Biya says his government has made significant efforts to resolve the conflict, his opponents in the presidential race continue to criticise his handling of the situation. After Sunday's vote, the Constitutional Council has 15 days to announce the results. The interior minister has already warned that no candidate is allowed to declare victory beforehand. Paul Atanga Nji made the comments on the eve of the last day of campaigning. ""Those who will attempt to announce results of the presidential election or any self-proclaimed victory in violation of the laws of the republic would have crossed the red line and should be ready to face the retaliatory measures commensurate to their crime.""

1f0475acb5c3,Icebreakers and golf spark Trump and Finnish leader's unlikely friendship,,"Icebreakers and golf spark Trump and Finnish leader's unlikely friendship Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House Reuters All smiles - Stubb and Trump There was no small talk required to break the ice between these two leaders who have become unlikely friends. Instead, it was real ice breakers - 9,000-tonne hulking ships - that sealed a deal between Donald Trump and Finland's President Alexander Stubb, cementing their growing business and personal relations. Trump was smiling in their Oval Office meeting on Thursday, leaning in slightly, and nodding in agreement to the man who has become, to many, an unlikely spokesman for Europe. Finland's Alexander Stubb is a leader who, despite his country's relatively small size, has the US president's ear more than most. ""We've been friends for a long time,"" Trump remarked as they sat, facing each other, under a painting of a young George Washington. For the next hour, the two men discussed a broad range of issues - but primarily a deal to purchase 11 icebreaker ships. These are a difficult-to-build Finnish nautical speciality the country uses to break through to ports frozen over in harsh Scandinavian winters, and which Trump has long had his eyes on. Four of those will be built in the US using Finnish know-how, which Stubb promised ""means investments, means jobs and means hope"" - which a grateful Trump said was necessary given Finland's proximity to Russia and what he termed the ""ridiculous"" war in Ukraine. Getty Images Icebreaking ship in Baltic Sea near Helsinki More than any aspect of the bilateral relationship between the US and Finland, the Ukraine war has thrust the relationship between Stubb and Trump into international headlines. Among many observers of the war, Stubb is seen as one of the Nato leaders perhaps best able to sway Trump towards Europe's position on Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. ""I see Finland's outsized influence in Washington as a direct result of the close personal relationship between Stubb and Trump,"" said Jason Moyer, an expert in transatlantic relationships at the Washington-based Atlantic Council. ""Finland and Stubb's pragmatism, knowledge of Russia, consistent support for Ukraine, and the fact that it has specialised technological know-how in its icebreaker ecosystem, provide Finland a larger-than-expected, and certainly well deserved, role in the transatlantic relationship."" he added. At first glance, the two men could not seem more different. While Trump became formally involved in politics late in life after a long career in real estate, his younger Finnish counterpart began his own career through more academic pursuits. He was a researcher for Finland's representative office at the European Union, before working his way through various positions until becoming an MEP in 2004, minister of foreign affairs, prime minister and - last year - his country's president. Stubb's role as what some media outlets have described as a ""Trump whisperer"" has not gone unnoticed in other European capitals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July thanked him for ""helping build a connection"" with Trump as the war in Ukraine continued to rage. At the White House the following month, Stubb sat beside Zelensky - and directly across the table from Trump - at a summit that included the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the European Commission and the EU. ""Finland is a country of 5.5m people,"" Mr Moyer said. ""It shows how interested Trump is [in Finland] and drives home how large an influence the Finns have."" The two men have a warm relationship, and text or call each other often - sometimes on a weekly basis, according to two sources familiar with the conversations. According to Stubb, one such call took place the night before Thursday's Oval Office meeting. ""The White House had learned that if the phone is on 'do not disturb' mode, if you ring three times it lets you through,"" Stubb told reporters. It was Trump on the line, who told him he wanted new icebreakers. truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump A round of golf at Mar-a-Lago in March quickly became an opportunity to discuss the Russia-Ukraine war. While these conversations are often policy-focused, sometimes they are simply friendly chats over a shared passion - golf. It's Trump's favourite pastime and a sport for which Stubb once represented Finland as a member of its national team. ""The golf really matters,"" said Brent Nelsen, a former professor of Stubb's at Furman University in South Carolina, at which the Finnish president studied on a golf scholarship in the late 1980s and early 1990s. ""He's a really, really good golfer."" The importance of Stubb and Trump's shared interest was highlighted in March, when Stubb made a surprise appearance at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to play with the US president, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and famed South African golfer Gary Player. Instantly, Trump was wowed by the Finn's abilities. On Truth Social, Trump wrote that he is ""a very good player"" and that the two won a member-guest tournament together. ""Trump loved that. Alex [Stubb] said he had a really good round,"" said Mr Nelson, who has remained in close contact with his former student and now friend, with whom he penned a textbook about the EU. ""Trump is always impressed with superior talent. Somebody who has some gift that really makes him stand out."" Over 18 holes on the sunny golf course, the two men chatted over a wide range of subjects, ranging from icebreakers to Ukraine. This time together, Stubb later recalled, allowed the two men to get a feel for one another. ""You learn about the personality of a human being on the first hole of a golf course,"" he told Bloomberg. ""You see if they're edgy, if they're impatient, if they're fun, if they're relaxed. I have to say, I had no uncomfortable moments during that round."" Over lunch, Trump asked the Finn whether he could trust Putin, a man who Trump has repeatedly claimed to have a ""great relationship"" with. ""You cannot,"" Stubb replied, he told Bloomberg. Within hours, Trump told NBC that he was ""pissed off"" and ""very angry"" with Putin - his harshest and most pointed criticism of the Russian leader at that point of Trump's second term. Mr Nelsen said that the conversation obviously convinced the president. ""Alex spent seven hours with him in that golf cart,"" he said. ""That had some impact on what Trump was thinking."" Trump's most recent Oval Office meeting with Stubb came just one day after Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel. ""Nobody in history has solved eight wars in a period of nine months, and I've stopped eight wars,"" Trump said in the meeting. ""I did it because I saved a lot of lives, and that's the thing that bothers me so much about Russia-Ukraine."" Stubb sat silently as he spoke, and just a few minutes later, reporters were ushered from the room. But behind closed doors and away from the cameras, Stubb said he and Trump once again discussed the war and the Finn conveyed messages from Zelensky, although he did not provide any details. A more detailed chat on Ukraine, it seems, will have to wait. And no golf on this trip.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g7nl35nz2o,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/60a2/live/f35957c0-a5f3-11f0-af09-bf7f0464c1dc.jpg,2025-10-11T03:44:05.412000+00:00,757c6013827aa93b0a4ff06a21b26f4dd0535d95
7e8d63282fea,How record auctions are fuelling India's art boom,,"How record auctions are fuelling India's art boom Anahita Sachdev BBC News, Delhi Saffronart VS Gaitonde's Untitled fetched $40.2m at a recent record-breaking auction in Delhi A radiant golden canvas layered with subtle textures and faint shapes, exuding both energy and tranquillity. This untitled 1971 painting by Vasudeo Santu Gaitonde headlined a record-breaking recent Saffronart auction in Delhi, which fetched $40.2m (£29.9m) - the highest-ever total for South Asian art. Gaitonde's work alone sold for $7.57m, nearly three times its estimate, making it India's second most expensive painting. The bidding added momentum to an already strong auction season for Indian art. Just days later, Sotheby's sold artist Francis Newton Souza's landscape, Houses in Hampstead , at a price marginally lower than Gaitonde's piece, making it India's third highest grossing painting. Earlier this year, the record for India's most expensive painting was reset when MF Husain's Untitled (Gram Yatra) fetched a staggering $13.8m. Auctioneers and curators say India's art market is witnessing an unprecedented boom, driven by a surge of art fairs, galleries, and exhibition spaces across cities and towns. Industry insiders estimate that the market is worth $338m, up exponentially from $2m at the turn of the century, and will expand to $1.1bn by 2030. Sotheby's Francis Newton Souza's Houses in Hampstead has become India's third most expensive painting Dinesh Vazirani, a founder of Saffronart, believes this is a ""point of massive inflection"". Marking its 25th anniversary, Saffronart's recent auction saw a packed room, spirited bidding, and a rare ""white glove"" result - every lot sold, with some attendees even ""squabbling"" over artworks, according to an attendee. ""When we started in 2000, people said we were crazy. Who's going to buy art online?"" Mr Vazirani said. ""Seeing the art market with so much strength almost validated that what we started as maybe foolish young people has become a very mature industry."" The boom in Indian art - which dominates South Asia's market - comes even as global art sales slump. The 2024 Art Basel and UBS report shows a 12% drop worldwide, the second yearly decline. Mr Vazirani predicts the auction market could double last year's earnings, driven by rising wealth in India and among the diaspora. Millionaire households have nearly doubled in four years. As the rich pour money into their luxurious lifestyle, art has become both a status symbol and an investment. For these groups, art is a generational asset that can also be enjoyed, Mr Vazirani argues. ""They understand that you can't buy it and trade in it. But if you hold it for long periods of time, the appreciation is quite dramatic."" Recent tax cuts slashing goods and services tax (GST) on art from 12% to 5% have also helped boost the market. While global buyers dominate, much of the demand abroad comes from diaspora collectors seeking ""a slice of their heritage"", said Manjari Sihare-Sutin, co-head of Sotheby's Indian and South Asian Art department. Its recent auction, which sold the Souza painting, was another ""white glove"" sale, earning $25.5m - the department's highest total in 30 years. ""I think art has become an important conduit for both local collectors and Indian diaspora outside of India to reconnect with their roots,"" Ms Sihare-Sutin said. Getty The Kochi-Muziris Biennale in the southern state of Kerala is popular for its exhibits These trends have attracted new buyers: a third of Sotheby's last-month bidders were first-timers with them, while Saffronart reports 25–30% of its buyers are recent entrants. While top sales often feature established modernists like Husain, Souza, Gaitonde, and Raza, auctioneers say rising top prices lift demand and values for previously overlooked artists as well. Unlike the brief speculative boom of the early 2000s, which collapsed in 2008, insiders say the current surge in the Indian art market feels more sustainable, going beyond galleries and auctions. Curator Ina Puri notes a resurgence in India's art scene, driven by growing recognition of Indian artists and increased investment in spaces for public engagement. ""I feel that Indian art has made a comeback,"" Ms Puri said. ""Across the country, there are new institutions, museums and spaces coming up to showcase art."" Government funding for the arts has long lagged behind other priorities, leaving the private sector to lead. A notable example is Kiran Nadar Museum of Art's new Delhi building, set to open in 2026, spanning 100,000 sq m and showcasing both visual and performance art. Other examples: Hampi Art Labs in Karnataka offers exhibitions and artist residencies; Art Mumbai fair's third edition in November expects 40,000 visitors; and Renault's planned Chennai design centre will merge technology with artistic collaboration. These join established events like the India Art Fair in Delhi and Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kerala, which draw record crowds annually. Galleries are increasingly showcasing indigenous and marginalised art, Ms Puri said, though more support is needed for students and emerging artists. AFP via Getty Images The India Art Fair in Delhi is a popular event that receives thousands of visitors annually Delhi-based non-profit Khoj, founded in 1997, tries to fill this gap by supporting emerging artists through programs and residencies. Director Pooja Sood notes growing participation from smaller towns often overlooked by the art world. ""They're trying to build their own thing,"" she said. ""It's fantastic"". Rising interest in South Asian art boosts the ecosystem, but record-breaking sales of established artists don't directly aid newcomers - ground-up support remains essential. Ms Sood stresses that Khoj operates outside the commercial art world, offering young and mid-career artists a space to explore, experiment, and ""even fail if they have to"". ""I feel the more mad, crazy, experimental art happens in very small pockets, and that's what we're always trying to build.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69550vgqdo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/883b/live/83053ab0-a59a-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-11T00:17:33.894000+00:00,daf3135dc2b1386b8aaeec4407840cf2550feec0
ac30bf1ddbc9,"As Nobel Prize goes to Venezuela's opposition leader, how far would Trump go to help her?",,"This Nobel Prize win for Maria Corina Machado is being hugely welcomed by the opposition in Venezuela. The hope is it will draw renewed international attention to their cause. Responding to the prize, Machado directly called for help from the man who had hoped he would win it. ""Today more than ever we count on President Trump,"" Machado said. She hopes through the help of him, the US, other nations in Latin America and ""democratic nations of the world"", Venezuela will ""achieve freedom and democracy."" The question is: how far will Donald Trump go? There is a lot at stake in Venezuela right now. Picture a country where millions of people live in poverty. Basic services, like electricity, are unreliable in many areas. The health system is in crisis, with acute medicine shortages. Millions of people citizens have fled in recent years, many to the US or neighbouring countries. The last election was widely dismissed internationally as neither free nor fair. Security forces cracked down on protests after the vote, with many people detained. Human rights organisations believe there are still hundreds of political prisoners. More recently, the US has started bombing boats off the country's coast – in international waters – which it alleges carry drug traffickers. Lawyers say the strikes could breach international law. This is just a snapshot of the situation in and around Venezuela right now. In any other world, it would be a huge story. But the opposition, who the US among others say won the last election, has been left with few obvious paths forward to enact real change. Machado, its de facto leader, is in hiding in Venezuela. The opposition candidate Edmundo González, who the US and others recognise as president-elect, lives in exile. Both face threats and have been accused of ""treason"" by the government. Machado briefly appeared at a protest ahead of President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration in January, but was arrested and then released. The widespread protests that took place after the last election have subsided in frequency, due to fears of repercussions for demonstrators. Calls from the opposition for the military and security forces to abandon President Maduro have so far not produced significant defections. They, and other key militia groups, remain loyal to the president. There is, though, a question about how far the opposition's allies – including the US – might be prepared to go to intervene. In recent weeks, the US has bombed at least four boats in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, killing at least 21 people. The US claims they are drug-trafficking vessels but has not provided any details about those on board. Some lawyers believe the strikes breach international law, but a recent leaked memo sent to Congress said the US is now defining itself as being in a ""non-international armed conflict"" – suggesting it intends to justify using wartime powers against alleged cartels. While it is true that cartels, such as Tren de Aragua, do have a presence in the region some of these vessels are alleged to have come from in Venezuela – this is by no stretch the largest trafficking hotspot in Latin America. That has led many in the region to suspect that Donald Trump's real objective of these strikes, coupled with building up a US military presence in the region, is to exert military pressure on Maduro and remove him from power. The Pentagon has now reportedly built up a force of thousands of troops in the region and has been planning potential military operations. Special operations forces have been sighted by neighbouring Caribbean islands, such as Trinidad and Tobago. Grenada's foreign ministry has said it is reviewing a US government request to temporarily install radar equipment and technical personnel at its airport. Venezuela's defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, has warned about possible US attacks with drones or special forces carrying out ""selective assassinations"". The president of neighbouring Colombia, Gustavo Petro, has claimed that a ""new war scenario has opened up"" in the Caribbean. In Venezuela, civilian reserves have been preparing for a potential US attack. US administration officials argue that Maduro sits on top of Venezuela's cartel network, something that he denies, so it is believed the US would argue that removing him from power is ultimately a 'counter-narcotics' operation. In August, the US doubled a reward for any information leading to his arrest to $50m and accused him of being ""one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world"" – something the government dismissed as ""pathetic."" Venezuela has co-operated with some repatriation flights of migrants from the US, but this has not tamed Trump's wrath for Maduro. On Friday, the New York Times reported that Venezuelan officials offered the Trump administration a dominant stake in Venezuela's heavily-sanctioned oil, gold and minerals resources – but that the Trump administration refused the offer. The Trump administration may have rebuffed the Nobel Peace Prize committee and accused it of being ""political"" for not awarding it to the US president. But, for now, he remains an ally of the Venezuelan opposition and a fierce opponent of Maduro. CBS News - the BBC's US partner - understands Trump called Machado to congratulate her, saying she deserves the award. It remains unclear whether the US will keep its operations to targeting these small vessels in the Caribbean Sea – or has wider plans to target more senior figures within the Maduro administration. Venezuela may not have many allies on the world stage, but there are notable exceptions including China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba. If the US decides to intervene on Venezuelan soil, the situation could escalate very fast.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmegp9lkjro,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/44ae/live/94084770-a5f0-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-10T18:33:53.134000+00:00,4c89078b767a4476759a64787c6832465cbf5417
de7c86102369,Tech billionaires seem to be doom prepping. Should we all be worried?,,"Tech billionaires seem to be doom prepping. Should we all be worried? Zoe Kleinman Technology editor BBC Mark Zuckerberg is said to have started work on Koolau Ranch, his sprawling 1,400-acre compound on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, as far back as 2014. It is set to include a shelter, complete with its own energy and food supplies, though the carpenters and electricians working on the site were banned from talking about it by non-disclosure agreements, according to a report by Wired magazine. A six-foot wall blocked the project from view of a nearby road. Asked last year if he was creating a doomsday bunker, the Facebook founder gave a flat ""no"". The underground space spanning some 5,000 square feet is, he explained, ""just like a little shelter, it's like a basement"". That hasn't stopped the speculation - likewise about his decision to buy 11 properties in the Crescent Park neighbourhood of Palo Alto in California, apparently adding a 7,000 square feet underground space beneath. Bloomberg via Getty Images Zuckerberg spent a reported $110m on properties in a neighbourhood in Palo Alto Though his building permits refer to basements, according to the New York Times, some of his neighbours call it a bunker. Or a billionaire's bat cave. Then there is the speculation around other tech leaders, some of whom appear to have been busy buying up chunks of land with underground spaces, ripe for conversion into multi-million pound luxury bunkers. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has talked about ""apocalypse insurance"". This is something about half of the super-wealthy have, he has previously claimed, with New Zealand a popular destination for homes. So, could they really be preparing for war, the effects of climate change, or some other catastrophic event the rest of us have yet to know about? Getty Images News Sam Altman once speculated about joining Peter Thiel at a remote property in New Zealand in the event of a global disaster In the last few years, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has only added to that list of potential existential woes. Many are deeply worried at the sheer speed of the progression. Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist and a co-founder of Open AI, is reported to be one of them. By mid-2023, the San Francisco-based firm had released ChatGPT - the chatbot now used by hundreds of millions of people across the world - and they were working fast on updates. But by that summer, Mr Sutskever was becoming increasingly convinced that computer scientists were on the brink of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) - the point at which machines match human intelligence - according to a book by journalist Karen Hao. In a meeting, Mr Sutskever suggested to colleagues that they should dig an underground shelter for the company's top scientists before such a powerful technology was released on the world, Ms Hao reports. AFP via Getty Images ""We're definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI,"" Ilya Sutskever is reported to have said ""We're definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI,"" he's widely reported to have said, though it's unclear who he meant by ""we"". It sheds light on a strange fact: many leading computer scientists and tech leaders, some of whom are working hard to develop a hugely intelligent form of AI, also seem deeply afraid of what it could one day do. So when exactly - if ever - will AGI arrive? And could it really prove transformational enough to make ordinary people afraid? An arrival 'sooner than we think' Tech leaders have claimed that AGI is imminent. OpenAI boss Sam Altman said in December 2024 that it will come ""sooner than most people in the world think"". Sir Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, has predicted in the next five to ten years, while Anthropic founder Dario Amodei wrote last year that his preferred term - ""powerful AI"" - could be with us as early as 2026. Others are dubious. ""They move the goalposts all the time,"" says Dame Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at Southampton University. ""It depends who you talk to."" We are on the phone but I can almost hear the eye-roll. ""The scientific community says AI technology is amazing,"" she adds, ""but it's nowhere near human intelligence."" There would need to be a number of ""fundamental breakthroughs"" first, agrees Babak Hodjat, chief technology officer of the tech firm Cognizant. What's more, it's unlikely to arrive as a single moment. Rather, AI is a rapidly advancing technology, it's on a journey and there are many companies around the world racing to develop their own versions of it. But one reason the idea excites some in Silicon Valley is that it's thought to be a pre-cursor to something even more advanced: ASI, or artificial super intelligence - tech that surpasses human intelligence. It was back in 1958 that the concept of ""the singularity"" was attributed posthumously to Hungarian-born mathematician John von Neumann. It refers to the moment when computer intelligence advances beyond human understanding. Getty Images John von Neumann is credited with one of the earliest mentions of the singularity concept, long before it had a name - he was a physicist, mathematician, economist and computer scientist More recently, the 2024 book Genesis, written by Eric Schmidt, Craig Mundy and the late Henry Kissinger, explores the idea of a super-powerful technology that becomes so efficient at decision-making and leadership we end up handing control to it completely. It's a matter of when, not if, they argue. Money for all, without needing a job? Those in favour of AGI and ASI are almost evangelical about its benefits. It will find new cures for deadly diseases, solve climate change and invent an inexhaustible supply of clean energy, they argue. Elon Musk has even claimed that super-intelligent AI could usher in an era of ""universal high income"". He recently endorsed the idea that AI will become so cheap and widespread that virtually anyone will want their ""own personal R2-D2 and C-3PO"" (referencing the droids from Star Wars). ""Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance,"" he enthused. There is a scary side, of course. Could the tech be hijacked by terrorists and used as an enormous weapon, or what if it decides for itself that humanity is the cause of the world's problems and destroys us? AFP via Getty Images Elon Musk has endorsed the idea everyone will want their own R2-D2 and C-3PO ""If it's smarter than you, then we have to keep it contained,"" warned Tim Berners Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, talking to the BBC earlier this month. ""We have to be able to switch it off."" Governments are taking some protective steps. In the US, where many leading AI companies are based, President Biden passed an executive order in 2023 that required some firms to share safety test results with the federal government - though President Trump has since revoked some of the order, calling it a ""barrier"" to innovation. Meanwhile in the UK, the AI Safety Institute - a government-funded research body - was set up two years ago to better understand the risks posed by advanced AI. And then there are those super-rich with their own apocalypse insurance plans. Getty Images ""Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance,"" billionaire Musk once enthused ""Saying you're 'buying a house in New Zealand' is kind of a wink, wink, say no more,"" Reid Hoffman previously said. The same presumably goes for bunkers. But there's a distinctly human flaw. I once met a former bodyguard of one billionaire with his own ""bunker"", who told me his security team's first priority, if this really did happen, would be to eliminate said boss and get in the bunker themselves. And he didn't seem to be joking. Is it all alarmist nonsense? Neil Lawrence is a professor of machine learning at Cambridge University. To him, this whole debate in itself is nonsense. ""The notion of Artificial General Intelligence is as absurd as the notion of an 'Artificial General Vehicle',"" he argues. ""The right vehicle is dependent on the context. I used an Airbus A350 to fly to Kenya, I use a car to get to the university each day, I walk to the cafeteria… There's no vehicle that could ever do all of this."" For him, talk about AGI is a distraction. ""The technology we have [already] built allows, for the first time, normal people to directly talk to a machine and potentially have it do what they intend. That is absolutely extraordinary… and utterly transformational. ""The big worry is that we're so drawn in to big tech's narratives about AGI that we're missing the ways in which we need to make things better for people."" Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg, pictured with his wife Priscilla, has said that the underground space at his Hawaii compound is ""just like a little shelter"" Current AI tools are trained on mountains of data and are good at spotting patterns: whether tumour signs in scans or the word most likely to come after another in a particular sequence. But they do not ""feel"", however convincing their responses may appear. ""There are some 'cheaty' ways to make a Large Language Model (the foundation of AI chatbots) act as if it has memory and learns, but these are unsatisfying and quite inferior to humans,"" says Mr Hodjat. Vince Lynch, CEO of the California-based IV.AI, is also wary of overblown declarations about AGI. ""It's great marketing,"" he says ""If you are the company that's building the smartest thing that's ever existed, people are going to want to give you money."" He adds, ""It's not a two-years-away thing. It requires so much compute, so much human creativity, so much trial and error."" Getty Images Films like 2001: A Space Odyssey have warned about the dangers of sentient computers Asked whether he believes AGI will ever materialise, there's a long pause. ""I really don't know."" Intelligence without consciousness In some ways, AI has already taken the edge over human brains. A generative AI tool can be an expert in medieval history one minute and solve complex mathematical equations the next. Some tech companies say they don't always know why their products respond the way they do. Meta says there are some signs of its AI systems improving themselves. Ultimately, though, no matter how intelligent machines become, biologically the human brain still wins. It has about 86 billion neurons and 600 trillion synapses, many more than the artificial equivalents. Researchers are studying the brain in attempts to better understand consciousness The brain doesn't need to pause between interactions either, and it is constantly adapting to new information. ""If you tell a human that life has been found on an exoplanet, they will immediately learn that, and it will affect their world view going forward. For an LLM [Large Language Model], they will only know that as long as you keep repeating this to them as a fact,"" says Mr Hodjat. ""LLMs also do not have meta-cognition, which means they don't quite know what they know. Humans seem to have an introspective capacity, sometimes referred to as consciousness, that allows them to know what they know."" It is a fundamental part of human intelligence - and one that is yet to be replicated in a lab. Top picture credits: The Washington Post via Getty Images/ Getty Images MASTER.

Serbia's 1-0 defeat by Albania on Saturday means Thomas Tuchel's England can qualify by winning in Latvia on Tuesday, with two matches of their campaign still to play after that trip. The Three Lions have not missed a major tournament since 2008, when they fell short in qualifying for the European Championship under Steve McClaren. Tuchel's side have won all five of their Group K fixtures to date without conceding a goal. And their place at the most-watched sporting event on the planet next summer could now be confirmed within days. What happens if England fail to win in Latvia? Anything but victory in Latvia on Tuesday would leave England still looking for a win against Serbia in November to guarantee qualification. A point in Latvia, though, would mean a draw with Serbia would all but secure their spot because England have a vastly better goal difference than second-placed Albania. England travel to Albania for their final group fixture on 16 November. The 12 group runners-up in the European section of qualifying will participate in the play-offs. They will be joined by the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024-25 Nations League that did not finish in the top two of their European qualifying groups. The 16 teams who enter the play-offs will be drawn into four play-off paths, with four teams featuring in each.

4d9e789f6de3,Cardiff edge out Connacht after Williams injury,,"United Rugby Championship

Cardiff (7) 14

Tries Bowen 2 Cons Sheedy, I Lloyd

Connacht (3) 8

Tries D O'Connor Pen Forde

Wales lock Teddy Williams suffered a serious-looking ankle injury in Cardiff's 14-8 United Rugby Championship win against Connacht sealed with two Tom Bowen tries.

The Blue and Blacks ended a five-game losing streak against the Irish province, although the loss of the Williams in the first half took some shine off.

The lock landed awkwardly on his right ankle after claiming a line-out and a lengthy lay-off looks likely.

Cardiff led 7-3 at half-time thanks to try by elusive wing Tom Bowen, who went over for a hat-trick to earn a pair of consolation bonuses at Munster seven days earlier.

In a game of wasted chances, the next score came in the 76th minute when Bowen snaffled a juggled Connacht pass in his own half and raced away for the clincher.

After starting with a bonus-point win against Lions and then leaving Limerick with a pair of points, Cardiff picked up another win as they cope with the loss of head coach Matt Sherratt to the Wales management team.

Connacht opened the scoring with an 11th-minute penalty from centre Cathal Forde after a scrappy start by both sides.

Cardiff responded swiftly with a seven-pointer when nine phases in the 22 were followed by Callum Sheedy finding Bowen on the left wing with a kick-pass, which the fly-half had used for two assists at Munster seven days earlier.

Sheedy then curled in his effort from the tee to make it 7-3, but the rest of the half was a tale of missed chances for the Blue and Blacks.

They wasted two trips to the Connacht 22 and then blew another opportunity after 26 minutes when Sheedy broke through, but Bowen couldn't hold onto his pass when a run-in looked likely.

Cardiff needed to make their dominance count on the scoreboard, but suffered a blow in the 33rd minute when Williams suffered his injury.

The hosts kept hammering away at the line, but endured more frustration when number eight Alun Lawrence was held up over the line.

The second half was delayed because of a communications issue for the officials, but the same, scrappy pattern continued after the restart with play taking place between the 22s.

Connacht blew a shot at taking the lead in the 65th minute when they worked space down the left only for replacement back Finn Treacey to drop the pass just outside the 22.

They went even closer in the 70th minute when Treacey powerfully burst to the line down the right only to knock on inches short under Sheedy's tackle.

Connacht were suddenly looking threatening against a Blue and Blacks side clinging on and with scrum-half Johan Mulder as a makeshift centre.

Yet a juggled pass gave Bowen the chance to race away and seal the win, Ioan Lloyd converting, before Dave O'Connor earned Connacht a losing bonus at the death.

285095ba6fc8,Ulster secure bonus-point win against Bulls,,"United Rugby Championship, Affidea Stadium

Ulster 28 (7)

Tries: McCloskey, Augustus, Herring, Izuchukwu Cons: Doak 4

Bulls 7 (7)

Tries: Louw Con: Pollard

Ulsterâs impressive start to the United Rugby Championship season continued with a bonus-point win over the Bulls in Belfast.

Stuart McCloskey's first-half try was cancelled out by Wilco Louw in an error-strewn opening period.

However, Ulster took command in the early stages of the second half.

After a yellow card to Bulls number eight Jeandre Rudolph, the hosts scored three tries in the 10 minutes he sat on the touchline.

Juarno Augustus scored on his first start for Ulster with Rob Herring and Cormac Izuchukwu also on the scoresheet, while Nathan Doak converted all four tries.

With two wins from two to begin the new season, Ulster will now make the trip to South Africa for their next two games against the Sharks and Lions on 18 and 25 October.

The only analysis to be done in the first half was on the number of errors by both sides, highlighted by Ulsterâs opening try.

When a Bulls pass along the backline found only empty (artificial) turf, it allowed McCloskey to kick ahead and score.

Ulsterâs maul defence was well organised, stopping the Bulls twice.

However, the visitors were guilty of wasting a number of scoring opportunities, eventually getting over the Ulster line through Springbok tight-head Wilco Louw. It came moments after Ulster hooker Rob Herring was yellow-carded for repeated infringements as the Bulls scrum began to get on top.

After holding the Bulls out in the first half, Ulster turned to attack at the start of the second 40 minutes and their early pressure led to a sin-binning for Bulls number eight Rudolph.

Never in their widest dreams, however, could Ulster have thought they would take such advantage with 21 unanswered points in the 10 minutes the South African was sitting on the sideline.

The tries from Augustus and Herring were the result of knocking at the door against a stretched defence, while Izuchukwu finished another move that began with a Bulls turnover.

A disappointing performance from the visitors - last season's beaten finalists - meant they never looked like mounting a comeback, but Ulster had put them to the sword with some direct rugby and capitalising on their man advantage.

With the Ireland squad for the November Series being named on Wednesday, it remains to be seen if two games are enough to see many of this squad named.

Jacob Stockdale was lively at full-back and he has started there for Ireland before, if only once, in October 2020 against France and with Hugo Keenan missing for the autumn, might he force his way back into the international reckoning?

Izuchukwu is another who impressed, but in the process of scoring his try he appeared to twist his knee and was quickly replaced as a precaution. Injury has robbed him before of a potential Ireland call-up. Letâs hope that isnât the case this time.

That was Wales' first appearance at a major tournament in 58 years with Davies producing a magnificent goal-line clearance in their opener to deny Slovakia an early goal. Davies went on to play at the Covid-delayed 2020 Euros and 2022 World Cup. ""I have loved him. As a coach, he is such a big help. I lean on him a lot,"" said Bellamy.

608c75a70c09,Israelis praise Trump at huge rally ahead of expected hostage release by Hamas in Gaza,,"Israelis praise Trump at huge rally ahead of expected hostage release by Hamas in Gaza Alice Cuddy Tel Aviv and Jaroslav Lukiv Tel Aviv crowd boos as Witkoff thanks Netanyahu Hundreds of thousands of people have held a rally in Tel Aviv, ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages by Hamas. Addressing the crowds, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said the hostages ""are coming home"" and praised Donald Trump for making a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal possible. In Gaza, Palestinian officials said about 500,000 people had returned to northern Gaza - which lies in ruins - in the past two days, following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Meanwhile Egypt confirmed it would host a summit on Monday to finalise an agreement aimed at ending the war. More than 20 leaders including Trump would attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are confirmed to be travelling to Egypt on Monday. Trump is expected to visit Israel on Monday before heading to Egypt. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner also addressed the Tel Aviv rally on Saturday. Under the ceasefire and hostage release deal announced on Thursday, Hamas was given 72 hours - until 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday - to release all the 48 hostages it is still holding after two years of war, 20 of whom are assumed to be alive. Aviv Havron, whose family members were murdered and others kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas, told the BBC in Tel Aviv: ""It's so important for the community... that they come back. Without this, we can't restart our lives. ""My sisters and two brothers in law were murdered. Seven of my family members were kidnapped - my older sister was kidnapped, her daughter, her grandchildren. Four bodies of Be'eri [community] members are still in Gaza,."" Reuters Crowds at the Tel Aviv rally unfurled a banner praising Trump Shulamit and David Ginat, who also attended the Tel Aviv rally, told the BBC all the hostages must be saved. ""They're our brothers and sisters. We want to heal again. We want to stop the war, stop the pain and heal again,"" Shulamit said. Many in the crowd yelled ""Thank you, Trump!"" - but also booed when Witkoff mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking just afterward, the couple said they were angry at him over the failure to prevent the 7 October attack, the war and the failure to bring the hostages home sooner. ""He wants to continue the war only because he wants to stay prime minister,"" David said. In Gaza, Hamas has called up thousands of fighters to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends and fears of internal violence. There have also been reports of armed clashes between Hamas and Gaza clans. Displaced Palestinians have continued to move north in Gaza in large numbers, in many cases arriving to find their homes destroyed. ""There is no house anymore. Everything is gone,"" lawyer Mosa Aldous said over the phone from Gaza City. EPA About 500,000 Palestinians have now returned to Gaza City, the civil defence says Raja Salmi, 52, told AFP she reached Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood to find her home also gone. ""I stood before it and cried. All those memories are now just dust,"" she said. Under the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, the amount of aid entering Gaza is due to be scaled up but the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC that a surge of aid lorries had ""not yet"" entered Gaza, reporting only two to three lorries entering the territory daily. With full access, WFP, a UN agency, said it intended to restore its regular food distribution system, boosting aid through 145 distribution points across Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body overseeing the entry of aid into Gaza, said 500 trucks had entered on Thursday of which around 300 were distributed inside Gaza by the UN and other organisations. A recent report by the world's leading hunger monitor Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), backed by the UN, estimated that 500,000 people in Gaza - a quarter of the territory's population - were suffering from famine. Israel has repeatedly denied that starvation is taking place in Gaza, and Netanyahu has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel. Israel responded by launching a military offensive that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75q5qng0rgo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/aa50/live/d652b260-a6e9-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T21:29:01.643000+00:00,c9fb31c77bf6999555286ab3a8ca8cdbd2fff676
a07a73683fb9,How the autumn climbing season turned deadly in the Himalayas,,"How the autumn climbing season turned deadly in the Himalayas Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent, BBC World Service Getty Images The autumn hiking season is increasingly seeing extreme weather Clear skies, calm winds and a panoramic view of Himalayan peaks draped in snow - that is the autumn hikers on Mount Everest have come to love. But that seems to be changing. Meteorologists say monsoon now stretches into autumn, which is traditionally mountain tourism season. And during this delayed tail end of monsoon, they have recorded at least one episode of extreme rainfall almost every year for the past decade, with mountain weather becoming dangerous. Last weekend, a shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest for days in freezing temperatures at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). Nearly 600 trekkers were guided to safety by the end of Tuesday, Chinese state media said. One person had died from hypothermia and altitude sickness, but the others were reportedly in good condition. This was on the Tibetan side but something similar had unfolded on the Nepal side, where a South Korean mountaineer died on Mera Peak. The world found out much later because communication lines were hit by torrential rains and heavy snowfall. Officials estimate that landslides and flash floods in the country have killed around 60 people over the past week. This is highly unusual for October ""when we expect the skies to remain clear,"" said Riten Jangbu Sherpa, a mountain guide, adding that trekkers have been increasingly caught in unexpected extreme weather in recent years. Given this is the favoured season, frequent storms like this have ""hampered our trekking and mountaineering business,"" he added. The monsoon season in northern India and Nepal usually lasts from June to mid- September, but not anymore. ""Our data shows that most of the years in the past decade have had monsoons lasting until the second week of October, which is definitely a change,"" said Archana Shrestha, deputy director general at Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology. More worrying is the heavy rain and snow the tail end of the season brings, like it did this time on 4 and 5 October - Ms Shreshtha described the pattern as ""damaging precipitation in a short span of time"". High in the Himalayas, such extreme weather means blizzards and snowstorms, which is a huge risk for trekking, mountaineering and tourism. Reuters A snowstorm this month trapped hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest That's what happened last weekend when the weather changed quite suddenly - the winds began howling, temperatures plummeted and visibility dropped drastically. The road that had comfortably brought the hikers to what should have been a stunning pitstop was now buried in snow and impossible to traverse. On Cho Oyu, another mountain which stands between China and Nepal, a team of climbers on the 8,201m peak retreated temporarily as snow fell unabated. ""Now they are back after the heavy snowfall ended,"" said expedition operator Mingma Sherpa, whose team has six members. But for hikers trapped near the eastern face of Everest, the return was much dicier. Some told the BBC they battled hypothermia despite being dressed warmly while trudging along deep snow. Others said they didn't sleep for fear of being buried in the snow, which was falling so heavily that they spent most of their time clearing it. It could have ended in tragically had it not been for a well-coordinated rescue, with yaks and horses deployed to clear the snow. Still, one trekker, who had hiked up these mountains more than a dozen times, told the BBC he had ""never experienced weather like this"". One big driver is the higher amount of moisture in the air because of how the world has been warming, scientists say. That has led to torrential rains over a short span of time, often after a prolonged dry spell – unlike in the past when monsoon showers were spread evenly over four months. ""The weather at this time of the year has been changing every year in recent years, we can't promise our clients anything,"" said Passang, a travel agent in the Tibetan capital Lhasa. ""September, October used to be peak season with pleasant weather but these days we see extreme weather all of a sudden and the temperature drops so quickly."" Getty Images Landslides and flash floods in Nepal over the past week have killed dozens A turbocharged monsoon Weather experts say the monsoons in South Asia at times appear to have become stronger because they are increasingly coming into contact with another weather system, the westerly disturbance. This is a low pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and travels east - it carries cold air that brings rains and occasionally snow to northern India, Pakistan and Nepal. But when it meets air that is warmer and wetter - which is what happens during the monsoon - the result can lead to more extreme weather. Put simply, westerly disturbances can ""effectively turbocharge the monsoon"", said Akshay Deoras, a weather scientist at the University of Reading in the UK. The reason this is happening more often is that these weather systems have traditionally been a winter phenomenon, arriving between December and March in  northern India and the Himalayas. But now, meteorologists say, they are frequently arriving earlier, during monsoon and autumn. The deluge of rain and snow in eastern Nepal, where Everest is located, in early October was also because of the westerly disturbance, officials at Nepal's meteorology department said. They added that the westerly disturbance had fuelled a low-pressure system (a part of the tail end of monsoon) from the Bay of Bengal, pushing the clouds eastwards when in fact they should have moved west. Scientists have also found that in a warming world, the growing interaction between westerly disturbances and monsoons is producing another unusual result. The warmer air is pushing the clouds higher, which means these weather systems are now able to cross the Himalayas and reach Tibet and other areas that did not see so much rain before. A study published in the journal Nature in June notes that ""the warming climate and the interaction between the westerly and the Indian monsoon are making the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau change into a warming and wetting climate"". The Tibetan plateau has always been home to a dry climate. And scientists say a warm, wet Tibet could mean unstable weather and frequent snowstorms and blizzards. ""What's changed is the reliability of patterns; we can't assume that conditions will behave the same from season to season,"" said Logan Talbott, chief guide with Alpenglow Expeditions that brings climbers to the Tibet side of Everest each year. ""That means flexible scheduling, real-time decision-making, and experienced leadership [in the Himalayas] have become even more important.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jwgnwmezo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99f9/live/db61de90-a5c5-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-11T22:17:35.335000+00:00,42fe02241c965f046089ab99e494b613b288c635
d50a25123ef0,Allen's Sheffield big night out ends in Makhmudov loss,,"British heavyweight David Allen's fairytale headline show ended in a unanimous points defeat to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov at a raucous Sheffield Arena. Judges scored the fight 115-111, 117-109 and 116-10 in favour of Makhmudov. The 33-year-old Allen had previously fought at the venue five times, but this was his first time as a headliner and a 9,000-strong crowd came out to support their South Yorkshire hero, who quit boxing five years ago and planned a quiet life. He returned to the sport with titles on his mind, and for big nights like this. ""I've never, ever seen anything like it,"" Allen said after the fight. ""I nearly cried. I had to really choke it all back a bit on the ramp. I'm not finished."" The imposing Makhmudov entered the fight with 19 knockouts from his 20 wins, and with just two defeats it made him the toughest opponent Allen has faced. As chants of ""There's only one Dave Allen"" rang around the venue, the home fighter had to bite down on his gumshield early on and take thudding blows from Makhmudov. With the names of his children, Betty and George, etched on his shorts, Allen started to stalk Makhmudov, with a massive body shot followed by a right uppercut landing in the fifth round. Allen sparked to life in the ninth round and connected with an overhand right, but Makhmudov showed toughness and durability. In the 12th round, Makhmudov had a second points deduction â both were for holding. This, along with the roar of the crowd, encouraged Allen to push on and land another monstrous right hook, but it was not enough. The 'White Rhino' has been here before - suffering some major setbacks during his 13 years as a professional. Allen's career appeared to be in tatters numerous times, but he has emerged from retirement and rebuilt over the past four years and will look to do so again. A stoppage loss to David Price in 2019 ended with Allen being stretchered out of the ring and he gave up the sport the following year. Allen's attention turned to training young boxers Joe Hayden and Joe Howarth - both of whom won on Saturday's Sheffield undercard - before confirming a return to the sport he loved at a ""low level"". After two wins via small hall shows, a loss to Olympic bronze medallist Frazer Clarke was only a minor setback as Allen was quick to accept a fight with undefeated heavyweight Johnny Fisher, without knowing this would catapult his career. Allen was on the wrong end of a contentious loss in Saudi Arabia before knocking out Fisher in a rematch at a sold-out Copper Box Arena in May 2025.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cy505wq4vxro,Sport,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/938a/live/8378fe10-a6ed-11f0-954d-8bf0310a3d21.jpg,2025-10-11T22:30:07.997000+00:00,0ffdda80deeaa6ed846e0a04872fd4d9ec17bb2b

Casualties are not yet clear in what the Taliban called ""retaliatory operations"", after it said Pakistan violated Afghan airspace and bombed a market inside its border on Thursday. Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi called the Taliban attacks ""unprovoked"", accusing them of firing at civilians. Pakistani forces would respond ""with a stone for every brick"", he warned. Islamabad accuses Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban reject. The escalation came as the Afghan Taliban foreign minister was in India for an historic visit. Both sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands. Saying he ""strongly condemns"" the Taliban's attacks, Naqvi stated: ""The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws. ""Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,"" he said in a post on X. A Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties. Pakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source told the BBC firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha. A police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT). He said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border. Last week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's ""sovereign territory"" , as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday. Pakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed. A top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a ""base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan"". Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban,  known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance. The Taliban government has always denied this. The latest escalation came as the Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was in India for a week-long visit. In a diplomatic thaw, Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago when the Taliban returned to power. ""Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,"" Naqvi warned. In a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul.

Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April. Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday. The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier. She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries. ""The police caught him with it and charged him,"" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military. ""I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,"" Ms Hasina said. In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army , Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment. He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September. The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added. The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/Facebook Mr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year later On Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives. ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an ""average student"" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity. Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. ""Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,"" said  Kasam Sumra. ""We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work."" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing. In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army. The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine. ""We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,"" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.

The vast wildlife sanctuary, called the Sabi Game Reserve at the time, was re-christened in 1926 to honour Paul Kruger. He was president in the late 19th Century of what was known as the South African Republic, which forms part of what is now the east of South Africa. For Afrikaners, descendants of 17th Century European settlers, Kruger is revered as a hero who led the resistance against British colonialism. But for the majority of South Africans, he is viewed as a relic of the country's racist past, as he was one of those responsible for driving black Africans off their land and excluding them from having a say in running the republic. Many South African cities, towns, roads and other major infrastructure have been given new names since the end of the legalised system of racial discrimination, known as apartheid, and the beginning of the democratic era in 1994. Though sometimes controversial, the decisions have been justified as a way to break with what went before – both the apartheid and colonial era. But the proposed Kruger name-change does not just touch on history, it also could have a bearing on the country's fragile economy.

Some argue that changing Kruger's name could threaten that. Part of the park is in Mpumalanga province and in September, as the country celebrated Heritage Month, representatives from the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) put forward a proposal in the region's legislature to change Kruger's name. ""How do we celebrate our heritage as South Africans when we still have our beautiful national parks named after the architect of apartheid Paul Kruger,"" EFF representative Rhulani Qhibi was quoted as saying in a stirring speech. While not historically accurate, as apartheid in its legal form was introduced decades after Kruger's death, the rhetoric reflects the way he is viewed by some. The EFF also proposed the renaming of other key landmarks in the province, including the Kruger Mpumalanga International airport. But in their haste to remove Kruger's association with the park, the EFF, whose national leader is the firebrand MP Julius Malema , put forward another problematic name: Skukuza. Skukuza, which means ""he who sweeps clean"" in the Tsonga language, was the nickname given to the park's first warden, James Stevenson-Hamilton, who was known for driving out poachers and black communities that lived in the park in its early days, among other things. The EFF leader in Mpumalanga, Collen Sedibe, was quoted in South African publication Sunday World as admitting the party's blunder. ""We are still engaging with the land claimants at Kruger National Park and the people who were staying there because they said Skukuza is not the right name. He was the man who kicked them out of the park,"" Sedibe said. Gallo Images via Getty Images The Paul Kruger statue in Pretoria has sometimes attracted the ire of protesters - it was daubed with red paint in 2020 Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum condemned the EFF's proposal as ""cheap politics and proof that political power-hunger in the province outweighs informed or responsible decision-making"". The group vowed to mount legal challenges to any attempts to rename the park without due process and blasted the EFF for criticising its namesake. ""The Kruger National Park was created thanks to Kruger's vision [and] to ignore Kruger's contribution to the establishment of the country's most important national park... is opportunistic and blatantly spreading lies,"" AfriForum's Marais de Vaal said in reaction to the news. The motion to change the name was adopted by the provincial legislature after receiving support from its largest parties, the African National Congress (ANC), which is in power nationally, and uMkhonto weSizwe. Despite it not being legally binding, as there is a national process that any name change needs to go through, detractors have warned that if approved it could damage the tourism sector, which contributes almost 9% to the country's economy. It could have ""severe consequences... it might even dilute the international recognition of this park and South Africa as a tourism destination that we've built over so many years"", tourism expert Prof Elmarie Slabbert told the BBC. There would also be the cost of having to rebrand the park. The academic, a research director at the North West University's school of tourism management, did acknowledge ""that we need to honour indigenous heritage"". ""But the effect on the economy is going to be so significant that we need to decide where do we spend our money. We've got such a high unemployment rate at this point in time that I believe that is where the money should go."" More than 30% of the working-age population are unemployed - ranked by the World Bank as one of the worst jobless rates of any nation – and youth unemployment is even higher. But economics is not the only basis on which name-change decisions have been made. The need to address the inequities of the country's past has been seen as vital. Getty Images The Indian Ocean city of Gqeberha was known as Port Elizabeth until 2021 For instance, the name of former Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, a key figure in implementing apartheid, has been removed from many places. Other changes include the city of Port Elizabeth. Named after the wife of a 19th Century British official, it is now called Gqeberha, the Xhosa word for the river that runs through it. King William's Town, after William IV, is now Qonce, also referring to a river. Johannesburg's international airport, once known as Jan Smuts – honouring a former prime minister – is now called OR Tambo, after the anti-apartheid leader and former president of the ANC. Some cities, like the capital, Pretoria, have kept their monikers but the local government areas under which they come have been renamed. Plenty of other renaming ideas have been floated, including changing the name of the Eastern Cape seaside town of Port Alfred, which commemorates Queen Victoria's second son. Some have even suggested changing the country's name to Azania. Many of these proposals have divided public opinion, and to ensure that changes are not just made on a whim there is an extensive legal process that needs to be completed. It is managed by the South African Geographical Names Council (SAGNC) and begins with an application either by individuals, communities or institutions to the body's provincial branch. The proposal is discussed and could lead to a public consultation. Once this has been concluded, the name-change plan is sent to the national office. If it is thought to satisfy ""all the requirements"", a recommendation will then be made to the sports, arts and culture minister for a final decision, SAGNC chairperson Dr Nkadimeng Mahosi told the BBC. ""What is happening here [in Mpumalanga's legislature], does not go according to what the national act says… [and] is political point-scoring,"" he said. As a national landmark, and the fact that different government departments will need to have a say, Kruger is a unique case, Dr Mahosi added. There are then several bureaucratic hurdles that need to be negotiated before the name Kruger ever disappears from tourism brochures. But the debate has revealed the sensitivities that continue to exist around how to deal with the country's past and the legacy of those who used to govern it.

5711ee3f748d,KPop Demon Hunters directors on Oscar chances and a possible sequel,,"KPop Demon Hunters directors on Oscar chances and a possible sequel Colin Paterson Entertainment correspondent Netflix Zoey, Rumi and Mira are Huntr/x - the Kpop trio who also try and save the world from evil Maggie Kang, the creator and co-director of Kpop Demon Hunters, has said she is ""excited for the potential for more stories"" involving animated girl group Huntr/x. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to Europe, Kang explained that while there was ""nothing official we can talk about"", she and co-director Chris Appelhans believe ""there's definitely more we can do with these characters in this world"". ""And whatever it will be, it will be a story that deserves to be a sequel, and it will be something that we want to see,"" she added. Kpop Demon Hunters has become a cultural phenomenon this year, overtaking Squid Game as the most watched title in Netflix history, with more than 325m views. Getty The directors of Kpop Demon Hunters, Chris Appelhans and Maggie Kang The animated film tells the story of a hugely successful female Kpop trio, who play enormous concerts at the same time as trying to save the world from evil forces. They end up locked in battle against a boy band called Saja Boys, who are made up of demons. The film has broken record after record. A sing-a-long version released in cinemas in August became the first ever Netflix film to top the US box office. Its music also topped the US singles and albums charts, becoming the first soundtrack in history to have four songs simultaneously in the US top 10, something not even Saturday Night Fever could achieve. The film's anthem Golden, sung by Huntr/x, has spent eight weeks at number one, tying Sugar Sugar by The Archies for the most time at the top of the charts by an animated act. Could the Oscars go Golden? There is now a real belief that Kpop Demon Hunters could be set to slay the Oscars. Critics have loved the film, which holds a score of 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , the online review aggregator. The influential Gold Derby predictions website now has it as the favourite for the best animated film , ahead of Zootopia 2 and Elio. ""The title alone is obviously Oscar bait,"" laughs Chris Appelhans, the American who is the other half of the directing duo. ""We tried to do something new and it was really hard and I think we're really proud of how it came out. But if people are going to reward that, that would be awesome."" The other category where the film should be a strong challenger is best original song, where the rules state that any film can only enter three numbers. Netflix Songs by both Hunter/x and the Saja Boys, the boyband populated by demons, could be nominated at the Oscars Netflix have already stated that breakout hit Golden will be included for Academy consideration, but what about the other two slots? ""I think Your Idol is such a banger,""  says Kang about song the Saja Boys sing while feeding the souls of their audience to the evil overlord Gwi-Ma. ""We're so proud of the song, but also the sequence. We cheered, we were so proud of it."" Appelhans, however, is team Huntr/x, opting for What it Sounds Like. ""The finale was such a technical challenge, both in songwriting and storytelling,"" he explains. ""To make a song that was the climax of your movie, with a lot of moving parts, but was also an actual cathartic song."" Kang concurs: ""It's the one song that every time I hear it, I just cry. It's very emotional."" ""No room for Soda Pop?"" I question about the Saja Boys earworm. ""Maybe we could get four?"" laughs Kang. ""We'll just submit then all,"" joins in Appelhans. Summer of success Appelhans can pin point the exact moment back in June when he realised they had a hit on their hands. ""It's literally 2am the night after the film came out. I'm on TikTok and in the comments section they are perfectly articulating Rumi's emotional journey."" He was overjoyed that the fans were already engaging with film's main protagonist, on a deep level. Kang, who was born in South Korea and moved to Canada aged five, places the breakthrough moment as slightly later. ""We were able to connect with our core audience, which is the KPop audience and the animation fans and that demographic took to our film very quickly. ""But it was the third week when the trajectory of the graph of viewership really changed. We were like, 'Woah. That was weird.' ""And we could see through our social media all the different pockets of demographic that were connecting to it."" Kang believes that the fans have been crucial in film's all conquering rise: ""They are an age group that loves to make content. And it was kind of like free advertising. They were just spreading the word of this movie everywhere. I think that helped it develop these long legs."" The film's success continues to grow. Four months after its release, it was still the most watched film in 19 countries last week, including the UK and US. The Kpop stars Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices for Huntr/x, have appeared on both Saturday Night Live (in a skit with Bad Bunny) and gave their first ever live performance of Golden on Jimmy Fallon's US chat show . ""We were so bummed that we weren't able to be there at Fallon,"" says Kang in a rare moment of non-total positivity. ""We were asleep in Paris. Just to see him speaking to our girls was so weird. It now feels more real than ever. I'm just so proud of them. Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images (L-R) Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices of Huntr/x, were presented with a platinum disc by Fallon One thing the pair would like to clear up is that they do not believe that their film should be classified as anime. ""I don't think we are big enough anime fans to be that inspired from it,"" explains Kang. ""The anime we like are very old school, like Cowboy Bebop and Sailor Moon,"" referencing two Japanese TV shows which originated in the 90s. Appelhans agrees: ""I think it was a flavour. I think we were influenced by a lot of Korean film makers and k-dramas. It was part of a wide spectrum of tones that we wanted to hit, but not the dominant one."" No live action adaptation They are also quick to rule out rumours of a Kpop Demon Hunters live-action adaptation. Kang wants to kick that idea into the underworld: ""There's so many elements of the tone and the comedy that are so suited for animation,"" she says. ""It's really hard to imagine these characters in a live action world. It would feel too grounded. So totally it wouldn't work for me."" For Appelhans, it is an ill-conceived idea: ""One of the great things about animation is that you make these composites of impossibly great attributes. Rumi can be this goofy comedian and then singing and doing a spinning back-kick a second later and then freefalling through the sky. ""The joy of animation is how far you can push and elevate what's possible. I remember they adapted a lot of different animes and often times, it just feels a little stilted."" Ricky Midlesworth/ Netflix The speaking voices of Huntr/x: Ji-young Yoo (Zoey), Arden Cho (Rumi) and May Hong (Rumi) No matter what happens this awards season, Kang says their expectations for the film have already been more than surpassed. She surmises that the aim was ""to connect people and bring them to Kpop"". ""Just seeing people bond over this movie has been so wonderful,"" she reflects. ""So all the awards would be great, but I think we feel really incredible about what the movie has done already. So it feels like we've kind of won in a way.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvzmyyzmpo,World,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5227/live/940c9bf0-a5ea-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T23:04:33.226000+00:00,d6d3596d829dd145be3d399578b4390988e81ae2
