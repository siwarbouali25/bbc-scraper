ad85897925e4,"My approach will pay off eventually, says Kemi Badenoch",,"My approach will pay off eventually, says Kemi Badenoch Kemi Badenoch: ""I was elected to do exactly what I am doing now"" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said there may be a ""price to pay"" in the opinion polls but insisted her approach to changing her party would ""pay off eventually"". Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Badenoch argued that unlike Labour and Reform UK she wouldn't ""rush out"" new policies and would instead take ""time to get it right"". She acknowledged that the Conservative Party may take a ""small"" political hit for the strategy but said: ""Nothing good comes quickly."" As her party's conference kicks off in Manchester, Badenoch is facing questions about her first year as leader which has seen the party perform poorly in the polls and in local elections . The party has been losing support to Reform, and some former Conservatives MPs - and one current one - have defected to Nigel Farage's party. Asked if Reform had stolen the Conservatives' thunder, Badenoch said: ""Reform rushed out an announcement on indefinite leave to remain - they hadn't done the actual work. ""All of a sudden lots of Europeans with settled status didn't know what was going to happen to them. ""I make sure that when I announce something I think about how it is going to impact people. ""Winning elections without a plan is what got us into trouble, it is why Labour is floundering and that is what Reform will deliver. ""I said I want to do politics differently - doing it differently means being patient and taking our time to get it right."" Speaking to the same programme, Conservative Mayor of Tees Valley Lord Ben Houchen, said the party should have got ""our show on the road much sooner than we have"" and added that ""a space"" had been created for Reform to ""steal a march"". ""We need to start to pull our socks up... start to communicate better and start to outline what a positive Conservative Party can deliver for this country."" In the build-up to the conference, the Conservatives have released a string of policies including an intention to repeal the Climate Change Act, leave the European Convention on Human Rights and a plan to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants. Badenoch told Laura Kuenssberg there were ""too many people in our country who should not be here"". Asked where the people being deported would be sent to, Badenoch said: ""I'm tired of us asking all of these irrelevant questions about where should they go. ""They will go back to where they should do or another country, but they should not be here. ""We cannot have a situation where we cannot deport people, we don't know where they will go so they can stay here. ""That is basically inviting every single person across the world to our shores because we don't know where they would go after. That is a defeatist attitude and I will not have that."" In a later interview with GB News, Badenoch said that MPs who did not agree with leaving the ECHR would not be able to stand as a Conservative candidate. She said party members could have different views but added: ""If you want to be a Member of Parliament as a Conservative, then you need to understand that leaving the ECHR is a manifesto commitment.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l81766g2qo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2510/live/e99ea350-a1d1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-05T10:07:37.609000+00:00,73ab04a6a56f1ef7da737d836d2f28803c05a16a
2e2fe331eaca,Police to get broader powers to restrict repeated protests,,"Police to get broader powers to restrict repeated protests Shabana Mahmood: ""This is not about a ban, it's about restrictions and conditions"" Police forces will be granted powers to put conditions on repeat protests, the government has announced, a day after nearly 500 protesters were arrested . Senior officers will be able to consider the ""cumulative impact"" of previous protests, the Home Office said, which could mean they instruct organisers to hold events elsewhere if a site has seen repeated demonstrations. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the move was not a ban on protests but ""about restrictions and conditions"". Organisers of Saturday's protests, against Palestine Action being made a proscribed terror organisation, had been urged to postpone them after two men were killed in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester. Police forces had warned resources would be stretched, with officers across the country offering additional support to hundreds of synagogues and Jewish community sites. The new powers will be ""brought forward as soon as possible"", the Home Office said. Currently, for police to ban a march entirely, there needs to be a risk of serious public disorder. But under the new rules, where there have been repeated protests, police could impose conditions such as requiring it to be held elsewhere or on the duration of events. Mahmood said that while the right to protest is fundamental ""this freedom must be balanced with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear"". Large, repeated protests could leave sections of the country, particularly religious communities, ""feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes"", she added. This had been particularly evident within the Jewish community recently, she said. She told Laura Kuenssberg she was ""very worried about the state of community relations in our country"". ""I know I, as the home secretary, have a responsibility to think about the action the government can take to strengthen our communities, to make sure people are well-integrated into our society,"" she said. The home secretary will carry out a review of current protest legislation to ""ensure powers are sufficient and being applied consistently"", the government said. This will include powers to ban protests outright, the government said. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch backed the new powers but questioned why it had taken so long and said the government must prove it had the backs of Jewish people. ""We believe in free speech but that has to be within the bounds of the law, if protests are used to intimidate, to incite hatred then that is not protest,"" she told Kuenssberg. Kemi Badenoch says the government 'must prove to Jewish people it has their back' Asked about the protests Mahmood said: ""I think just because you have a freedom doesn't mean to say you have to use it at every moment of every day, those people could have just waited a day or two and given people the chance to grieve and process what has happened."" Most of those arrested at protests on Saturday were held on suspicion of supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. Organisers Defend Our Juries said around 1,000 took part in demonstrations around Trafalgar Square against the ban on the group and opposing Israel's actions in Gaza. Following the Home Office announcement on protests the group posted on social media accusing the government of ""silencing opposition"" and ""authoritarianism"". Hundreds of people have been arrested since the group was outlawed by former home secretary Yvette Cooper in the summer, predominantly for holding signs saying they support Palestine Action. Israel has repeatedly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and that its actions are justified as a means of self-defence following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. But last month the world's leading association of genocide scholars said that Israel's conduct meets the legal definition as laid out in the UN convention on genocide . The arrests have been criticized by human rights group Amnesty International, which said arresting people for ""peacefully sitting down and holding these signs"" was not a job for the police. Watch: Activists applauded their fellow protesters as they were detained Organisers of Saturday's protest, Defend Our Juries, had been asked to reconsider their plans following the killing of two men at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur - the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar. But organisers said in a statement beforehand it hoped police ""choose to prioritise protecting the public from real terrorism, and not waste resources on enforcing the absurd and ridiculous ban on Palestine Action"". Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz were killed after Jihad Al-Shamie drove a car into people outside synagogue in Manchester. Al-Shamie then tried to force his way into the building before being shot dead by armed police. Three others were injured in the attack. Several arrests have been made in relation to the attack and Mahmood said four people remained in custody on Sunday morning. The home secretary will write to chief constables on Sunday to encourage them to use all their powers to prevent and respond to public disorder, as well as thanking them for their response following Thursday's attack. Police forces are working with the Community Security Trust, a charity which works to protect Jewish people from terror and antisemitism, to reassure the Jewish community, the home office said. On Sunday, the Board of Deputies of British Jews is holding a commemorative event ahead of Tuesday's second anniversary of the 7 October attacks on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The group has welcomed the government's move to increase police powers and described recent protests as ""deeply irresponsible and offensive"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24rmdngrrjo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c914/live/2fffa270-a1cf-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-05T10:11:29.865000+00:00,df12e1a78af097241c429bffa847cfdf530123d5
e9f909e4722b,"Tories pledge to remove 750,000 migrants under borders plan",,"Tories pledge to remove 750,000 migrants under borders plan Paul Seddon Political reporter, Conservative Party Conference, Manchester Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch: ""They'll go back to where they came from"" The Conservatives say they would task officials with removing 750,000 illegal immigrants within five years, under Trump-style deportation plans. Under plans unveiled as its annual conference begins, the party has pledged to ban people who enter the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum. It would also prevent those whose claims are rejected from challenging decisions in the courts, with appeals instead handled by Home Office officials. Border officials would be instructed to remove people ""within hours or at most a few days"", the Tories say, with a reformed ""Removals Force"" unit seeing their funding doubled to £1.6bn per year. It comes as Tory activists gather in Manchester for their annual party conference, amid dire poll ratings under leader Kemi Badenoch and questions over how they can head off a potentially existential challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. In the run-up to the four-day gathering, the party has already said it would end the UK's 75-year membership of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to thwart asylum appeals, confirming a widely-expected policy shift. Under the latest proposals, the Home Office's immigration enforcement unit would be rebranded as a ""Removals Force"" and given wider-ranging powers, along with an extra £820m per year the Tories say could be unlocked by closing asylum hotels. The party says it would give the new unit a ""mandate"" to remove at least 150,000 people each year, totalling 750,000 during the five-year lifetime of a Parliament. This would include people currently living in the UK illegally, the party says, as well as future illegal arrivals and all foreign nationals convicted of a crime more serious than minor parking or speeding offences. It would represent around a five-fold increase from the 35,000 migrants who were removed from the UK over the last year - the majority of whom went voluntarily. Visas threat The Tories say people would be deported to their home country if possible, or to ""safe"" third countries that would agree to take them. Like Reform, the party says it would negotiate returns agreements with other nations, and threaten to withhold aid spending and visas from countries that decline to co-operate. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Badenoch said illegal migrants should ""go back to where they came from"". But pressed repeatedly to set out where people would go, she did not name particular countries, branding the question ""irrelevant"", adding that concerned voters were ""not interested in these sorts of questions"". 'No need for lawyers' The party says it wanted to take inspiration from the US, where President Trump has handed immigration enforcement officers sweeping new powers to arrest and deport undocumented migrants. The Tories say they would instruct police forces to check the details of everyone they arrest against biometric borders data, and would be allowed to use facial recognition without informing the public it is in use. It plans to expand an unspecified ""existing facility"" to detain migrants before they are removed, with a capacity for between 1,000 and 2,000 people. The party also plans to restrict the grounds for claiming asylum to those facing a threat from the government in their home country, excluding claims from those fleeing conflict or ""less tolerant"" laws on religion or sexuality. Key to their proposals is a plan to abolish the Immigration Tribunal, which hears challenges to failed asylum claims, handing the appeals process instead to a team of officials within the Home Office. The Tories also plan to abolish taxpayer-funded legal aid in immigration cases, with a document on the proposals arguing there ""will be no need for lawyers"" because claims would be ""fairly assessed against the criteria"". ECHR divide The Conservatives' plan comes after Reform UK made similar pledges over the summer to take the UK out of the ECHR and deport 600,000 migrants within five years if it won power. Badenoch sought to portray her party's plans as more credible, adding that it was backed by ""comprehensive legal analysis"" in the form of a review by Tory peer and former justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar. ""Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival,"" she added. The Tory move to leave the ECHR creates a key dividing line with the Labour government, which has opted against leaving the treaty but is reviewing how it is applied in UK law. Labour has also pledged tougher action to deal with small boat crossings over the English Channel, which are set to break record numbers this year. Labour recently set out plans to lengthen refugees' route to permanent settlement in the UK in a bid to make the country less appealing to migrants, and has negotiated a ""one in, one out"" pilot scheme with France. Unlike Reform, the Tories are not promising to formally disapply the Refugee Convention, a 1951 treaty that prevents signatory countries from returning refugees to countries where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. But the party says it would legislate to prevent courts having regard to it in asylum cases, with a pledge to leave if ""activist judges attempt to override Parliament"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708g5x2yqzo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/51dc/live/637c5ed0-a1d0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-05T09:50:00.189000+00:00,f91cf706e5c8f293267f61775811521b2928ef09
e796b8833e23,"UK will leave ECHR if Tories win election, Badenoch says",,"The Conservatives will take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election, Kemi Badenoch has announced. The announcement comes after a review by the Conservative party's lead lawyer found staying in the ECHR blocks migration reform and leads to the persecution of military veterans. Last year Badenoch said leaving the treaty would not be a ""silver bullet"" for tackling immigration, but on Friday argued the move was necessary to ""protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens"". Labour said the Conservative leader had adopted ""a policy she argued against"" because she is ""too weak to stand up to her own party in the face of Reform"". The announcement on the eve of the party's conference in Manchester will settle the party's position following months of internal divisions. The ECHR had become a focal point in the Conservative Party's immigration debate, with senior figures arguing that its provisions have obstructed efforts to deport foreign criminals and failed asylum seekers. Announcing plans to leave marks a sharp shift in Conservative policy and will likely become a central theme of the party's election campaign. It comes amid growing pressure from Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR. Badenoch said: ""I have not come to this decision lightly, but it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens. ""I have always been clear that we should leave the ECHR, if necessary, but unlike other parties we have done the serious work to develop a plan to do so – backed by legal advice from a distinguished King's Counsel."" The announcement comes after detailed legal review led by shadow attorney general Lord Wolfson of Tredegar concluded that the ECHR placed ""significant constraints"" on the government. The review, set up by Badenoch in June, tested how international law impacted five key Conservative policy proposals: deporting foreign criminals and illegal immigrants, protecting military veterans from legal action, prioritising British citizens in access to public services, ensuring prison sentences reflect parliamentary intent, and preventing courts using climate change laws to block planning reforms. “In all the five policy areas, the ECHR places significant constraints,"" Lord Wolfson found. This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government would look again at how international laws including the ECHR were interpreted by UK courts - to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation on the grounds they could be sent to worse prisons or healthcare systems. Sir Keir told the BBC he did not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but said mass migration in recent years meant there needed to be a change. Legal experts have warned leaving the ECHR would carry serious political and legal consequences. Catherine Barnard, University of Cambridge professor of EU Law, has noted withdrawal would isolate the UK alongside Russia and risk breaching both the Good Friday Agreement and the UK-EU trade deal. But Lord Wolfson's nearly 200 page legal advice reportedly found that alternative domestic attempts to soften the impact of the ECHR rules would be ineffective. He also said withdrawal would not breach the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement or the Windsor Framework. A Labour Party spokesperson said the decision had been ""forced on"" Badenoch, and not been ""thought through"". ""Badenoch now thinks she is both incapable of negotiating changes to the ECHR with our international partners, and a sufficiently accomplished diplomatic operator to renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement."" Conservative shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said the ECHR had ""enabled foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to stay in the UK"", adding: ""Protecting our borders is non-negotiable."" During previous debates on immigration, moderate conservatives have expressed concern about leaving the ECHR. In 2023, ex-deputy prime minister Damian Green said leaving the ECHR was a ""red line"" for the One Nation Tories group he chaired. More recently, Boris Johnson's justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland said leaving the ECHR would be an act of folly - calling instead for reform from within. Both Green and Sir Robert lost their seats in the 2024 election and no longer sit in Parliament. A Reform UK spokesman said ""nobody trusts a single word"" the Conservatives said. ""The Conservatives had 14 years in government to leave the ECHR. Since then, it's taken them 14 months to even decide what their policy is,"" the spokesman said. ""The Conservative Party is finished."" The Liberal Democrats seized on Tory splits, telling ""former One Nation Conservatives who have been abandoned by their party's lurch to the extremes: you have a home with us"", Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said by leaving the ECHR ""Kemi Badenoch has chosen to back Nigel Farage and join Vladimir Putin"". ""This will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system – problems caused by the last Conservative Government that Badenoch still hasn't apologised for,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mxy2j2elro,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/299f/live/f343b7e0-a098-11f0-a918-e111dd54869c.jpg,2025-10-04T11:04:17.343000+00:00,07cfd5216d41317f402b98fc9c2dd27eaebf4642
b84bb637818f,Starmer tells protesters to 'respect grief of British Jews',,"Starmer tells protesters to 'respect grief of British Jews' Suzanne Leigh and Ben Hatton Getty Images Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, visited the scene in Manchester on Friday morning Sir Keir Starmer has said pro-Palestinian protests planned for this weekend will cause ""distress"" and urged those thinking of taking part to ""recognise and respect the grief of British Jews"" after Thursday's synagogue attack. ""It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain,"" the prime minister wrote in the Jewish News and the Jewish Chronicle. A leader of the Community Security Trust (CST) charity, which provides security for the Jewish community, told the BBC it was ""phenomenally tone deaf"" to be ""taking police resources away from protecting the rights and freedoms of Jewish people"". But a spokesperson for protest group Defend Our Juries said: ""Cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win."" Pro-Palestinian protests are taking place in both London and Manchester on Saturday. The leaders of both the Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police have said covering protests will stretch resources at a time when police have deployed extra officers to synagogues and other Jewish buildings to offer protection and reassurance. The prime minister's comments came after Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood called for demonstrators to ""step back"" and give people a chance to grieve. She said there were ""strong"" powers to protect the freedom to protest, but they could be overridden on the advice of the police. ""I can take my lead from the police, if they were to tell me there was an inability to respond and to police the protests, then there are powers that are available,"" she added. In an article for the Jewish News and the Jewish Chronicle published on Friday, Sir Keir said: ""Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy – and there is justified concern about the suffering in Gaza – but a minority have used these protests as a pretext for stoking antisemitic tropes. ""I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews this week. This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain."" Met Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said he did not have the powers to prevent protests or ask the home secretary to do so but questioned whether they should proceed. ""There's a risk the timing of that event sends a message which, whether inadvertently or deliberately, endorses antisemitism, which is a deep risk to community tension,"" he said. The Met has written to the protest group Defend Our Juries, raising concerns about the amount of police resources its planned protest would divert at a time when ""visible reassurance and protective security"" was needed for communities. But the group, which has led demonstrations against the ban on Palestine Action, said it planned to go ahead with the march. Dave Rich, director of policy at CST, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""For so many people who claim to care about human rights and care about freedoms, to be taking police resources away from protecting the rights and freedoms of Jewish people to live their lives and go to synagogue in safety, all to support a proscribed terrorist organisation, which is not the same thing as supporting the Palestinians. The two are not the same. ""And I think it's remarkably self absorbed and insensitive to say the least."" Defend Our Juries member, Sir Jonathon Porritt, told the BBC that he had ""no doubt"" that ""everyone taking part in the silent vigil today will demonstrate huge respect and real grief for those affected by the absolute atrocity at Heaton Park."" He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I do not think that means that we should be asked to give up on our right to stand up for those who are being devastated by an ongoing, real-time genocide in Gaza."" He added those taking part ""would have the deepest concern about growing levels of antisemitism"". The group has urged the Met to ""prioritise protecting the community, rather than arresting those peacefully holding signs"" in support of Palestine Action. The government proscribed Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation in July. At various protests since then, hundreds have been arrested for showing support for the group , which has won permission to challenge the ban. The Met will deploy 1,500 officers to arrest anyone breaking the law by overtly supporting the group. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson appealed for those intending to protest in the city this weekend to ""consider whether this is really the right time"". He said his force would not seek to stop peaceful gatherings, but said police would immediately act to curtail any acts of violence or intimidation. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Friends of Palestine, which is planning a demonstration in the city's Cathedral Gardens on Saturday, said: ""Because we recognise the sensitivity of the local situation, there will be a Jewish speaker who understands what both communities are going through."" The CST's Mr Rich also told the BBC that politicians and wider society have allowed antisemitism to flourish in the UK. ""There are a lot of people who could step up and do better,"" he said. He added: ""If people knew how much, how many people went online every single day to talk about killing Jews, they'd be absolutely horrified."" ""More broadly, across civil society and across parts of industry, there is an inability to recognise antisemitism or a reluctance to deal with incitement in ways that have just allowed it to grow."" A pro-Palestinian protest took place in Manchester on Thursday night. Demonstrators in London protesting against the Israeli navy halting a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza clashed with police too. The Metropolitan Police said 40 people had been arrested. Six of those detained were arrested for assaults on police officers. Home secretary calls pro-Palestine protests after Manchester attack ‘un-British’ Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told the BBC on Saturday: ""I don't think these protests should go ahead at all. I think it's extremely insensitive to the Jewish community."" He added: ""We cannot allow this atmosphere to develop where a particular community, in this case the Jewish community, are intimidated."" Green Party leader Zack Polanski said on Friday ""non-violent protest has a really important part to play in our democracy"". ""I think it's important in democracy we find space and we find nuance that people can both grieve and people can protest for the people that they are grieving and all of these things can be true at the same time,"" he told the BBC. The UK's chief rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said on Friday that many members of the Jewish community wondered why marches in support of Palestine Action had been allowed to take place. ""Some of them contain outright antisemitism, outright support for Hamas. Not every single person, however there is so much of this, which certainly is dangerous to many within our society,"" Sir Ephraim told Radio 4's Today programme. ""You cannot separate the words on our streets, the actions of people in this way, and what inevitably results, which was yesterday's terrorist attack.""

c2f5d01e6446,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader",,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader Kate Whannel Political reporter Green Party leader of England and Wales Zack Polanski:  'We will make sure that the very wealthiest pay more tax' Newly-elected Green Party leader Zack Polanski has told his party's conference a tax on the wealthiest would end ""rip-off Britain"" and make the country ""an affordable"" place to live. Addressing members in Bournemouth, he said taxing the assets of the richest 1% would enable the government to fund universal free childcare, special needs education and rural bus routes. He also defended migrants and refugees to loud applause from the audience and accused Labour of being ""handmaidens"" of Reform UK adding: ""When Farage says jump, Labour asks 'how high'."" Polanski has described himself as an ""eco-populist"" and is seeking to shift the party to the left to take on Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party. The prime minister has sought to tighten immigration controls in recent months, in what is being seen by critics as a response to Reform leading national opinion polls. But Sir Keir launched an attack on Reform leader Nigel Farage in his Labour conference speech this week, accusing him of sowing division and not believing in Britain - something denied by Farage. Polanski described Farage as a ""Trump-loving corporate stooge"" and accused Sir Keir of jumping to his tune. Unusually for a speech by a Green Party leader, Polanski did not focus primarily on the environment. He told the conference: ""You can not be an effective environmentalist without talking about the deep inequality in our society."" Much of his speech centred on the problems posed by the cost of living, pointing to a rise in homelessness, tenants worried about their rent and families struggling to pay bills. Polanski argued that the country's problems were ""rooted in an economic model built on austerity and privatisation"" but that the Green Party would ""break the shackles of poverty and hardship that lock so many in"". ""This is a country with so much going for it, but we have been failed time and time again by a political class poisoned by extreme wealth and you can see that poison everyday."" ""A country where a tiny few have taken our power and wealth. Things must change. It's time to take it back."" He said some voters might worry that they could be hit by taxes on the wealthiest being proposed by his party. ""Hairdressers and plumbers say understandably 'I've worked hard all my life. Why are you taxing me? Why are you taxing my ambition?'"" However, Polanski said he was targeting people who ""will make more money in one night than everyone in this room could probably earn in an entire year"". In a 20 minute speech, Polanski told the conference his party's ""horizons"" would not be ""narrow"" and that he would ""not be silent"" on ""the mass slaughter in Palestine"". ""We must stop selling arms to Israel, we must stop sharing intelligence,"" he said. He also criticised what he called a ""draconian crackdown on the right to protest"". ""From terrorist proscription against protesters, to banning journalists from their conference, to diving into a rushed evidence-free plan for digital IDs that are likely to discriminate against minorities - the alarm bells of authoritarianism are now ringing."" In his defence of refugees and migrants, Polanski said it was the ""economic system"" that was a ""threat to the places we love... not people arriving small boats"". To loud cheers from party members he declared : ""We'll say it loud, we'll say it clear migrants and refugees are welcome here."" He said the Greens wanted to stop small boats crossing the Channel through ""safe and legal routes"". He also blamed ""a politics that tries to divide us and points the finger at each other, instead of at billionaires"". In a contrast with comments from Sir Keir earlier this year, who said the UK risked becoming an ""island of strangers"", Polanski said: ""This is a nation of neighbours."" He said defending migration was important to him because of his own ""confused and muddled"" Jewish ancestry, which saw his family flee from Latvia to Ukraine to Poland and eventually to England. Taking a moment to mark Thursday's attack on a synagogue in Manchester, where Polanski grew up, he said ""my heart is with the community."" In the past year the Green Party has built on its success at the 2024 general election - when it won four MPs - by winning 74 seats in the local council elections. Last month, Polanski was overwhelmingly backed by members in a leadership contest against the less combative duo of Green MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. Since the election the party says its membership has risen by 20% to an all-time high of 80,000. Polanski, who is a member of the London Assembly but does not have a seat in Parliament, has expressed interest in working with the new party being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Speaking after the leadership election, he said it was ""too soon to talk about joining electoral coalitions"", but he was interested in working with ""anyone who wants to challenge a failing Labour government and take on fascism and the far right"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y9nq174o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ae45/live/a0ba2130-a061-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-03T15:51:35.614000+00:00,134dcec18ec417562e56e66eb70cb815d00c1415
06292036e75e,Green deputy leader defends comments on Leeds rabbi,,"Green Party deputy leader Mothin Ali has defended his criticism of a Leeds-based Rabbi and Israeli Defence Force (IDF) reservist. Rabbi Zecharia Deutsch had accused Ali of playing a key role in the wave of threats that drove him from his home. Green leader Zach Polanski has been under pressure to take action but is standing by his deputy. Speaking to the BBC, Ali called for Rabbi Deutsch and ""anyone who participates in a genocide"" to be investigated by the police. Ali described the death of two Jewish people in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday as ""an absolute tragedy"" and expressed solidarity with the Jewish community. In September, The Times newspaper reported that Rabbi Deutsch left his Leeds home under advice from West Yorkshire police following a deluge of threats linked to his work with the IDF. Speaking to the Times, Rabbi Deutsch blamed Ali, who is a member of Leeds City Council, for playing a key role in amplifying the attacks through his posts on social media. The Times reported that Rabbi Deutsch had been working as a student chaplain at Leeds University at the time of the 7 October attacks in 2023. An Israeli citizen, he was called up as a reservist for a tour of duty with the Israel Defence Forces. Rabbi Deutsch reportedly acted as a guard for food and ammunition convoys entering Gaza during his service. In one video on a now private social media account, Ali said: ""Leeds University should be protecting its students against this kind of animal. ""You should be protecting people. You should be protecting students from this kind of animal, because if he's willing to kill people over there, how do you know he's not going to kill your students over here?"" Ali has not disputed the content of the video when asked by the BBC. He said: ""I think anyone who participates in a genocide is a danger and should be investigated by the police. ""I don't believe that British people, people who enjoy the freedoms of this country, should be able to go into a foreign state and participate in genocide."" Separately, Ali apologised for the ""short sightedness"" of a post he made the day after the 7 October attacks, where he said ""indigenous people have the right to fight back"" and called for an end to ""white supremacist European settler colonialism"". Speaking to the BBC, Ali argued he had not been referencing the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians - killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. He reiterated that the post referred to principles ""enshrined in international law"" and was not directly linked to the events of that day. Defending his position, Ali said he had been elected as deputy leader by more than 5,000 Green Party members who ""put their trust in me because they recognise that I work for our community as a whole"". ""Politicians have a responsibility in how they communicate, but also the media have a responsibility in how they communicate,"" he added. ""We shouldn't conflate what's happening in Israel to British Jews her - I think that is irresponsible. ""We need to express our solidarity with British Jews in this country, we need to express our solidarity with all marginalised communities in this country."" Ali became a councillor for Gipton and Harehills ward in May 2024 and immediately hit the headlines for his victory speech, labelling his election a ""win for the people of Gaza"" before shouting ""Allahu Akbar"", meaning ""God is the greatest"" in Arabic. He later apologised for ""any upset"" caused. Green Party leader Zack Polanski stood by Ali in an interview on the morning of the party's annual conference, saying his views needed to seen in context that ""this Rabbi went off to fight for the IDF, he was actively recruiting for people to engage in a genocide"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4s Today programme Polanski said Ali was right to apologise, but he would ""defend his right to be annoyed and upset by what is happening in Palestine"". ""We need to have a nuanced conversation about what is a genocide and talk about what is actually happening as opposed to the words that people use.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33ryml4y5ko,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0998/live/92c14460-a051-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-03T15:43:16.628000+00:00,f3ca54bc97dab002e9dfe73b4e1baf059529c335
f847db0a6371,"Reform Send system now or face billions in extra costs, ministers warned",,"Reform Send system now or face billions in extra costs, ministers warned Kate McGough Education reporter BBC Supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England will cost the government an extra £3bn a year by 2029 if the system is not reformed, a think tank has warned. The government is already spending £12bn this year on supporting those with Send, a figure that has risen by 66% in the last decade. Under current projections, there will also be an extra 220,000 children and young people with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) by 2029, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says. A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) says the IFS report is ""further evidence of the broken Send system this government inherited"". A rise in the number children receiving Send support in schools has driven what the IFS calls a ""dramatic and ongoing"" increase in spending. ""The truly shocking thing is that despite this increase in spending, we are still left with a system that is failing to cope with the needs of these children and young people,"" Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said. One in five pupils (1.7 million) in England get some kind of support for special educational needs in school at the moment. And 482,000 of them (or 5.3% of all pupils) get the higher level of support from individual EHCPs, a legal document setting out a child's tailored support needs, which councils have to provide and pay for. The rising costs of Send support have forced local authorities into hundreds of millions of pounds of debt . A government agreement meant councils have been able to keep Send deficits off their financial books, and now there are calls for the total debt - which is forecast to reach £5bn next year - to be wiped completely. Amanda Hopgood, of the Local Government Association, says that would ""put councils on a stable financial footing"", as well as addressing ""outdated legislation that leaves councils facing rising and unsustainable costs"". Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' spokesperson on education, says councils have been ""pushed to the brink"", adding that ""vulnerable young people are being set up to fail"". The IFS is predicting that the proportion of pupils with EHCPs will rise even further in the next four years, to 8% of all pupils aged four to 16. In July, the government refused to rule out scrapping EHCPs as part of their upcoming reforms. Education minister Georgia Gould has since said ""there will always be a legal right to additional support"", adding that children, families and teachers will be ""at the forefront"" of Send reforms. Currently, the first £6,000 of Send support comes from school budgets - but costs above that in mainstream schools, and the full costs of support in special schools, are covered by councils. Educating children in special schools is significantly more expensive than in mainstream settings. The average cost of funding one place at a state special school is £23,900 per year, or £61,500 per year for an independent special school. The government wants more early intervention and more Send pupils to stay in mainstream education . Angela Mawer, grandmother and legal guardian to seven-year-old Colby, says she felt like she had ""won the lottery"" by finding him a place in mainstream education which could cater to his needs. ""It's really sad that I should have to feel like that,"" she said. ""There isn't enough provision for children like Colby."" Family handout Angela is now looking for a suitable place in a specialist school for her grandson Colby Colby has spent three years at Littlecoates Primary Academy in Grimsby, in a council-funded and specially-resourced part of the school called Launchpad, which provides dedicated areas for Send support within mainstream schools in the area. Colby will soon need to move on to a more specialised setting to continue his education, but Angela says he has ""come on leaps and bounds"" during his time there. There are 12 spaces at the Littlecoates Primary Launchpad site for Send pupils in reception up to Year 2. Most are offered a place by the council after struggling in mainstream schools, or not being able to find a school place that will meet their needs. The aim is to help children adjust to mainstream classes with short-term support from specialist staff. It's been running for three years, with 100 more places planned for schools across North East Lincolnshire. Seven-year-old Finley has managed to successfully integrate into a Year 2 class with the support of Launchpad. Simply joining in with his classmates' phonics practice was something his mum Claire says she ""didn't dare to dream could happen"". ""Getting to the point where Finley has made all this progress, I could burst with pride,"" she says. Family handout Claire says most mainstream school staff do not have the training to deal with the needs of children like her son Finley But Claire says most mainstream schools have got a long way to go before they can properly support Send pupils. ""The government needs to put a lot of work into ensuring mainstream settings can meet children's needs,"" she says. ""I don't feel like mainstream staff have got the right training to be able to deal with some of the special needs of the children."" Kate Cowdroy, who runs Launchpad, says children can make ""phenomenal progress"" with the right support, even if some have to go on to a specialist setting. ""The reality is a lot of schools haven't got funding like this available to them,"" she says. ""Some of the children they're putting in mainstream classrooms, they're setting them up to fail on a daily basis."" The DfE says ministers have ""not hesitated to take action"" to make changes to the Send system, adding that they ""will continue engaging closely with children, parents and experts as we develop plans to ensure all children get the outcomes and life chances they deserve"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjv2rk9yjvo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ba9d/live/3620ae20-9f8a-11f0-a934-075243299099.jpg,2025-10-03T08:16:55.044000+00:00,1c39ad748e65a2bab37eb9bc3e6b5546c64cc62a

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Mone should be stripped of her peerage after a firm linked to her, PPE Medpro, was ordered to repay £122m for breaching a Covid contract. In a letter to Badenoch, the Scottish entrepreneur said she would not return to the Tories ""assuming there still is a Conservative Party before the next election"". Mone was made a peer by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015, but took a leave of absence and lost the Tory whip following the PPE revelations. The Conservatives said in December 2023 that she was no longer a member of the party. However, this was later disputed by Mone. The party said she was ""formally written to"" on Thursday and told that she would not be accepted back as a Tory if she ever returned to the Lords. Getty Images Kemi Badenoch said the PPE Medpro case was enough to strip Mone of her peerage In her letter to Badenoch, Mone said there ""seems to be a bit of amnesia"" about her loss of the whip, suggesting that she removed it herself when she chose to go on leave. Mone continued: ""You will be pleased to hear that once I do clear my name, I have no wish to return to the Lords as a Conservative peer. ""That's assuming there still is a Conservative Party before the next general election."" Badenoch was among several politicians, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who called for Mone to relinquish her peerage after the High Court judgment. Getty Images Mone and Doug Barrowman have been married since 2020 On Thursday, Badenoch told BBC News that what she had heard from the case against PPE Medpro was ""enough"" for her to be stripped of her title . She added: ""I want to make sure that people can see that the Conservative Party is a party of integrity. ""That's why we removed Michelle Mone. ""And it's very, very important that people see that politicians, whether they're in the Commons or in the Lords, are acting above board."" A party spokesman added: ""Under Kemi Badenoch's leadership, the Conservative Party expects parliamentarians to maintain the highest standards, and on this Baroness Mone has fallen well short."" Can a peerage be removed? Peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. The SNP have called for the UK government to take that step . PPE Medpro, which was set up by a consortium led by Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman, was awarded lucrative contracts to supply 25 million medical gowns to the NHS during the pandemic. However, the equipment has been in storage since 2020 after the company failed to prove it was correctly sterilised. Mone described the court ruling as ""nothing less than an establishment win for the government in a case that was too big to lose"".

bd4f93cb6325,Green leader Zack Polanski backs legalisation of all drugs,,"Green leader Zack Polanski backs legalisation of all drugs Charlotte Wright Political Editor, South East PA Media Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke to Charlotte Wright ahead of the party's annual conference in Bournemouth The leader of the Green Party says he wants to legalise all drugs, calling for an approach ""led by public health experts, not politicians"". Speaking to BBC South East ahead of his party conference, Zack Polanski said he agreed with a Kent Green councillor, who earlier this year called for the legalisation of all drugs, including class A drugs like heroin and crack cocaine. Polanski said ""the war on drugs has absolutely failed, and ultimately we need to be having a public health approach"". When asked about implications of this for the taxpayer, he replied, ""Well, I think voters are having to pay right now for a crime that happens, for the fact that people are in the illegal drug markets, for gangs that we see across county lines. ""All of this is a failure of the fact that, again, for far too long, Prime Ministers have stuck their heads in their sand and said, if we just make drugs illegal, everything's going to be okay."" The Green Party of England and Wales is gathering in Bournemouth for their first autumn conference under a new leadership team which also consists of deputy co-leaders Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward, the current deputy leader of Wealden District Council. The party has seen growing success in local council elections in parts of Kent Sussex and Surrey in recent years, including in previously Conservative-voting areas like Wealden, Reigate and Maidstone. Modelling himself as an ""eco-populist"" during the recent leadership election, Polanski was seen to have a more radical, left-wing approach. It was argued by his opponents that this might alienate the more moderate, former Conservative party voters who had turned to the party over issues like protecting green spaces from housebuilding. The leader rejected this idea when speaking to BBC South East. He said: ""I think the radical thing for people in the South East is the fact that their wages have not gone up, but their bills have gone up, the fact that they can't get an NHS dentist appointment. ""The fact that it feels like there's no real future or opportunities for young people. ""So I don't actually think what I'm offering is radical. What I'm offering, I think can appeal to almost everybody."" Polanski remains clear that his party wants to ""tax multi-millionaires and billionaires"" in order to create a fairer society. ""This is about redistributing the excess wealth that is happening right across the South East and England and Wales, and saying, let's put that money back into our communities,"" he said. The leader discussed a myriad of other issues, including defence and the party's general election prospects. When asked whether the former Conservative voters now with the Green Party would support his ambition for the UK to leave NATO, Polanski stressed that the UK needs ""a different approach to defence"". He said: ""What I'm talking about there is recognising we can't be in hock to Donald Trump. ""What I want to do is have a conversation about what an alternative alliance looks like with our European neighbours."" This would not ""necessarily"" mean spending more on defence, Mr Polanski added. Turning attention to the next general election, the Green leader has previously said he thinks his party can win 30-40 seats. When it come to the South East he says other seats in Brighton will be ""first on the list"", with the party hopeful of adding to the Brighton Pavilion it has held since 2010. Polanski said: ""I think the fact that Sian Berry has such an incredible success, in Brighton Pavilion shows that a lot of the seats around there suddenly get into play. ""That doesn't rule out other seats too.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e20rzje2o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3ff8/live/d714a830-9fa9-11f0-bcf9-91615bda46dc.jpg,2025-10-03T09:32:09.534000+00:00,e9b0c03c2d2840fbb81c9c79c733a4d35f0dcc78
66f0921e99f3,Tories pledge to scrap landmark climate legislation,,"The Conservatives have pledged to scrap the UK's landmark climate change legislation and replace it with a strategy for ""cheap and reliable"" energy. The Climate Change Act 2008, which put targets for cutting emissions into law, was introduced by the last Labour government and strengthened under Tory PM Theresa May. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said her party wanted to leave ""a cleaner environment for our children"" but argued ""Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions"". Environmental groups said the move would be an act of ""national self-harm"", while Labour said it would be ""an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations"". Conservative ex-prime minister Baroness Theresa May criticised the decision as a ""retrograde step which upends 17 years of consensus between our main political parties and the scientific community"". ""To row back now would be a catastrophic mistake for while that consensus is being tested, the science remains the same,"" Baroness May added. The 2008 law, which was passed when current Energy Secretary Ed Miliband was in the same role in Gordon Brown's government, committed the UK to cutting carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. In 2019, under May's premiership, this legally binding target was updated to reaching net zero by 2050 - meaning the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces. The legislation also established the Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on meeting the target and reports on progress towards reducing emissions. At the time, the law passed through Parliament with the support of all major parties. However, the political consensus on net zero has since fragmented. Badenoch has previously said the target of net zero by 2050 is ""impossible"" for the UK to meet and promised to ""maximise"" extraction of oil and gas from the North Sea . Reform UK has also said it would scrap net zero targets if it wins the next election , blaming the policy for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK. The UK was the first country to establish a long-term legally binding framework to cut carbon emissions, and since the act was passed many other countries have introduced similar legislation. However, the Tories said the act forced ministers ""to make decisions to meet arbitrary climate targets, even if they make the British people poorer, destroy jobs, and make our economy weaker"". The party argues that the 2008 law has ""forced successive governments to introduce punitive measures that have hit family finances"". As an example, it pointed to fines for boiler manufacturers who do not hit heat pump sales targets, which critics have branded a ""boiler tax"". The scheme, announced but then delayed by the previous Conservative government, came into force under Labour in April. The UK has high electricity costs, ranking the fourth highest for domestic consumers of medium usage when compared to other EU countries, and the highest for industrial usage. Labour says its plan to boost clean energy in Britain will reduce household energy bills by ""up to £300"" by 2030. However, earlier this year energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family. Badenoch said: ""We want to leave a cleaner environment for our children, but not by bankrupting the country. ""Climate change is real. But Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions. Previous Conservative governments tried to make Labour's climate laws work - they don't. ""Under my leadership we will scrap those failed targets. Our priority now is growth, cheaper energy, and protecting the natural landscapes we all love."" However, Miliband said: ""This desperate policy from Kemi Badenoch if ever implemented would be an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations. ""The Conservatives would now scrap a framework that businesses campaigned for in the first place and has ensured tens of billions of pounds of investment in homegrown British energy since it was passed by a Labour government with Conservative support 17 years ago."" Former Conservative minister Lord Alok Sharma, who was president of the Cop 26 UN climate summit in 2021, said the last Conservative government had a legacy of ""global leadership"" on tackling climate change and urged Badenoch not to ""squander this for the sake of short-term political expediency"". The Liberal Democrats also criticised the announcement. The party's energy security and net zero spokesperson Pippa Heylings said: ""The reality is that investing in renewables is the greatest economic growth opportunity in this century and will protect the planet for future generations."" Meanwhile, Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link coalition of environmental groups, said: ""The real route to lasting security is in homegrown clean power, not burning more fossil fuels. ""Without binding climate law, ministers will be free to trade away our future - and it is nature and the poorest communities that will pay the price.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrp2k3m3deo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/752b/live/bb9f6640-9ef4-11f0-b1c8-5d59c9f3a032.jpg,2025-10-02T16:21:23.593000+00:00,3b38645165d96877bb8286fa27d0f09d9add6367

The posts implied Reform's Caerphilly candidate, Llŷr Powell, had links to Vladimir Putin - an accusation the party firmly denies. They also referred to bribes taken by a former Reform leader . Newyddion S4C has been told the letter was sent under the Defamation Act 2013 and the Representation of the People Act 1983. The Defamation Act protects individuals from false statements that damage their reputation, while the Representation of the People Act sets strict rules on false claims during election campaigns.

In an interview with BBC News NI, she said: ""The last time I checked, Northern Ireland did vote to leave."" Northern Ireland voted by 56% to 44% in favour of staying in the EU in the 2016 referendum, which saw the UK overall vote to leave by a majority of 52% to 48%.

'The best of both worlds' Badenoch was speaking ahead of her party's annual conference this weekend. She has been the Tory leader for almost 12 months after her party lost the 2024 general election to Labour. Asked how her party was good for the union, after it had delivered the controversial post-Brexit Irish Sea border, which left Northern Ireland under different trading arrangements than Great Britain, Badenoch replied: ""Last time I checked Northern Ireland voted to leave (the EU)."" When told that Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, she replied: ""I do recognise the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain and we came up with a settlement - it wasn't perfect, but it tried to make sure we had a way of Northern Ireland getting the best of both worlds."" 'Under new leadership' Badenoch also said she was ""deeply concerned"" by Labour's efforts to repeal and replace the last Conservative government's Troubles Legacy Act , legislation that was widely criticised in Northern Ireland. She defended her party's stance, adding: ""We went through a lot of pain to get to the point where we could deliver it. ""When you speak to veterans a lot of people were affected, I think they're worried that again and again, decisions are being made by politicians but they are the ones being held accountable for them."" The Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act was passed by the Conservatives and had been criticised for including a conditional amnesty. It was strongly opposed by many victims groups and all political parties in Northern Ireland.

Two members of the Jewish community were killed and four were left in a serious condition in the attack during worship to mark Yom Kippur at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in the north of the city. Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson confirmed worshippers and security staff helped stop the attacker getting inside before he was shot dead by officers. Sir Keir said there was no doubt emergency services and the synagogue's security guards ""prevented an even greater tragedy"". PA Media A man drove a car into pedestrians and stabbed a security guard in the attack The attacker was wearing a suspected explosive device, which GMP have said was not viable, when he drove a car at crowds before stabbing a number of people. A witness at the scene said prayers had started when the attack happened but Rabbi Daniel Walker, who was leading the service, remained calm and he and others led the congregation to safety. He added: ""They are true heroes."" Sir Stephen said there were many worshippers inside the synagogue at the time of the incident. He praised security staff and worshippers who shut the attacker out, saying that thanks to the ""immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside, as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access"".

A major incident was declared at about 09.37 BST after police received a call from a man who said he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and a male security guard had been stabbed. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man described as being of Syrian descent, was shot dead outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, at about 09:40 BST. It is understood that he entered the UK as a very young child, and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor. GMP said three people had been arrested - two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s - as part of the investigation into what has been declared a ""terrorist incident"" by police. Rob Kanter, a university teacher who was inside the synagogue, said worshippers continued their service after being evacuated. He said the congregation were moved by police first into the rear hall of the building, then to a nearby centre, adding he did not fear for his safety. He said ""everyone was calm and dignified"" and people ""used an element of humour"" to keep going. Footage circulating online appeared to show the moment police opened fire The attacker was shot dead within seven minutes of the initial call to police.

The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Gareth said - describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to see. Another witness, Chava Lewin, who lives near the synagogue, said when the suspect got out of the car he ""started stabbing anyone near him"" after the vehicle crashed into the synagogue gates. After the attack, police said a loud explosion could be heard as ""specialist resources gained entry to the suspect's vehicle as a precaution"". PA Media Bomb disposal experts have been sent to the synagogue In his statement, Starmer said: ""Britain is also a country where Jewish buildings, synagogues, even schools require round the clock protection, where dedicated specialist security is necessary because of the daily threat of antisemitic hatred. ""Today's horrific incident shows why. And while this is not a new hate, this is something Jews have always lived with, we must be clear, it is a hatred that is rising once again, and Britain must defeat it once again. The prime minister said: ""To every Jewish person in this country, I also want to say this. I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do. ""And so on behalf of our country, I express my solidarity, but also my sadness that you still have to live with these fears. Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. ""And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community."" Counter-terrorism policing Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said police forces across the UK were stepping up patrols at synagogues and Jewish sites to provide reassurance ""to all those communities that have been affected by this incident"". Forces were deploying ""all of our capabilities in response to what has happened"" and were working closely with security services to ensure we have a ""full intelligence picture"", he added. A major incident was declared at about 09:37 BST in the suburb in the north of Manchester The attack was carried out on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, when work is forbidden and worshippers gather to pray. It is also a day when many who do not regularly attend synagogue services do so, and as a result security is often increased. Some Jewish people do not access social media or television during this holy day, meaning many may not yet have heard about the attack. Burnham confirmed that volunteers from the Community Security Trust, a charity that monitors antisemitism in the UK, were at the scene during the attack. The CST said it is working closely with police in Manchester to ensure security at synagogues is ""as strong as it can be"". The trust paid tribute to the security guards at the synagogue and the police officers who responded. CST urged everyone attending synagogues or any other Jewish premises to follow all instructions from security guards and police officers. ""In particular, we urge people not to congregate outside communal premises and synagogues to keep their doors closed at all times"", they said. ""This kind of attack is the reason why we have such extensive security in place across the Jewish community."" Reuters Jewish communities have been urged to be vigilant after the attack In response to the attack, the Manchester Council of Mosques said it was ""shocked and saddened"", adding ""our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the Jewish community at this distressing time"". In a statement, it said: ""Manchester has always been a city where people of all faiths and backgrounds live side by side. ""Any attempt to divide us through violence or hatred will fail - we remain united in our commitment to peace and mutual respect."" The council has urged people to remain calm and called on the city to ""stand together as one Manchester, united against hatred"". Burnham has said he plans to reassure Jewish communities who have been living in a ""higher state of anxiety"" after rising incidents of antisemitism.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg3499p18po,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/66f2/live/69548920-a024-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-03T00:14:58.346000+00:00,e2726f27093d18f8fc6404f47c54d9d46d09ce30
9668a88949ac,Refugees to face longer route to UK settlement rights,,"Refugees to face longer route to UK settlement rights Damian Grammaticas political correspondent and Kate Whannel political reporter Reuters Refugees will have to wait longer than the current five years before they can apply to settle permanently in the UK, under changes the government has said it is planning to the asylum system. It has also confirmed that the route enabling refugees to automatically bring close relatives to the UK - which was temporarily suspended in September - will be permanently scrapped. Sir Keir Starmer said the changes will mean ""there will be no golden ticket to settling in the UK, people will have to earn it."" It comes as the prime minister meets leaders at the European Political Community summit in Copenhagen, where he will be discussing ways to tackle illegal migration. Ahead of that meeting, the prime minister said ""fundamental changes"" were being made to the asylum system to show that ""settlement must be earned by contributing to the country"". The changes are similar to those already being planned for people arriving in the UK for other reasons, such as on a work visa, many of whom will have to wait 10 years to settle. Earlier this week, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood set out her plans to make it similarly harder for other categories of migrant to qualify for indefinite leave to remain. Under the proposals, those wishing to apply will have to learn English to a high standard, have a clean criminal record, and volunteer in their community to be granted permanent settlement status. Details of the new conditions refugees will have to meet in order to settle in the UK and be accompanied by family members will be set out later in the autumn. A government source said the UK had been ""overly generous"" towards asylum seekers and wanted to show ""we get it, we will reduce the pull factors."" But shadow home secretary Chris Philp called the planned changes a ""Starmer gimmick"" that ""will make no difference whatsoever"". The Refugee Council, a charity, said the government's approach would not deter people trying to get to the UK but would instead push ""more desperate people into the arms of smugglers in an effort to reunite with loved ones"". The government has been trying to reduce the numbers of people arriving in the UK on small boats crossing the Channel. On coming to power in July 2024, Labour promised to ""stop the chaos"" of the ""small boat crisis"" but numbers remain at high levels. Currently refugees can apply to settle in the UK - also called indefinite leave to remain - after five years, giving them the right to live, work and study in the country for as long as they want provided they meet certain conditions . Under the forthcoming rules, the government says refugees will be offered a ""package of core protection"" but will face ""a new, longer route to settlement requiring them to contribute, replacing the current five years"". Reform UK has announced it would replace indefinite leave to remain with visas requiring migrants, excluding EU citizens whose rights are protected under Brexit treaties, to reapply every five years. The Migration Observatory estimates there are about 4.5 million people who hold indefinite leave to remain, including roughly 430,000 non-EU citizens. The expected changes to settlement rules for refugees will be accompanied by alterations to family reunion conditions. 'Fair but firm' Migration Minister Mike Tapp said the changes would stop migrants being able to ""shop around for asylum"". Tapp told BBC Breakfast that asylum seekers had been ""looking for the most generous, almost soft touch"" system. ""We're saying we're not a soft touch - we're fair but we're firm,"" he added. Asylum applications would still be decided on a ""case by case"" basis, but scrapping the automatic rights to family reunion and settlement would bring the UK ""into line"" with the rest of Europe, Tapp argued. Tapp also said the number of people returned to France under the ""one in, one out"" deal secured in July has risen to seven. A family of three were the first to arrive in the UK under the scheme last week. Under the treaty, France agreed to take back migrants who had travelled to the UK by small boat and had their asylum claim withdrawn or declared inadmissible. For each person returned to France, the UK will accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel. Figures from the Home Office show 1,899 migrants crossed the Channel since Saturday, pushing the total number of recorded crossings since 2025 past 34,000. During Thursday's summit in Copenhagen, Sir Keir will meet Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen. The two leaders are expected to announce £3m to encourage people from Western Balkan countries to stay in the region rather than migrate. The UK government is also contributing up to £5.75m - up from £4m this time last year - to Italy's Rome Process, a scheme aimed at reducing the number of migrants crossing from Africa to Europe. The government has said the prime minister will also discuss ""how to go further"" on changing the European Convention on Human Rights. On Wednesday, Sir Keir told the BBC he did not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws but was ready to look again at article three of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture and degrading treatment. Sir Keir's comments come after a Labour Party conference dominated by efforts to confront Reform UK, which has been leading opinion polls in recent months.

dc08030bb0ee,Starmer vows to protect Jewish communities after Manchester attack,,"Starmer vows to protect Jewish communities after Manchester attack Watch: Britain must defeat 'rising hatred' PM says Sir Keir Starmer has promised to do ""everything"" in his power to protect Jewish people as he said Britain must defeat antisemitic hate. The prime minister was speaking after two people were killed in a car and stabbing attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, on Thursday. Condemning the ""vile individual"" who carried out the ""horrific"" attack, on the holiest Jewish day of Yom Kippur, Sir Keir offered his condolences to the victims and their families and thanked the first responders. Greater Manchester Police said four other people remain in hospital. The attacker, who has been named as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police at the scene. Police say three suspects are currently in custody and have been arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s. In a recorded message to Jewish people, Sir Keir said: ""I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do... Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. ""And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community. ""I promise you that over the coming days, you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love."" He added that hatred against Jews ""is rising once again, and Britain must defeat it once again"", as he reflected on the history of Jews seeking refuge in the UK. Getty Images Members of the public and congregants were solemn outside the Heaton Park Synagogue on Thursday afternoon The prime minister flew back to the UK early from the European Political Community summit in Denmark on Thursday to chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee and respond to the attack. Many national figures and community leaders have issued statements as the gravity of what happened becomes clear . King Charles III said in a statement that he and Queen Camilla were ""deeply shocked and saddened"" to hear about the attack, ""especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community"". ""Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services,"" the statement added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the ""barbaric terror attack"". ""Our hearts are with the families of the murdered, and we pray for the swift recovery of the wounded. ""As I warned at the UN: weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism. Only strength and unity can defeat it."" Israel's foreign minister accused the UK government of failing to curb ""rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement in Britain"". Gideon Sa'ar said Israel expects ""more than words from the Starmer government"" and demanded a ""change of course"" on tackling anti-Jewish hatred. The Israeli embassy in the UK said it was ""in close contact"" with the Manchester Jewish community, the authorities and Jewish charity the Community Security Trust (CST) to ""ensure that the necessary support is provided"". Thanking the police and synagogue security for their response, the CST said it was an ""appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year"" and it was working with the police and local Jewish community. President of the Conference of European Rabbis, Pinchas Goldschmidt, called for more to be done to ""stamp out murderous ideologies"" following the attack. ""Jews in Manchester, England, woke up this morning to pray, and were murdered in their own synagogue,"" he said in a statement to PA. Yom Kippur is a day of fasting and atonement and is believed to be the day God seals the fate of each person for the coming years. It is a day set aside for prayer and reflection, when work is forbidden and many attend synagogue services even if they do not do so regularly. The Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the incident was ""the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come"". He said the attack was the ""tragic result"" of an ""unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, campuses, on social media and elsewhere"". ""Our hearts are shattered,"" he said in a statement shared with the BBC. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said: ""We are devastated at the loss of two members of our Jewish community, and our thoughts are with their families, those who are injured and receiving treatment, and all those who have been affected by this act of antisemitic terror."" It was a sentiment echoed by Imam Qari Asim, co-chairman of the British Muslim Network, who said the scenes in Manchester had ""no place in our society"" and ""antisemitism in all its forms is totally unacceptable"". ""The bloodshed and violence in the Middle East - which is excruciatingly painful to witness for all of us - must not be allowed to poison our streets in Britain,"" he said. And Allama Qamaruzzaman AzmI, chief imam of Anwaar ul Haramain Jamé Masjid in north Manchester, said ""we stand in solidarity with our Jewish neighbours and community"" and he was ""committed"" to strengthening the bond between them. Reuters People had gathered at the scene Meanwhile, the Church of England's leader, Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, said he was praying that ""all may live alongside each other in harmony and respect"". The Bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev Dr David Walker, said he feared an increase in divisive rhetoric recently in the UK and elsewhere in the world which should not be allowed ""to get ahead of our humanity"". He said ""short-term political gain is no excuse for long-term damage to the fabric of our communities"". 'It was a matter of when, not if' Figures from across the political spectrum have condemned the attack. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said on X: ""We condemn whoever is responsible and will do everything within our power to keep people safe. We stand with GM's Jewish community at this time and will work through the day to support them."" Alex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, told BBC News: ""Many Jews understood it was never 'if' an attack like this was going to happen, it was 'when', because attacks against Jews have spiralled out of control and some mass attacks have already been foiled by the security services."" But he said there was ""a lot of anger"" about what he said was ""very little action"" over anti-Jewish hate being allowed to ""flourish"" and ""take root in institutions"". He said synagogues and Jewish schools, including primary schools, have needed security ""for a long time"". Asked about the synagogue attack in Manchester, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC it looks like ""an outrageous attack on the Jewish community on their holiest day"" - calling it ""vile and disgusting"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was ""horrified and appalled"" and that his ""thoughts are with the victims"". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said he was ""horrified"" and thinking of the Jewish community ""who will be suffering at this time"".

Serving Met Officers called for immigrants to be shot, revelled in the use of force and were dismissive of rape claims in footage captured by a Panorama undercover reporter. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood described the footage, which also shows officers making sexualised comments to colleagues and sharing racist views about immigrants and Muslims, as ""disturbing"" and ""sickening"". Sir Mark Rowley, head of the Met Police, has apologised for the ""reprehensible and completely unacceptable"" behaviour. In a letter addressed to the mayor and home secretary after the documentary aired, he listed a series of ""immediate actions"" the force had taken, including having dismantled the custody team at the Charing Cross police station, and senior leadership changes that cover west London. Sir Mark added that all those involved will be ""put on a fast-track hearing within weeks and [are] on a path to likely dismissal"". After the BBC sent a detailed list of allegations to the Met, it suspended eight officers and one staff member, and took two more officers off front-line duties. Mina Smallman, the mother of two murdered sisters, told the BBC's Newsnight she was not shocked by the allegations. Two Met Police officers were jailed this year after they shared photos of her daughters' bodies on WhatsApp. ""When people are comfortable and their guard is down, we get to see what they're really like,"" she said. Ms Smallman added that the Met was ""not going to change overnight"". She said ""this behaviour has been there for so long, it's going to take ages to root out"". Watch: 'When their guard is down we get to see what they're really like' - Mina Smallman Sir Sadiq said ""sexism, racism, misogyny and the excessive use of force"" had ""no place in the police"". ""I have met with the commissioner to discuss directly the issues exposed by the BBC - and its impact on public confidence and trust in the police,"" he said, before the BBC programme was broadcast. ""A series of urgent changes have been put in place at Charing Cross police station and across the Met, with more to follow."" The mayor backed Sir Mark, saying he had confidence in the commissioner's efforts to kick wrongdoers out of the Met. The home secretary welcomed the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) ""fully and urgently investigating all the issues raised in this report"". ""It is right that the Metropolitan Police have condemned this, and we fully support their pledge to root out those unfit to serve the public,"" Mahmood added. ""We have given police chiefs the powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks and dismiss those guilty of gross misconduct, and we expect them to be used."" Sir Mark, speaking before he had seen the film's Wednesday evening broadcast, said that ""where there is incontrovertible evidence"" of wrongdoing it is likely that accused serving officers would be dismissed within weeks. ""Officers behaving in such appalling, criminal ways, let down our communities and will cause some to question if their sons and daughters are safe in our cells, and whether they would be believed and respected as victims of crime,"" he said. ""For that, I am truly sorry."" Footage shows police disbelieving alleged rape and domestic violence victim The Liberal Democrats called the findings ""beyond appalling"". ""The public is being failed, as are the majority of police officers who are doing their best for the people of London,"" said the party's London spokesman, Luke Taylor MP. ""The Home Secretary now has a responsibility to intervene and work with the Met to tackle this behaviour once and for all."" Paula Dodds, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said it ""deplores any discriminatory behaviour in the strongest possible terms - such behaviour has no place in policing or society. ""If officers are proven to be guilty of criminal offences or serious gross misconduct, then we do not want these individuals in the job."" However, she said ""all police officers - like all people - have the right to representation and due process, and not trial by media or documentary"". Rachel Watson, who leads the IOPC, said she was ""appalled by what Panorama has exposed - these behaviours are completely unacceptable and have no place in policing"". She said an investigation was already under way and hoped the BBC would now share its evidence ""to allow our work to progress at pace"". Zoe Billingham, who served as Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary from 2009 to 2021, told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 that Sir Mark was a ""reforming"" figure, but that the revelations were ""tricky"" for him. ""I do think the pace of change really now needs to be demonstrated to Londoners if that precious bond of trust is to be restored,"" she said. A former detective superintendent at the Met, Shabnam Chaudhri, said she was ""shocked to the core"". ""Policing is in my blood,"" she told Newsnight.

It is a civilian role which involves working closely with sergeants and constables, but not taking part in arrests. The station had been the focus of an investigation by the IOPC police watchdog into bullying and discrimination nearly four years ago. It found that some officers had discussed hitting their girlfriends, shared offensive and discriminatory comments and joked about rape in private group chats.

d728f1a9bdb9,Two-child benefit cap has been devastating - Phillipson,,"Two-child benefit cap has been devastating - Phillipson Becky Morton Political reporter Bridget Phillipson: Why should children be punished for events out of their control? Bridget Phillipson has said the two-child benefit cap has had a ""devastating impact"", as she signalled the government could soon lift it. Asked whether this needed to happen now, the education secretary and deputy leadership candidate, told the BBC there was ""a real urgency"". The policy, introduced by the Conservatives, prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. The government is widely expected to change the two-child limit in November's Budget, with reports suggesting the Treasury is looking at different options to replace it, including a tapered system. Asked if the chancellor was about to the lift the cap, Phillipson told the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast: ""I'm leading the child poverty task force and I've been doing that work from government. ""But I'm clear about what needs to happen. I'm clear about what the evidence tells us. And I'm clear about what we need to do."" She added: ""There's a real urgency about this because every year that passes, as children are born, as they move into that system, the numbers go up, child poverty rates increase. So we have to tackle it."" The education secretary argued that children should not be ""punished"" for events beyond their control, for example if a parent loses their job and has to rely on benefits. ""This was a Tory policy that's had a devastating impact on children and we'll sort it,"" she said. Sir Keir Starmer has previously spoken of his desire to ditch the two-child cap when economic conditions allow, without specifying exact circumstances. According to the Guardian newspaper , officials are considering whether there could be a tapered rate, so parents receive the most benefits for their first child and less for subsequent children. Other options under consideration include limiting additional benefits to three or four children, the newspaper reported. Asked whether the cap needed to be scrapped completely or if it could instead be amended, Phillipson told the BBC: ""Through the work of the taskforce I see all the evidence, I look at the numbers, I look at the impact of different policies. ""This isn't the only way we'll take action, to be clear, because there are other steps we need to take, whether on skills, rights at work, much more besides, childcare. But I know what the evidence tells me."" The Resolution Foundation think tank says axing the cap would cost an estimated £3.5bn and would lift 470,000 children out of poverty. Campaigners have called for it to be abolished in full, arguing this would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty. 'In the room' Phillipson said tackling child poverty would be her ""number one priority"" if she was elected Labour's next deputy leader, to replace Angela Rayner after her resignation last month. ""It really is personal to me. I know what it's like to not grow up with very much,"" she said. Phillipson's rival in the contest, her former cabinet colleague Lucy Powell, has also criticised the cap and said scrapping it would be the ""single biggest policy we could do to address child poverty"". Powell was sacked from her role as Commons leader in a reshuffle last month. Phillipson rejected the idea that as a cabinet minister she would have less freedom to challenge the prime minister over government policy. ""What I'll bring as deputy leader is the ability to unite our party and our movement,"" she told the BBC. ""But alongside that I'll be a strong voice at the cabinet table for members. So I'll be in the room when those decisions are being made, able to push for the things that members want to see."" Highlighting her record as education secretary, Phillipson said she had fought ""tooth and nail"" for policies like the expansion of free school meals . She added that ""there's a limit to what you can do"" from outside cabinet and ""what I don't think members want is for us to be airing our dirty linen in public"". In her pitch to Labour members at a hustings on Wednesday, Powell said she would be a ""full-time deputy"" and ""a strong independent voice"". If elected, she pledged to have ""difficult conversations"" with the leadership, while refusing to ""snipe from the sidelines"". Although Phillipson gained more nominations to be deputy leader from her fellow MPs, published polling of party members has suggested Powell is the frontrunner in the contest. However, Phillipson's campaign have pointed to her greater number of nominations from the trade union movement. Voting in a ballot of Labour members and affiliated supporters is open from 8 October to 23 October, with the result of the contest announced on 25 October.

16761a2b2701,PM tells BBC he wants to change how international law used in asylum cases,,"PM tells BBC he wants to change how international law used in asylum cases Sam Francis Political reporter Watch: Starmer says he will ""look again"" at human rights laws Sir Keir Starmer wants to change how international law is interpreted, to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation on the grounds they could be sent to worse prisons or healthcare systems. The prime minister told the BBC he did not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but is ready to look again at article three of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture and degrading treatment. The prime minister said mass migration in recent years meant there needed to be a change, but those genuinely fleeing persecution should still be given asylum. His comments came after his home secretary set out plans to tighten rules for migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain . On the issue of deportation, he was asked by Radio 4's Today programme about the example of a Brazilian paedophile who successfully claimed he would be treated worse in a Brazilian prison than he would in a British prison. Sir Keir said there was a difference between deporting someone to ""summary execution"" and sending them to somewhere with a different level of healthcare or prison conditions. He added ""we need to look again at the interpretation"" of a wide range of international laws by UK courts. He warned that laws must be ""applied in the circumstances as they are now"" before adding that countries were experiencing ""mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years"". To meet this new challenge ""we need to look at again at the interpretation of some of these provisions, not tear them down"", he said. He added: ""I believe that those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum and that is a compassionate act."" Pressed for details about what was blocking deportations of foreign criminals, Sir Keir cited Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR - which ban torture and protect the right to private and family life respectively. ""But it's more than that,"" he said, pointing to the UN's Refugee Convention, Torture Convention and Convention on the Rights of the Child as potential barriers. Leading human rights lawyer Shami Chakrabarti said the number of cases where the courts have ruled someone cannot be removed because of inhuman and degrading treatment, were ""very very rare"". ""To say that it's inhuman and degrading because the situation is worse back home than it is in the UK has never been the test that has been employed by the UK courts,"" she said. Ministers were already exploring ways to tighten the interpretation of some aspects of the ECHR to crack down on immigration. In May, the government's immigration white paper promised legislation to ""clarify"" how the right to a family life in European human rights law should apply to immigration cases. Before being made foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper ordered home officials to look into how courts used laws that halted deportations on torture grounds. Sir Keir's comments come after a Labour conference dominated by efforts to confront Reform UK . The prime minister used his keynote speech to cast Nigel Farage's movement as practising the ""politics of grievance"" and to position Labour as the party of ""tolerant, decent"" patriotism. He stopped short in the speech of repeating his attack on Reform's deportation proposals as ""racist"" but vowed to fight racist rhetoric ""with everything we have"". In an interview with GB News on Wednesday, Sir Keir said the small boats were ""Farage boats,"" because he advocated Brexit, which made the Dublin Regulation - an agreement allowing the repatriation of asylum seekers to their EU country -  invalid. Prior to Brexit, the UK was allowed to return people who had tried unsuccessfully to claim asylum to other EU member states, taking into consideration factors such as family reunion and irregular entry. The scheme ended in the UK after Brexit, in January 2021. Sir Keir has also spent the conference contending with a provocative challenge to his leadership by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham who said Labour MPs had asked him all summer to return to Westminster and take over as prime minister. Asked about internal challenges to his leadership, Sir Keir said he had ""been underestimated every time"" he had taken on a senior role. Despite this, ""I pushed through the barriers,"" he said. Sir Keir told the BBC: ""I didn't come into politics as some sort of popularity contest. ""I came in with one focus, which is changing my country for the better. ""I'm proud to be prime minister, getting on with that work."" During a wide-ranging interview, Sir Keir also said it was ""wrong"" that thousands of young people remained out of work because of mental problems. ""I'm not saying you don't and shouldn't have benefits for mental health issues but I do think we need to examine this quite carefully,"" he added. ""I say it because if you are on benefits, in your 20s, it is going to be extremely difficult to get off benefits for the rest of your life."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he added he was committed getting ""bills down for those at home and for businesses,"" as energy costs increase by 2% from Wednesday for millions of people in England, Wales and Scotland, as regulator Ofgem's latest price cap come into effect. Asked about the soaring price of food , Sir Keir said the recently published UK-EU SPS Agreement - which stands for sanitary and phytosanitary and refers to rules about animals and food - would mean food prices would soon drop. Separately, in an interview with the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, Sir Keir said he thought some people who had gone to university ""might have been better off"" completing an apprenticeship. He said he wanted ""gold standard"" apprenticeships,  to be as ""equally regarded, equally respected"" , as a university degree. In his speech to the Labour Party Conference, he said he wanted to see two-thirds of young people in the UK go to university or study a technical qualification after leaving school. The new ambition will include both degree-level apprenticeships, which are partly funded by the employer through a levy, and qualifications which sit just below the level equivalent to a university degree. He said the party's old ambition to ""get 50% of kids to uni"" - a target set by Tony Blair in 1999 - was no longer ""right for our times"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd72p30v574o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b941/live/be603cf0-9e91-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-01T10:05:47.580000+00:00,761aa1970bbbde70fefe594e6c8b4c4efc86ffe1
ba52a320b6df,"Michelle Mone should be stripped of peerage, says Badenoch",,"Michelle Mone should be stripped of peerage, says Badenoch Getty Images Mone dismissed the court ruling as ""an establishment win"" for the government Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said Baroness Michelle Mone should be stripped of her peerage. A company linked to the Glaswegian entrepreneur, PPE Medpro, has been ordered by the High Court to repay £122m to the UK government for breaching a Covid contract. Badenoch told BBC News that what she had heard from the case against PPE Medpro was ""enough"" for her to be stripped of her title. Mone was made a Tory peer by David Cameron in 2015, but lost the whip following the revelations about the contract to supply medical gowns. The Conservatives said in December 2023 that she was no longer a member of the party. This was later disputed by Mone. The baroness described the court ruling as ""nothing less than an establishment win for the government in a case that was too big to lose"". Getty Images Kemi Badenoch spoke to the BBC ahead of the Conservative conference in Manchester Speaking to BBC Scotland News ahead of her party's annual conference in Manchester, Badenoch said: ""I want to make sure is that people can see that the Conservative Party is a party of integrity. ""That's why we removed Michelle Mone from our party. ""And it's very, very important that people see that politicians, whether they're in the Commons or in the Lords, are acting above board."" Peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. The SNP have called for the UK government to take that step . Mone is on a leave of absence from the House of Lords and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she did not want the entrepreneur to return. However, she said it was beyond her power to strip Mone of her peerage. During a fringe event at Labour's party conference this week, Reeves reportedly joked that the government had a vendetta against the peer. Mone has accused the chancellor of using ""dangerous and inflammatory"" language . PPE Medpro, which was set up by a consortium led by Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman, was awarded lucrative contracts to supply 25 million medical gowns to the NHS during the pandemic. However, the equipment has been in storage since 2020 after the company failed to prove it was correctly sterilised. A spokesman for Mr Barrowman described the High Court judgement as ""a travesty of justice"". Getty Images Doug Barrowman and Michelle Mone have been married since 2020 Meanwhile, looking ahead to the Scottish Parliament election in May, Badenoch insisted it was ""all to play for"". She said that while the SNP was ahead in the polls, Scots were ""fed up"" with the party, criticising its record on education and the economy. The Tory leader also dismissed calls for a second independence referendum as a ""distraction"". The Scottish Conservatives have been the largest opposition party at Holyrood since 2016. However, recent polls suggest the party is now in a battle to finish as the country's fourth largest party. Badenoch said voters were ""going to protest parties"" due to the Conservative's historic defeat at last year's general election and the unpopularity of Sir Keir Starmer's government. North Sea fears ""What I'm doing is making sure the Scottish people know that the Conservative and Unionist Party is fighting for them, especially in the one area where Scotland leads, and that is on our North Sea oil industry,"" she said. The Tory leader warned that the economy was underperforming and that people getting poorer could lead to ""civil unrest"". She said that Aberdeen was ""dying"", with the oil and gas industry, local supply chain and high street all in need of support. ""We cannot kill industry in Scotland,"" she said. ""We are backing it fully."" The UK Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences, warning that exploring new fields would reduce household bills or improve energy security.

720cbfeeaa81,"Donors covering Farage security after cuts, Reform claims",,"Donors covering Farage security after cuts, Reform claims PA Media Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's publicly-funded security detail has been cut by 75%, the party's head of policy has claimed. Zia Yusuf said the decision had been taken two weeks ago by parliamentary officials for ""inexplicable reasons"", with party donors stepping in to ""ensure that his security is shored up"". The Commons authorities said they do not comment on individual cases, but a ""rigorous"" process was in place to assess arrangements for MPs. It comes amid an escalating war of words between Reform and Sir Keir Starmer over Labour attacks on Farage during its party conference in Liverpool. Speaking to the BBC, Yusuf accused the prime minister of co-ordinating a ""campaign of incitement to violence"" against Farage, adding that the Reform UK leader had been subjected to ""unprecedented vilification"" by ministers. It comes after Sir Keir described Reform UK's policy of scrapping indefinite leave to remain as ""racist"" and accused Farage of not liking Britain. Reform has accused the prime minister of describing Farage and the party's supporters as racists, something Sir Keir has denied. Yusuf accused Sir Keir of ""circling the drain"", claiming polling showed Labour members want Sir Keir to stand down as the party's leader. ""So how's he responded? He's responded by co-ordinating the most unprecedented vilification and campaign of incitement to violence against the man who, frankly, he knows he cannot beat at the ballot box,"" he said. 'For the police' He added that the attacks on Farage this week had come ""in the context"" of the decision to downgrade the Reform UK leader's security by Parliament's security team, which manages security for both MPs and members of the House of Lords. Speaking earlier to Times Radio, he added that the decision was made ""from what I can tell, for inexplicable reasons"", without elaborating further. In his BBC interview, Yusuf said that ""reasonable people"" would be able to question whether the decision was appropriate, given Reform UK's rise in national opinion polls since last year's general election. Speaking to Radio 5 Live at Labour conference, Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden dismissed the idea that security decisions were political, adding it was an operational matter ""for the police and the security authorities"". The Parliamentary Security Department is responsible for security within Parliament, and works with police forces, who are responsible for security outside of the parliamentary estate. MPs are provided with security based on their risk. In May last year the previous government announced a £31m package to increase security provision for MPs. It said the money would also ensure elected politicians, as well as election candidates, had a dedicated named police contact to liaise with on security matters. A spokesperson for the House of Commons said assessments of individual MPs' security arrangements was ""subject to a rigorous risk-based assessment, conducted by security professionals and with input from a range of professional authorities."" ""Whilst these are naturally kept under continuous review, we do not comment on specific details so as not to compromise the safety of MPs, parliamentary staff or members of the public,"" they added. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock rejected Yusuf's claims about incitement, adding he was ""lecturing us on something where they are just not qualified to lecture anybody"". ""We live in a world where there is very robust political debate, that has been going on for a long time,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ypey88kdo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1944/live/6602d520-9ebb-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg,2025-10-01T16:14:50.716000+00:00,0a18f0dd414ca1621513b67eff62d255540c5328
3587de766caa,Ex-Tory defence minister joins Reform UK,,"A former Welsh Conservative MP says she has joined Reform UK and wants to stand for the party in next May's Senedd election. Ex-Wrexham MP and former junior defence minister Sarah Atherton left the Tories earlier this year. She now wants to be a Reform candidate in the new Fflint Wrecsam constituency having ""put her hat in the ring"". Atherton told the BBC she had joined Reform because of her concerns over a ""loss of national identity and pressure on public services"". She added that she had ""had enough of 26 years of decline in Wales under a Labour and Plaid Cymru pact"". Atherton added that she worried ""like millions of others"" about the direction the UK was heading. It comes as Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told BBC Wales that turning around the fortunes of her party cannot happen ""overnight"" , with bumps in the road along the way. Atherton is the third high-profile former Conservative to join the part in Wales, after former Brexit minister David Jones and Conservative Member of the Senedd Laura Anne Jones. Reform is currently deciding who will be its candidates next May. Under Wales' new election map, 16 seats will each elect six members, chosen from party lists. Atherton left the Conservative Party in August having said the previous year that the Conservatives should ""embrace"" Nigel Farage and Reform. At the time she said the Conservatives were ""impotent"" and ""no longer align with her values or ideology"". Having served as Wrexham MP from 2019 until she lost her seat in 2024, Atherton was parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence people, veterans and service families for a brief period in 2022. She was the first Conservative politician to represent the Wrexham constituency since its creation in 1918. Ms Badenoch later told PA News: ""Former MPs have been defecting. Many of them are going where they think the wind is blowing."" But she conceded that leaders are ""always sad to lose party members"".

c4382e9aaae0,Labour deputy debate exposes differences in approach,,"Rival deputy leadership candidates Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell went head-to-head in a hustings at the very end of the Labour Party conference in Liverpool. Education Secretary Phillipson and former Commons Leader Powell both wore dark blue dresses as they sat to one side of the giant stage, with a large podium standing empty in the middle. This is a contest the Labour leadership did not want to have, in case it highlighted internal divisions when the party is behind in the polls. So the hustings - where the two candidates set out their stalls and answered members' questions - was shunted beyond the official end of the annual conference, with no TV camera access, although it was streamed on Labour's YouTube channel. As the session began the audience were asked not to applaud because ""cumulatively applause could knock out a whole question,"" in a hall that was far from full. Phillipson and Powell are vying to replace Angela Rayner as the deputy leader of the party, after she resigned over what she insisted were mistakes in paying her stamp duty. The pair were each given two minutes to make their cased to the membership, with Phillipson stressing how, as education secretary, she would be a voice ""at the heart of government"" and would deliver the Employment Rights Bill in full. She spoke of the need for unity but how she was a candidate who would push the government to be bold and took a swipe at her competitor, suggesting she was the candidate of ""division and disunity"" and that Labour could not afford to look inwards. By contrast, Powell said she would be a ""full time deputy"" who would be able to ""wrestle back the megaphone"" and set the terms of the debate as the party's ""campaigner in chief"". She highlighted how the deputyship ""is a party role, not a government one"" and said her focus would be bringing the voices of councillors, members and communities to the attention of government. However, she said she would not ""shy away"" from difficult conversations because the government would make better decisions ""when we reflect the views of our broad movement and when our values shine through"". She added: ""Having this debate is not dissent but an important conversation about how we can be better - because we need to be."" There was consensus on some issues - that in taking on Nigel Farage, Labour should  not ""ape"" Reform but there was a different emphasis from each candidate on what the Labour government had got wrong. Both said winter fuel cuts had been a mistake but Phillipson said the party should focus on ""the 90% of things it got right"" - including family hubs and workers' rights -while Powell said that it wasn't possible to ""sugar-coat"" big errors, adding that voter disillusionment needed to be addressed. Team Powell seem confident of their prospects with the membership, but the Phillipson campaign point to her greater number of nominations from the trade union movement. Labour members have until 23 October to vote for their preferred candidate and the result will be announced on 25 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxzpgjqd82o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c482/live/4d47d220-9ebf-11f0-9ab9-d38bf221fde2.png,2025-10-01T13:05:01.187000+00:00,6a56ddefc6eb834af55b5963fbb5b2382a1fe3ed
807da3f83736,Labour plans new law to ban fracking permanently,,"The Labour government is planning to pass a new law that would ban fracking for shale gas permanently in England, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has announced. At Labour's conference, Miliband said he wanted to legislate at the earliest opportunity and launch a national campaign against fracking in the meantime. Fracking is currently only limited by a suspension on ministerial decisions to grant licences. The practice has been suspended numerous times over the last few decades, most recently in 2022, over concerns about earthquakes and environmental impacts. But Reform UK has said it would bring back fracking and has threatened to ""wage war"" on renewables developers if it wins power. In speech at Labour's conference, Miliband said fracking would ""not take a penny off bills"" and ""trash our climate commitments"". ""The good news is that communities have fought back and won this fight before and will do so again,"" Miliband said. Labour said Miliband would launch a campaign to take on Reform UK over shale gas exploration. The energy secretary told Labour's conference: ""Let's ban fracking and send the frackers packing."" The government will announce in the outcome of the North Sea Energy Future consultation that it will legislate to permanently ban new onshore oil and gas licences, ensuring that no future fracking can take place in England. Labour sources say a timeline for the legislation will be set out in due course. Fracking projects under previous governments were hampered by planning delays, minor earthquakes, legal challenges and persistent protests. Rishi Sunak reinstated the moratorium on fracking when he was prime minister in 2022 and Labour said it would ban the practice permanently in its general election manifesto. The party says Miliband's campaign will rally activists and local communities across the country against fracking, and promote investment in clean, homegrown power. Labour is focusing on building out the UK's renewable energy and is aiming for clean power to meet 95% of electricity demand by 2030. It is part of the government plan to achieve the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. In his speech, Miliband also announced an expansion of Great British Energy's scheme to install solar panels on the roofs of schools and hospitals. He also outlined plans to boost the number of jobs in the clean energy sector and improve workers' rights in those industries. Throughout the conference, Labour ministers have said they're in a fight over climate action with Reform UK, which has pledged to scrap net zero if the party wins power. In his speech, Miliband said Labour had to take the fight to Reform, which ""would wreck everything we are doing"". ""And let's call it out: theirs is an all-out war on future generations too,"" Miliband said. ""I'm proud of British climate leadership. I'm proud of Labour climate leadership."" Polling consistently shows a majority of the public supporting the UK's net zero target but also indicates public concern over the costs. Labour has spent its week in Liverpool targeting Nigel Farage, with Sir Keir Starmer using his speech on Tuesday to accuse the Reform UK's leader of not believing in Britain and sowing division. Miliband said the threat from Reform ""goes beyond their climate denying agenda"". He said Farage was ""a key part of a global network who together want to destroy the ties that bind our communities and our way of life"". The energy secretary lashed out at the billionaire Elon Musk, accusing him of inciting ""violence on our streets"" and enabling ""disinformation through X"". Miliband said: ""Conference, we have a message for Elon Musk: Get the hell out of our politics."" At the conference, ministers have also said they are considering removing policy costs from energy bills to make electricity cheaper. Speaking at a fringe event, Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the government was ""looking at everything"" to reduce energy bills and understood ""the strong argument for moving policy costs on to gas rather than electricity"". ""I think it's really important to squeeze as much money out of bills as we can,"" Shanks said. ""We've not ruled out options but there are no quick answers that don't have trade-offs somewhere else."" Policy costs are effectively government taxes used to fund environmental and social schemes, such as subsidies for renewables. These costs made up about 16% of an electricity bill and 6% of a gas bill last year, according to research by the charity Nesta. The Climate Change Committee has long recommended removing policy costs from electricity bills to help people feel the benefits of net-zero transition. The government's climate adviser said the move would make switching to electric technologies, such as heat pumps, cheaper and encourage take-up.

954b1fb8f3c5,Five takeaways from Starmer's conference speech,,"Five takeaways from Starmer's conference speech Watch: Key moments from Starmer's Labour conference speech Sir Keir Starmer sought to rally his party and set out his vision for the country in his keynote speech at Labour's conference in Liverpool. So, what were the standout moments? Let's look at five of them. Taking aim at Reform UK The central theme of the Labour conference is taking the fight to Reform UK, which is leading in UK-wide opinion polls. Throughout the conference, Labour ministers and MPs have attacked Reform and framed its fight with the party in existential terms. In his speech, the prime minister reinforced that message, telling the party faithful the country faced a stark choice between ""renewal or decline"". ""It is a test,"" Sir Keir said. ""A fight for the soul of our country, every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war, and we must all rise to this challenge."" Calling out the Reform UK leader by name, Sir Keir asked: ""When was the last time you heard Nigel Farage say anything positive about Britain's future? ""He can't. He doesn't like Britain. Doesn't believe in Britain."" In these spiky comments, Sir Keir was pointedly naming Farage as the principal opponent in the ""fight"", rather than Labour's traditional competitor for power, the Conservatives. The Tories were barely mentioned, and there was a chorus of laughter when Sir Keir quipped: ""The Tories - remember them?"" Hard truths on migration PA Media There has been some discomfort among Labour MPs over the home secretary's plans to make it harder for migrants to gain permanent settlement status in the UK . Sir Keir acknowledged this in his speech, but argued the government would have to take ""decisions that will not always be comfortable for our party"". In a departure from the New Labour years, he said the party had placed too much faith in globalisation and the idea that ""immigration is all we need to give us the workers"". He talked about meeting a woman in Oldham, shortly after becoming an MP in 2015. Sir Keir said the woman complained about ""a group of men from Eastern Europe"" who had recently moved into her street, ""didn't put the rubbish out at the right time and spat on the ground"". The prime minister said the woman ""felt she had to prove to a Labour politician that she wasn't racist"". Sir Keir said at that time, Labour ""had become a party that patronised working people"" and ""that's why we changed the party"". A focus on apprenticeships The speech blended the personal and the political. But the prime minister did announce one new policy. Sir Keir said the UK government would scrap a commitment to get 50% of England's young people into university. Tony Blair set the target over 20 years ago to boost social mobility when he was prime minister, and the symbolic 50% mark was passed for the first time in 2019. Sir Keir said the target would be changed to two-thirds of young people going to university or ""gold standard apprenticeships"". He said the government would invest in new technical excellence colleges and skills training. Personal and political were entwined here: he reminded the conference about his father's job as a toolmaker who worked with his hands - and said that further education colleges had been ""ignored - because politicians' kids don't go there"". Starmer's version of patriotism PA Media There's been a lot of debate about patriotism and national flags - and what they represent - ahead of and during the conference. A few weeks ago, following a march organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson in London, the prime minister said the UK would never ""surrender"" its flag to those who wish to use it as ""a symbol of violence, fear and division."" To a waving sea of flags in the conference hall, Sir Keir elaborated on that argument. ""Labour is the party of national renewal. Labour is the patriotic party."" He said the flags of the UK ""belong to all of us and we will never surrender them"". Patriotism, the prime minister said, was about serving the ""common good"" - and disputing the idea that Britain was ""broken"", Sir Keir praised the work of ordinary people, including a woman named Melanie who organises meet-ups for people in care in Yorkshire. He also mentioned Kaitlyn, a 15-year-old sitting in the audience, who set up her own girls football team at school in Barnet, and George, who delivers food parcels in Telford. ""Mere politics cannot break Britain, conference,"" Sir Keir said. Looking back - and ahead - to tough Budget decisions The upcoming Budget has loomed over the conference, fuelling speculation of tax rises, which most economists think are likely. In his speech, the prime minister reflected on the last Budget, which saw the chancellor unveil £40bn in tax rises - the biggest increase in a generation - to raise money to pay for the NHS and other public services. ""We asked a lot at the last Budget - I know that,"" Sir Keir said. ""And the tough decisions they will keep on coming."" Rejecting calls for a wealth tax and increases in borrowing to fund government spending, Sir Keir said he would not ""cast off the constraints and indulge in ideological fantasy"". Sir Keir said losing control of the economy means ""working people pay the price"" and promised ""I will never let that happen again"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36krle3894o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13ff/live/47e2f580-9e1a-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-30T15:20:10.373000+00:00,4fa6a9d69e8ddae68326910c6e7d4e84f549bf36
78fef204f1af,Lammy backtracks on Farage Hitler Youth claim,,"Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy rowed back on claims Nigel Farage ""flirted with Hitler Youth"". Lammy's comments were an apparent reference to allegations that emerged in 2013 that Farage sang Nazi songs as a teenager. The Reform UK leader denied the allegations at the time, which centred on a claim that as a schoolboy in the late 1970s and early 1980s he and others marched through a village ""shouting Hitler Youth songs"". A Reform source told BBC News: ""It's disgusting and libellous. Beneath contempt."" On Sunday, Sir Keir Starmer described Reform UK's policy of scrapping indefinite leave to remain as ""racist"" and ""immoral"". Since then senior Labour figures have been careful to try to draw a distinction between calling a policy of Reform UK ""racist"" but insisting they're not using the same label about the party's supporters. In his conference speech, the prime minister stepped up his attacks on Farage and Reform, claiming they did not love their country and were only interested in stirring division. He also vowed to fight racist rhetoric ""with everything we have"". Speaking after the speech on the BBC's Politics Live, Lammy was asked whether he thought Farage was a racist. He said the PM had been calling out policies ""that would line people up who have a right to be in this country, who might be Indian, who might be Nigerian, and send them home"". He added: ""It's not British. It doesn't respect our values. ""I'm not going to play the man. I'm playing the ball, as our leader did. ""I will leave it for the public to come to their own judgements about someone who once flirted with Hitler Youth when he was younger."" Shortly after making the comments, Lammy said he was ""happy to clarify"" them, in an interview with the BBC News Channel. ""He [Farage] has denied it and so I accept that he has denied it and I would like to clarify that position because in the end the prime minister is keen for us to focus on the policies not the individuals."" The deputy prime minister added: ""I wasn't at school with Nigel Farage. I don't know what songs he sang at school. ""I'm happy to clarify. I did say it's for the public to make up their mind and I did also emphasise that let us play the ball, not the man.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn95q9j0yyro,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6334/live/c8657c60-9e28-11f0-ba41-9d184b600492.jpg,2025-09-30T18:22:55.185000+00:00,950f58834d2ebbf40339eeba2967ba17bb816ea4
934a2d1f5a6e,Call for Miliband to go as second oil refinery loses jobs,,"Oil workers have called for Energy Secretary Ed Miliband to be sacked as a second UK oil refinery moves towards closure. The 125 job losses at the East Lindsey site were announced on the morning of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party conference. But Unite's Sharon Graham, head of the union which represents workers at the refinery, warned Sir Keir needed to rescue the government's industrial strategy with fresh investment to protect jobs. Urging him to ""wake up and smell the coffee"", Ms Graham said there could be no growth agenda when the country's industries were shedding jobs. Jamie Dalgetty, Unite branch chairman at the site, said workers had lost faith in Miliband and his junior energy minister, Michael Shanks. ""As part of the National Oil Refinery and Terminal Convenience Committee, I can speak for all of us that we're calling for Ed Miliband and Michael Shanks' removal from their position,"" he said. He added that Miliband needed to support takeover bids for the site, in a similar government intervention to the one taken at the Scunthorpe steel works, also in north Lincolnshire. Ms Graham called on the prime minister to intervene and get the industrial strategy and the Net Zero strategy back on track, because ""it is a disaster"" that two oil refineries are facing closure in less than a year ""under Labour's watch"". ""They've got to have a plan for British industry, you cannot just do this piecemeal,"" she said, comparing Germany's £1 trillion plan for energy diversification to the UK's £50bn. ""It doesn't make any sense for a growth plan if you're allowing oil refineries to shut down and other parts of British industry to shut down,"" she said. ""We need to have the money, like Germany's just done, they've changed their fiscal rules, we need to have the money to invest in these jobs."" The Unite general secretary criticised what she said was a net zero plan for jobs rather than carbon, adding that Chancellor Rachel Reeves should change course by growing the UK economy through investment in jobs.

2ae140198d13,The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter,,"The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC ""Oh God,"" and then a pause, a sigh, and then, ""Oh God,"" again. Just as a senior Conservative was telling me the party might be able to climb out the terrible hole it's in, news popped up of another of its ranks deserting for Reform UK. Their response? Sad resignation, at yet another resignation. The individual exit of Sarah Atherton, who was briefly a defence minister when the Tories were in power, is not the point. Well over a dozen Conservative MPs or former MPs have made that same move. The question for the Conservatives perhaps this weekend is: is there a point? You don't need me to tell you that the Conservatives are unpopular - deeply so. The hangover from the last election was always going to be nasty after a proper thumping, 14 years in power, and, oh yes, those five prime ministers. But the party's standing has fallen even further since then. No discernible bounce with its new leadership under Kemi Badenoch. No profit from the misery of the government. For the group once regarded as the most successful political operation in the western world, it's dire. Technically, the Tories are still the main opposition. That brings status and meaning. It's Badenoch who gets to ask six questions of the prime minister every week. It's the Conservatives who, as is traditional, are most often called on to respond to government announcements. They still have way more MPs than the Liberal Democrats, or the SNP, and legions more than Reform or the Greens. But politically, it just doesn't feel at this moment that they are the government's hungry main challengers. That's in part because they were smashed to bits in July 2024 and it was always going to take a bit of time to come round. It's in part because the party is so far behind in the polls. It's in part because the government is very deliberately making its arguments against Reform, not their traditional Conservative rivals. As another senior party figure observes, Labour's ""framing of cutting the Tories out is the right one"". It suits Labour and the Lib Dems to treat the Tories as if they are irrelevant. And it's in part, many Conservatives argue, because Badenoch ""just hasn't generated any traction, any attention"" during her time in charge. As the Conservatives arrive in Manchester for their conference, in the very serious aftermath of the attack on Heaton Park synagogue, the primary job is to grab any attention: perhaps the Tory party is smack bang in the middle of a battle to matter at all. Reuters Prime Minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer Like it or not, just as Sir Keir Starmer has discovered, grumpy parties who are not doing well point the finger at their leader. Badenoch has admirers in the Conservative Party for speaking out on particular issues like single-sex spaces, free speech, or declaring that some cultures are in her view ""less valid"" than others. Some of her colleagues applaud her blunt, tell-it-like-it-is manner. But politics is also a business of charm and empathy. A senior Tory told me after the election defeat the party had to ""go everywhere and do a mea culpa, to listen and take a kicking"". But the issue with Badenoch, they say, is ""she is grand... hasn't been anywhere and isn't listening to anyone"". Ouch. With conference about to start, it's almost a Tory tradition to fill the papers and podcasts with gripes about the party leader. She has had some more effective performances at Prime Minister's Questions. Policies are starting to emerge. Money has kept flowing to the party.  One of her backers maintains that although she is still ""finding her way"", she has some of the same ""strength and character as a young Margaret Thatcher"". Thatcher was seen as ""strange and shrill"" when she got the job, but became the party's most successful boss of modern times. But as Badenoch approaches a year in the job, it's becoming harder to find people who'll make that comparison. Whatever Badenoch's personal strengths and failures, there is a different criticism of how she has gone about the job, with a party veteran suggesting, ""there is just no pace, no nimbleness"". Maybe that should have been staring the party in the face: her original pitch for the job was ""Renewal 2030"" - a date past the next general election. During many of her interviews Badenoch has said she wants to take her time working out the right moves for the party, developing credible ideas rather than being rushed. You can expect lots of policy to be unveiled in the next few days. But politics moves incredibly fast, and another source agrees pace is a problem, saying: ""What she misunderstood is you get one chance to introduce yourself to the public – she lost the chance to generate any traction and she won't get that back."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was only too happy to step into that ""vacuum"", gaining strength in the polls and grabbing headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans. Getty Images Badenoch after delivering a speech at the Institute of Chartered Accountants' Hall in September Candidly, it is not unusual to hear Conservatives saying freely in private that Badenoch won't be in the job for long, she could be ""out by Christmas"", or ""might not even have to be dragged out"" if the party bombs at the polls in a set of mega elections in May. Indeed, when asked the question herself in a conference warm-up interview, she more or less said: Well, ask me then. Refreshingly honest from a leader who isn't fully in control of her own destiny? Or foolhardy when this is a moment when she ought to be mustering as much authority as she can? The conference gives a shop window to the party and its leader to show what she is made of too. As one senior MP says: ""This conference is about her, and making it clear she has a direction and a sense of where she is going, and it is hers and she is going to lead it – we have this one chance."" ""We understand the polls aren't great, a source close to the party leadership adds. ""There needs to be a bit of understanding from those who are grumbling."" But where is Badenoch trying to lead? ""If I want a can of full fat coke, then I go and buy one, if I like what Reform are saying I'm gonna vote Reform, I'm not going to vote for a party that's not quite there,"" a party insider says. Badenoch's signals on climate change, on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, tip towards the right of the Conservative spectrum, on territory that right now, Reform have painted in bold primary colours. Bloomberg via Getty Images Reform leader Nigel Farage has grabbed headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans Badenoch is a Brexiteer, a strong advocate of free speech, and seemingly often up for a spat in the latest round of culture wars. But politics is a business - not quite like any other - but a business nonetheless. And many in the party reckon she is going after the wrong customers and ought to be trying to appeal more to soft liberals or soft Tories, rather than to those interested in Reform. ""Frankly, the gap in the market is on the centre right,"" one source says. Some of the current Tory top brass are keen to get the argument onto issues they hope might appeal more to more voters, and it's not stupid to guess it, yes, the economy. One shadow minister says: ""We have to talk about the money in your pocket and trying to articulate what all of Labour's tax rises and debt means to you in terms of the cash in your pocket and the food in your fridge."" With Reform UK in the ascendant, are they the right enemy for the Tories in any case, one source wonders? Their presence on the right means the Conservatives right now don't have the luxury of assuming they will always be the number two. The party used to be ""free to carry on in opposition in our own space – now when the party looks for who its enemy is, is it Labour, Reform or Lib Dems, or it doesn't know?"". According to one source close to the party leadership, in recent years people have struggled to know what the party stands for: ""We have flip-flopped, criss-crossed, gone from [Theresa] May to [Boris] Johnson, to [Rishi] Sunak."" There will be big announcements over the next few days setting out Badenoch's position ""and it will be the job of MPs and councils and everyone to go and sell that message"". Getty Images Badenoch giving a speech earlier this year As party members and associated hangers-on start to arrive in Manchester today, there are reasons to be gloomy for the current leadership. If you look back at the polling, Badenoch is in a worse position according to net satisfaction ratings than John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, David Cameron, Theresa May,  Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. (If you're wondering, I didn't forget Liz Truss, but she wasn't around long enough to have her popularity measured after nearly a year). ""I don't remember it ever being this bad,"" says one insider, suggesting not just that Badenoch's time will be up before too long, but also that the party has been hollowed out of experience and knowledge, and many of the big-name MPs who have stuck around have, frankly, rather checked out. But one of Badenoch's backers suggests it's the party, not the leadership, that ought to have a word with itself. They told me their colleagues have got a ""messiah complex - ever since Margaret they think there is a leader out there who will lead them to the promised land"". In other words, get your heads down, get your work done, and stop thinking it's all about the person at the top. ""We need to understand real history, not folk history,"" they say, suggesting a new leader would not and could not solve the party's problems on their own. Do it again, and a frontbencher suggests ""people will think, 'Oh God, they haven't changed!'"" But the overall picture for the Tories' top team is as foul as the weather in Manchester which awaits them. ""They're not relevant, they don't matter - that is the big thing the current team have not understood,"" one Tory source worries. ""If it's not resolved soon it's easy to see  how we might be in third or even fourth place"" when it gets to the next election, they add. Not for the first time, you don't need me to remind you - but I will - that politics in the 2020s is a very unpredictable era. There are known unknowns. Might Badenoch pull off a blinding speech this week? Will Labour be patient with Sir Keir until the general election? Will Reform hold together? Will the economy improve? And unknown unknowns that we can't list right now. And anyone who claims to know what's next may as well be trying to sell ice to an Eskimo. The Conservative party has been pronounced more or less gone before. There was even a book published titled ""The Strange Death of Tory England"". Five years later, David Cameron strolled into No 10. But the party is in trouble. Conferences are always an opportunity for political parties, but also a risk. The pressure is on the Tories to show they matter in the next few days, or more on their own side may wonder what they're for.

e7bc4c86a145,Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates,,"Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates Getty Images Caerphilly Castle is the second largest in Britain, behind only Windsor Castle Eight politicians are competing in, arguably, the most interesting by-election in the 26-years of Welsh devolution. They are seeking to represent the constituency of Caerphilly in the Welsh Parliament. Prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August , the poll takes place on 23 October. Here you can read about all of the candidates, in alphabetical order, and their messages to voters. The details were provided by the political parties and candidates, and reflect their views. Steve Aicheler - Welsh Liberal Democrats Welsh Liberal Democrats Who is he? Steve Aicheler lives in Machen with his family and is a community councillor and school governor. He works for a national non-profit organisation promoting entrepreneurship in education and has founded several local businesses. Steve says he is standing to give Caerphilly a strong, independent voice in the Senedd who puts people first. What are his policies? Fix the social care crisis to free up the Welsh NHS and reduce waiting times. Provide 30 hours of free childcare a week for every child aged nine months to four years, so that every parent in Caerphilly has access to affordable and flexible childcare. Prioritise education, ensuring young people in Wales have equal access to opportunity as young people in England. Bring jobs back to Caerphilly, challenging a Cardiff-centric City Deal that has failed to deliver for local people. Protect local services that are under threat from Labour locally and in the Senedd. Anthony Cook - Gwlad Glenn Whitehouse Who is he? Anthony Cook grew up in Cefn Hengoed, lives in Ystrad Mynach and says his family has been ""part of the Rhymney Valley mining history for generations"". He is a father of three children that he takes on ""adventures over Parc Penallta and Gelligaer Common"" and says that, as a boy, he ""played in the shadow of Penallta colliery and caught the C9 bus to Bargoed to go shopping with my nan in a once thriving high street"". He says he understands the ""struggles that have followed the decline of our traditional industries"". The name of his party, Gwlad, means country in Welsh. What are his policies? Help town centres by building homes, siting public services such as polyclinics (centres for GP surgeries, outpatients and minor injuries) there and encouraging evening shop opening, at least from April to October. Reform VAT; as new build is free of the tax but repair is not, making it cheaper to build new on the outskirts of town rather than restore the old centre. The elected Welsh government should run Wales, not boards and panels of the ""great and the good"" which require additional funding to administer and give ministers a way to evade responsibility. End subsidies for renewable energy schemes such as solar farms that are destroying good agricultural land. Oppose Welsh government funding of politically partisan NGOs (non-governmental organisations), eg those that campaign for men to access women's spaces. Gareth Hughes - Green Party Who is he? Gareth Hughes, who lives in Caerphilly, was born in Bangor and educated at Friars Grammar School, Coleg Harlech and the London School of Economics. He has been an apprentice printer, print journalist, university lecturer, researcher and played a prominent role in the early days of housing associations in Wales. He returned to journalism, with the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in the late 1990s, as an ITV Wales political reporter and commentator, later analysing public life for BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and others. What are his policies? Create green jobs for people where they live. Provide better public services - including more evening bus services and warm, safe housing. Build stronger communities with empowered local voices. Promote a fairer, greener future tackling the climate emergency. Gareth Potter - Welsh Conservatives Welsh Conservatives Who is he? Gareth Potter is married with two children and has lived in Ebbw Vale since last year. Born in Pontypool, he grew up on a Trevethin council estate and attended West Monmouth Comprehensive School. He worked for retailers, including Matalan, then in charity retail with the British Heart Foundation before focusing on politics full-time. He was previously a staff member for Conservative South Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar and worked, for the last four years, as a campaign manager for Bristol and South Gloucestershire Conservatives. What are his policies? Scrap business rates for small businesses to allow our forgotten high streets to grow, creating more local jobs and reducing unemployment across Caerphilly and growing tourism. Ban mobile phones in schools by rolling out lockable phone pouches across all schools in Caerphilly and ensure children are automatically excluded for carrying knives into school. Push to extend GP services beyond 09:00 BST to 19:00 and review NHS hospital planning which has seen hospitals like Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr designed for A&E services but instead all A&E going to the Grange in Torfaen 30mins away for residents living just yards from Ystrad Fawr. Scrap Wales' 20mph default speed limit and build an M4 relief road south of Newport to support growth in our town and villages across Caerphilly. Keep local services open while cutting council waste, scrapping the Senedd expansion while initiating an Anti-Waste Action Plan. Llŷr Powell - Reform UK Reform UK Who is he? Llŷr Powell has lived and worked in Caerphilly for the last five years and has called the area home for much of his professional life, aside from a brief hiatus to work in the House of Commons in 2024. He has worked in communications in public, political and charitable organisations, including roles in political communications and public affairs, where he has used his platform to highlight issues facing the left-behind communities of south Wales. He is a fluent Welsh speaker, and describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter of grassroots Welsh rugby and a keen follower of the national side. What are his policies? Protect the NHS, free at the point of delivery, with free prescriptions. Champion shorter waiting lists, more frontline staff, proper funding and an upgrade for Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr. Support local high streets, be a strong voice for Caerphilly's local economy and prioritise attracting much-needed investment to create more opportunities and jobs in this area. End the Nation of Sanctuary policy, which has wasted £55m of taxpayers' money. Fight to keep libraries open as the Labour council wants to close 10 of them while sitting on almost £190m in reserves as council tax keeps rising. Ensure reserves are spent on local communities not wasteful projects. Get Wales moving again by pushing to reverse Labour's 20mph speed limits, which are negatively impacting Caerphilly's economy and putting businesses off investing in the region. Back better and safer transport links. Roger Quilliam - UKIP Who is he? Roger Quilliam has been a member of UKIP's National Executive Committee since 2024. The party says he has worked for over two years closely with party leader Nick Tenconi in activism and citizen journalism for UKIP, Turning Point UK, and Disciples of Christ. UKIP says he campaigns against mass immigration, communism, liberalism, and in favour of patriotism, nationalism, and traditionalism and that his core values are rooted in family, community, national identity, justice, and law and order. What are his policies? Abolish the Senedd. Freeze immigration for a minimum of five years. Mass deportations and remigration. Reinstate Christianity back into the heart of government and put Britons first. Richard Tunnicliffe - Welsh Labour Welsh Labour Who is he? Richard Tunnicliffe has lived in Caerphilly with his Troedyrhiw-born wife Lynda for 26 years and they raised their three sons in the town. He has worked as an accountant and financial analyst and runs a publishing company with his wife, specialising in Welsh translations of popular children's books. He was encouraged to become more active in the local party by Hefin David, who was mentoring him to be a candidate in next year's Senedd election at the time of his death. What are his policies? Honour Hefin David's legacy by listening to constituents and solving community problems together. Champion Bevan's NHS by working proactively with local health service leaders. Earn trust by doing what I say I will do and never over-promising. Calling for the council to prioritise protecting libraries across the borough and use any future funding to do so. Lindsay Whittle - Plaid Cymru Plaid Cymru Who is he? Lindsay Whittle was born in Caerphilly town, he lives in Abertridwr, was raised on the Penyrheol council estate and attended Cwm Ifor Primary School. A councillor for Penyrheol since 1976, he was Caerphilly council leader from 1999 to 2004 and 2008 to 2011, and has been Plaid Cymru group leader on the council since 2022. From 2011 to 2016 he was a South Wales East assembly membe r (as Senedd members were previously known). What are his policies? Campaign for a fair funding settlement for Wales to help protect local services and oppose cuts, recently opposing plans to close public libraries and a leisure centre across the Caerphilly constituency. Attract quality jobs through Plaid Cymru's Making Wales Work plan, giving locally-owned small and medium-sized businesses and co-operatives in Caerphilly more help and adjusting business rates to boost town centres. Billions spent on rail projects in England, such as HS2 and the Oxford-Cambridge line, bring extra money to Scotland and Northern Ireland but not Wales. Releasing cash for Wales would help pay for local improvements. Invest in primary healthcare: Lindsay Whittle supports Plaid Cymru's plan to set up elective care hubs to get people seen faster, with a triage system to speed up referrals between GPs and hospitals.

b27281916b71,"Trump trusts Blair, others don't - could he govern Gaza?",,"Trump trusts Blair, others don't - could he govern Gaza? James Landale Diplomatic correspondent Getty Images As prime minister of the UK for more than 10 years, Sir Tony Blair was a master of political compromise. He was seen as a deft negotiator of the centre ground, triangulating his way out of the straitjacket of traditional left-right politics. But if there were peace in Gaza and he were summoned to help govern what was left, would even Teflon Tony – as he was once known – have the political wiles to keep all sides happy and the guns silent? His putative role is still not clear. Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan envisages an international transitional body that would oversee the governance of post-war Gaza. The US president would chair this so-called ""Board of Peace"" and Sir Tony, aged 72, would be a member. He's a ""good man, very good man"", Trump told reporters. Sir Tony's presence on this hypothetical body would come as no surprise. The former prime minister has been closely involved in drawing up Gaza peace proposals for months. He has been working with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Ron Dermer, a key adviser to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In August, Sir Tony attended a high-level meeting with Trump at the White House to discuss a post-war strategy for the Strip. A month earlier he also held talks with Steve Witkoff, the president's chief envoy, at the White House. In a statement, Sir Tony unsurprisingly lavished praise on the Trump plan, describing it as ""bold and intelligent"" and ""the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering"". He said the proposals created the possibility not only ""of Israelis and Palestinians finding a path to peace"" but also ""a broader regional and global alliance to counter the forces of extremism and promote peace and prosperity between nations"". And that is the key point: this is what Sir Tony has been pushing for decades in different roles. As prime minister from 1997, he supported the Clinton administration's efforts to find peace in the region. On the very day he left office in June 2007, he was appointed special envoy for a so-called Quartet - representing the US, Russia, the EU and UN – designed to coordinate peace efforts, a role he held until 2015. His supporters insist his remit at the Quartet was economic development and he was excluded from the political process. Since then his business and other interests – including his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change - have kept him firmly plugged into the region. Diplomats say this is what makes Sir Tony unique; he is trusted by the Trump administration, he has an unparalleled network in the Middle East, and he has long experience of dealing with both Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. Nick Hopton, director general of the Middle East Association, said the former UK PM was the only western leader one could imagine taking the role. ""He's got the credibility and experience having been embroiled in the Middle East for 24 years,"" he said. ""But it will work only if he is able to have the confidence of Donald Trump and also if he is not seen as being manipulated by Benjamin Netanyahu. He also needs to demonstrate he has the confidence of the Palestinian Authority leadership."" But – and it is a big but – Sir Tony would come to the role with much baggage. To some he is a divisive figure, to others worse. Role in Iraq invasion 'not forgotten' His role in joining the 2003 invasion of Iraq - based on incorrect reports about the country's weapons of mass destruction – still tarnishes his reputation in the region and has led some to accuse him of war crimes. Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, was blunt. ""Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine,"" she posted on social media. ""Shall we meet in The Hague perhaps?"", a reference to the location of the International Criminal Court. Sir Simon Fraser, former head of the UK Foreign Office, said Sir Tony had shown genuine interest in the Palestinian issue and was trusted in Washington, Israel and the Gulf. ""But the Arab street has not forgotten Iraq,"" he said. ""The future oversight of Gaza needs a broader base and cannot look like an American/British enterprise."" Hamas, for one, did not seem keen. Husam Badran, a member of the group's political bureau, said this week Sir Tony should be on trial for the US invasion of Iraq, not administering Gaza. ""Any plan linked to Blair is an ill omen,"" he said. Some Palestinians and others also see Sir Tony as historically always being too close to Israeli and US positions. Nomi Bar-Yaacov, a former international peace negotiator, said: ""I don't think the Palestinians trust him at all. I think they view him as a colossal failure during the time that he was the Quartet envoy."" Even UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who used his Labour conference speech on Tuesday to praise the Trump peace plan, chose to make no mention of the key role his predecessor might play. As Middle East peace envoy for eight long years, Sir Tony was supposed to help build up the Palestinian Authority so that one day it would be in a fit state to run a Palestinian state. But few would argue that this is where the PA is today. Palestinians also argue he did not do enough to push back against illegal settlements and settler violence. Some have claimed he should have made a stronger case for Palestinian statehood, focusing instead on economic development. Getty Images As former Quartet special envoy Tony Blair met Benjamin Netanyahu in 2014 The interesting question is why Sir Tony still feels the need to be involved in trying to find an end to the fighting in the Middle East. He has long seen himself as a peace-maker, after his success negotiating the Good Friday Agreement that helped reduce conflict in Northern Ireland. But as a political correspondent throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and thus a close observer of the Blair years of power, I was always struck by his dogged refusal to accept that he might have failed to persuade someone of his point of view. It niggled at him. To that extent, the Middle East may be seen by Sir Tony as unfinished business. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told PA Media Sir Tony's role would ""raise eyebrows"" because of the Iraq war and said he had an ""incredible legacy"" in Northern Ireland of building peace that lasted. ""If he can bring that skill set to bear in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the support of Israelis, Palestinians and other regional powers, then so much the better,"" Mr Streeting said. In truth, the role of Blair is a second order issue. He will have a job to do only if this peace plan succeeds and survives, and there is no guarantee of that. Far more important are the differences between both sides and details that are as yet unresolved by the framework outlined by the White House. Sanam Vakil, Middle East programme director at the Chatham House think tank, said: ""The focus on Tony Blair and his legacy of western intervention in Iraq masks the real challenges of this peace framework that lacks details, timelines and deliverables - and does not yet have Palestinian or Israeli buy-in, let alone leadership. ""Without significant work to move beyond 20 points on a piece of paper, this plan will be another version of cosmetic diplomacy that embeds structural injustice and deprives Palestinians of agency and sovereignty."" So maybe what really matters is not perhaps the psychodrama of Sir Tony Blair and the controversial opinions people hold about him. A more relevant question may be more what role any transitional authority in Gaza might play and whether Sir Tony has the right skills and experience to play a significant role. If his job would be to coordinate with Gulf leaders and the White House, that is one thing. But if he were being asked effectively to govern Gaza, overseeing the reconstruction, the security and economic development of the Strip, that is quite another. ""Viceroy Blair?"" one diplomat texted me. ""That will never wash.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d5938w3ko,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ebc5/live/f21cee50-9e2b-11f0-ba41-9d184b600492.jpg,2025-09-30T19:31:18.674000+00:00,0664df86f879ca2d24ecbbd482679548e1a50884
5fb84056c04c,Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage,,"Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage Matt Chorley Presenter, BBC Radio 5 Live Getty Images ""Know yourself and know your enemy,"" wrote Sun Tzu, the Chinese military adviser from the 6th century BC. ""In a hundred battles, you will never be defeated."" Sir Keir Starmer might not quite have 100 battles, but he's got a fair few on his hands: with his party, with the bond markets, with the mayor of Greater Manchester. And yet the prime minister, who still helms an enormous Commons majority, has a resolute focus on who the singular enemy is. And it's a party with five MPs: Reform UK. Time and again, Sir Keir has chosen during Labour's conference week to focus on Nigel Farage, having written off the Conservatives as ""dead"" and barely mentioning the Lib Dems, Greens or other parties eating into Labour support from the left. 'Different fight' But in the lanyard-laden fringes and bars in Liverpool, there is a live conversation about the wisdom of this strategy. Does naming your enemy so publicly help bring focus to the government's operation and attack? Or does it risk elevating Reform UK, a new party with no record in government, to an elite status which only serves to bolster rather than damage them? Reform UK love it. Whenever the prime minister goes out of his way to mock or ridicule them during PMQs, Farage and his MPs including Richard Tice and Lee Anderson slap their thighs in pantomime laughter, believing they are being paid a high compliment. At the weekend, Sir Keir said the fight with Reform is different. ""Most elections have always been Labour or Conservative,"" he said. ""This is a different election that we are facing.  We have not had a proposition like Reform in this country ever before. This is a different fight. It is a fight about who we are as a country, it goes to the soul of our future."" Some in Liverpool this week have likened this to Joe Biden's repeated refrain against Donald Trump in 2020 that they were locked in a ""battle for the soul of the nation"". However, some within Labour are unsure if the strategy of attacking Farage is the right approach. One backbench MP from the North East told me that those in Downing Street advising the PM ""don't get it"" - and don't represent ""white, working class council estates"" with voters that worry about immigration. ""They tend to be the frothy coffee drinking liberal lefties. They are speaking to the same people,"" they added. Others suggest that keeping Kemi Badenoch's Conservative party alive, or at least their share of the vote up, is needed to split the vote on the right. One senior minister said: ""The Tories being dead doesn't help us, it just pushes people to Reform. It's a bit like how at the last general election we needed the Lib Dems to do well, as they took seats off the Tories rather than us. ""But this is worse, because both Tory and Labour are voters shifting to Reform. In places from Barnsley to Bexley, we need the right vote to split, and then we need to squeeze Lib Dems and the Greens to come down the middle."" John Denham, a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the last Labour government, agrees. ""It makes no sense to me to elevate Reform to that position, even if you think the Tories are dead,"" he told me on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We have four years left of this government. The idea that the only thing we think we can offer in four years time is 'well, at least we're not Reform'... surely to God we can do something with the huge majority we've got and the time we've got to tell a convincing story that marginalizes Reform."" He suggested that there were a ""really very small"" group of people who might switch between Reform and Labour. The latest YouGov poll suggests just over half of Labour's 2024 voters are sticking with them. Some 12% have switched to Reform, and 4% to the Conservatives, while another 13% have gone to the Lib Dems, 12% to the Greens, and others have gone to the SNP and Plaid Cymru, suggesting losses to the left are far greater than to the right. 'We love it' However, Tom Lubbock, from pollsters JL Partners, thinks focussing on Reform UK is ""extremely smart politics"". ""If you look at Labour voters who are undecided at the moment, if you force that choice and say it's a choice between Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage, a lot of them who are undecided will come back into the Labour boat. ""And, you know, there's a lot of time to go before that next election, but it's actually very smart at the moment to make that the choice."" Previous party leaders and governments have faced this choice about how to deal with insurgent parties under Farage. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, made around 30 references to Farage in his conference speech last week. Simon Lewis, a former director of communications for Gordon Brown, said: ""The risk is that you are seen to be taking your opponent too seriously. ""Multiple references to his name probably gets people thinking, goodness, these guys are really scared about Reform. And I think you do have to be very careful."" Number 10 insiders defend the strategy, and insist the PM is adamant that the country is at a crossroads, and he thinks it is his responsibility to stand up to Farage. So what do Reform make of party leaders falling over themselves to namecheck them and their leader? ""It made us laugh,"" said Gawain Towler, a former press adviser to Farage. ""We love it. We absolutely love it! It's so preposterous.""

3d99c7fb1bf0,Reeves pre-emptively justifies tax rises,,"In Liverpool Rachel Reeves seemed to be floating a pre-emptive argument ahead of possible tax rises in her November Budget. The key line in the chancellor's speech in relation to the Budget was her linking of tough decisions ""in coming months"" to global headwinds and a critical reassessment of the long-term productivity performance of the UK economy, about to be delivered by the Office for Budget Responsibility. ""We will face further tests, with choices to come, made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage to the economy, which is becoming ever clearer,"" she said. This prepares the government's argument if there does need to be further tax rises, even significant ones at the Budget. Firstly, they will blame the broad global economic backdrop, of trade wars, actual wars and rising government interest rates. ""The world has changed,"" the chancellor told the Today programme. Secondly, the OBR's reassessment of the UK's long-term economic trends is revealing ""ever clearer"" evidence of ""long-term damage"" which she will blame on the record of her predecessors. The other notable call was for ""responsible management of public finances"" against opposition voices and those in her own party. Other than that, this was relatively light on policies. The policies that most of the country are the most interested in - what is in the Budget - have not been nailed down, and depend on the ping pong about to start with the OBR over its forecasting process. It is on that, where we did get new news today. The chancellor confirmed publicly that she agreed with the International Monetary Fund about changing the fiscal dance that has created non-stop speculation about tax changes. The OBR forecast by law has to happen twice a year, but that could now only happen in full once a year. There are various options. This is a tacit admission that after whatever emerges from the Budget, everyone would benefit from a period of stability, and that has not been the case over the past year. Elsewhere she repeated the idea that the election promises not to increase the main tax rates were still in place. When asked if VAT could rise, she said: ""The manifesto commitments stand."" This appears to connect the commitments to a state of the world that could change. As the Chief Secretary to the PM Darren Jones said: ""The manifesto commitments stand today."" Those manifesto commitments are clearly under pressure, if the OBR's calculations go against the Treasury. Her interpretation of how flexible they are was revealing. She wants to protect pay packets and ""not put up the prices in shops"". That would appear to rule out a straightforward rise in the rate of VAT, which would directly raise bills. There are many other options, depending on the size of the gap - to be revealed to her by the OBR this week - from scrapping some tax breaks and allowances, especially on housing and pensions, to extending the freeze on tax thresholds. The changes made by the OBR to the UK's underlying rate of growth could add considerably to the gap in the public finances Reeves has to bridge in the Budget. The draft details will be presented to her on Friday. It is then and only then that the real work of translating a series of tax proposals into a Budget starts in earnest. The government will also seek to persuade the OBR that its policy moves, from infrastructure plans, to closer ties with Europe, can help long-term growth. Today was about leaving some options open, at a tricky time. The extent of tax rises, and who gets hit, is still very much up for grabs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6x07j9e43o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b00d/live/35d04c80-9dcf-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-29T16:36:04.080000+00:00,49bd84822a5e22116dd9d6bf818121ae5ed450d3
60200561be67,Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?,,"Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business? Simon Jack Business editor WPA Pool/Getty Images One of the key audiences that the prime minister and the chancellor will have to convince at this year's Labour conference are the business leaders they targeted with a charm offensive before the election last July. The party trumpeted itself as ""the natural party of business"" and Rachel Reeves told anyone and everyone that this would be ""the most pro-business government this country has ever seen"". Labour had some big business beasts backing them. Billionaire mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell - a long-time Conservative supporter - switched his backing to Labour . Some 120 business leaders signed a letter which read: ""We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change. For too long now, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation, and a lack of long-term focus. ""Labour has shown it has changed and wants to work with business to achieve the UK's full economic potential."" But post-election, the party sent a different message - warning of tough choices and hard times ahead, and delivered a Budget to prove it. That Budget, says John Caudwell, with its £25bn rise in employers' National Insurance, undid a lot of the goodwill the chancellor had garnered. ""I think there was a desperate loss of faith from the business community in general from the last Budget,"" he says. ""I think people were shocked at the level of negative components for businesses."" On top of that NI rise, the National Living Wage was hiked by an inflation-busting 6.7%, with a rise of 16% for 18 to 20-year-olds. Mr Caudwell says he understands that Labour needed to raise money to shore up the public finances but felt it hit some sectors unduly hard. ""Even if you say they needed to be done, certain aspects were very unfair. So if you look at the increase in employers' NI, that really badly hit those businesses that employ tens of thousands of people on low wages, because they got hit by minimum wage and they got hit by the NI."" PA John Caudwell says businesses were shocked at ""the level of negative components"" they faced after the last Budget Other small business owners have also told the BBC they have lost confidence. Rachel Carrell is the boss of childcare firm Koru Kids and signed that letter in 2024. She says she hopes the government can restore business confidence over the rest of the parliament. ""I wouldn't sign that letter today but they've got three or four years to turn this around. That's a really long time."" She believes there's an opportunity to fix things in the upcoming Budget, but says ""they need to move quickly"". While anecdotal evidence of crumbling business confidence is not hard to find, official measures show a mixed picture. The Institute of Directors' confidence measure shows a steep fall after the last election, which compilers put down to immediate warnings issued by the government once in power that tough times and tough choices lay ahead. That was duly delivered on by the Budget and has hovered near those lows ever since. However, the government's favourite index to quote is the Lloyds Bank confidence survey, which shows confidence on the future is much more robust. Other measures, including the ICAEW and the S&P PMI measures, tend to support a more gloomy outlook. That in turn is supported by the number of businesses looking to recruit. Job vacancies have been on a downward trend since the Covid pandemic and there are 150,000 fewer staff on payrolls now than there were before the Budget bombshell, with a large part of those jobs going in hospitality. However, there is widespread hope among smaller businesses that the long-promised overhaul of business rates will come soon and in their favour. The government points understandably to the enormous amounts of money pledged recently when tech royalty from Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and others met real royalty at US President Donald Trump's recent state visit. John Caudwell welcomed it too. ""I hear a lot of negativity about government - we hear about rich people leaving and they are useful to the UK economy, but they're not as useful as the £150bn of inward investment that we've got coming into the country to create high-paid jobs in high-technological businesses. So we have to get a balanced view on that."" Mark Brearley runs a trolley and tray manufacturing and export business in Peckham, south London. He is less impressed with the razzamatazz surrounding the tech billionaires and their largesse. ""I'm sure it's very important to get these racy high-growth sectors to invest here. But what about the less exciting bits of the economy - the ones who are always here? We feel forgotten. ""I was hopeful that a new government would give us some help but all my costs have gone up - my business rates have doubled. I'm more cautious about investing in a new machine, a new product, hiring a new person."" The new Employment Rights Bill , which confers greater rights and protections on employees from day one, is also adding to employers' reluctance to take on new staff. Mark Brearley says small businesses like his feel forgotten The government has made much of its plans to sweep away impediments to economic growth and has seen that acknowledged by some of the biggest investors in UK infrastructure. Just months after Labour entered Downing Street, Scottish Power announced a £24bn UK investment. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: ""The government has taken on the planning bogeyman to unlock growth and get us building. That's why the UK is now Iberdrola's biggest investment destination globally."" Rain Newton-Smith, director general of the employers group the CBI, also gives the government high marks on the international stage. ""I think this government have navigated really difficult geopolitics. We've got a better deal with the US than others, we're forging a closer relationship with Europe and they got the deal with India. ""They've got a lot of work done internationally, and that does count. But they've really got to dial up delivery, and make sure that they they learn from the mistakes of last autumn."" Business confidence is a vital but fragile thing. It's a key ingredient for any government hoping that economic growth will pay for its other spending commitments - on heath, defence and welfare. Labour has a job on its hands at conference, and at the Budget, to restore the animal spirits of UK business.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0xyxnyz48o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7aa5/live/803f8e10-9af1-11f0-89b4-1b2d09c610c7.jpg,2025-09-29T06:29:26.809000+00:00,4012358ec77c35c2ca0ec06f7ff0a9cbde553a3f
f0865c91c474,How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job?,,"How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job? Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Sir Keir Starmer achieved what many sage minds in Westminster believed was impossible. Labour smashed itself to bits in 2019. But Sir Keir put the party back together and swept back to power with an epic majority five years later. Yet, turn on the radio or glance at the headlines and Labour appears to be flirting with the unthinkable – giving him his P45. In the last few days I've spoken to 30 people across government and the party -  ministers, MPs, advisers - to try to work out, as the prime minister makes his way to Labour's annual party conference in Liverpool, how much trouble is he really in? ""How many more data points do you need to see that he is just not very good at being prime minister?"" Unforgiving as that sounds, the Whitehall figure who posed that question is far from the only person who has seen Starmer's government up close to conclude that fundamentally, the prime minister is just not suited to many aspects of the job. For months polling has suggested the public feels the same. Sir Keir is an intelligent, incredibly diligent, serious-minded politician who has achieved extraordinary things. But time and again the same problems are raised, summed up brutally by another senior figure: ""His judgement on people has proven to be flawed, see endless staffing resets."" ""His judgement on policy is flawed, hence U-turns, and he can't communicate, and has been unpopular in the public's eyes for a long time."" Others point to a slow pace of decision making in Downing Street, suggesting the prime minister thinks ""too like a chairman, not a chief executive,"" says another insider. And ""he only gets to the right answer having exhausted all the other options,"" rather than moving fast using a gut political instinct. Another senior party figure says: ""He doesn't think like a leader."" Getty Images Everyone in the Labour party is fed up with months of shocking polls. But others are fed up of colleagues complaining about the boss, whether the small number who do so in public, or the much higher number who do so in private. ""It's like being England manager,"" one cabinet minister jokes. ""Everyone thinks they can do a better job."" You can hear the frustration in others' voices, highlighting the ""outstanding job"" Starmer has done on the world stage – wrangling President Donald Trump, or leading support for Ukraine. ""He hasn't put a foot wrong,"" when it comes to foreign policy, says a cabinet minister. Another praises the ""sensible changes"" the prime minister has just made to Downing Street, saying ""people now are now in jobs that will suit their abilities better"" after the reshuffle, and promising the public will soon see the benefit. There can be no hiding from a very messy few weeks, with the forced exits of Angela Rayner and Lord Mandelson , and the circus around the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham's not very hidden ambition. But there are other believers in what they see as Starmer's steady and relentless leadership, as one party source jokes: ""There were a couple of weeks where we couldn't get of bed without accidentally tearing our own arms off."" They predict ""that could all go away if we have a decent couple of months"". Perhaps. What even some of the prime minister's staunchest allies believe is that, he must explain more clearly, and vigorously, to the party - and to all of us - what the government is actually doing and why. Getty Images Sir Keir himself admitted as much in the summer, saying: ""We haven't always told our story as well as we should."" So in the next few days, and live on the programme tomorrow, expect the prime minister to try hard to make a clearer pitch to the country. After a horrible few weeks, aides say the prime minister is in a ""better place, clearer about the argument he wants to make"". Announcements like the Hillsborough Law, the returns deal with France, and yesterday's confirmation that ministers will go ahead with digital ID cards will convey, No 10 hopes, a sense of momentum. And you can expect him to build on the argument he's been making about patriotism in politics, trying to reclaim some of the territory Reform UK have been trying to grab. There are two problems though. Firstly, even Starmer's biggest fans in government know fluid communication is not his strong point. He doesn't see the camera, or the TV sofa as his friend. A strong defender of Starmer tells me: ""I wish he was better at telling a story, people don't understand how deeply he feels it and how passionate he is, but he personally isn't good at it."" Secondly, and according to one senior MP this is the bigger issue: ""We're just not clear about what we are doing or who we are for."" Another staffer tells me: ""There is no fire, no passion, no vision – we are timid and flat-footed."" Even if the prime minister suddenly developed the silky charm and persuasiveness of George Clooney, or the bombastic nature of Piers Morgan, the question becomes, what is the story he wants to tell? Multiple exits from the No 10 communications team tell you that working this out is not an easy task. Getty Images One source says: ""Until we know the story we are trying to tell we will get buffeted around."" Is reforming schools, hospitals or welfare at the top of the list?  Building houses or becoming a green ""superpower""? Or being at the forefront of technology, or protecting our borders, or growing the economy? Or is it now this priority of ""patriotic renewal""? If you have that many priorities, how can the public understand what you care about most? To govern is to choose after all, if you're not doing much choosing, are you doing much governing? One source suggested frankly, even for those who work closely alongside him, it's often hard to work out what the prime minister thinks, telling me: ""He often appears unknowable."" ""He compartmentalises his life - personal, professional, and political - in a way that works for him, but leaves colleagues unsure of his true views."" In a sense it seems extraordinary that the leader of a political party can leave colleagues unsure of their views, after 14 months in office, and four years as leader in opposition. But his early years in charge were dominated by internal fights for control of the party, and over antisemitism, not over ideas. One source recalls: ""We had lots of fights to win in opposition, but they were never, ever about what the parties' priorities should be."" Getty Images The prime minister has a huge chance in the next few days to spell out to his party, and to the public, exactly where he stands, and exactly what he believes in specific terms. After a horrible summer, and a very tricky year, it is desperately needed if the party is to get back on track. ""There is a way through this, but he has to assert himself,"" says one cabinet minister, desperate for the prime minister to remind his party and the country why they elected him in the first place. Ministers and Downing Street are frustrated by chatter about Starmer's leadership, especially the behaviour of Andy Burnahm in recent days. ""Everyone needs to just shut up and get on with their own jobs,"" one government source says. Another says: ""the Burnham stuff is just ridiculous."" ""He doesn't have a seat in Parliament, wouldn't necessarily find or win one,"" and one minister snipes, ""any chance to have a dig – Burnham will never miss an opportunity"". They predict confidently, the party ""doesn't want regicide or disruption, they just want us to do well"". But leadership chatter is a symbol that all is not well. And that sense of assurance is far from universal. One senior figure outside government warns me, ""they don't realise they are in serious, serious trouble – this is literally a head-in-hands-moment"". There are real discussions in different pockets of the Labour movement about whether Starmer should still lead the party. And the sweaty bars and fringe meetings of the party conference provide the perfect backdrop for those out to make trouble. Yet it's clear from multiple conversations that it's not only mischief makers who are pondering what to do. ""Frustration is wide and deep,"" says a senior MP. One insider who has been part of conversations about the chances of changing the leader says, ""it's not flighty people, not just newbies without a clue, they're not idiots"". Even on the government payroll one minister worries, ""the country is desperate for a disrupter, and it's just not who he is,"" questioning whether Starmer can be the right man for this political moment. Here's the fundamental question, asked by many, expressed by one senior figure: ""Do we think Keir can improve? People don't think he can, although they wish he would. But there is a sinking feeling."" Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Some MPs are even pointing to the example of the Democrats' failure to tell former President Joe Biden to go , which left the party no time to build up another candidate. The source continues we ""dread and fear being the people who didn't do what was necessary to stop the country electing Farage"". Others would baulk at that comparison. The prime minister has only had just over a year in charge. The problems Labour inherited on taking office were profound. Centre left political parties in many countries are grappling with how to deal with demographics, immigration, an era where public money is very tight. There are more than three years until the next general election. There is time to start wrestling with all of that. The electorate has shown politicians they can move in droves, and fast. So many ministers plead for patience. One wishes his colleagues would not just ""get a grip"", but remember they were all elected on a promise to stop political chaos. ""Anyone who thinks the challenging world is rectified by a change in leader, I don't understand the rationale. When we look at how unstable things are, and talk about leadership, how would the bond markets respond, when our primary responsibility is stabilising the economy?"" Another source dismisses those predicting doom in the party, ""nothing is irrevocable, and nothing is inevitable"". Perhaps the rebooted No 10 will start getting better results. Perhaps, and No 10 fervently hopes, Sir Keir will wow the crowds at conference, and display why he earned the job to start with, and won the election in the first place. The prime minister's position is also, frankly,  protected by the fact there is no consensus about who could do a better job than him. Even if Labour were to conclude universally, which it is far from doing, that Starmer's leadership is somehow beyond repair, that reality is a smack in the face for those who'd seek a change. As one Whitehall figure suggests: ""problem one, is he good at being PM? No. But next problem, do you have an upgrade? Hmm..."" Labour's answer to that question right now, notwithstanding Andy Burnham's antics, is, ""well, we're not sure"". AFP via Getty Images A lack of clarity over who would be next, and fresh memories of the political shambles of the Conservatives' change of leader, both put the brakes on anyone seeking to make a change any time soon. As ever in politics two things that might appear to be contradictory are in fact, both true. Is it mad on paper for Labour to be even vaguely contemplating changing their leader so soon, without an obvious strong successor, when they ran on a promise of no drama? For many, yes, it's crackers. But is the discussion about whether the PM can carry on like this just idle chit-chat? Not at all. One senior figure sums up the situation with no pleasure – discussion about changing the Labour leader ""is both lunatic, and real"". The leadership's hope is that a strong conference without too many noises off, and an effective speech from the platform by the prime minister himself might calm everything down. A political get together, a party conference for the politicians, members, and associated hangers-on, would never transform a prime minister's fortunes with the public overnight. But it can make a big difference to how a party feels about itself. For Starmer to have a chance of restoring his position with the public he must first, once again, persuade his party that he is the man for the job. But without restoring his party's faith in him, convincing Labour of his merits, his own position could well be at risk. One insider who knows the prime minister well suggested: ""He is not a natural explainer… he states positions but doesn't repeatedly argue for them. ""This has led to an aversion to debate, treating persuasion as weakness."" Yet politics is, above all else,  the art of persuasion. That is perhaps the dilemma for Labour. That is the problem for him.

0f4766085b7c,What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform?,,"What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform? Iain Watson Political correspondent BBC ""The country is at a crossroads,"" Sir Keir Starmer is expected to declare in a speech just ahead of the annual Labour conference, which kicks off this weekend. The prime minister will suggest there are two paths to choose: one is the way of ""division and decline"" with Reform UK, or Labour's route – unity and progress. For some in Labour's ranks, the leadership's response, so far, to the rise of Reform has gone down like a lead balloon. Not nimble enough, not impassioned, is the message. With Labour lagging in the polls, expect to hear the anti-Reform rhetoric ramped up - but exactly how to burst the populist bubble has proved challenging. The response to Reform leader Nigel Farage's proposal this week to end existing migrants' Indefinite Leave to Remain suggested that Labour hadn't quite settled on the most effective line of attack. Chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned Reform's alleged cost-savings and denounced the policy as a gimmick; Labour Party chair Anna Turley highlighted unanswered questions but also raised the prospect of families being broken up; the MP Sarah Owen also mentioned family break-up but added that this was ""morally abhorrent"". None of these responses were mutually exclusive but they differed in tone, and perhaps point to a tension between denouncing Reform as not serious - or as all too serious. Just a year ago, the Conservatives were Labour's principal opponents. The government now has to grapple with an insurgent party with no track record in office and which is eroding Labour's, not just the Conservatives', vote. And it's not a problem that's unique to the UK. Reuters Sir Keir Starmer will be eyeing the lessons from Australia, after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won a second term There is concern amongst centre-left parties internationally that a rejuvenated right is doing well at the ballot box and seemingly winning the battle of ideas. So how do they fight back? The think-tank, the IPPR; the Center for American Progress and the pro-leadership Labour Together organisation have brought together an array of progressive leaders to share their electoral lessons at a major conference in London on Friday. Their big tent encompasses not just international socialist and social democratic parties but also Greens, Liberals - and even some former Conservatives. Labour strategists are looking enviously at their Australian counterparts who won a second term in May. Anthony Albanese's government tackled the immigration issue - in which they had felt vulnerable - soon after taking power and tightened rules on student and temporary visas. They were able to demonstrate a steady reduction in net migration before polling day and made the political case for continuing to bring in skilled labour - defeating an opponent who called for bigger reductions. But there won't be a single template for Labour to follow. The Spanish Socialist PM Pedro Sanchez's approach is to not to bang on about immigration but when necessary to defend it as a contributor to a growing economy, while the Danish Social Democrat PM Mette Federikson has been taking a hard line on asylum. There is nonetheless a shared recognition that a defence of the status quo is no longer sustainable. The IPPR's Harry Quilter-Pinner says it would be a mistake to follow ""the playbook of the right"". He tells me: ""The populist right's story is one of extraction – of just taking. Progressives should reject this - it stokes divisions."" He suggests when it comes to economic migration there needs to be an assessment of whether - and how quickly -  a UK citizen could be trained to do a job. He believes more of a fuss should be made of becoming British citizen, and there needs to be an expectation of what new citizens would contribute. Claire Ainsley, who was Sir Keir Starmer's policy chief when he was in opposition, is now overseeing a project on centre-left renewal at the Progressive Policy Institute, and her advice is to grow the ""seeds of doubt"" about Reform in the electorate's minds in the three years between now and the election. She believes that while people are happy to cast a protest vote, they currently question whether Reform are really a government in waiting - so challenging them on whether their policies hold together, or whether their numbers add up, is a way of undermining their support. But it does also mean doing more to tackle the core issue. She says the party leadership realised ""the previous set of answers on immigration were not going to wash with the British public that want to see action"", and says she was encouraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's promise that ""nothing is off the table"" in tackling illegal migration. But tackling Reform isn't just about immigration. Ms Ainsley says it's about people feeling worse off and not feeling they have got a fair deal on the economy,  and a sense that other people are getting treated better than them. The current buzzword around government is ""contribution"" - convincing people that they will be beneficiaries and not just contributors to a welfare state. This is likely to be developed further in the main Labour conference speeches in Liverpool next week. Previewing that, Labour Together published a report this week. In it, chief policy officer Morgan Wild argues that over the past decades, the link between what people put in and what they get out has all but disappeared. He says: ""It is hard to explain to people why their council tax is going up while their waste service is being cut. It is hard to explain to the public why asylum seekers are being placed in hotels for years on end at the taxpayers' expense....the best way to restore trust is through the contributory principle. If you pay in, you should be able to see what you get out."" Labour MP Clive Lewis, on the party's left, doesn't underestimate the scale of the challenge. One of his school friends took part in the recent Unite the Kingdom march in central London . Lewis hadn't thought he'd be part of it – he had black family members and is, says Lewis, ""a great guy"" - but his friend had texted to say he felt he was being listened to. Lewis says he has seen a ""vehemence and anger"" amongst a section of the electorate who feel let down - and for Keir Starmer to be believed when he calls out Farage, he needs to be trusted. He says he believes seeing off Farage is a much bigger task than making a speech, and the prime minister has to do nothing less than change the political culture in the government and in the country. Adam Langleben of the Progressive Britain think tank also believes progressive parties need to be more ""humble"" – whether in victory or defeat. ""We have an avoidable habit of not listening enough to the electorate,"" he says. Tackling a pessimistic public mood also requires more than policies. The prime minister is a political leader who appears to know the value of symbols. Soon after winning his party's leadership in 2020, he branded Labour literature with the union flag, which was also never far from the backdrop of his TV news clips. Initially it was to help define him against his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The message was: Sir Keir would be unambiguously pro-Nato, pro nuclear deterrent, pro strong defence - proud of the flag. Safe to vote for. But those who converged in central London on the Unite the Kingdom march to hear Tommy Robinson weren't exactly waving their flags to symbolise support for Labour. It has again become a contested symbol. The prime minister is expected to say he wants to reclaim the flag. It's a problem that previous Labour leaders have grappled with - and the current one can perhaps learn from. When Neil Kinnock was the Labour opposition leader in the 1980s, he did not want to cede the mantle of patriotism to the Conservatives, so he sought to define patriotism in line with his own beliefs, and he placed the union jack (and the flags of the UK's constituent nations) on party literature to reclaim it, he said, from the far-right party, the BNP. In the 2000s, the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown sought to claim 'Britishness' for themselves. But Keir Starmer faces a tougher political landscape now. According to recent polling from pollster Lord Ashcroft , the public can't agree on why union and English flags have been appearing on lampposts, and whether or not this is a good thing. Labour, Lib Dem and Green voters tend to think they signal hostility to immigrants; while right of centre voters believe they are signs of frustration with immigration. Overall, 39% of respondents supported the appearance of the flags while 28% disapproved - but about a quarter of voters surveyed had mixed feelings. Despite obvious divisions, Adam Langleben believes it is possible to create a ""progressive patriotism"", taking a leaf from the maiden speech of the murdered MP Jo Cox , which celebrated diversity but recognised that ""we have far more in common than that which divides us"". Reform UK have been clear what they are against.

The department said ""officials are working at pace with [the minister] to determine how we will move forward with a War Memorial"". The trust took this as welcome confirmation that the new Labour government did intend to honour the previous government's commitment to make a grant available to help fund a Muslim war memorial, even if it was not confirmation the memorial would definitely go ahead. Over the following months Sir William continued to press for a decision and whether the Â£1m was still available. In November 2024, the department said that it remained ""committed to providing funding of up to Â£1m"", and officials were working on taking the matter forward. The following month, an exercise to gather information about suppliers was launched, which the trust responded to. But by May this year, nothing had happened. Sir William emailed again to ask about progress, but the response again was that no decision had yet been made. Sir William now says: ""Silence reigns."" ""The issue is not that the government is obliged to support the trust's memorial,"" Sir William says. ""It is when we can expect a decision whether it will provide any financial support and, if so, how much and on what terms. On that hangs how we approach others to give to the project.""

93bec1d5998d,Burnham's provocative challenge to Starmer shows he is serious,,"Location: party conference. A fairly new prime minister is struggling for popularity with his party and the country at large, against a backdrop of grim economic choices. A popular, plain-speaking mayor enters the week talked up as a future leader  — and is doing little to dampen that speculation himself. The year is 2012, the prime minister is David Cameron and the mayor is Boris Johnson. But it could just as well be 2025, Sir Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham. Sometimes politicians of all parties flirt with the possibility of one day becoming leader in suggestive, coy, almost deniable ways. This is not an example of that. Burnham is being more overt. To the Telegraph, the Greater Manchester mayor gave a straight answer to a straight question: yes, he had been contacted by Labour MPs ""throughout the summer"" about the prospect of him returning to Westminster, where he was an MP for 16 years, to lead Labour and replace Starmer as prime minister. Burnham said this was ""more a decision for those people than it is for me"". He repeated that line in an interview with BBC Manchester. Well, up to a point. Burnham is not an MP. He would have to decide to become one if he wants to be Labour leader and prime minister. Labour's rule book dictates that the party leader must be an MP, so when the party is in government that means the prime minister must also be an MP, meaning they have to be elected to Parliament rather than made a member of the Lords. This means that his path to Downing Street is extremely complicated. First, a Labour MP would need to resign their seat so there is a by-election - unless a contest happened to arise through an MP dying or similar. Because of Burnham's distinctive regional pitch, the constituency would surely have to be in Greater Manchester or at least the north-west of England. Two Manchester Labour MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, have already ruled out standing down for Burnham. Then, Burnham would have to be selected as Labour's candidate. This would require the approval of Labour's national executive committee, which for most purposes is controlled by allies of Starmer, although at least some of those would probably support Burnham's return to Westminster. Then, he would have to win the by-election in a difficult national political environment for the Labour Party. And then, finally, Burnham would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer  - at which point presumably other candidates would enter the fray. There are a lot of difficulties along that path. Still, it is clearly a path that he is willing, at the very least, to publicly entertain. The mere existence of the Telegraph interview, alongside a long profile in the New Statesman, the bible of left-liberals, is pretty provocative. Burnham knew that he would be asked questions about his national ambitions, and that they would create a stir in the days before a crucial party conference for Starmer. Perhaps most notable, though, is that Burnham used both interviews to spell out a policy prospectus: higher council tax on expensive homes, borrowing to invest in council housing, cutting income tax for lower earners and increasing it for higher earners. In the New Statesman, he said: ""We've got to get beyond this thing of being in hock to the bond markets"". That is a direct challenge not just to Starmer but to Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her view  - her supporters and plenty of experts would say the economic reality  - that the government cannot borrow much more money. It is an argument that quite a few Labour MPs make, mostly in private: that this government has allowed itself to become too constrained by Treasury orthodoxy. To have Burnham joining that argument publicly, whether his leadership challenge is plausible or not, is unwelcome for Starmer and Reeves. In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now. One senior source said he was: ""A Boris-sized ego, but without the strategic thought."" Speaking from the main stage of Conservative conference back in 2012 (an honour not being afforded to Burnham at Labour's conference next week), Boris Johnson ended up rallying the members behind David Cameron. It took him seven years to get to No 10. It's hard to see the Starmer and Burnham story taking quite so long to play out, whatever the ultimate conclusion.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx275r1l3xpo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/da0e/live/172696c0-99e9-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg,2025-09-25T09:50:48.015000+00:00,238925805f5ba54834c3088b16ab6682e44c54db
f12bce52aabf,How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock?,,"How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock? Dharshini David Deputy economics editor and Raphael Sheridan Economics reporter BBC Glenys is concerned about people whose only income is the basic state pension At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80. Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April , will add a spring to those dancers' steps. Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension. ""I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,"" she says. Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. ""My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea."" Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability. The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer. Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April. The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched. It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable. That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans. ""You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,"" she says. ""If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference."" The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population. Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned. Linda worries about having to pay tax on her state pension in the future Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits. As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones. The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a ""messy tool"". So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue ""infinitely"", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases. The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and the row over the winter fuel payment , underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters. That is not just the case with current retirees. Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form. Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can. There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending. No-one said getting older was easy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c07a/live/b2ce65e0-92cc-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg,2025-09-16T09:04:55.401000+00:00,86c0560311218126e96b2d16bd5d6c033b347fab
777652698006,The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney,,"The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney Glenn Campbell Scotland political editor The White House John Swinney lobbied Donald Trump at a meeting in the White House John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship. On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president. Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK. In early March, Swinney said it was ""unthinkable"" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question. Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to ""ethnic cleansing"". But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet. Why has John Swinney's approach changed? The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott. Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff. Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited. So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach? That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque. ""We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,"" he said. He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky. Scottish government Swinney is arguing for a reduction or removal of US import tariffs on whisky This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy. That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions. That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states. UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky. But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action? Reuters Trump opened his new golf course in Aberdeenshire during his visit to Scotland Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind. The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March. I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day. He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word. This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office. Building a new relationship It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were ""thank you"". Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words. A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney ""nasty"" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign. It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built. It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections. He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again. Reuters Keir Starmer had dinner with Donald Trump during his visit to Scotland this summer There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government. However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known. That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire. Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a ""terrific guy"". It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry. He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda. Scottish government Swinney had a 50-minute conversation with Trump on his visit to Washington Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president. He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America. But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky. The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House. He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world. None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office. This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down. Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential ""win-win"" business deal to Donald Trump. The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky. A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK. Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too. If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up. If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an ""absolute blinder"". One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was ""smart politics"". PA Media Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said whisky was very high up the UK's list of priorities What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge. They enabled him to run rings round them. The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days. Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson. Eventually, the new Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander took to the airwaves to insist that the UK government had been ""thinking, working, talking and negotiating about whisky for many weeks and months"". He argued that whisky was ""very high"" up the list of priorities for the UK as it seeks further trade concessions from the US and warned Swinney against ""playing politics"". There is no certainty that whisky will get a special deal or that any announcement will come during Trump's state visit - but the industry has sensed in recent weeks that a better deal for them could be ""deliverable"". They would raise a glass to that if it happens and leave the politicians to squabble over who fought Scotch's corner the hardest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cb2b/live/071a8960-92de-11f0-950e-eb051178bae0.jpg,2025-09-17T06:07:24.876000+00:00,f677f380a7d8d4e0650cff237db5d2ee5a2cc0e5
f1fbeaddf06c,Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't,,"Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't Sarah Smith North America editor in Scotland Getty Images A list of Donald Trump's favourite things would be very unlikely to include raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens (as Julie Andrews famously sang in The Sound of Music). Instead, the president's list would surely have on it playing golf, a way to brazenly promote his commercial interests and, thirdly, trade deals that generate billions of dollars for the United States. No wonder he looks so pleased with himself - his working holiday in Scotland has delivered on all three of these passions. On what was billed as a ""private visit"" he got a lot of work done. He is taking home with him a trade deal with the EU which is not only the largest in history, it is also extremely favourable to the US. The EU will spend hundreds of billions of dollars buying American energy and military equipment as well as investing billions more in the US economy. In return European goods will be subject to a 15% tariff when they are exported to the US rather than the 30% Trump had threatened. The deal is an important achievement for Trump to be able to boast about, even if he has failed to conclude the ""90 deals in 90 days"" he had promised. He also seemed to relish hosting Sir Keir and Lady Starmer at his Turnberry golf resort on Monday. It was a peculiar spectacle, the British prime minister being welcomed as guest in his own country. But the PM was prepared to overlook the protocol when he was being treated to an unusual and valuable amount of face time with the US president. Trump is, after all, a man whose foreign policy is abnormally influenced by his personal relations with other world leaders. Their talks were dominated by the crisis in Gaza. Starmer appeared to make some headway as he pressed Trump to use his influence to get more food into the Palestinian territory. Getty Images Starmer and wife Victoria were hosted by Trump at Turnberry Trump said afterwards that the US would work with the UK and other European partners to set up food centres, adding that he will tell Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure that food gets to people who need it. ""I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food."" He also seemed to give the green light to Starmer to officially recognise the state of Palestine even though that is not something the US will do. ""I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him taking a position,"" he said. Trump also made a significant change to his position on the conflict in Ukraine. He revealed that he is now giving Russian President Vladimir Putin only 10-12 days to agree to a ceasefire, not the 50 days he had previously given him. ""There's is no reason in waiting… I want to be generous but we just don't see any progress being made."" All of these major announcements were made during an exceptionally long, wide-ranging and free-wheeling press conference, during which the US president appeared extremely relaxed. He was prepared to talk at length about anything from wind power to immigration, including his views on King Charles and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Watch: Trump says he turned down an invitation to Epstein's island There was one issue he could not escape, much as he perhaps wanted to. He was inevitably asked about Jeffrey Epstein, as the long running controversy about why he is refusing to release all the files held by the US government on the deceased sex offender followed him across the Atlantic. A van displaying an old photograph of Trump at a party with Epstein was driving around Aberdeenshire to make sure the president could not escape the furore. He told us for the first time why he fell out with the disgraced financier many years ago, saying that Epstein had poached staff from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and he refused to talk to him after that. And he denied ever having sent a lewd drawing to Epstein (as reported by the Wall St Journal), claiming that he only ever draws very basic pictures of buildings. The intrusion of the Epstein scandal into Trump's Scottish trip was a reminder of what inevitably awaits him on his return to Washington but it did not seem to dent his buoyant mood. A few anti-Trump protests were staged. But they were largely kept away from the president himself and were remarkably muted compared with previous visits. The most determined demonstrators were Trump fans who turned out to greet him as he landed in Prestwick and at both golf resorts, holding large signs welcoming him to Scotland. The president also took every opportunity to use this trip to proudly promote his two Scottish golf resorts. He hosted the press conferences with Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU's executive, in the newly renovated ballroom at Turnberry, boasting of the opulent new ceiling and brand new windows at the same time as discussing famine in Gaza. Getty Images Starmer and Trump arrive by helicopter at Trump MacLeod House Arriving in Aberdeenshire with Starmer on board his Marine One helicopter, he took a couple of laps to show off the new golf course before landing. After talks with John Swinney on Tuesday morning, he had the Scottish first minister attend the official opening of the Trump International Golf Links in the village of Balmedie, along with several VIPs and a phalanx of TV cameras. It is exceptionally unusual for a US president to so nakedly use his office to promote his own commercial interests but it is something Donald Trump clearly revels in doing. Almost as much as he enjoys playing golf. Which he managed to do on almost every day of this trip.

8ee7f100cb83,Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage,,"Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage Chris Mason Political editor Starmer questions if Reform wants to serve ""our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country"" Sir Keir Starmer was last year's big winner at the general election. This year saw the prime minister sharpening his argument against Nigel Farage and - by extension - against those within his own party, from the cabinet down, who fret he's not the best frontman for the fight that beckons with Reform UK. There is a defiance and steeliness to the prime minister; with this performance, he reminded his internal critics just who it was who won that whopping majority in the election 15 months ago. The year gone by has been a relentless grind – not least the last few weeks, after losing the former deputy PM Angela Rayner and US ambassador Peter Mandelson - and in his speech, the prime minister wanted to remind the audience of the achievements of the past months. His critics within the Labour party remind him, relentlessly, that Labour's politics must be politically more aggressive, front-footed and pointed in order to defeat a communicator of Nigel Farage's ability. This speech was the prime minister's response. It taught us little new about Sir Keir's political creed, but persistently painted the dividing line he wants: Reform versus everyone else. And he says he's the figurehead for that fightback. Farage has claimed his migration policy being labelled ""racist"" by the prime minister had put his staff at risk; it left him ""more determined than ever"", he said. Was Sir Keir Starmer's speech up to the challenge? Is this the point where the pace quickens? The prime minister is now approaching a bleak-looking Budget and a grim set of local elections, and elections in Wales and Scotland, next May. And even his most loyal allies accept those elections could determine if he's still delivering a conference speech to the assembled party as prime minister this time next year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw1jwdlz7lo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f98/live/049f4ce0-9e26-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-30T17:52:33.029000+00:00,0c0d7501f6218fa32b8356e644d663a4634db3f8
caad761735e3,Labour grapples with threat from Reform UK at party conference,,"It is just 14 months since the general election. Not yet 500 days. Labour has a working majority of 161. But here on the banks of the Mersey, it really doesn't feel like that. I am reminded of Conservative conferences of old, where a circus would accompany Boris Johnson from the railway station to each and every event he attended, in the years when it was transparently clear he was rather keen on becoming prime minister. Swop a former mayor of London and subsequent prime minister for the current mayor of Greater Manchester and aspiring prime minister Andy Burnham, and you have a sense of the vibe here. There is no shortage of acidic views about what is seen as the rather thrusting nature of Burnham's ambition, or near hagiographic accounts of his governance of Greater Manchester as its mayor – with the clear implication he should stay there. But there is one big reason why all this is happening, so early in this parliament: it is symptomatic of a party wrestling publicly and privately with how it confronts Reform UK. There is broad and deep reflection from plenty here – from the cabinet to councillors – that the pitch right now from Labour to the country isn't good enough. This is why we are seeing a sharpening in the language and the policies being presented now. No fewer than 10 cabinet ministers are addressing this conference from the main stage on Monday. The centrepiece address will be from Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who will argue that Reform presents a threat to the British economy with the potential, she will argue, for more borrowing and rising barriers to international trade. But perhaps more striking is the speech from the new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. She has been dubbed 'the Terminator' by the tabloids. She gives every impression she might regard that nickname as a bit wishy-washy, a bit namby-pamby. ""You won't always like what I'll do,"" she will say, addressing Labour activists in front of her directly. In other words, her instincts and approach in the Home Office might make some within the party squeamish. But she sees it as absolutely essential – and the clue is in the candid observations she has already shared here at an event on the conference fringe. ""We can reclaim the mantle that was once ours and can be again: we will be the party of the working class,"" she said – an acknowledgement that, right now at least, they are not. It is a reflection, in a sentence, of how this party perceives its predicament and what it is trying to do about it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr701vn0rjmo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/42a2/live/42a6d600-9d06-11f0-a8fe-677b0b0b2d56.jpg,2025-09-29T08:06:22.261000+00:00,9ca067e52da09bc744ea75a5b6b3e22cac66b74d
9e3ec1b479d7,Chris Mason: Starmer unflinching as he seeks to take on Reform,,"Chris Mason: Starmer unflinching as he seeks to take on Reform Chris Mason Political editor EPA First week by week, and now day by day, the prime minister is stepping up the way he describes the political battle between Labour and Reform UK. Sir Keir Starmer tells the Guardian this weekend: ""History will not forgive us if we do not use every ounce of our energy to fight Reform. There is an enemy. There is a project which is detrimental to our country. It actually goes against the grain of our history. It's right there in plain sight in front of us. We have to win this battle."" Expect more in the coming days at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool, including in the prime minister's speech on Tuesday. He heads to the north west of England after a day in the company of fellow left-wing leaders at a conference in London. I was standing at the back of Methodist Central Hall in Westminster listening to a quartet of prime ministers. Sir Keir was joined by his opposite numbers from Canada, Australia and Iceland. And here's the thing: while they are all winners, they had the demeanour of those with pensive worry. The rise of Reform here in the UK is far from unique. There was a confessional vibe at times to the conversation, borne of a fear the left can exude a piety and loftiness off-putting to many. Sir Keir's take on this was that Labour took far too long to recognise the deep-seated concerns from many about illegal immigration. It was an observation some within Labour are weary of hearing about again, recalling the fuss a decade ago when Labour had mugs printed with the promise of ""controls on immigration"". Others say Labour cannot highlight its instinct to be tough too much, given the instinct of many, fairly or otherwise, is to assume they might be the opposite. Amid the noise of this debate comes the plan for digital ID . After two decades of rapid digitalisation, from the smartphone's invention to its near ubiquity, the prime minister reckons the centre of gravity around the whole issue of state-mandated ID - and our collective willingness to embrace it - has shifted. Twenty years ago, Tony Blair was making the case for ID cards. The ""card"" bit of the idea feels rather vintage, but the ID bit is back as an idea. It is an idea still lacking in key detail, but one Sir Keir wants to enthusiastically embrace. He told me a few weeks ago, as he began to publicly toy with it, that plenty of us are now much more used to handing bits of personal data to all sorts of institutions and companies we deal with online. So, the logic goes, plenty will be comfortable doing the same thing with the government. Let's see. What is undoubtedly the case is that there is, again, noisy opposition to the idea. A petition on Parliament's website has reached well over a million signatures. Only a handful have cleared that threshold in the last decade. The prime minister will hope a quieter majority are won over by the idea – and he already has his political dividing line with Reform. And with the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, as it happens. His challenge, against the toughest of backdrops - economic, political and international - is to prove he can deliver incremental, or better, improvements for voters, and convince enough that the embrace of Reform would be a big mistake. Sir Keir is now unflinching and explicit, talking of what he calls the ""open fight"" he wants with Reform - a ""battle for the soul of this country"". On that characterisation of the tussle ahead, at least, Reform agree that is precisely what it amounts to.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg41lljnryo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a899/live/280e58d0-9b3b-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-27T00:23:17.959000+00:00,af0e940484d184320161b29f3224351402019d5d
95cf05fdea01,Chris Mason: Starmer's irritation with Burnham shows as he seeks to tackle critics,,"Chris Mason: Starmer's irritation with Burnham shows as he seeks to tackle critics Chris Mason Political editor Getty Images The prime minister will address a conference of centre-left leaders from around the world on Friday and argue it is time to ""look ourselves in the mirror and recognise where we've allowed our parties to shy away from people's concerns."" A key theme of the Global Progressive Action Conference is about how the Labour Party and its sister outfits around the world take on Reform UK and their equivalents. ""This is the defining political choice of our times: a politics of predatory grievance, preying on the problems of working people… against the politics of patriotic renewal,"" Sir Keir Starmer will claim. And it is this challenge that unites the two big things in politics in the last 48 hours. First there was the blizzard of headlines about the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. Then, conveniently timed, the blizzard of headlines yesterday afternoon about the government's plans for compulsory digital ID. This, yes, is the daily din of Westminster, but there is a signal amid the noise. Personnel, policy and ambitions are all in the mix here, three of the staples of politics, but they are also both a symptom of the same thing: a party and a movement wrestling with how to confront what senior figures agree is a generational challenge – the rise of Reform UK. This, for so many Labour folk, is not merely the traditional political tussle with the party's oldest adversary, the Conservatives. Instead, it is an insurgency which utterly horrifies so many of them. It is Reform's recent rise - and the durability of its support, up to now at least - that has fast forwarded the collywobbles in a vast parliamentary Labour Party so soon after a general election. Of all the criticisms of Sir Keir, there is one that has stuck, almost to the point of cliche, and is acknowledged as being fair within government and beyond. It is the persistent critique that there has long been a lack of definition about the government's direction. And it is into this perceived vacuum that Andy Burnham has stridden, again, to the intense irritation of Downing Street and plenty of Labour MPs. I know what Labour should stand for and I'd know how I'd communicate it is the underlying message from Manchester, with the implication the prime minister isn't doing either. Sir Keir may not strike you as the kind of bloke to be frequently demonstrably angry or irritated. But when a Labour prime minister compares a Labour colleague to former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss , you know just how narked he is by the whole thing. The prime minister and those around him have long privately rolled their eyes at Burnham's antics. But when Sir Keir invokes the memory of a prime minister associated with economic calamity and near immediate political oblivion – and, on top of that, suggests his economic prospectus could lead to the same outcomes – you know he isn't messing about. Watch: Andy Burnham on leadership speculation Incidentally, the scale of the backlash from Labour MPs to Burnham's interviews was quite the thing to witness. Burnham has his supporters in the Parliamentary Labour Party, but boy, plenty told us he should just shut up . And amid all this comes the crucial new detail about a plan the prime minister has talked up enthusiastically in recent weeks – digital ID. The new key point – it will be compulsory. Sir Keir will talk about the idea in his speech at a gathering also attended by Anthony Albanese, the prime minister of Australia, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. He hopes it is a practical example of how he can give definition to his premiership, have what he hopes is a useful tool in tackling illegal working and therefore illegal immigration, and give himself a useful political dividing line with his opponents. Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party are opposed to the plan. The Conservative position is more ambiguous. They see it for now at least as a ""desperate gimmick"" but do remain open to being persuaded it is a good idea. Is it something he can lean into as a defining idea of his time in office and help him address the predicament he and his party find themselves in? He has to hope so.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly19zld70qo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8b01/live/3c600720-9a9b-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-26T05:36:16.399000+00:00,bd7c96f2347046f531ead32242171d296b037dab
573409afe4c8,Chris Mason: Punchy Lib Dems use Reform UK as call to action,,"Chris Mason: Punchy Lib Dems use Reform UK as call to action Chris Mason Political editor PA Media Sir Ed Davey's speech to close the Liberal Democrat conference was punchy. Here was a leader knowingly painting in primary colours and determined to be heard in our noisy politics. This was a gathering of a party willing to double down on being more aggressive in making its arguments - in particular, its focus on the Reform leader Nigel Farage. By my count there were at least 30 references to Farage – far, far more than to the prime minister or the Conservatives. Senior Liberal Democrats spot an opportunity right now: a willingness to take on Reform and Donald Trump in a way Labour and the Tories either can't or won't. And the party is using the Reform leader as a funding and recruiting sergeant. They hope the prospect of a Farage premiership will motivate their activists, in efforts and donations, in a way a prospective Labour or Conservative victory might not do. But the Lib Dems realise too that Reform's rise has a cost when it comes to a squeeze on the attention paid to Sir Ed Davey and his team, hence their noisy protests and allegations - repeated again by Sir Ed in his speech - about the relative coverage and scrutiny different parties receive from the BBC and others. The corporation, incidentally, said ""these continuing attacks on BBC journalism are completely groundless – it is simply false to say that we give any political party any less scrutiny than any other"". The Lib Dems also didn't remove a reference to the prospect of the UK's gun laws changing under a Reform government, despite Reform making it clear before the speech was delivered, but after the script had been shared with reporters, that they had no intention of changing the law. When I asked if it was irresponsible or scaremongering to suggest schools might have to ""teach our children what to do in case of a mass shooting,"" they argued it is about holding Nigel Farage to account for remarks he made 11 years ago. Reform accused him of ""spouting total madness"". I'd say the mood of the Liberal Democrats felt chipper, but business-like. This time last year, just after a stonkingly good general election result for them, their conference felt like a non-stop party. Not so now. The political landscape has changed and changed quickly. Ed Davey's pitch The Lib Dems are far from the only ones seeking to adjust and adjust quickly. Part of their strategy is to extend their appeal towards recent Conservative voters unattracted by both Reform and Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Tories. Sir Ed Davey's pitch was both direct - ""my message to you is this: come and talk to us"" - and also packaged in the language of a former Conservative prime minister. The Lib Dem leader talked of ""male voice choirs and Hogmanay, county shows and school fairs, fish and chips, village greens and cricket pavilions"". It reminded me of Sir John Major's words more than three decades ago: ""Fifty years from now Britain will still be the country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers and - as George Orwell said - 'old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist' - and if we get our way, Shakespeare still read even in school."" Both men, today and in 1993, are attempting to portray a pride in what they see as an understated patriotism and respect for traditions, a small c conservatism. The Liberal Democrats hope they can be seen to represent the clearest and most authentic big party antidote to Reform. And they are buoyed by internal polling suggesting more people are at least open to voting Lib Dem than for any other party right now. But their challenge is they face a new and noisy rival in Reform for the protest votes of those put off by both the Conservatives and Labour. They have grounds to hope and to worry in this increasingly competitive, noisy and fluid politics – and a determination not to be squeezed out of the conversation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg97gq8230o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/394f/live/cea11a60-98c1-11f0-94c0-d393b11c46d7.jpg,2025-09-23T21:30:31.954000+00:00,180161a7b42e067eabb404da16fc88c3c30a22be
6dda1cf1f678,Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point,,"Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point Nick Robinson BBC ""At what point did we become North Korea?"" That was the question Nigel Farage posed when asked by a US congressional committee about limitations on freedom of speech in the UK. He was condemning the ""awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into"", which he claimed had led to various arrests including that of Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan over his views on challenging ""a trans-identified male"" in ""a female-only space"". When I heard the question, I confess I thought that the leader of Reform UK had gone over the top. Farage was comparing his country - my country - with a brutal dictatorship that murders, imprisons and tortures opponents. And he was doing it in front of an influential audience of American lawmakers. Lucy North/PA Wire 'I don't regret anything I've tweeted,' Graham Linehan said earlier this month When I interviewed his deputy, Richard Tice on Radio 4's Today, I asked him whether he really believed that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was the same as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Three times I asked the question. Three times Tice swerved it, suggesting Farage was simply using ""an analogy"". But Farage is not alone in questioning how far restrictions to freedom of speech have gone in the UK. Tensions around the limits of free speech are nothing new and since the advent of social media in the mid-2000s, the arguments have been simmering. Now, though, they're reaching a boiling point. BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images Farage lambasted the 'awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into' During his recent visit, US Vice-President JD Vance said he did not want the UK to go down a ""very dark path"" of losing free speech. The US business magazine Forbes carried an editorial this month that took this argument further still. In it, editor-in-chief Steve Forbes condemned the UK's ""plunge into the kind of speech censorship usually associated with tin pot Third World dictatorships"". He argues that, in stark contrast to the United States - where free speech is protected by the first amendment to the constitution, ""the UK has, with increasing vigour, been curbing what one is allowed to say, all in the name of fighting racism, sexism, Islamophobia, transgenderism, climate-change denial and whatever else the woke extremists conjure up"". So, how exactly did we get to the point where the UK is being compared to a dictatorship and, given how inflamed the conversation has become, what - if anything - would it take to turn down the heat? Big tech dialled up the debate The case of Lucy Connolly has become a cause celebre to some in the UK and beyond. The former childminder from Northampton, who is married to a Conservative councillor, had posted an abhorrent message on X, calling for people to ""set fire"" to hotels housing asylum seekers following the murder of three young girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024. It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times at a time when the threat of violence was very real. Police/PA Wire Lucy Connolly was jailed for 31 months after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing ""threatening or abusive"" written material on X. And yet she was given the red carpet treatment at the Reform party conference, as ""Britain's favourite political prisoner"". The length of her prison sentence - 31 months although she only served 40% before she was released - was questioned by many, including people who were appalled by what she had written. It is just one case that highlights how much social media has changed the shape of the debate around free speech and made heroes and villains of ordinary people. And I use the word ""ordinary"" deliberately because views similar to Connolly's will have been expressed up and down the land by others who might well have said, as she now does, ""I was an idiot"". But while it's unlikely that any action would have been taken had she said what she did in a coffee shop or a bar, the fact she posted it on social media changed things. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has changed the rules for Facebook and Instagram What's more, big tech firms have changed their approach in recent years. After billionaire businessman Elon Musk bought Twitter, which he re-named X, he changed content moderation, which he regards as ""a propaganda word for censorship"" - and he talks a lot about people spreading ""the woke mind virus"". Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has also changed the rules governing Meta and Instagram. In the case of Connolly, her post was ""accelerated by the algorithm"" and spread far more widely, according to Lilian Edwards, an emeritus professor at Newcastle University. Dilemma around policing speech The arrest of Graham Linehan at Heathrow, too, raised further questions around policing freedom of speech - and put the way issues are handled under renewed scrutiny. Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley has voiced his own concerns. ""It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the (online) content out there that enforcement is the answer to that,"" he has said. What these cases both illustrate is the lack of consensus about what can and should be policed online in the UK, and by who. And a lack of consensus too about how we can set apart the unpleasant, offensive, ugly and hateful things said online from those that are genuinely threatening or dangerous. PA Sir Mark Rowley: 'It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the content out there that enforcement is the answer' In the UK, the Human Rights Act does give protection to free speech but as a ""qualified right"". This means that ""governments can restrict that right… provided that the response is proportionate - [or] 'necessary in a democratic society' is what people tend to say"", according to Lorna Woods, professor of internet law at the University of Essex. But some of the comments made at the protest in London earlier this month, billed by far-right, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as a ""free speech rally,"" demonstrate that, despite other controversies, that right isn't that qualified. Like nailing jelly to the wall ""Violence is coming"" and ""you either fight back or die"", Musk told flag-waving protesters via video link. Along with his call for the overthrow of the government, some might argue that his words at the rally were an incitement to violence. But the UK's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the barrister Jonathan Hall KC, has said that Musk's words would not have broken the law. ""Politicians use martial language all the time, don't they?"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Metaphors such as fights and struggles are pretty normal. And he was talking about it contingently, wasn't he? He wasn't saying: 'Go out immediately.'"" Reuters Musk called moderation ""a propaganda word for censorship"" Yet the fact both men were able to address a huge crowd in London is perhaps evidence that there is rather more leeway for free speech in this country than those likening the UK to a ""tin pot dictatorship"" suggest. According to Essex University's Prof Lorna Woods, the lowest level of views that can be prosecuted in British criminal law are those deemed ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character"". These are concepts that few people without a law degree could easily define, let alone agree upon. It is the job of the police initially, but ultimately the courts, to try to nail that particular piece of jelly to the wall. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Former deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg says the the UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries on free speech The UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries, according to Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who later became right-hand man to Zuckerberg. He believes the UK needs to ""think long and hard"" about ""whether we've overdone it"" on policing speech. ""Surely part of the definition of being in a free society is people say ghastly things, offensive things, awful things, ugly things, and we don't sweep them under the carpet,"" he has said. Free speech versus 'me speech' What the British public want is another story. Earlier this month, in a survey by YouGov, 5,035 British adults were asked what was most important when it came to online behaviour: 28% said it was that people were able to express themselves freely but 61% prioritised keeping them safe from threats and abuse. ""People tend to prefer safety to free speech [online],"" argues Anthony Wells, a director at YouGov. What's more, there seems to be a generational divide. Mark Kerrison / Getty Images and SOPA Images / Getty Images In a new YouGov survey, 61% of Britons said keeping people safe online was more important than absolute free speech In my conversations with young people in their 20s and 30s - the age of my own children - I often hear the view that far from being an ideal to be strived for, free speech is the cause of much of the anger, division and fear they live with every day. In recent years a ""cancel culture"" has emerged in which those with ""unacceptable"" views can be hounded out of their jobs, no platformed as speakers or intimidated as students. Even back in 2021, a YouGov poll of Britons found that a majority of those surveyed - some 57% - had sometimes stopped themselves from expressing political or social views because of the fear of being judged or negative responses. For those who believe that free speech is under threat in the country, these figures can be used as evidence that decades of political correctness has had a chilling effect on people's ability to express their opinions. ""Our definitions of what constitutes hate speech, and I think a very broadened definition of what constitutes harm, is meaning that people feel like they are walking on eggshells and they're frightened - not just that they'll have the police around, but that they'll be cancelled if they say the wrong thing,"" the former Brexit Party MEP Baroness Claire Fox told the BBC's The World Tonight. But dig deeper and this debate, like so much else, is also about politics and the deepening and, increasingly, angry and violent divisions in our society. What can America teach us? Even with its constitutional protection for free speech, plenty in the UK question what basis Americans have to lecture Britain on free speech, given the arguments they are having back at home. The anger and division sparked by the assassination of the conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk in Utah this month ramped up the debate further on that side of the Atlantic over where the boundaries should lie between what is offensive, hateful and dangerous. Michael Le Brecht/Disney via Getty Images ABC has suspended talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel over comments about the killing of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi appalled many conservatives when she declared that, ""There's free speech and then there's hate speech"". It seemed to take her into precisely the territory, which has caused so many problems here in the UK. President Trump himself has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15bn (£11bn) over what he calls defamation and libel, adding to the long list of media outlets he has taken to the courts over stories - the newspaper has called it ""intimidation tactics"" - and he celebrated the sacking of the late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel as ""great news for America"". The US historian Tim Snyder, who is an outspoken public critic of the direction America is heading under Trump believes that free speech should be distinguished from what he calls ""me speech"". Win McNamee/Getty Images Trump has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15 billion ""Me speech is a common practice among rich and influential Americans,"" writes Mr Snyder. ""Practitioners of me speech use the phrase free speech quite a bit. ""But what they mean is free speech for themselves. They want a monopoly on it. ""They believe that they are right about everything, and so they should always have giant platforms, in real life or on social media. ""The people with whom they disagree, however, should be called out and intimidated in an organised way on social media, or subjected to algorithmic discrimination so that their voices are not heard."" As much about listening This issue is one I've felt strongly about for as long as I can remember. My grandparents knew first hand what it was to be persecuted for who you were and what you thought or said. They were German Jews who fled the Nazis for what then was the relative security of China and later had to flee the Communists there. As a child, I recall watching in reverential silence as each day, after lunch, my grandfather held a huge radio on his lap and turned the dial, skipping stations until he found the BBC World Service. There, he had learned, he would find news he could trust and speech which was free of political control. So important was this to him that he had risked hiding with his wife and daughter (my mother) in a cupboard in their home in Shanghai to listen to it on a banned shortwave radio. Nick says he finds it hard to accept comparisons between the UK and a dictatorship That is why I find any comparison between the UK and a dictatorship a little hard to swallow. What I learned as the grandchild of those who had fled not one but two murderous ideologies was that free speech was about listening as much as talking. What mattered above all else is being able to hear both sides of an argument and learn the facts behind them - without having that information controlled by governments, rich and powerful media owners, or anyone else.

796a2f6086cd,Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning,,"Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning James Landale Diplomatic correspondent BBC Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago. Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Trump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019) There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries. How Windsor became 'Trumpton' For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."" Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty Images One challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech. 'Pressure to make this massive' So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me. Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty Images President Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and Thursday The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."" Peter Nicholls/Getty Images Members of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images President Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit ""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain. Serious business behind the pageantry Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda. Carl Court - Pool/Getty Images Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."" Leon Neal/Getty Images Planning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."" The Mandelson question For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when? Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Lord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and Vance Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit. Profound differences in the UK and US The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"". Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy. The diplomatic game of cards Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019 ""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter. But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. ""This is very early in Trump's presidency,"" one diplomat said. ""Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?""

d85289a2b48f,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform",,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025. The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style. And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times. These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping ""How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy"" was a joke. And what was planned as No 10's ""get back in charge week"" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax on her expensive new house. Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team. The start of this political season has been wild. Arron Chown/ PA Both Rayner's team and No 10 felt she had to go In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut. The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken. Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed. There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake. It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster. It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis. She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called ""Mr Rules"" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, ahem , flexible attitude to the normal rules. She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust. Jane Barlow/ PA Rayner had styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the ""service of the people"", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels. For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, ""it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight"". And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world. ""There's just the smell test,"" a Labour insider said. Chris Jackson / PA Angela Rayner, Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves all came under fire for accepting  permitted freebies This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not. Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now. Getty Images Nigel Farage moved forward his conference speech after Rayner's resignation The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument. Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust. Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock David Lammy is the new deputy prime minister The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days? Making changes to his ministers. The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making. Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: ""None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership."" You and I might translate that as: ""The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway."" One insider described it as moving those who were ""a bit awkward, or a bit tired"". Aaron Chown/ PA Some hope Shabana Mahmood will take a more strident approach on small boats as the new home secretary What those changes add up to depends on who you ask. One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle ""is all about immigration"", believing ""Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this"" to solve the small boats issue or ""we're all done for"". Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system. As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings. But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock Yvette Cooper will have to contend with a visit from President Donald Trump within days of taking up the foreign brief Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job. I wouldn't bet we'll see her meeting JD Vance in waders any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days. Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that. Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry. He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical. Phil Noble / Reuters Angela Rayner's exit from government has brought on a change in the prime minister's top team But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves. This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition. His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the ""time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long"", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck. Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: ""I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions."" This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for. ""Phase 2"" was meant to be ""delivery, delivery, delivery"". Another bout of political jargon that followed, ""change"", ""renewal"", ""security"", ""fairness"", ""milestones"", ""first steps"", you get the point. Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing. ""You can see the problem from Mars,"" another party insider says, ""there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything"", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week. But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work. And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement. House of Common / UK Parliament/ PA The start of Sir Keir Starmer's phase two of government has not quite gone to plan Seven days ago there was an ambition that week one of ""phase two"" might be an orderly start to the term. The Rayner saga skewered that plan. Now with his new chosen team in place there is more opportunity to make things work perhaps, but fewer excuses if things go wrong. A senior party source told me: ""The test is how does the PM show how No 10's capacity for political strategy and policy making have materially changed?"" With a long list of problems and the party conference looming, we'll soon know if Downing Street can pass that test, to prove it can manage the many challenges of ""phase two"" any better than the agonies of year one.

The song, Actually Romantic, is about an unnamed fellow popstar - and social media has blown up with speculation that it's a Charli XCX diss track. In a cinema screening to accompany the new album, Swift has now revealed that the track is ""a love letter to someone who hates you"". The pop star, 35, didn't say who she was singing about, but she sarcastically thanked them for paying her attention, saying: ""It's flattering."" Watch: Did Taylor Swift write a Charli XCX diss track? Actually Romantic is the seventh track on Swift's much anticipated new album , The Life of A Showgirl. It refers to another singer, who calls Swift a ""boring Barbie"" and writes songs about how much they hate her. Fans on social media are convinced this is a response to Charli XCX's song, Sympathy is a Knife, from her Brat album, which the 33-year-old allegedly wrote about Swift. Getty Images Charli XCX scored her second UK number 1 album with Brat, which was released in June 2024 In that song, Charli writes about feeling insecure about a woman who shows up backstage at her boyfriend's gig. ""Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiralling. One voice tells me that they laugh, George says, ""I'm just paranoid"" , she sings. She adds: ""Fingers crossed behind my back. I hope they break up real quick"". Charli's then boyfriend, now husband, George Daniel, is the drummer in the band The 1975. Swift briefly dated the band's frontman Matty Healy. In her new track, Swift sings it's ""actually romantic"" how much time another popstar devotes to her. ""It sounded nasty but it feels like you're flirting with me,"" she sings. ""All the effort you've put in, it's actually romantic."" Neither star has confirmed if their songs are about each other. And last year, Swift showered Charli with compliments in an interview with New York Magazine. ""I've been blown away by Charli's melodic sensibilities since I first heard 'Stay Away' in 2011,"" she said. But the new track has fans wondering whether the alleged beef is back on. Getty Images Charli XCX, left, and Taylor Swift pictured posing backstage at an event in 2014 On Friday, a launch event film for The Life of a Showgirl dropped in cinemas. Along with a music video, it contains a mixture of song explainers and behind-the-scenes footage. In a short intro to Actually Romantic, Swift shed new light on its meaning, saying it's about realising unexpectedly that you're part of someone else's story. ""There can be this moment where it's unveiled to you, through things that they do that are very overt,"" she said. ""And, as I've gotten older, I've just started to be like, 'Oh my God, you did so much with this. It's flattering,'"" she said. ""That is, wow, that is very, very sweet of you to think about me this much, even if it's negative. In my industry, attention is affection, and you've given me a whole lot of it."" Best friends Anya, left, and Scarlett, right, attended a club night on Friday dedicated to Taylor Swift songs At a ""Swiftogeddon"" club night in Clapham, south London, on Friday night, partygoers admitted they'd spent the day over-analysing everything. Anya, 24, from Brighton, was attending the party - which played exclusively Taylor Swift songs - with her friend Scarlett, 21. Anya said she doesn't have to do a lot of the decoding ""because the internet does it for me"". She felt convinced Actually Romantic was about Charli, adding she could relate to the lyrics. ""It's universal, we've all had that feeling,"" she told BBC News. But Tanya, who's 27, and is a huge Charli XCX fan, said she didn't think it was ""very fair or feminist"" of Swift to appear to take shots at her. ""I don't think she should've done it. But, hey, freedom of expression, I guess."" Fans have long tried to decode Swift's lyrics, and work out who she is settling scores with. This new album is no exception. Away from the songs clearly about her fiancé, Travis Kelce, other new tracks that have been subject to internet speculation include Father Figure (thought to be about music executive Scott Borchetta). Some have also speculated that Cancelled! is about the status of her friendship with Blake Lively,  and that Opalite is about Kelce's ex, Kayla Nicole. Swift, who is known for penning a string of break-up tracks, has previously said she will never confirm who her songs are about.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg24xvyzxwo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dd7e/live/3de510a0-a116-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-04T12:45:44.010000+00:00,df7f73fd133a96f0119e311a49bf115c2c201968

It's really unusual to see this kind of comedy here in Saudi Arabia."" That's how one ex-pat summed up the performances she's seen, at the first ever Riyadh Comedy Festival. ""The response was amazing, I've never seen such enthusiasm,"" she said, after sets by American stars Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr. The woman - whom we're calling Sara - said the comedians avoided discussing Saudi Arabia's controversial human rights record. But that didn't particularly bother her. ""People here don't care about those topics,"" she said. ""If they did, they wouldn't live here."" Outside Saudi Arabia, there are very different perspectives. Famous comedians such as Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall, Kevin Hart, Russell Peters and Omid Djalili have been intensely criticised by fellow artists for agreeing to perform at the festival. Others say they turned down invitations. On Friday, one of the few female comedians on the bill, lesbian stand-up Jessica Kirson, apologised for taking part in the event, telling The Hollywood Reporter she would be donating her fee to a human rights organisation. But some argued it’s a more nuanced picture. While human rights groups have a host of concerns about Saudi Arabia, the country has attempted to transform its image in recent years. With the festival in full swing, we’ve been speaking to fans and comedians to find out what's actually happening on the ground - and how people have reacted. What's being said... The Riyadh Comedy Festival kicked off last weekend, with an all-star - and primarily male - line-up . One of the first fans through the doors was Zain, not his real name. He attended Omid Djalili’s and Bill Burr’s sets with friends, and is booked in to see Jimmy Carr next week. The sets included ""profane content"", with jokes about gay and trans people, he said. ""The opening act for Bill Burr included a ten-minute segment which was all about sex."" Zain, who lives in Riyadh, said he was shocked to hear jokes like this, in a country which is known for being ultra-conservative socially, and where homosexuality remains illegal . The country imposes the death penalty for same-sex relationships, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. ""I can't believe people were saying this stuff in Saudi,"" Zain said. ""Many people here haven't seen a stand-up in their lives, let alone something so explicit.” Getty Images Comedian Omid Djalili had ""done his homework"" on the region, attendees said But the jokes were well received, he said. ""In front of me, [there was a group] of local Saudi women, and they were all laughing.” Chappelle's set was also controversial, according to Sara, with lots of jokes about trans people. She said it's ""really unusual"" to hear jokes like that in the Gulf state. ""It's very haram,"" she said, using the Arabic word for forbidden. Zain said that Djalili poked fun at elements of Saudi culture. ""He joked about the niqab, and women driving. He also did a skit about how people in Riyadh think they are god's gift to earth."" But Burr seemed much more nervous, he said, and stuck to tried-and-tested jokes about his wife and kids. The audience was a broad mix of Saudi nationals and ex-pats, and there was a strong turnout, attendees said. And what's not being said Then there's what's not being said. Fans we've spoken to said the shows ""completely avoided"" any mention of the government in Saudi Arabia. Ahead of the festival, Human Rights Watch argued the festival was an attempt by the Saudi regime to ""whitewash"" its abuses. The group warned Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists were being unjustly detained. And it urged everyone performing in Riyadh to use the opportunity to speak up on topics such as human rights and free speech. ""So far I've not seen one of the comedians raise these issues, not just on stage but on social media or anywhere,"" Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, told BBC News. ""It's very disappointing."" X/Atsuko Okatsuka Alleged content restrictions placed on comedians in Riyadh Comedian Atsuko Okatsuka, who said she turned down an invitation to perform, shared excerpts from a contract that allegedly included bans on any material that could ""degrade or defame"" the Saudi royal family or religion. BBC News has not been able to independently verify the existence of such a contract. But British comedian Rosie Holt says it's extremely rare for comedians to receive content restrictions like those. ""I've only heard it happening sometimes at gigs at universities, like don't be homophobic or racist,” she told me. “But that's the exception not the norm.” 'It's morally repugnant' The timing of the festival also hasn’t been lost on its critics. Its dates, from 26 September to 9 October, coincide with the seventh anniversary of the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi . Khashoggi was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and his body cut up. A US intelligence report found Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved his murder. Saudi Arabia has rejected that report, and the crown prince, who is effectively the kingdom's ruler, has denied any role in the murder. ""The same guy that's gonna pay [the comedians] is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a [expletive] suitcase,"" said US comic Marc Maron, in a standup clip that appears to take aim at Mohammed bin Salman. Holt said that if comedians were going to go to Riyadh and make jokes about the state, and ""call out Khashoggi"", then ""I'd say fair play to them - but they won't"". Jeremychanphotography/Getty Images Jack Whitehall will take to the stage in Riyadh next week ""There's that old saying, that comedy speaks truth to power,"" she said. ""A lot of these comedians have been huge defenders of free speech, and to go and perform in Saudi Arabia, where free speech is so heavily curtailed, is extraordinary. It's morally repugnant."" Alex Falcone, a comedian and TikTokker from LA, acknowledged that free speech had also come under fire in the US. But he said it was the fact the festival is government-backed that made him most uncomfortable. ""There's a difference in performing in a country and for a country. I would not do a festival if it was being paid for by the ""Trump is a great guy"" department,"" he said. Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, which announced the festival, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Saudi Embassy in London has been approached for a comment. Chappelle, Djalili, Burr, Whitehall and Carr did not respond to BBC News. 'They're paying me to look the other way' Some comedians have been clear about what's drawn them to Saudi - money. ""They're paying me enough money to look the other way,” US comedian Tim Dillon said on a podcast. Dillon, who says he was fired from the festival following that podcast appearance, also claimed he had been offered $375,000 (£278,000) for his set, and that some of his peers were offered millions. Others have also spoken about the large fees. Getty Images The line-up also includes American superstar Kevin Hart, who performed earlier this week US star Shane Gillis said on his podcast he had declined a ""significant"" offer to perform at the event. ""I took a principled stand,"" he said. Fellow comedians have taken a dim view of their peers for ""selling out"". ""No one goes into comedy for the paycheque,"" says Holt. ""The only people who are being invited are people who already very successful,"" added Falcone. ""This has not been a tough year for Kevin Hart."" Comedians and musicians have often performed at private gigs and corporate parties. ""The difference,” says entertainment journalist Natalie Jamieson, “is that those events tend not to be disclosed, or receive such publicity. The outrage is happening now because this is happening so publicly."" 'People here are excited' It's not only comedians who have taken up large sums of money from the Saudi government in recent years. As a nation that has been heavily dependent on oil, Saudi Arabia is working to diversify itself economically, socially and culturally. Its Vision 2030 plan, spearheaded by the crown prince, includes funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, entertainment, and sports. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won hosting rights for several major international events, including the 2034 men's football World Cup. Last month, gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA) was bought by a consortium spearheaded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The fund's portfolio also includes Newcastle United and the LIV Golf franchise. ""I'm sure there are lots of people in the West who don't approve, but people here are really excited about the transformation programme,"" said Sara. ""Saudi Arabia is trying to be an entertainment centre, and things like this comedy festival really help. There's a lot of enthusiasm here, especially among young Saudis."" Getty Images Bill Burr called the Riyadh festival ""one of the top three experiences I've had"" Speaking on his podcast this week, Bill Burr defended his Riyadh performance in the face of the backlash. ""The comedians that I've been talking to are saying, 'Dude, you can feel [the audience] wanted it. They want to see real stand-up comedy’,"" he said. ""I think it's going to lead to a lot of positive things."" Whether the festival truly permits diverse perspectives to be aired is up for debate. Zain acknowledges there is no getting away from the fact the comedians in Riyadh won’t be making jokes about the state or its leaders, as they would elsewhere. “So you can criticise them for that,” he said. But holding an event like this was helping to “open the eyes of the population”. “Every Saudi who attends a show like this will learn something. You had gay jokes, trans jokes, sex jokes, they're being really open about everything - aside from the government.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn2yqpnnpo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8c14/live/56c27be0-a066-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png,2025-10-04T01:03:44.876000+00:00,7b8db9aebadfba2cb20ff733d3f4252c12082c43
06d7475d2ef4,Lola Young in legal dispute with Messy producer,,"Singer Lola Young has taken legal action against one of the producers of her hit single Messy in a dispute over songwriting credits. The English singer has filed an intellectual property court claim against Carter Lang, with her lawyers saying she had ""no choice"" after he claimed writing credits on four of her songs, which she ""strongly refuted"". The US producer and songwriter has not yet responded. The case was filed in London on behalf of Young and Sony Music Publishing on Wednesday. It came a day after she cancelled all shows ""for the foreseeable future"", following a collapse on stage during a performance in New York. The 24-year-old shot to fame at the end of last year when Messy became a viral hit. It spent four weeks at number one and is the second most-streamed song of 2025 so far in the UK. A statement from her lawyers said: ""It is with immense disappointment, especially given recent events, that we have had no choice but to respond to recent writing credit claims from Carter Lang on four Lola Young songs by issuing legal proceedings on her behalf. ""Carter's claims are strongly refuted and we will not allow Lola's reputation and integrity to be called into question - particularly so long after the sessions took place and agreements were put in place. ""Lola has always been authentic in her songwriting process and acknowledges songwriting contributions where appropriate. ""This dispute has been ongoing for several months and we look forward to the truth being established."" Young's representative declined to confirm which four tracks were involved in the dispute. Lang is one of four producers credited on Messy and also worked with her on a number of other tracks. He made his name by working with R&B star SZA and is now one of the most in-demand producers and writers in music, collaborating with big names including Post Malone, Justin Bieber, Renee Rapp and Rosé.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx235qe04o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2fd2/live/0daf3df0-a07d-11f0-bb47-b30225268691.jpg,2025-10-04T07:35:16.791000+00:00,13cfc94a4bd9e43cc56ea1700e8ce2b0b472cd9e
c669f6ba85be,Idlewild: 'Small music venues need protected like libraries',,"Idlewild: 'Small music venues need protected like libraries' Jonathan Geddes Glasgow and west reporter Prescription PR Idlewild have returned with their first album in six years Idlewild cut their teeth playing small pubs and tiny clubs around Scotland - now the indie rock veterans feel those venues need protected for generations to come. Scores of venues have been forced to close in recent years , with some never recovering from revenue lost during the Covid shutdown in 2020. ""These venues become like community centres for music fans. They need to be protected the way a library would be, as they're so important to culture,"" says guitarist Rod Jones. The group formed as students in Edinburgh in 1995 and have become one of the country's most respected bands, with their 10th album released on Friday. Both Rod and singer Roddy Woomble - speaking over a video call with the BBC - believe the record, their first in six years,  is a fine representation of a three decade long career. However such a lifespan would never have happened without finding places to play in their early days. That was harder to do in Edinburgh than Glasgow, where the group regularly gigged at the likes of legendary hangout Nice N' Sleazy. ""You can't have an interesting music scene without a hub where people can learn,"" says Roddy. ""Glasgow has always had much more of that than Edinburgh, so we struggled to find a scene when we started out. ""We ended up playing a pub to get better, but how are you supposed to learn without gigs like that?"" The band earned a reputation for great live shows Thirty years on and it is hard to find a venue Idlewild haven't found themselves playing over the years. That might have surprised people who saw the group during their early days making a chaotic racket , famously and vividly described by the NME as ""the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs"". However a more reflective and melodic sound emerged, with 2002 release The Remote Part making Idlewild known as much for poetic lyricism as much as punky energy. In recent years the band - who despite line-up changes have always retained a core of Roddy, Rod and drummer Colin Newton - revisited the record for a series of shows playing it in full. That decision wound up inspiring their future as well as celebrating the past. ""Those 20th anniversary concerts of The Remote Part helped us reset and refocus on what we wanted to do next,"" explains Roddy. ""Anniversary shows always feel like you're putting a spotlight on the past and I don't like that until I'm actually doing them. ""I much prefer to focus on the now, normally. But then you do the gigs, and they're absolutely brilliant because everyone is so excited to hear a record they love."" Getty Images Idlewild in 1999 with a line-up including bassist Bob Fairfoull, who left the group in 2002 The year 2025 has been dominated by another example of nostalgia, in the shape of the Oasis reunion tour . Idlewild were never part of the 90s Britpop movement the Gallaghers fuelled, taking inspiration from American alternative rock rather than anything close to home. However both Roddy and Rod have watched the brothers' reunion, and the emotion it generated among fans young and old, with interest. ""These concerts are cultural events and I'm really fascinated by it, because I lived through it,"" explains Roddy. ""In the 90s we'd think of the 1960s as this cultural touchstone and now the 90s are being celebrated the same way. ""They've found a new generation and it feels different, because it's not just drunk old folk singing along to Roll With It, it's new fans too. ""It's a powerful thing to see these generations united by it. It's not to the extent of Oasis, but we have soundtracked some people's lives too, and we have two generations [of fans] now."" Getty Images The band's new release suggests a prosperous future. Both Roddy and Rod feel the album combines elements from throughout the band's career. It results in a fitting reflection of the group, from the towering rock of opener Stay Out of Place to the quickfire pop of Like I Had Before and snappy indie on Writers of the Present Time. ""I think we have made the best version of ourselves, in an honest way,"" says Rod, who also produced the record. ""It's not what we thought it would be when we first started making this record, it took some different turns and we almost flexed the muscles of what the band can do at times. ""We've definitely overcooked things in the past. Quite often that was for the better but what was important to me this time was to be really focused."" Idlewild UK tour The group will shortly hit the road for a run of dates across the UK, concluding with December shows in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow. Going on tour is a harder proposition for the band now, given they have other responsibilities with family life. They also live in different parts of the country, with Rod in Edinburgh and Roddy settled on the scenic isle of Iona. But Roddy says live shows are always welcome, whether singing new or old material. ""When I sing When I Argue I See Shapes, that was written when I was 19 or 20. A lot of the audience were presumably the same age when they heard it, or younger, and it's like you all shape-shift back to that age. ""That's the cool thing about gigs, everyone becomes themselves when they were first hearing it again. ""Or maybe I'm just overthinking it!""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz08jpg9181o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96c7/live/d95b9360-a148-11f0-9be2-514f62a90aaf.jpg,2025-10-05T08:12:20.654000+00:00,ea47b7e18c150e631396efa9a2efe9ffc8f488ce
03c6b6f168a1,Sean 'Diddy' Combs sentenced to more than four years in prison,,"Hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was sentenced to just over four years in prison on Friday after being convicted on prostitution-related charges involving his two ex-girlfriends. Combs' attorneys argued for a 14-month sentence, saying their client is reformed after serving 13 months in a New York jail, but prosecutors wanted 11 years, citing his domestic violence history. In addition to prosecutors detailing Combs' abuse, the court heard from several of Combs' children, some openly sobbing; defence attorneys who called him inspiring; and finally, an apologetic Combs himself. In the end, Judge Arun Subramanian said a significant sentence was required as a  deterrent, and to send a message. Before the judge delivered the 50-month sentence, Combs addressed the court - his first public words since the trial began. Combs apologised to his victims, specifically naming his two ex-girlfriends, Casandra Ventura, and ""Jane"", who testified under a pseudonym. ""My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,"" he said. ""I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego."" He went on to apologise to his mother and his children. ""I'm so sorry. They deserved better,"" he said, referring to his seven children, most of whom were in the courtroom. Then he begged the judge for a second chance, saying he would never jeopardise time with his family again. ""I ask your honour for mercy. I beg your honour for mercy,"" Combs said. ""I don't have nobody to blame but myself. I know that I've learned my lesson."" In the nearly two-month federal trial in New York City, prosecutors accused Combs of using his celebrity status and sprawling business empire to run a criminal enterprise and sex traffic his former girlfriends. Prosecutors argued Combs sex trafficked women through ""freak-offs"", or encounters in which he would pay male escorts to have sex with his girlfriends while he watched and filmed. The government argued Combs coerced the women into unwanted sexual encounters with drugs and physical violence. Combs, 55, was found not guilty in July of the most serious charges against him, racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking of his two ex-girlfriends, Ms Ventura and ""Jane"". He was convicted on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. For most of Friday morning, Combs maintained a non-reactive demeanour, sitting back in his seat and listening quietly as prosecutors accused him of ruining his victims' lives. Prosecutor Christy Slavik argued that the harsher sentence was more appropriate for the severity of his actions. A lighter sentence would ""let the defendant get away with years of domestic violence and abuse,"" she said. ""Today is about accountability and justice,"" she said. Citing victim statements and testimony from Ms Ventura and Jane Doe that detailed domestic violence in their relationships with Combs, she reminded the judge of photos the court saw of the two women's injuries they say Combs inflicted. ""He didn't need the money, his currency was control,"" the prosecutor says. ""This is a defendant who will pose a danger at any age."" However, the defence argued that Combs ""is not a pimp"" and that the prostitution charges on which he was convicted did not apply. ""All pimps share one aggravating factor,"" said attorney Jason Driscoll. ""They make money."" The conviction was based on the Mann Act, passed in 1910, which criminalised transporting women and girls for ""the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose."" The main difference, Mr Driscoll said, is money, pointing out that Combs did not benefit financially from the offences. The defence painted Combs as reformed, describing his positive contributions at the jail in Brooklyn, New York, where he's being held and citing ""untreated trauma and a ferocious drug addiction"" as factors in his behaviour. ""Mr Combs personally inspired me,"" defence attorney Nicole Westmoreland told the court, choking back tears. She talked about Combs starting his own record label and clothing line, which she said also inspired other black entrepreneurs and musicians. After spending 13 months in jail, Combs was ""remorseful,"" said Ms Westmoreland. ""Your honour, he gets it, simply put."" Combs' children - some sobbing - also vouched for his transformation in prison. In possibly the most emotional part of the day, one called him a ""changed man"" and another asked for a ""second chance"" for his father. Combs looked on, appearing to hold back tears and occasionally burying his face in his hands. ""In front of you and in front of us is a changed man. He has evolved, something we haven't seen in 15 years,"" said Combs' son Quincy Brown. Delila Combs, 18,  pleaded: ""We can't watch our baby sister grow up fatherless the same way we grew up motherless... Please, please give our family the chance to heal."" Afterwards Judge Subramanian thanked them, saying they would help him in his decision. Combs will get credit toward his 50-month term for the roughly 13 months he has served in jail before and during the trial. He also will be required to pay a $500,000 fine. After the hearing, Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo said the legal team is planning to appeal the decision. In his sentence, the judge said Combs' actions were more than being a consumer of prostitution, like the defence had claimed, and that he was not convinced Combs would not reoffend if released. The defence played a 15-minute video highlighting Combs' achievements, and  Judge Subramanian acknowledged that he considered his involvement with charities and helping the black community, and his deep family ties. But he rejected the defence's portrayal of his relationships with Ms Ventura and Jane as intimate and consensual. ""You abused them, physically, emotionally and psychologically,"" he said. Both women had trauma that will last a lifetime, the judge said. ""You had the money and the power to keep it going,"" he said. ""This was subjugation."" ""This is the reality of what happened.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx0gx227z4o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bd6e/live/fc8e9cd0-a083-11f0-bb47-b30225268691.jpg,2025-10-04T01:54:53.144000+00:00,b62c46f0e89d82d5447a71306072ce31bbd8f38a
8da3a97c4c5d,Taylor Swift feared happiness could  'dry up' her songwriting,,"Taylor Swift feared happiness could  'dry up' her songwriting Helen Bushby, Ian Youngs and Steven McIntosh Culture reporters BBC Swift recorded a string of interviews while in the UK, including The Graham Norton Show Taylor Swift has spoken of her relief that being happy in her personal life did not affect her ability to write songs for her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. ""I used to have this dark fear that that if I ever were truly happy and free, being myself and nurtured by a relationship, what happens if the writing just dries up?"" she told BBC Radio 1 as part of a flurry of UK interviews. Swift also discussed her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce, getting her master recordings back, the Eras world tour and her love of baking. Fans have been digesting the album since its release at 05:00 BST, with some reporting that Spotify was briefly overwhelmed by the demand. Watch: Taylor Swift on Travis, new tracks and baking bread The new album includes a song which interpolates George Michael's Father Figure. The late singer's estate said they were ""delighted"" when Swift approached them about using it. ""When we heard the track we had no hesitation in agreeing to this association between two great artists and we know George would have felt the same,"" Michael's estate said on Facebook . Another song on the album, Actually Romantic, prompted speculation that the song is a diss track about Charli XCX. But others have played that down, noting that Swift said last year that she was ""blown away"" by Charli XCX's work, and praised the British star's music as ""surreal and inventive"". Here are six other things we learned from Swift's interviews, plus what critics are saying about the album so far. 1. Did being happy impact her songwriting? Getty Images Taylor Swift has made no secret of how happy she is with fiancé Travis Kelce Swift, who famously uses her lyrics as a form of emotional purging for her relationships, told Radio 1's Greg James about her fears her writing abilities might be impacted if she felt ""happy and free"". ""What if writing is directly tied to my torment and pain? And it turns out, that's not the case at all, and we just were catching lightning in a bottle with this record. ""But it's nice because you're from a place of happiness and love, you can go back to those places. You can look forward to other things,"" she said. Graham Norton asked her on his BBC One chat show if all the songs are inspired by her life. ""I am open about things, but in recent years I have a different perspective and like storytelling at a little bit of a distance, so it isn't like doing a complete autopsy of myself,"" she said. 2. Life and love with Travis Kelce Getty Images Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrated with Taylor Swift after his team's victory at last year's Super Bowl in Las Vegas, The singer spoke affectionately in several of the interviews about how she's loving life with Kelce. ""He's such a natural, just in life. He's just never been nervous about anything in his entire life, so it's pretty fun,"" she told Heart's Emma Bunton and Jamie Theakston. ""He's fun and vibrant and has this infectious personality, makes me laugh so much. There's a line in a song that says, you just wanted a best friend who you think is hot - and that's kind of it!"" That song is Wi$h Li$t, from the new album, which includes the lines: "" Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot / I thought I had it right, once, twice, but I did not ."" Her prayers, it seems, have now been answered. She added: ""It's this interesting thing, that you've been you your whole life, but we are different shades of ourselves at different volume levels, and this person came into my life and everybody's like, 'Yeah, you've never been so you'. ""People fuel you, they fuel every part of you, and they make you walk taller, and they make you present in a more vibrant way. And hopefully that bleeds into the music too."" 3. Engagement ring hint 18 months ago Instagram/Reuters Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift got engaged in August Swift showed off her diamond engagement ring, which she confirmed Kelce designed with an ""amazing jeweller"" called Kindred Lubeck. ""She does all of her gold engraving by hand,"" Swift told Heart. ""I just thought all of her stuff was so cool, so I'd shown him a video a year and a half ago. ""And he was just paying attention to everything, it turns out, because when I saw the ring I was like, 'Aaahh, I know who made that!' ""And also that you listened to me. It was like, you really know me. I didn't know what I would want, but he did somehow. And that's kind of a flex."" Kelce popped the question in his garden, surrounded by lavish flower arrangements, straight after the couple recorded an episode of his podcast in August. ""He really crushed it in surprising me,"" she told Norton. ""While we were talking on his podcast, he had a complete garden built out the back of his house to propose in. He went all out – 10 out of 10."" Asked when the wedding is happening, Swift joked, ""you'll know"", adding that it will not be until she has finished promoting the new album. ""I want to do the album stuff first, and the wedding is what happens after in terms of planning,"" she said. ""I think it will be fun to plan."" 4. The ups and downs of touring Getty Images Taylor Swift's Eras Tour lasted nearly two years, with 149 shows spanning five continents Swift's Eras Tour was an ""astonishing challenge"", she told Hits Radio's Fleur East, Will Best and James Barr, saying how proud she was of her crew, performers and indeed herself. The tour famously became the first in history to surpass $1bn (£786m) in ticket sales when it ended in December after nearly two years. It featured a 44-song setlist lasting more than three hours, with 149 shows spanning five continents. All this meant setting herself some tough goals. ""So you're like, don't get sick, don't let any outside noise into your head, focus on only this one thing,"" she said. Swift wrote and recorded her latest album at the same time as during her recent Eras Tour. Swift invited BBC Radio 1 presenter Greg James to her wedding during their interview Speaking to BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills, she explained:  ""I would go from three shows in a stadium, fly to Sweden [to record it], fly back to the tour, fly to Sweden."" So has she ""got the itch"" for another tour for her new album? ""No, no, I'm gonna be really honest with you,"" she told James. ""I am so tired when I think about doing it again, because I would want to do it really, really well again."" Capital Radio's Jordan North heard how she still finds time to put her feet up. ""When you're inspired to write, for me that's the most fun possible,"" she said. ""But also, I lay around and watch so much TV, just rotting."" 5. Preferring baking to social media Getty Images Swift, pictured in 2019, said she would rather be focusing on hobbies than scrolling Swift explained she tries to be very measured about how she uses her phone and social media, with her focus on being ""peaceful and happy"". ""I really am not much of a scroller at all,"" she told Hits Radio.

She added: ""When there's so much of any type of opinion about me, it's like, don't put that in my brain... ""We live in a moment of a lot of rage-baiting and getting attention has now been monetised. So you have to know what world we live in and choose what reality you want to be in.""

Getting her master recordings back Getty Images Swift was championed by her fans for reclaiming her master recordings The singer also discussed how she bought back the master recordings of her earlier albums this year , something she described as ""a lifelong dream"". ""I don't respond to stuff generally, but not owning it really pissed me off,"" she told Norton. ""I didn't think I should be given it – I was happy to pay and at a premium. I am glad I spoke publicly about it and my fans got behind it and championed it. ""I couldn't believe it happened. Travis and I were in tears when it did. Every time it is mentioned, I get a wave of euphoria still."" In the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licensed. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future. To date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as ""Taylor's Versions"" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material. What have critics said about the new album? TAS Rights Management Meanwhile, The Life of a Showgirl has received broadly positive reviews from critics, some of which have been shared by Swift on social media. Rolling Stone's Maya Georgi awarded the album five stars, saying Swift ""hand-picks elements from all of her eras, just as she did on tour, and combines what works best"". In a four-star review, the Independent's Roisin O'Connor said: ""The Life of a Showgirl might be one of her most uneven records, but she's as compelling as she's ever been – the showgirl, the ringmaster and the circus all in one."" There was a colder reception from the Guardian's Alexis Petridis, whose two-star review said the album was ""dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzled"", while the Financial Times' Ludovic Hunter-Tilney said the album was ""charismatic, but lacks sparkle"". But the Telegraph Neil McCormick awarded four stars, noting: ""The overwhelming emotional mood is relief. It pervades the songs, a self-soothing blanket of gratitude that she has been rescued from solitude.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9312173ydko,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04db/live/c598aaf0-a050-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg,2025-10-03T12:13:24.878000+00:00,7cc966175a1ca0cfd9bef1855c075c4d3e1028ba
b97fd4cc37a9,Keeping Up Appearances star Patricia Routledge dies at 96,,"Keeping Up Appearances star Patricia Routledge dies at 96 Ian Youngs Culture reporter BBC Actress Dame Patricia Routledge, known for playing Hyacinth Bucket in classic TV sitcom Keeping Up Appearances, has died at the age of 96. She also starred in Alan Bennett's TV monologues and played BBC One's amateur sleuth Hetty Wainthropp, while also enjoying an acclaimed stage career. Her agent told the PA news agency on Friday that she died ""peacefully in her sleep this morning surrounded by love"". The BBC's director of comedy was among those paying tribute, saying she ""made millions laugh and left a legacy that will always be remembered with gratitude and admiration"". Dame Patricia as Hyacinth Bucket with Clive Swift as long-suffering husband Richard in Keeping Up Appearances Keeping Up Appearances creator Roy Clarke said in a statement to BBC News: ""I'm sorry, as I'm sure so so many people will be to hear of the death of Patricia Routledge. ""It's a fortunate coincidence to find your scripts in the hands of so accomplished an actor. She was a singer and it showed in the way she could use her voice without music. It was an instrument. ""On top of such skills she was also a very fine physical clown. ""With those talents she took my scripts to the heights. I can only salute her talents and regret their passing."" Dame Patricia was best known as Hyacinth Bucket - pronounced ""bouquet"" - a comic creation who lampooned the extremes of English pretension and snobbery. ""She's an absolute monster and I enjoyed playing her enormously,"" the actress once said. Keeping Up Appearances ran from 1990 to 95, and the following year she was voted the nation's most popular actress at the BBC's 60th anniversary awards. Announcing her death, her agent's statement added: ""Even at 96-years old, Dame Patricia's passion for her work and for connecting with live audiences never waned, just as new generations of audiences have continued to find her through her beloved television roles. ""She will be dearly missed by those closest to her and by her devoted admirers around the world."" 'Loved around the world' Jon Petrie, the BBC's director of comedy, said he was ""so sad"" to hear of her death. ""She was an actor of remarkable range, but her portrayal of Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances has to be one of the most iconic performances in British comedy,"" he said. ""She took a character on the page and gave her such truth, precision and warmth that Hyacinth became part of the national conversation; instantly recognisable, endlessly quotable, and loved around the world. ""Whatever she did, she brought impeccable craft, and in doing so inspired generations of writers, performers and audiences."" Routledge starred with Derek Benfield (left) and Dominic Monaghan in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates The Birkenhead-born star was celebrated for her performances on stage as well as screen after starting her career in the theatre in the 1950s. Following roles in London's West End, she established herself in the US when she won the Tony Award for best lead actress in a musical on Broadway in New York for Darling of the Day in 1968. She was as adept at serious drama as she was at musicals and comedy - she appeared in Richard III and Henry V for the Royal Shakepseare Company, then won an Olivier Award for best actress in a musical for Candide in the 1980s. The 80s also saw her become a true national TV star - playing Kitty in Victoria Wood's As Seen on TV, and delivering three of Bennett's renowned Talking Heads monologues, including 1988's A Lady of Letters, for which she received a Bafta Award nomination. Alan Bennett wrote his first Talking Heads monologue for Routledge, and two subsequent instalmets She earned two further Bafta nominations, for Keeping Up Appearances, in 1992 and 93, then starred in the title role as a retired woman on a quest to solve crimes in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates between 1996 and 98. Broadcaster Gyles Brandreth, a friend, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One she was ""an extraordinary person"", adding: ""I think she was a remarkable actress because she was a remarkable human being."" She was ""a very decent, strong, independent, intelligent person and a mistress of her craft"", he said. He recalled falling in love with her when he saw her on stage in a Noel Coward compilation in the 1970s. ""Noel Coward admired her. Everybody admired her,"" Brandreth said. ""Alan Bennett loved writing for her. She was one of Victoria Wood's favourite human beings. What's interesting, of course, is she entered the national consciousness as Hyacinth Bucket. She epitomised that character, but her versatility was extraordinary."" Getty Images She starred in The Importance of Being Earnest at Chichester Festival Theatre and a West End transfer in 1999 Actress Kerry Howard, who played the young Hyacinth Bucket in a one-off BBC prequel, said Dame Patricia would be ""remembered forever"". ""She was a monolithic talent who became a comic beacon to me,"" Howard said. ""I would watch her every week as Hyacinth and then spend the rest of the week pretending to be her. ""She was my first drama teacher - although we never ever actually met, she has informed so much of my comedic sensibilities. ""A wonderful clown has left this world, but I'd like to think her energy and gifts go beyond the grave."" 'A supreme actress' The actress appeared numerous times at Chichester Festival Theatre near her home in West Sussex, and the venue's artistic director Justin Audibert and executive director Kathy Bourne paid tribute to her as ""irreplaceable, inimitable and unforgettable"". ""Patricia Routledge was a supreme actress. Her talents were particularly associated with comedy, though her range was far greater than that,"" they said in a statement. ""She was not only a national treasure, she was a Chichester treasure too - a stalwart supporter of the city and community, and of the Festival Theatre whose stage she graced for five decades.""

The rock legend died in July at the age of 76 , less than three weeks after a star-studded farewell concert in his home city, Birmingham. ""What a great way to go out that gig was,"" he said in one of his final interviews for the documentary. Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home followed the final three years of his life and was broadcast on BBC One on Thursday.

""I couldn't get the words out,"" recalled Ozzy, adding that it had been ""torture"" to have to sit down on a throne to perform due to a serious spinal injury. ""The only thing that was terribly frustrating for me, I had to sit there instead of running across the stage,"" the former Black Sabbath frontman said. ""I wanted to get up and sing so much. It was very humbling to sit in that chair for nine songs."" As well as Black Sabbath, the event featured performances from an array of artists they influenced, such as Metallica and Guns N' Roses.

The Prince was speaking to the actor Eugene Levy in Windsor, for the Apple TV+ show The Reluctant Traveller. In a revealing conversation, the actor asked Prince William about his future role as King. ""I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda,"" he said. ""Change for good, and I embrace that, I enjoy that change. I don't fear it, that's the bit that excites me, the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen."" AppleTV+/PA Schitt's Creek star and co-creator Eugene Levy was given a tour of Windsor Castle by Prince William The prince made the comments as he gave Levy a tour of Windsor Castle. William arrived to meet the actor on an electric scooter that he said he used to get around the castle grounds. He said he had been a fan of the American Pie series of films – the bawdy coming-of-age movies in which Levy played a long-suffering father. During the tour of some of the castle's grandest rooms, Prince William also spoke about his family history. ""I think if you're not careful, history can be a real weight and an anchor around you, and you can feel suffocated by it, and restricted by it too much. And I think it's important to live for the here and now."" Prince Willam stresses the importance of tradition but says he isn't afraid to ask questions to keep the monarchy relevant.

It's an informal setting where the Prince seems relaxed especially when talking about his family and how his children coped when their mother was unwell. ""We try to make sure we give them the security and the safety that they need,"" he told Levy. ""And we're a very open family, so we talk about things that bother us, and things that trouble us, but you never quite know the knock on effects that it can have. ""And so, it's just important to be there for each other and to kind of reassure the children that everything is okay."" AppleTV+/PA They shared a Guinness and a sweet cider in a nearby pub The interview does not touch on the state of relations with Prince Harry. But Prince William does mention his brother when asked about his experience of royalty growing up with the intense scrutiny his mother and father faced. ""I hope we don't go back to some of the practices in the past that Harry and I grew up in. And I'll do everything I can to make sure we don't regress in that situation.""

I wasn't thinking about it in my own mind as any kind of scoop,"" he said. ""He was telling me what his thoughts were and we were able to have a little back and forth. It was a totally surreal day for me."" And as the prince and the actor finish their pints and round off their day together, the prince says he wants to create a world his son would be proud of.

6e335b79c2d1,Ghost of Yōtei: PlayStation puts blockbusters back on the menu,,"Ghost of Yōtei: PlayStation puts blockbusters back on the menu Tom Richardson BBC Newsbeat Sucker Punch Ghost of Yōtei follows the story of Atsu, a warrior on a quest for revenge PlayStation fans and PlayStation haters don't usually agree. But there's one complaint (or insult, depending on who you ask) that's been coming from both sides. ""Where are all the games?"" Big-budget, single-player blockbusters from in-house studios have been the key to Sony's console success. In the PlayStation 4 days fans got a steady stream of cinematic adventures, but that's felt more like a trickle since 2023's Spider-Man 2. However, Sony's newest release - Ghost of Yōtei - is a return to its proven triple-A format. BBC Newsbeat spoke to Nate Fox, a creative director at Sony-owned studio Sucker Punch, about the wait for the game and some of the reasons behind it. Firstly, what took so long? Sucker Punch's latest is a follow-up to 2020's feudal Japan-set adventure Ghost of Tsushima, one of the last big PS4-exclusive releases from Sony. ""Games do take a long time to make, so it's no small chunk of your life,"" says Nate. Ghost of Yōtei relocates the action a few hundred miles north, to the Honshū region, and the setting a few hundred years later, to 1603. This time the story follows Atsu, a female warrior on a quest to exact revenge against the Yōtei Six - a group of warlords responsible for her family's murder. With a previous game to build on, it's not a completely fresh start but, Nate explains, the project is still a huge undertaking. Just having a new main character, for example, requires input from writers, animators and character designers, to name just a few of the roles involved. Behind the scenes there are many, many more. Sucker Punch Ghost of Yōtei provides a larger open-world environment for players to explore Although Sucker Punch has roughly 200 employees at its base near Seattle, many hundreds more work on its games. The credits for Ghost of Tsushima, for example, contained about 1,800 names. Some of those will be from abroad, or from outside companies that specialise in certain technical fields. ""Making a video game requires all sorts of different skills, from incredibly technical people... to people who are very driven by emotions, like our writing staff,"" says Nate. ""And these teams work in co-ordination. It's like conducting an orchestra. ""You need to have all of the elements coming together."" Nate says that a dizzying number of elements can go into a single scene - from music to the programming that makes leaves blow across the screen at a pivotal moment. ""All these teams have to have a sense of where they're going,"" says Nate. A sense of direction is something fans have accused PlayStation of lacking in the last few years. Under its previous boss, Jim Ryan, the division launched development on 12 online multiplayer titles, known as ""live-service"" games in the industry. Some of the most famous examples, such as Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty, keep players engaged for months and generate huge amounts of money. Sony has had success in the space with last year's Helldivers II, but a disastrous failure with Concord , which was taken offline just two weeks after its release. It has since cancelled multiplayer projects based on some of its most popular series, including God of War and The Last of Us. Pursuing the multiplayer market is a strategy Sony has admitted is not entirely ""going smoothly"", but it's said some titles with online elements, such as Gran Turismo and baseball game MLB: The Show, have performed well. The stars of its most recent promotional showcase were Saros, a follow-up to 2021's Returnal, and the long-awaited Wolverine game from Spider-Man maker Insomniac - both single-player games. Marvel/Insomniac Wolverine is one of two big single-player exclusives due to hit PlayStation in 2026 High-profile releases can be magnets for controversy, as Sucker Punch recently found when a developer's joke about the death of right-wing American activist Charlie Kirk prompted a backlash. The studio eventually fired the employee involved, and founder Brian Fleming told journalist Stephen Totilo that ""celebrating or making light of someone's murder is a deal-breaker for us"", when asked about it. Some right-wing video game influencers have also attacked Ghost of Yōtei for featuring a female protagonist. Nate says it was an ""unconventional choice"", but key to the story the developers wanted to tell of an underdog defying society's expectations. As the game progresses, Atsu's reputation as an Onryō - a vengeful spirit found in Japanese folklore - grows. ""People think there's no way this woman could have taken out members of the Yōtei Six unless she is a supernatural creature,"" says Nate. Big releases can also invite another kind of scrutiny - hype. With the gap between new games widening, it puts pressure on developers to deliver something that will impress fans. How do you cope? ""Certainly there's a lot of expectation that games will be beautiful and emotionally compelling,"" says Nate. ""And that pressure definitely gets us going, but it's nothing compared to the pressure we put on ourselves.""

County council leader Mick Barton banned the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, from speaking to him and other councillors ""with immediate effect"" on 28 August. Law firm CMS LLP served the council with a legal letter on Tuesday on behalf of Reach, the organisation that runs the publisher, calling for the ban to be withdrawn in full. The county council's team manager for litigation, Geoff Russell, responded to the letter on Thursday and said it would now provide the Post with press releases and invite them to council events. However, the Post said it remained ""unclear"" whether Barton would now speak to them, but added they were ""committed to building a working relationship going forward"". Barton has been approached for comment. Council leader Mick Barton has said his door is ""always open"" to the local newspaper, despite refusing to speak to its reporters According to the Post, the ban was prompted by an article about local government reorganisation , written by its agenda editor Oliver Pridmore. The authority also stopped sending press releases to the publication and inviting them to council events. But Barton later clarified the ban only applied to the issuing of press releases and to him personally . Barton later lifted the ban for the three BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists who work out of the publication. The Post believed the ban was in breach of local government regulations, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights - in relation to freedom of expression - and the council's own councillor code of conduct. ""I'm pleased this unprecedented ban has been lifted and the situation finally resolved, so that we can continue to get on with our jobs as we always have done,"" said senior editor Natalie Fahy.

A forthcoming Peaky Blinders film, set at the start of the war, will see Cillian Murphy reprise his role as gang leader Tommy Shelby. That will now be followed by two new TV seasons, which ""will be rooted in Birmingham and will tell the story of a city rising from the ashes of the Birmingham blitz"", creator Steven Knight said.

A four-month-old Spencer Elden was pictured swimming naked underwater on the 1991 LP's famous cover. He sued the rock band and photographer Kirk Weddle, but a judge has ruled that ""neither the pose, focal point, setting, nor overall context suggest the album cover features sexually explicit conduct"". A lawyer for Nirvana said: ""We are delighted the court has ended this meritless case and freed our creative clients of the stigma of false allegations."" Mr Elden originally filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that his identity and name were ""forever tied to the commercial sexual exploitation he experienced as a minor which has been distributed and sold worldwide"". US District Judge Fernando Olguin dismissed it in 2022 because Mr Elden submitted it after the 10-year limit for filing a civil case. An appeals court overturned that decision, allowing Mr Elden to refile the case. However, Judge Olguin has now ruled that, beyond the fact Mr Elden was naked, nothing came ""close to bringing the image within the ambit of the child pornography statute"". He likened the image to a family photo of a child bathing, and said it is ""plainly insufficient to support a finding"" of child pornography. ""Nudity must be coupled with other circumstances that make the visual depiction lascivious or sexually provocative,"" Judge Olguin wrote, quoting from an earlier ruling. The judge also cited factors including the presence of Mr Elden's parents at the photo shoot, the fact the photographer was a friend, and the fact he had previously ""embraced and financially benefitted from being featured on the album cover"". Mr Elden's legal team told Rolling Stone they ""respectfully disagree"" with the decision and plan to appeal.

They were found in the archive of Kretzmer, who died in 2020 aged 95 , after it was donated to Cambridge University Library . A letter that Kretzmer wrote to theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh in 1987 referenced ""unpleasant actions taken by others to downgrade my credit and contribution"". ""I think it will clarify matters if I spell out, for the first and I hope only time, the straight and verifiable facts about the authorship of the English version of Les Miserables,"" he wrote. Getty Images The enduringly popular show has been performed around the world over the past 40 years ""Not many people have had the opportunity to compare my English version, page for page, with the original Paris libretto. ""So let me, as briefly as I can, point out the evidence for declaring that, in terms of the actual lyrics now being sung nightly in New York and London, there is very little indeed that can be called translation. ""Les Miserables in English is virtually a new, rewritten show."" He described it as ""a mass of material that is so totally reconceived and rewritten that there is no longer any substantial similarity between my lyrics and the 1980 Paris model"". ""I regret that this letter has to be written at all, but in view of the unpleasant actions taken by others to downgrade my credit and contribution, I must emphasise that Les Miserables is not a show translated or re-written, but a show reborn,"" he said. The Times quoted Mackintosh as saying in reference to the correspondence in the archive: ""Herbie has a very strong moral compass as a person. He has the very quality to reflect in popular song and lyric the ethos of Victor Hugo."" Les Misérables was adapted from Hugo's 1862 novel for a French album in 1980 and a stage show the following year. The English-language version of the musical opened in London in 1985. The archive also includes a 1985 memo about auditions, which reveals Brian Blessed was among those discussed for roles in the original cast, stating he ""has been working hard on his voice, and has made considerable improvements"". It also says Fiddler On The Roof actor Chaim Topol and Exorcist actor Max von Sydow ""will, hopefully, be available to come to London... to discuss the roles of Jean Valjean and Javert"". The archive also features letters from huge names including actors Frank Sinatra and Peter Sellers, and photographs taken by director Stanley Kubrick, along with Kretzmer's cuttings from his newspaper work and his theatre career. The South African-born English writer also penned the lyrics to the 1960 song Goodness Gracious Me, made famous by Sellers and Sophia Loren. He also worked with French singer Charles Aznavour on his 1974 hit She. Word changes discovered Dr Liz Savage, special collections assistant at Cambridge University Library, helped to catalogue the Les Misérables sections of the archive. She found many edits in Kretzmer's second draft of the musical, including changing ""common"" to ""angry"" in the song Do You Hear The People Sing? The song, which has been sung in protests around the world, begins: "" Do you hear the people sing?/ Singing the song of angry men. "" The archive also reveals how Kretzmer tried out various other words first, including ""valiant"" and ""fearless"", before deciding on ""angry"". Documents also show that the song Stars was in danger of being cut, before pressure from Kretzmer and others to keep it, writing: ""We must altogether disassociate ourselves from the decision to cut Stars. We do not agree that the show is weakened by the inclusion of this song."" Kretzmer's widow, Sybil, said: ""The prestige of Cambridge University reflects the impact and influence of Herbert's work, and we know the archive will be preserved by the Library and live on for generations to come, just like Les Miserables itself.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2518579w9o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dd01/live/26656f90-9f74-11f0-9ccd-4dc2d8fa5ad2.jpg,2025-10-02T11:01:51.484000+00:00,68d79192aa4613c1606d5135a3210a9bd0d683a0

CMAT, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, was due to play in London on Thursday on her Euro-Country tour, following the release of her third album in August. She was scheduled to perform in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Glasgow over the coming week. Thompson confirmed she would cancel her upcoming concerts after learning she had an infected wisdom tooth.

a43b0eea3bd7,Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl is a triumphant pop victory lap,,"Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl is a triumphant pop victory lap Mark Savage Music correspondent TAS Rights Management Taylor Swift's 12th album comes from ""the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place"", she said ahead of release The last time we met Taylor Swift, she was spiralling. Her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, was an emotional purge - a stunned post mortem of two bitter, messy break-ups. We found her at her lowest, ""crying at the gym"" and ""pissed off"" at wasting her youth on a six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, that ultimately fizzled out. Eighteen months later, she's back with the latest update from her bureau; and the story is very different. Recorded in stolen moments during the record-shattering Eras tour, it finds the 35-year-old happy, energised and newly in love with NFL star Travis Kelce. ""This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,"" she said in an appearance on Kelce's New Heights podcast last month . To capture that dynamic, she produced the album not with her longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff – whose pillowy productions defined the sounds of Midnights, and Tortured Poets Department – but with Swedish pop masterminds Max Martin and Shellback, who previously worked with Swift on hits like Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble. The goal, said Swift, was to make a tight, compact album of ""bangers"" (that's hit songs, not sausages) with ""melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it"". But enough preamble. Is The Life of a Showgirl a rhinestone-studded success, or a chorus line catastrophe? Watch: Taylor Swift on Travis, new tracks and baking bread Getting straight to the point: It's a triumph. It is a combination of compelling songwriting and whip-smart production that easily clears the high bar Swift has set for herself. Fans expecting a return to the maximalist pop of Red and 1989 might be surprised. Swift's new music is more cool and collected than her previous collaborations with Martin; tapping into the atmospheric textures of his recent hits for The Weeknd and Ariana Grande. But there's not an ounce of fat on any of these songs. At 41 minutes, The Life of A Showgirl is the shortest album Swift has released since her debut in 2006; and the laser focus is a welcome relief after the bloated word soup of Tortured Poets. Max Martin / Instagram Max Martin (right) has written more US number one singles than anyone since the Beatles, including Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time and The Weeknd's Blinding Lights Thematically, Swift's latest lyrics have two distinct threads. Half of the album's 12 songs are about falling completely, goofily, head over heels in love. The rest tackle the seedy underbelly of fame. Along the way, we get some classics, like the image of a burlesque dancer ""glowing like the end of a cigarette""; or comparing a critic's barbs to ""a toy chihuahua barking from a tiny purse"". Elsewhere - and I can't believe I'm writing this - there's an entire song filled with playground innuendo. Getty Images Taylor Swift started dating Travis Kelce after meeting backstage at the Eras tour. The couple announced their engagement last month. The album opens, however, with a misdirect. Fans assumed that The Fate of Ophelia would tether Swift Shakespeare's story of a noblewoman who drowns in a fit of mania after being driven mad by grief. Instead, she sings about being ""saved"" from that fate by Kelce, in a crisp pop track that's packed with cute references to their relationship - including the Kansas City Chiefs, and the number 100 (the sum of Kelce's jersey number, 87, and Swift's lucky number 13). "" I heard you calling on the megaphone, "" she says, acknowledging how their romance began with Kelce publicly declaring his affection on his podcast in July 2023. "" If you'd never come for me, I might have drowned in the melancholy."" Musically, the song plays a clever trick by adding an extra bar at the end of every other phrase, as though Swift is lingering in the moment, too swept up in her feelings to continue. The album is peppered with little flourishes like that - and it's supremely satisfying. TAS Rights Management The album cover shows Swift submerged in water, coming down after a show in an ""offstage moment"", as the album is about ""what happened offstage"", she said The lovestruck theme continues on Opalite , whose breezy chords and Abba-esque harmonies unfurl like a blossoming romance; and Wi$h Li$t, where Swift extricates herself from the Hollywood pack for a life of domestic bliss. "" They want that critical smash Palme d'Or and an Oscar on their bathroom floor ,"" she observes. "" I just want you "". (Plus ""a couple of kids"" with ""a best friend who I think is hot""). But perhaps the most eye-opening tribute to Kelce is Wood - a staccato dance track, complete with a Jackson 5 guitar riff, that's essentially an extended double entendre. Therein, we find Swift superstitiously ""knocking on wood"" that their relationship will last, and knocking wood in the bedroom, in an unexpected homage to her fiancé's ""manhood"". It's so silly and unexpected that I laughed out loud. The same thing goes for Actually Romantic, a fantastically sarcastic track about a fellow pop star (unnamed), who calls Swift a ""boring Barbie"" and writes songs about how much they hate her. Over grungy guitars and a slapping drum beat, Taylor taunts them with a touch of reverse psychology. "" It sounded nasty but it feels like you're flirting with me ,"" she trills. "" All the effort you've put in, it's actually romantic."" She continues to settle scores on Father Figure - the scathing story of a backstabbing protégé, that interpolates the George Michael classic of the same name. Fans will go wild trying to uncover the subject's identity, but, to me, the song feels more like a morality tale about a music industry Svengali, who possesses the power to wipe out anyone who isn't ""loyal to the family"". Full of cinematic strings and disorientating key changes, it sits alongside No Body, No Crime, Bad Blood and Vigilante S*** in Swift's expanding catalogue of revenge anthems. Getty Images The Eras tour made a record $2bn at the box office - and will have made millions more from merchandise sales alone. The album's best track, however, is the soft-focus ballad Ruin The Friendship. Time-travelling to Swift's high school days in Tennessee, it reminisces about a boy she confined to the friend zone while yearning for a single kiss. Delicate and nostalgic, it takes a heart-wrenching turn in the third verse, when Swift's real life best friend Abigail calls to say their former schoolfriend has died, and she flies through the night to attend the funeral. In an album that's largely concerned with contentment, the regret and sadness hit doubly hard. The collection ends with the title track, a spirited duet with Sabrina Carpenter that doubles as a cautionary tale about stardom. It's the only song that really leans into the showgirl concept, with a percussive tap-dancing interlude and ostentatious key changes, as the stars trade lines about their cut-throat industry. "" All the headshots on the walls of the dance hall / Are of the bitches who wish I'd hurry up and die, "" Swift sings. Then the punchline: "" But I'm immortal now, baby doll ."" That feels like a deliberate call-back to Look What You Made Me Do, written in 2017 when Swift was at her most embattled, following a public showdown with Kanye West and months of negative press. Back then, she sang: "" The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now… Why? Oh, cause she's dead. "" In 2025, with the world at her feet, Swift can finally say with certainty that her place in pop history is guaranteed. The Life of a Showgirl is her well-earned victory lap.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4wpe5z52qo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d309/live/0fb41d10-9f69-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png,2025-10-03T04:01:53.390000+00:00,30475383612d55cfbcea1750f53c105fcc493108

Insisting it was ""pronounced Bouquet,"" Hyacinth ran roughshod over her long-suffering husband and bewildered neighbours in Keeping Up Appearances, one of Britain's most successful sitcoms in the 1990s. Behaving like an duchess while living in a suburb, Bucket's monstrous social-climbing schemes were ultimately doomed to failure - while she battled to maintain her dignity. It was Dame Patricia's most famous role in a career that saw her win theatrical awards on both sides of the Atlantic, become the star of Alan Bennett's famous TV monologues, and become BBC One's crime-busting Hetty Wainthropp. Patricia Routledge as the indomitable Hyacinth Bucket in BBC1's Keeping Up Appearances in the 1990s Katherine Patricia Routledge was born in Birkenhead on 17 February 1929. Her father was a haberdasher and she later recalled sheltering from German bombs in the basement of his shop during the war. She studied English at the nearby Liverpool University and intended to teach. Instead, she joined the Liverpool Playhouse before training at the Bristol Old Vic. Her successful stage career took her from the provinces to the West End, and eventually to Broadway, where Leonard Bernstein chose her to star in his musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 1976. Getty Images Patricia Routledge gets ready for a performance in 1962 She had already won a Tony award for her performance in Darling of the Day. She could move effortlessly from comedies to classics. She went from Stratford-upon-Avon, appearing with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then to the National Theatre in London. There, her starring role in the stage musical Carousel involved her singing the rousing You'll Never Walk Alone. There were also various minor film roles, notably in the 1967's, To Sir, With Love, and the Jerry Lewis comedy outing, Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River. Her stage and radio work proved her versatility and won her awards, but it was television that provided Routledge with her most high profile roles. Getty Images Patricia Routledge and Jerry Lewis in Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River Early small-screen work included popular programmes like Z Cars and Steptoe and Son. And later, one of Britain's most respected playwrights, Alan Bennett, wrote a set of outstanding Talking Heads TV monologues for her. Routledge overcame her initial reluctance to perform his scripts and excelled as A Woman of No Importance and A Lady of Letters. She went onto play a lonely, middle-aged department store clerk tipped into a relationship with a kinky podiatrist in Bennett's Miss Fozzard Finds Her Feet. Finding her feet as Alan Bennett's lonely, middle-aged Miss Fozzard A comic turn as the larger-than-life Kitty on The Victoria Wood Show led to the creation of Hyacinth Bucket. Routledge recalled being sent the scripts by the writer, Roy Clarke - who had also done Last of the Summer Wine and Open All Hours. ""I had opened the script for a moment at one o'clock in the morning,"" she said, ""I read straight through and Hyacinth leapt off the page. I knew that woman, I knew several of that woman."" Keeping Up Appearances ran for five series and included four Christmas specials. In a documentary, she later claimed that fans had included Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and Pope Benedict XVI. Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket alongside Clive Swift who played her husband, Richard It became BBC Worldwide's most exported programme ever and meant Routledge was recognised as far away as Botswana. For her work on the sitcom, she was voted Britain's all-time favourite actress in 1996, but after five years in the role, she felt it was time for a change. ""I brought it to an end,"" she said, ""which, of course, the BBC didn’t care for very much."" She thought that Roy Clarke was beginning to recycle ideas and recalled a piece of advice from the comedian, Ronnie Barker. ""He always left with people saying, ‘Oh, aren’t you doing any more?’ she said, rather than people saying, ‘Is that still on?’"" Patricia Routledge as Hetty Wainthropp, Lancashire housewife turned sleuth Playing the homely but astute detective in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates brought her continued success on television, but she always called the stage ""the test"". Long after she stopped appearing regularly on screen, Routledge made theatre tours both in the UK and abroad. Whenever interviewers asked the inevitable question, she asked them to spell out the word retirement because, she explained: ""It's not in my vocabulary."" She never married or had children, but told interviewers of two great affairs in her youth, one with a married man. ""I felt guilt and an acute sense that there had to be loss,"" she confessed. ""I suppose I convinced myself that it was all right for the time being because his marriage was not a living thing."" Instead, she dedicated herself to her craft, serving it with the talent, discipline and commitment that were always admired by her colleagues. Getty Images Patricia Routledge was awarded an MBE, a CBE and later became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire She was scathing about the BBC's decision in 2016 to bring back Keeping Up Appearances, but this time set in the 1950s and featuring a younger version of her character. Questioning the Corporation's policy of resurrecting old sitcoms, she said: ""Why are they doing this sort of thing, they must be desperate."" She had already clashed with the BBC over its decision not to commission a documentary she had written about the author Beatrix Potter (Routledge was a Patron of the Beatrix Potter Society), which eventually aired on Channel 4. On turning 90, she continued to live quietly in Chichester, where she busied herself raising money for the cathedral roof. In 2017, she became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire but - unlike Hyacinth - honours did not go to her head. Dame Patricia always said she thanked her Northern roots and solid family for giving her good sense with her time and her money. Nonetheless, she admitted that, should any extra cash come her way, she'd definitely spend it on ""a case of champagne"" - an appreciation of the finer things in life that she shared with her most famous character. ""I was never stage-struck,"" she said. ""I'm not stage-struck now. Nobody's more surprised than I am that I have, in fact, spent my life doing this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511ym2r2xpo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4894/live/b705b4f0-80c2-11ef-ab28-17c883eb03dd.jpg,2025-10-03T10:18:22.015000+00:00,d0ca8553bad20ac1fe2ab89dd33ac312b23cedbf
2fd015612c2e,William's interview with Eugene Levy is the most open we've ever seen him,,"William's interview with Eugene Levy is the most open we've ever seen him Daniela Relph Senior royal correspondent 'Stress around family overwhelms me', Prince William says Prince William's conversation with Eugene Levy on the actor's Apple TV show is revealing on many levels. It has clarified his vision for his own reign once he becomes king, reinforced how stressful family life has been for him, and given us a few personal details about him we didn't know before. Here are our main takeaways from his interview. This was a different type of royal chat Traditionally, interviews with the Royal Family come around rarely and when they happen they are formal. There is usually a room in a palace, set up with cameras and lights. The interviewer will likely be an experienced presenter or journalist. There would have been weeks of briefing notes and discussions about subject areas. It is a tried and tested formula. But it is now clear this isn't Prince William's way. Part of his openness here comes from the setting and the context. He is at home at Windsor, he's on familiar territory, he's walking his dog, he's in the pub. William just seems more relaxed in that space, and talks more freely. The choice of interviewer matters too. He told the actor that he was a fan of his and had loved watching the American Pie films - the coming of age movies starring Levy as a long-suffering father. There have been some eyebrows raised about revealing so much to a Hollywood actor rather than a more forensic interviewer. There were no questions on his relationship with his brother, Harry, nothing on his view of Prince Andrew's place in the royal family. But even with those missing components, we still got something new and interesting. William didn't falter when asked about his children and about what kind of king he wants to be. He would have probably been more restrained and uptight if it hadn't been Levy asking the questions. AppleTV+/PA Prince William also revealed he rides an electric scooter around Windsor Castle William is set on change It has always been clear that Prince William has his own take on his public role. ""A smaller R in royal"" is how he previously referred to it. But the words ""change is on my agenda"" and not being ""suffocated"" by history make it very clear that he has a vision for monarchy that will look forward rather than back. Those who work with the prince and his family are cautious about how those words are interpreted. One palace staffer told me: ""He's not afraid to ask questions about how and why things are done. If the answer is because that's how we've always done it then he just won't accept it."" The Duchy of Cornwall  - the financial portfolio that provides an income to the heir to the throne - is cited as an example of William going in and leaving ""no stone unturned"" in terms of how it is run and what needs changing. There is new leadership there, a focus on social action and a very involved prince. One source told me that when he is king, William will be ""deep in the roots of the management of Monarchy HQ"". Don't expect the big stuff to change dramatically. There will definitely be a coronation. Trooping the Colour and Remembrance Sunday will remain fixed and important parts of the royal year, and jubilees and big occasions will still be celebrated. But William as king will have his own way of doing things. AppleTV+/PA Prince William was asked about his children and about what kind of king he wants to be He rides an electric scooter at the castle The programme is filled with small details about the prince – many of which we didn't know before. He rides an electric scooter around the grounds of Windsor Castle, but still describes himself as ""a late person"". A favourite drink is a pint of sweet cider. None of his children currently have their own phone – something he said he and the princess were strict about. He loved running down the wooden floors of Windsor Castle with his cousins when he was younger trying to avoid getting splinters. His children now do the same but the floor has been carpeted, so is less perilous. His eldest son, Prince George, now knows more about history than his father. And he describes his children's favourite activities – it is football and hockey for George, netball for Charlotte, while both Charlotte and Louis like trampolining. ""As far as I can tell they're jumping up and down on the trampoline and beating each other up,"" says their dad. Prince Harry gets a brief mention The prince's younger brother, Harry, gets one fleeting mention in the show. There are no direct questions about him, but William brings him up in a conversation. ""I hope we don't go back to some of the practices in the past that Harry and I grew up in. And I'll do everything I can to make sure we don't regress in that situation."" He was referring to some of the more chaotic aspects of his childhood and how difficult the press attention and intrusion had been. The sibling relationship still remains deeply fractured following Harry's public criticism of the Royal Family. There are no signs of that changing right now. Still, it is interesting to hear William just say his brother's name out loud in public. The strain of Kate's illness is clear Prince William has mentioned the strain of having both his wife and father unwell a number of times over the past year and a half. He doesn't shy away from discussing it again here with Levy. William is asked directly about his wife being in remission, about how his children have coped. He uses the world ""overwhelmed"" to describe how he has felt at times. It is just further confirmation of how unsettling the experience has been for him and his family and it has obviously reinforced his desire to put his wife and children first. ""It's just important to be there for each other and to kind of reassure the children that everything is OK,"" he says. Press Association Prince William has previously spoken about the strain of his wife's illness The choice of Apple TV is important The royal media teams are taking a much broader perspective on the type of media work they now do. A lot of energy is spent on their Instagram posts and YouTube channels. The King is currently working on projects with both Netflix and Amazon. Apple fits the strategy of engaging a wider number of media platforms and looking for different ways of presenting royalty globally. It's an approach that isn't without risk for William. We were told there were no agreed questions or approved areas of discussion and that he was opening up parts of Windsor Castle to the actor and film crew. But the project has worked for both Apple and Kensington Palace. Apple has a programme making headlines and Kensington Palace feels William has emerged as ""a human and easy to relate to guy"", according to sources. This was an unusual place for such an interview Sometimes royal revelations are found in unexpected places – a prince opening up to one of his favourite actors from his teenage years was a bit of surprise. But it has shown an heir to the throne managing the stresses of family with his future on his mind. A royal source summed it up. ""For all too long, we've seen the royals as perfect,"" they told me. ""Here we see William as a human being, in a pub, with a pint, chatting. ""It's the most open we've ever seen him.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r3k0d2e5o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/07f9/live/740154f0-a044-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-02T21:02:50.615000+00:00,013e270292187d47b8590ec95f9a457967fa13f6
012465b1eb27,Steve Coogan: 'I don't want to live with Alan but I do like to visit him',,"Steve Coogan: 'I don't want to live with Alan but I do like to visit him' Paul Glynn Culture reporter BBC Alan Partridge is part of a British tradition of desperate male comedy characters which includes Captain Mainwaring, Basil Fawlty and David Brent ""Do you like my orange socks?"" asks Steve Coogan. The British actor is pointing down to a brightly coloured, Argyle patterned pair, worn with brown leather sandals. ""That's where Alan meets Steve,"" he adds. ""In the socks."" By Alan, of course, he is referring to his much-loved and often quoted comedy creation, Alan Partridge - the tactless, self-absorbed and self-styled presenter. The character first appeared as a sport reporter on the BBC Radio 4 parody news show On the Hour in 1991, with one unwitting listener writing in to say they had been ""appalled"" by his on-air behaviour. Since then he has gone on to have his own chat show, sitcom, film and podcast. Now, his 2025 return finds him funnily failing at fronting a self-funded TV documentary on mental health. Partridge, as Coogan reminds us, is like ""every superficial"" celebrity who just wants to have a public profile. ""That's more important to them than what they're saying or what they stand for,"" he adds. ""He'll take a look around for what seems the most fertile territory for him to exploit. And I think he thought, 'oh mental health... A lot of people are talking about that these days, I'll jump on that and try to make myself relevant.'"" Comedy potential Steve Coogan starred in 24 Hour Party People, The Trip and Philomena, and will lead the regeneration of his hometown Middleton in Greater Manchester How Are You? It's Alan (Partridge) shows its titular star ""bravely"" - as he puts it - investigating his own mental health and that of the nation. Addressing ""important"" topics in comedy can be cathartic but requires a constructive and kind approach, Coogan stresses, noting the intention from him and his co-writers was to ""laugh around mental health, not at it"". He says: ""Sometimes if people are worried about attaching comedy to something which is about people's vulnerabilities then they tend to avoid it because they don't want to upset people. ""Whereas we will gravitate towards that, even though it gives people anxiety or could be potentially problematic. ""But we know that the same things that make something problematic also give it a lot of potential in terms of comedy."" The character featured on The Day Today before getting his own TV shows, Knowing Me, Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge Partridge's latest misadventures see him searching for answers as he reintegrates into British life after a year spent working in Saudi Arabia, having been cast out by the BBC again. His misguided approach - often aped on the Accidentally Partridge social media account, which shares cringeworthy clips of public figures - is ""provocative"" but, Coogan hopes, ""never mean-spirited"". The fictional Norfolk-based host can be used as a comedic ""Trojan horse"", he says, to talk about taboo subjects and to ""mock different kinds of received wisdom"". Partridge is as likely, according to Coogan, ""to mock the xenophobic little England mentality of the Daily Mail"" as he is ""the smug, self-righteousness of the Guardian, at its worst"". He continues: ""People who don't agree on everything might all laugh at Alan Partridge at the same time. ""So that's really a nice unifying thing."" Allow Google YouTube content?

Accept and continue In the 1990s and early noughties, Coogan would write material for the ambitious-yet-awkward Alan alongside Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham. But Iannucci turned his attentions to political satires like The Thick of It, while Baynham was ""poached by Sacha Baron Cohen"" for Borat, Coogan recalls. Cocaine use affected his own work on series two of I'm Alan Partridge, he has previously admitted. The character then endured a ""fallow period"" of about seven years, as Coogan looked for other projects that would ""help me feel like I wasn't just gonna die with 'here lies Alan Partridge' on my tombstone"". He starred as Manchester music mogul Tony Wilson in Michael Winterbottom's 2002 film 24 Hour Party People, and then alongside friend and fellow comic Rob Brydon as exaggerated versions of themselves in The Trip. A blend of truth and fiction, the conceit hinted at Coogan's frustrations and ambitions to step out of Partridge's shadow into other acclaimed roles. It worked. He won a Bafta for his performance in series one, to add to his previous wins for I'm Alan Partridge. Another Bafta win and an Oscar nomination followed for 2013 film Philomena, which he wrote and starred in alongside Dame Judi Dench. The actor compares Alan to Malvolio from William Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night When Alan returned from his hiatus in the 2010s, in the YouTube series Mid Morning Matters and spoof autobiography I, Partridge, a new writing team was in place. Screenwriting brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons helped Coogan to slowly fall back in love with him. ""It took a while,"" admits Coogan. ""I was doing a live show, and I asked them to write something and it was brilliant - almost but not quite perfect. ""And since then, they've just taken the reins and they have breathed new life into the character, given me new confidence and we took it off in a different direction."" The trio worked together on the Partridge movie, Alpha Papa - alongside Iannucci and Baynham - and another Bafta-winning series Scissored Isle, as well as the TV magazine programme This Time and podcast From the Oasthouse. Coogan believes Partridge's longevity is down to him having ""evolved"" into a more ""three-dimensional"" figure, capable of evoking ""pathos"". Neil Gibbons says in the early days Partridge was surrounded by ""reasonable"" people, meaning he would often be the one saying something ""stupid"". Their trick, he reveals, was to surround him with people who are worse, like his new girlfriend Katrina. ""Alan often, in a clumsy way, says things that as an audience you agree with,"" he explains. ""It just gives you another angle of attack, as otherwise you run out of ways he can say the wrong thing or lose his temper with someone."" PA Media Coogan also compares the character to Sir Keir Starmer, who he recently criticised over Gaza in a Palestine Solidarity Campaign video alongside Paul Weller, Maxine Peake and Khalid Abdalla More sympathetic characters like his long-suffering assistant, Lynn (Felicity Montagu), and his old sidekick, Simon (Tim Key), return but with gripes of their own. Coogan thinks while older fans may feel relieved watching Alan slip on life's ""banana skins"" that they've avoided, younger viewers - with whom he is popular on TikTok - ""see their parents in Partridge"". ""They see that desperation from their parents to be relevant and not square,"" says the actor. Like for many ""white, middle-aged, middle-class men"", offers Rob Gibbons, ""the world has changed too fast for him"" and he's ""scared"". Filming in Norfolk down the years has given northerner Coogan ""a real affinity"" for the area though he admits locals love and hate Partridge in equal measure Partridge was once an ""albatross"" around Coogan's neck, but he returns to him nowadays because he ""wants to"", not because he has to. ""I don't want to live with Alan but I do like to visit him,"" says the star, who has also recently portrayed Mick McCarthy, Jimmy Savile and Stan Laurel as well as Dr Strangelove on the West End. As his socks might suggest, the 59-year-old admits he has caught himself becoming a little more like Partridge as he's got older. He has no intention of killing him off anytime soon. ""As long as I can do the other things that are really important to me, I think I will always come back and do something, as long as we can keep the standard."" And having realised that ""laughter is very healthy"", Coogan says he will keep performing comedy for ""as long as I've got breath in my body"". How Are You?

c230165d09b9,"Lady Gaga serves mayhem, magic and guest stars as UK tour launches",,"Lady Gaga serves mayhem, magic and guest stars as UK tour launches Mark Savage Music correspondent Getty Images Lady Gaga's Mayhem Ball is her eighth tour. Originally planned as a brief series of outdoor promotional concerts, she expanded the run following glowing reviews Lady Gaga is dancing on a human skull. Lady Gaga is buried in a shallow grave. Lady Gaga is serenading a corpse. Lady Gaga is also teetering around on crutches, cavorting with zombies and crossing the River Styx. Welcome to the Mayhem Ball, a magnificent and operatic tour de force; that pitches the star's inner angels and demons in a fight for her very soul. Premiered at this year's Coachella festival, it reached the UK on Monday night, for a run of eight shows at London's O2 Arena and Manchester's Co-Op Live. The transfer from outdoor festival stage to the confines of an arena only heightened the show's vampy, gothic energy - as Gaga raced through two decades of hits, from her debut single Just Dance to her latest hit The Dead Dance, from the Netflix series Wednesday. The latter came with a star cameo from two of the show's young stars, Emma Myers and Evie Templeton, who pirouetted around Gaga and her dancers in wispy bridal gowns, before breaking into choreography from the show's second season. The singer later posted video of their rehearsals on Tiktok . Getty Images Wednesday stars Emma Myers (right) and Evie Templeton (centre) joined the show for two songs - The Dead Dance and LoveDrug Getty Images The young stars embraced Gaga and waved to the crowd before making their exit The tour comes hot on the heels of Gaga's latest album, Mayhem, widely regarded as a return to high-concept pop after a spell of method acting and jazz crooning. The album, like the show, is a reckoning with her past. She questions whether her career was really worth sacrificing her privacy, her sanity and even her health, as punishing live shows exacerbated her fibromyalgia, a condition that causes chronic, full-body pain. On stage, the tussle plays out between her light side (angelic, naive, floating across the stage in flowing blonde curls) and her inner darkness (raven-haired and manic, with convulsive choreography). During Poker Face, the two sides face each other on a giant chess board; as Gaga is confronted by a doppelgänger dressed head-to-toe in face-obscuring lace (a nod to the star's 2010 Brit Awards outfit). ""What are you doing here in my house,"" screams Gaga, striking her old self to the ground and demanding, ""off with her head!"" The ghost of Gaga past re-emerges for Perfect Celebrity, writhing with camp energy in a shallow grave as she sings about the pressure and torture of stardom. For a dramatically stripped-bare version of Paparazzi, she's on crutches, snarling at photographers, but soaking up the public's adoration until it frees her to walk unaided. Getty Images The star arrived on stage in a giant, tiered dress... Getty Images ...That opened to unveil a cage full of dancers Does the story make sense? Sure, kind of. It's about as coherent as any pop concert narrative - ie not very - but Gaga's visceral commitment makes it soar. Her vocals are rich and gutsy, even through kinetic choreography that requires her to be in almost constant motion; and the music is given a gothic overhaul, painted black and scuffed up with industrial guitar chords and sawtooth bass lines. Even Shallow, Gaga's Oscar-winning A Star Is Born ballad, opens with an unsettling synth pulse , as it soundtracks the show's climactic final act. She performs it in a gondola, floating down the catwalk as she flees the chaos of the main stage for the sanctuary of her piano. Sitting down at the keys, she's finally at peace, playing the heartfelt ballads A Million Reasons and Die With A Smile, without the accompaniment of her band. ""My first big arena show was in the UK,"" she tells the audience. ""You believed in me then. Thank you for believing in me now. ""No matter what, we've found each other through the music and through community."" To celebrate, she dives deep into her songbook and plays impromptu versions of Speechless, from her 2009 Fame Monster album, and The Edge Of Glory, from 2011's Born This Way. Fans, who know the standard setlist by heart, are enraptured, singing back every word at full volume. At the end, Gaga wipes away a tiny tear. Getty Images The solo piano set is the emotional highlight of the concert After two-and-a-half hours, the show ends with Gaga announcing she has defeated the ""mistress of mayhem"". As the entire set catches fire, she's wheeled out on a hospital gurney, surrounded by dancers in red plague doctors costumes, who operate on her lifeless body. Frankenstein-like, she springs back to life for a show-stopping, floor rattling version of Bad Romance,  that feels both cathartic and celebratory. ""It's been almost 20 years,"" she reflects, ""but I want to make a pact with some of you. ""If I come back 20 years from now, will you come to the show? ""You gotta promise me now, otherwise I'm just gonna roll up with a keyboard, and I'll be playing on the street. I'll be here no matter what."" In the storyline of the show, that feels like a revelation. Gaga has found a path through the chaos, a way to keep performing without surrendering her soul. On previous tours, I've often felt her ambition was let down by self-indulgence or messy execution. Not this time. The Mayhem Ball finds the pop star operating at the peak of her powers. Fancy that.

097035ed49f9,Where is her husband?! Raye on her hit song and five-year plan to start a family,,"Where is her husband?! Raye on her hit song and five-year plan to start a family Mark Savage Music correspondent BBC Raye says there's a serious undertone to her frisky new single, Where Is My Husband! Glastonbury, summer 2025. Raye is wheeled on to the Pyramid Stage in a giant flight case marked ""Caution, contents may be fragile."" Freed by two tuxedoed roadies, the pop star teeters to her microphone in a black sequinned ball gown and does the worst thing a performer can do - plays a brand new song. ""When I think about it now, that was really bold,"" she laughs. ""I got out of that box and I was like, 'No-one knows this. Everyone hates it, everyone hates it!'"" Not quite. Because the song was Where Is My Husband!, a blistering pop-funk throwback that became an instant earworm. Fans streamed the Glastonbury performance 1.2 million times while they waited for an official release. When the single finally came out last week, it entered the charts at number four. The insanely catchy bridge – where Raye longs for "" a diamond ring I can wear on my wedding finger"" – has also gone viral on TikTok. So... has it resulted in any concrete offers? ""Someone wrote their number on a tissue the other day and I was like, 'Oh no, you're just not my type',"" she guffaws. ""He was really sweet, he just wasn't my vibe."" PA Media Raye debuted Where Is My Husband! on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury, backed by a full soul revue band Still, for all of the song's sass and flippancy, Raye is deadly serious about snaring a partner. ""I have a five-year plan,"" she says. ""I'll put out an album in first half of next year – although I need to finish it first - then I'll tour with my sisters. ""Ideally, around that time, it would be nice to meet my husband. So like, maybe 2027? Then we get married and have a baby. ""And I want to do enough groundwork in the next two years that I can take a year off and my career's not gone down the toilet."" It's a startling admission - a year after winning a record six Brit Awards in a single night , Raye still worries about the precarious nature of success. And, like many women, there's a fear that maternity leave will damage her career prospects. It doesn't help that she's been scarred by her past experiences with a record label that, for almost a decade, pushed her into making generic dance records while refusing to release her debut album. That's also why, having finally broken free, she's keeping a close eye on her younger sisters Lauren and Abby-Lyn Keen as they follow her into the music industry. ""I'm fiercely, fiercely, fiercely protective of my girls,"" Raye says. ""We have discussions about how to handle disrespect in a studio environment and learning how to navigate egos. ""It's really, really hard, and sometimes people are very disrespectful, so we talk about it and cry about it and go through it together."" Raye and her sisters Amma (L) and Absolutely (R) spoke to BBC News backstage at the Graham Norton Show last week Lauren, who performs under her middle name Amma, says having Raye in her corner has already paid off. Many of her friends have met male writers and producers who've diminished their contributions and made sexually inappropriate comments, she says. ""But because my older sister is Raye, it's like, 'No!' They won't move to me because they've already hit on you,"" she says. The sisters laugh raucously, but there's an undercurrent of pain. Raye was a teenager when she signed her first record deal, and experienced several instances of sexual abuse that contributed to a ""dark, dark"" period of drinking and drug-taking in her early 20s. ""It was difficult [to watch] for a little bit of time,"" says Amma, gently touching her big sister's arm. ""You were just struggling, I think."" To sing or not to sing? Witnessing Raye's experiences in the industry – both the successes and the sorrows - ultimately stopped Amma from pursuing music ""for a really long time"". It was only when her father played one of her songs to music publishers in Los Angeles that things changed. Snapped up as a songwriter, she was working with R&B artists like Flo and Nao until a meeting about her next project took an unexpected turn. ""We were meant to be talking about other artists - and 20 minutes into the meeting, they pitched me becoming an singer,"" she recalls. ""I was like, 'No, no. That's not what I'm meant to be doing.' ""But as I was driving home, I was like, 'Wow, this is the best I've felt on this [songwriting] trip. Maybe I am meant to be doing this?'"" PA Media Assignments The siblings joined Graham Norton's TV show before setting off on a joint tour at the start of 2026 She got home, took a shower, and was hit by a sudden wave of inspiration. Sitting on her bed, she sketched out a song that weighed up the pros and cons of becoming a singer. "" Don't know if I'm really wanting the fame / Something tells me I'm a bit smarter than that ,"" she sang into her tape recorder. Ironically, it was expressing those doubts that convinced her to give it a shot. The song, called What Am I Doing It For?, became the opening track of her debut EP, Middle Child. Absolutely never had those doubts. She's been writing since she was 13 - and part of the reason for her new musical pseudonym is that she ""never wants anyone to find"" the EPs she recorded in her teens. Quieter and more reserved than her sisters, her singing voice is no less breathtaking. Her latest single, a gorgeous, yearning ballad called I Just Don't Know You Yet , has been played four million times on Spotify. Written two or three years ago, it shares its compositional DNA with Raye's Where Is My Husband! ""I was lying in bed one night, and I pray a lot,"" she explains, ""and I had it really heavy on my heart to pray for my future husband. ""Then I went into the studio the next day, and the lyrics came so effortlessly - just flowing out of my heart."" Getty Images Raye brought her grandmother onto the stage at the 2024 Brit Awards, where she picked up a record-breaking six trophies If it seems odd that these fiercely talented, independent women are so preoccupied with marriage, it helps to understand the overwhelmingly supportive and loving environment their own parents created. The sisters talk glowingly about growing up in the embrace of the church, where their father would teach them piano and their mother encouraged them to sing in the choir. But the biggest praise is reserved for grandma Agatha Dawson-Amoah, who moved from Ghana to help raise the family. ""She used to carry my cello home from school on her back while pushing me in the pram,"" reminisces Absolutely. ""Lauren would just be toddling along at the side and I'd be walking ahead, pretending I'm all independent,"" adds Raye. ""And we'd all be eating jam and cheese sandwiches,"" Amma laughs (the delicacy being a result of Agatha misunderstanding the composition of a ham and cheese toastie). ""Grandma was our best friend, and our rock,"" says Raye. In fact, she even makes a cameo on Where Is My Husband!, promising the star, "" Your husband is coming soon "". The song is projected to top the charts next week, and Raye is justifiably proud of the track - which she worked on right up to the wire, only delivering the final mix eight days before the deadline to get it pressed to vinyl. It turns out the song had a troubled gestation as the pressure of following up Raye's Mercury Prize-nominated album 21st Century Blues hit home. ""When you haven't written for a long time, you start being extremely self-critical. So I was hating everything I was coming out with, and then I had to have a pep talk. ""Mike [Sabbath, producer] and I went for a walk in the woods and talked about life, and did no work for a whole day."" The chorus for Where Is My Husband! arrived, unprompted, the next day. ""It was so exciting,"" she says. ""And then we just began chip, chip, chipping away at it."" Her sisters are totally enamoured with the song and spend a good few minutes trying to sing the tongue-twisting bridge before giving up and breaking into Sister Sledge's We Are Family instead. They'll have plenty of time to perfect it next year, though, when the whole clan set off on tour together, apparently oblivious to the fact that most family road trips end in disaster. ""Back in the day, we'd have war zones over hairbrushes,"" says Raye. ""But now we're just very close."" So, could a joint album be on the cards? Maybe even a Christmas record? ""A gospel album would be better,"" says Absolutely. ""Somewhere where we can experiment and have fun and push boundaries. ""I think it'll happen in like five or six years,"" Raye suggests. ""Five or six?"" Amma says, shocked. ""I bet you money we're gonna do it before."" ""OK then,"" replies Raye. ""Once I'm married and I've got my baby."" With a final, sisterly eye-roll, Amma sighs: ""Oh my gosh , you and your baby!""

e598dc3621ee,Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power?,,"Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power? Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images In the month since self-proclaimed ""eco-populist"" Zack Polanski took charge of the Green Party of England and Wales, there has been a noticeable change within the party. With over 20,000 new members in recent months, the Green Party is the largest it has ever been. The party appears to be trying to shed its image as well-meaning eco-warriors to become an insurgent force. While there appears to be momentum within the party, in a splintered political landscape there is a question mark over how the Greens can turn this into votes. When campaigning to become Green Party leader, Polanski promised to ""pick fights"". On the eve of his first conference as leader, Polanski was argumentative during an interview on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme when pushed to defend his deputy Mothin Ali over inflammatory comments he had made about an Israeli army reservist. This willingness to create controversy - if it wins attention and cuts through to the public - has been embraced by his party. Boldness is needed to combat voter disillusionment and rising right-wing populism, argues Rachel Millward, Polanski's other deputy co-leader. ""I guess I can't see the point of not going as big as you can go,"" says Millward. ""If we stay timid, we might gain nothing. ""Whereas, if we're bold we definitely gain people because it resonates because it's true and it's real and people are craving that honesty."" The Green Party's head of elections, Chris Williams, oversaw the Greens' best-ever general election campaign last year - it gave the party four MPs for the first time by tailoring and targeting campaigns in both Tory and Labour heartlands. But he is now recalibrating the party's approach to reflects Polanski's leadership style. ""To tailor an old adage: if you try to annoy nobody you don't excite anybody,"" is how he puts it. The Green Party see on opportunity to build on the momentum. With increased belief comes more members, more donations ""the campaigns get bigger, and the targets grow, and we win more seats, and we just build upwards and keep on going"", Williams argues. The UK's shifting electoral landscape, is also bringing growing opportunity, Williams says. ""By-elections are being won with just 27% of the vote. ""The swings we need are smaller - instead of climbing Everest, we're having to climb Snowdon now in order to win a constituency."" The party has already picked a raft of so-called ""development constituencies"" in Tory and Labour held areas across the country, though the targets are predominantly urban where traditional parties like Labour and the Conservatives are shedding votes fastest, Williams says. Some members warn a shift away from localised strategy could risk alienating the very voters who delivered the breakthrough wins in 2024. The party's two current MPs in rural areas could be particularly exposed - ex-leader Adrian Ramsay in Waveney Valley, on the border of Suffolk and Norfolk, and Ellie Chowns in North Herefordshire. Ramsay and Chowns also ran on a joint ticket against Polanski, picking up just 16% of the vote. On the ground, Millward - who co-leads the predominantly rural Wealden District Council - insists the countryside vote is not at risk. ""We've had more new members coming in, even in our rural area,"" Millward says. Getty Images Zack Polanski, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward (l-r) are set on taking the Green Party in a new direction. For all their ideological differences, the Green Party is watching Reform UK as a case study in how to win attention and turn it into electoral support. A well-attended panel discussion on ""how to stop Reform"" at conference was notable for the number of members praising the work of the Green's foe Nigel Farage. Members argued for copying a playbook of simple messaging, emotional appeal and a willingness to provoke - albeit with different content. In his leader's speech, Polanski said: ""If Reform can rocket through the polls with a politics of despair, then it's time for the Green Party to do the same thing with a politics of hope."" But the Green Party's electoral strategy is being reshaped not just by the rise of Reform UK. There's a risk that Your Party, the emerging political force led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, could take the wind out of the Green Party's sails. At 82,000 members the Green Party is the biggest it has ever been. For context Your Party claims to have had more than 600,000 sign-ups in the weeks after it launched. For Millward, all this proves is ""Labour's lost its support on the left"". ""And we are actually gaining from that as well - so it's not like a net loss to us."" The Greens have long relied on grassroots energy and volunteer labour. They now have more members to call on, but for a party trying to scale up from protest politics to serious electoral force money matters. Behind the scenes, Millward and others are pushing for a bolder approach to fundraising. She used her conference speech to argue they will be the party of ""fivers"" – emulating the micro-donations successes of US figures like Barak Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The party also needs to become ""bold enough to ask"" sympathetic donors that have sustained big parties like the Conservatives, Labour and Reform, she says. ""We're not talking about being funded by corruptive billionaires, but there are people who are with us and who would like a change."" The 2026 local elections will be a key test for the Greens. The party is aiming to hold a record 900 council seats when they contest a series of nominal strongholds, in London, Brighton and Huddersfield. The party is also talking up their chances in taking over new combined authority contests in Sussex, and in Norfolk and Suffolk. In Wales, they have high hopes the new proportional representation voting system will allow the party to gain a foothold in the Senedd. But fractured multi-party voting in a first past-the-post electoral system in England and Wales can lead to unpredictable results. It is clear the Green Party leadership see a path to victory. They must now see if voters will reward ""picking fights"" with electoral success or a bloody nose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx85q4dyzo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/193b/live/d6d4a950-a167-11f0-8b70-39bf68f49b3e.jpg,2025-10-05T10:43:16.415000+00:00,13abb7877500137130af79d8f04a8d9e24427f96
48276753a77e,Tories invoke Thatcher legacy in search of a comeback,,"Tories invoke Thatcher legacy in search of a comeback Paul Seddon Political reporter, Conservative Party Conference, Manchester Getty Images It is far from unusual to see tributes to Margaret Thatcher at Conservative party conferences. But the ghost of the Iron Lady hangs particularly heavily at this year's annual gathering in Manchester, as activists celebrate 100 years since her birth in 1925. Along with the customary cardboard cut-outs and decorative gift mugs, a special exhibition stand is displaying a selection of the former Conservative prime minister's most famous outfits from her 11 years in office. Delegates can have their photo taken for a Thatcher mosaic projected on a wall, whilst a cocktail bar has been booked for a ""Maggie's 100th"" party, with a live DJ ready to blast out ""everyone's favourite disco hits"". That the party faithful would turn to their most successful leader at this particular point in time is not surprising, even if outsiders might question the party's continued fascination with a leader it ejected from office more than 30 years ago. Kemi Badenoch, who is preparing to mark her own one-year anniversary as Tory leader next month, is grappling with how to revive the Tories after their election drubbing last year and subsequent slump in the polls. She has reportedly turned to Mrs T's legacy herself for inspiration, reading a book about her predecessor's early years in power. But the party has also been debating whether the Thatcherite era holds any lessons for Badenoch, as she faces the task of restoring her party's fortunes. 'Lanyard classes' Robert Colvile, who co-authored the Tories' 2019 election manifesto and now runs the Centre for Policy Studies think tank set up by Thatcher in the mid-1970s, says Badenoch today is facing a different economic backdrop. But speaking at a fringe event to mark the anniversary, he suggested she could draw from Thatcher when it comes to identifying the party's political targets. Whilst the former PM waged war with unions and state-backed industry, he said the Tories today should look to rein in the ""lanyard classes"" running government bodies ""constraining the growth of enterprise"". John Redwood, a former Tory MP who once headed up Thatcher's policy unit in Downing Street, said the British energy industry could provide a similar cause for the party's activists to rally behind. The sector, he added, had become ""like a nationalised industry"" due to the scale of public subsidies and ""bans and blocks"" to enforce net-zero targets. Getty Images Cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher are in evidence at the Tory conference Conservative MP Esther McVey told party members that Thatcher would be ""spinning in her grave"" at GB Energy, the new company set up by Labour to invest in green energy projects. McVey also argued that the party could take a leaf out of Thatcher's book when it comes to the task of rebuilding its reputation as a competent custodian of the British economy. It is perhaps the key message the party wants to get across this week, as it seeks to present Nigel Farage's spending plans as a threat to the public finance. McVey, a former work and pensions secretary, said Reform UK's promise to scrap the two-child benefit cap , a policy backed by the Lib Dems and also under consideration by Labour, could leave the Tories as the only main party pushing to keep the limit in place. ""The economy is where the Conservatives are going to get their breakthrough,"" she added. ""That is, I think, going to be our separation, our USP."" Redwood pointed out that Thatcher also faced an electoral challenge from a new party, in the shape of the SDP, which polled as high as 50% in the 1980s as part of an alliance with the Liberals. He added that the Tories didn't ""spend our time talking about or worrying about the social democrats,"" instead focusing on ""being Conservatives"". As the governing party at the time, he added, it was ""incumbent on us"" to show the party could deliver its policy programme. If Badenoch can repeat the trick in opposition, it could decide whether she can lead her party back into government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23755eg09zo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e2a6/live/b61c2550-a1f6-11f0-947b-6b8b23372a50.jpg,2025-10-05T18:40:03.239000+00:00,98b76726681df634f30ad2c5dc516d5c032a598f

And in the end, it was former Apprentice star Thomas Skinner who left the show, after judges voted to save former England rugby captain Chris Robshaw. When asked by co-host Tess Daly about his experience on the show, Skinner, 34, paid tribute to his professional dance partner Amy Dowden. “Thank you, Amy - sorry that we haven't done too good, 'cause you're a different class,” he said. BBC/PA Skinner hit the headlines before the series had even started, after walking out of a press conference early - something he later apologised for . But the social media personality insisted he had ""loved"" his time on Strictly. ""I've never danced before and my stay was short, but Amy's amazing. It's been great fun and I've enjoyed it. I can't really dance that well but I've had fun!"" BBC/PA Thomas Skinner and Amy Dowden spoke about their experiences on the show after being defeated in the dance-off On Sunday night, both couples performed their routines from Saturday once again. Skinner and Dowden did their salsa to Bonkers by Dizzee Rascal and Armand van Helden, while Robshaw and his partner Nadiya Bychkova reprised their Viennese waltz to Die With A Smile by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. After the dances, the judges delivered their verdicts - and it was Robshaw and Bychkova who won the majority vote, leaving Skinner and Dowden to say their farewells. Dowden also complimented her dance partner, saying: ""I've got to know the real Tom, and he is adorable. He's looked after me. We've laughed so much."" BBC/PA During Saturday night's live show, Thomas Skinner bench-pressed his partner over his head Dowden has been candid about her wish to get back on the dance floor following her diagnosis with breast cancer two years ago. She made a return to Strictly in 2024 but had to pull out midway through the series due to an injury. Speaking on Saturday night, she said winning the glitterball would have been ""amazing"", but added: ""What I've learnt in the last few years is happiness, health and being alive is more important than anything."" Addressing Skinner, she went on to say: ""The last three years as you know have been quite difficult for me. I lost all confidence as a dancer - but walking into the room with you with a massive smile and a laugh, you brought me back and, honestly, thank you."" During Saturday night's live show , Skinner - sporting a clingy, sparkly vest top - hoisted Dowden up so often during their routine, judge Craig Revel Horwood joked it looked more like a weightlifting competition. They scored 13 points, placing them at the bottom of this week's leaderboard. Scores from week one and two were added to the public vote to decide which couples should face the dance-off. Skinner first hit TV screens on The Apprentice in 2019, and has since appeared on shows including 8 Out of 10 Cats, The Wheel, Michael McIntyre's Big Show, Good Morning Britain and Faking It, as well as Celebrity Masterchef.

0774091cfd34,Conservatives to set out plan for £47bn of cuts to public spending,,"Conservatives to set out plan for £47bn of cuts to public spending Kate Whannel Political reporter Getty Images The Conservatives will set out proposals later on cutting public spending on welfare, aid and civil servants which the shadow chancellor will say would save £47bn over five years. Sir Mel Stride is expected to say in his speech to the party's conference in Manchester that there is ""no more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have"". Proposals include stopping welfare claims for people with ""low level mental health problems"" and reducing the number of civil servants by around 132,000, a reduction of around a quarter. Sir Mel will also say his party would reduce aid spending by £7 billion to 0.1% of national income. The conference in Manchester marks almost one year since Kemi Badenoch was elected party leader. In the last 12 months, the party has struggled to counter the political threat posed by Reform UK and suffered heavy defeats in this year's local elections . During their conference, which began on Sunday, the Conservatives are hoping to portray themselves as more competent and more credible - particularly on public spending - than their political rivals. In his conference speech, Sir Mel will say: ""We must get on top of government spending. ""We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. ""We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility."" His proposals include saving: £23bn from the welfare bill £8bn by bringing civil servant numbers from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000 £7bn from the overseas aid budget £3.5bn by ending the use of hotels to home asylum seekers £4bn by ensuring benefits and social housing are reserved for UK nationals £1.6bn by scrapping environmental policies, including cutting subsidies for heat pumps and electric vehicles. Earlier this year, the Labour government sought to cut nearly £5bn from the disability and health-related benefits bill but had to backtrack after a rebellion by its own MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has suggested the government will return to the issue, telling the BBC that changes to the welfare system ""must happen"". Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from £64.7bn in 2023-24 to £100.7bn in 2029-30. The Tories argue they can reduce the bill by reviewing exemptions for the Household Benefit Cap, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability - which allows claimants to lease vehicles - and changing obligations for job-seekers. It says it would stop claims for people suffering from ""low-level health"" mental health problems arguing that ""what is really needed is treatment and support, not cash"". It also says it would keep in place the two-child benefit cap, which prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. The Labour government has been under pressure to remove the cap, with many of its backbenchers arguing the limit has increased the number of children in poverty. The Resolution Foundation says axing the cap would lift 470,000 children out of poverty and would cost around £3.5bn. Badenoch has previously defended the cap saying it was a matter of ""fairness"" and Conservatives believed people on benefits ""should have to make the same choices on having children as everyone else"". Earlier this year, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut the UK's aid budget from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to pay for an increase in defence spending. The Conservatives say further reducing spending to 0.1% would save nearly £7bn. Currently, a portion of the existing aid budget is used to pay for hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. The Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) think tank welcomed some of the proposals but warned the Conservatives not to ignore ""elephant in the room"" of age-related spending such as pensions. Tom Clougherty, IEA executive director, said: ""Ultimately, no political party is going to be able to balance the books only by cutting things their supporters don't like. ""Without that, other cuts are likely to amount to running to stand still."" The Conservatives have not committed to changing the triple lock, which guarantees that the state pension will go up each year in line with either inflation, wage increases or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. Romilly Greenhill, chief executive of Bond, the network of international development organisations, said the proposed aid budget cuts were ""reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible"". The Conservative conference comes six weeks before Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivers her Budget on 26 November. During the election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. However, there has been speculation that Reeves will need to raise taxes in order to meet her self-imposed rules for public spending and debt. In a report in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor only had a ""very small margin"" - £10bn buffer - in which to operate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzv9j78dyo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/20e0/live/817a56d0-a22a-11f0-9a8d-55d7ff06f061.jpg,2025-10-05T21:33:42.878000+00:00,a504697dc7a2560b93555221ea46e7498603e01f
9cbd2a1269e7,Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness',,"Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness' Chris Mason Political editor EPA The Conservative Party conference in Manchester is taking place against a backdrop of grief and pain over last week's synagogue attack When a political party gathers for its annual conference, the host city (or at least the political and security bubble that surrounds the conference centre) becomes home to feverish and partisan political chat. What is different about the next few days is Manchester is also a city in mourning after the horrific attack on Thursday. There is, of course, still sharp political argument here but the emotional and practical backdrop is one of grief, fear and an ongoing police investigation. The flags outside the conference centre fly at half mast. A community just a few miles from here, but also all over the UK, is terrorised, frightened and grieving. Many Jewish people are furious more has not been done - for years - to protect them. And all this poses some of the biggest questions about who we are and what we hold dear. The other day the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood pleaded with pro-Palestinian protesters not to head out onto the streets in the immediate days after the attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue. She argued that to do so would be ""un-British"". But others ponder just how British it is to curb repeated protests - the plan Mahmood now plans to legislate for. So what are the fundamental tenets of Britishness - a concept itself some would contest - under which a multicultural, multilingual, multireligious collection of nations such as the UK could agree on? Against the backdrop of pain and grief, this is a debate about some of the fundamentals of our society - democracy, protest, offence, tolerance (even tolerance for the intolerant) and proportionality. In addition to antisemitism, there is Islamophobia too. The home secretary talked over the weekend, rather euphemistically, about what she called ""community relations"" and others might put more baldly as racism and hatred. The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK had tolerated what she called radical Islamist ideology ""for too long"". This element of the conversation around the dangers of Islamism and how it is countered is not new and itself infuriates many as we collectively wrestle with what to do about it. These are challenges for the home secretary, challenges for the government yes, but challenges for society as a whole.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7840dv7n4po,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/afef/live/acb32710-a279-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T06:01:51.849000+00:00,8b1de4374fa1c138867b726cc803bb2403668971
3e586b23f634,Housebuying shake-up plan aims to cut costs and time,,"Housebuying shake-up plan aims to cut costs and time Charlotte Edwards Business reporter, BBC News Getty Images Plans for a major reform of the housebuying system, which aim to cut costs, reduce delays and halve failed sales, have been unveiled by the government. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the changes would ""fix the broken system"" and put more money ""back into working people's pockets"". Under the new proposals, sellers and estate agents will be legally required to provide key information about a property up front. The overhaul could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and cut up to four weeks off the typical property transaction timeline, according to the government. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of families and first-time buyers could benefit from the reforms. Those in the middle of a chain could also potentially gain a net saving of £400 as a result of the increased costs from selling being outweighed by lower buying expenses. The consultation draws on other jurisdictions, including the Scottish system where there is more upfront information and earlier binding contracts. This will include being up front about the condition of the home, any leasehold costs, and details of property chains. The government says this transparency will reduce the risk of deals collapsing late in the process and improve confidence among buyers, particularly those purchasing a home for the first time. Binding contracts may also be introduced to prevent parties from walking away late in the deal, a move intended to halve the number of failed transactions, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5bn a year. ""Buying a home should be a dream, not a nightmare,"" said Reed. ""Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives."" The reforms will also aim to boost professional standards across the housing sector. A new mandatory Code of Practice for estate agents and conveyancers is being proposed, along with the introduction of side-by-side performance data to help buyers choose trusted professionals based on expertise and track record. The government said a full roadmap for the changes would be published in the new year, forming part of its broader housing strategy, which includes a pledge to build 1.5 million new homes. Housing expert Kirstie Allsopp, the presenter of Channel 4's Location, Location, Location, told the BBC's Today programme she was ""really glad the government has grasped this nettle"". She said it was important to focus on both the buying and selling sides, ""because things fall through because buyers walk away just as much as sellers walk away, and I think that was a worrying element"". The boss of property website Rightmove, Johan Svanstrom, welcomed the plans to modernise the system. ""The home-moving process involves many fragmented parts, and there's simply too much uncertainty and costs along the way. Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals."" However, Conservative shadow housing minister Paul Holmes said: ""Whilst we welcome steps to digitise and speed up the process, this risks reinventing the last Labour Government's failed Home Information Packs - which reduced the number of homes put on sale, and duplicated costs across buyers and sellers."" The announcement comes as the Conservatives are set to detail changes to its tax policy for first home buyers at the party's conference in Manchester. The party will lay out plans to ""reward work"" by giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home when they get their first full time job. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride will announce proposals for a ""first-job bonus"" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account. The party say it will be funded by cuts to public spending worth £47bn over five years in areas such as welfare, the civil service and the foreign aid budget.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0v7zwp0dlo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0623/live/488de0c0-a226-11f0-a2b9-abdd67c14f44.jpg,2025-10-06T06:56:00.600000+00:00,e0465fcf99bf349beccba1418a655374bef4fdef
32ea352a35d5,Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future,,"Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future Matt Chorley 5 Live presenter PA Media Louis Armstrong had all of it in the world. The Beautiful South needed a little more. For Kemi Badenoch, and her 118 MPs, time is also on their minds. The Conservative leader believes she needs more time, to turn around her party from its historic drubbing in last year's general election. Yet as time's gone on, she's gone further down in the polls. ""I didn't say it would be easy,"" she told Tory members on Sunday. ""And I didn't say it would be quick."" For her MPs - and I've contacted almost all of them for my BBC Radio 5 Live show via text and WhatsApp over the last few days - time is of the essence, and for some, it is already running out. Around one in three Tory MPs responded to my questions about the mood of the party, and the pressure Badenoch is under. They break down roughly into two camps. In the first are those who think the next election is a considerable way off and want Badenoch to be given space to try to repair damage not all of her own making. The mood, they insist, is better than much of the media speculation. ""Chipper"", even. They take comfort from Labour's own woes and leadership speculation, and cling to a belief that Reform UK's populist policies increasingly do not survive contact with reality. ""There's a gallows humour about the party, a 'well it can't get any worse, can it?' strange jovialness which is kind of bonding,"" says one Tory MP. Several texts I received suggested Badenoch had bought herself more time in office, perhaps months, with a single performance at Prime Minister's Questions last month , when she challenged Keir Starmer over what he knew about the friendship between his US ambassador, Peter Mandelson, and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. One former cabinet minister said: ""The Mandelson PMQs was a turning point. She smashed it. ""That one half hour has probably bought her another six months of grace in the job. She doesn't need to learn the same lesson twice. Giving her time and space is starting to pay dividends."" And then there is the second camp who think the clock is ticking: on her leadership and on the long-term viability of what used to be called the world's oldest and most successful political party. They grumble, especially those elected for the first time last year, about a leader's office lacking in direction, fight, even a willingness to acknowledge their existence. ""It's not that we're not getting listened to as a party,"" says one 2024 Tory MP. ""It's that we've nothing to say. We're too timid, we think we're in government still and are fretting about costing things that we'll never have to worry about if we keep on launching commissions and our best pushback against Reform is 'That's not costed, you know'."" In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches. When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied ""oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in"". Some tell me privately that the looming date of 2 November, when Badenoch will have been in office for a year and therefore open to a confidence vote, is ""focusing minds"" in the leader's office. ""She needs to have a very impactful conference in order to stave off a confidence vote before the end of the year in my view,"" says one MP. ""There's a whiff of fatality in the air because of the polls."" So how much time does she have? Next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd and many English councils are shaping up to be ""the moment of truth"", according to some of her MPs. (Labour MPs were saying similar things to me about Keir Starmer last week.) One member of Badenoch's own frontbench, who closely monitors the mood of the party, texts me bluntly: ""She is under unbelievable pressure. This will be her last conference as leader."" When I expressed some surprise at the prediction, the MP quickly responded: ""I like Kemi and I think we should stick with the leader we have so I hope I'm completely wrong."" Others are more convinced that her time is running out. One Conservative who publicly backed Badenoch in last year's leadership contest told me: ""Kemi's time as leader could end by Christmas rather than after the May elections. ""Ultimately unpredictable, and how conference goes will shape the outcome, but conference, and post conference polls, are undoubtedly pivotal."" Whatever the merits of having someone different in charge – and many see Robert Jenrick waiting in the wings – it risks exposing the Tories once again to the most damaging of political forces: ridicule. One grandee tells me: ""We need to regain our senses and remember we were totally thrashed last summer and have not yet been forgiven. More shenanigans won't help."" A shadow minister agrees: ""This conference is super important. People and members want direction and messaging and so this is Kemi's moment. She can't squander it - she needs to show why we are the sensible option on the right and a genuine force still. ""If she doesn't deliver it could be curtains but most MPs I speak to want this to work. There is too much PTSD from the last five years."" A former cabinet minister says: ""The Tories will start to make progress - and it will be on the economy – after enough time has passed since our crushing defeat and the public feel enough water under the bridge since that defeat."" Another says: ""When the country is ready to listen to us again (a year hence maybe?), we'll show that we are totally unified, have some great people and the right ideas."" One MP who has been in the Commons for two decades says: ""No one is expecting instant miracles nor is there urgent appetite for a coup."" PA Media Kemi Badenoch defeated rivals Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat in the 2024 leadership election in Birmingham Some note that she is very much the new kid on the block: Farage has been an elected politician on and off for more than quarter of a century. Starmer has been leader for almost six years. Even Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, was a minister in the coalition government 15 years ago. Being unknown means voters struggle to work out what she is about, but it also presents an opportunity to move beyond the last Tory government and appear new and fresh. Talk continues about what to do about Reform. Will some sort of deal have to be made? A merger? A pact? A takeover? Whatever, the Tories need to be in a stronger position before it can think about such a negotiation. There is also a theory that's taken hold in Conservative thinking that part of their predicament is the fault of Keir Starmer. ""Usually the opposition would have longer but the government collapse in popularity has happened so quickly it has sharpened focus on needing to have an alternative narrative,"" one Tory MP, first elected in 2024, said. ""It is hard to look like a renewed party though when so many of the key people are well known from the last government when it was comprehensively dumped from power."" Some declare her party conference pledge to repeal the Climate Change Act a ""gamechanger"". Others say the same of a promise to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. What is not always clear is if they actually expect it to change the game, or merely hope it might. Badenoch and her team are being urged to ""quickly set out a bold, uncompromisingly honest, radical 'Maggie 2.0' program of reform, on tax, small business, immigration and welfare, to tackle the grievances Farage is feeding on"". EPA Three display cabinets at Conservative party conference holding outfits worn by Margaret Thatcher Ah yes, Maggie. Margaret Thatcher. She would have turned 100 this month, but the former prime minister still haunts this conference and this party. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who took over as leader of the Conservatives after their 2001 election defeat before being ousted two years later, told me: ""I think it's a very difficult time for anyone to be leader. ""The Conservative party has a messiah complex, thinking some messiah will suddenly appear and lead us to the promised land. ""They look back to Margaret Thatcher and think she arrived as a fully-formed messiah to save the party and the country. In fact, when she arrived some people thought 'this is a disaster'. People said she was shrill, weak, difficult. It took her time for her strength of character and intellect to dominate and for her to become the leader she was. ""Kemi has that capability and needs time too. Otherwise we risk confirming people's view of us from our behaviour during the last government that we are fratricidal and not to be trusted."" In the conference exhibition hall in Manchester there is a lot of Thatcher merchandise - and a glass display case holding the burgundy wool suit she wore on the day she left Downing Street - a monument to the moment a female Tory leader was ousted by her colleagues because they believed she was doing more harm than good. After this conference week in Manchester we might have a clearer idea if Tory MPs are ready to do that particular Time Warp again.

5b7d80f55b23,Eastenders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being a Send parent,,"Eastenders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being a Send parent Kellie Bright Presenter, BBC Panorama Kellie Bright I've been desperate to make a documentary about special educational needs and disabilities (Send) for ages. You might know me as EastEnders' Linda Carter but I'm also a mum to my autistic son. He's also dyslexic and has ADHD. It took months of perseverance and hard work from my husband and I to try to get the right education for him. At times, it felt like a battle. That is why I wanted to make this film for Panorama, so I could meet other families who were going through the same thing, and speak to teachers, councils and the government about how Send children are educated in England. There are more than 1.7 million children in England with Send. It is a broad group, including autistic children and people who struggle with speech and language, have ADHD and physical disabilities, among other conditions. Schools in England already provide some support to these students but if parents think their child needs extra help they can make an application to their council for what's called an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). An EHCP is a crucial document because it is legally binding, states where a child should go to school and outlines how much extra support they should get. My husband and I spent hours filling in the forms to request an EHCP and many families find the process very frustrating. Buddy and Tunde Not long after I meet 15-year-old Buddy, he shows me his favourite cuddly toy, Reindeer Dog. Buddy's autistic, meaning his brain experiences and reacts to the world in a different way from many people's. He struggles with meeting people his own age, understanding his emotions and anxiety. Buddy likes to keep Reindeer Dog close to him. After moving to London from Scotland in October 2024, Buddy's mum, Tunde, started applying for schools. She says she tried at least 11 schools but many of them didn't get back to her, and those that did said they were full or could not give Buddy extra support without an EHCP. At the start of this year more than 638,000 EHCPs had been issued to children and young people in England, a 10.8% rise on the year before and an 80% increase in six years. The increase is partly because parents and schools have got better at identifying children who have special educational needs, especially autism, as opposed to there being more children with Send. It is the second time Buddy and Tunde have applied for an EHCP. Their first application was turned down before Buddy was assessed. Councils reject about a quarter of EHCP applications at the assessment stage, according to the Department for Education. When they lived in Scotland, Tunde says they did not have to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. Buddy's comprehensive school arranged support for his learning, although not for his emotional needs. Scotland has a different system for helping children with Send; schools there aim to deliver more support without the need for parents to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. ""It's a madness,"" Tunde says. ""[Getting extra support] was so easily done, and it could be easily done again."" While Buddy is not able to go to school, the council is providing him with 19 hours of lessons per week in the local library. Tunde tells me the process of applying for an EHCP has been so time consuming she had to stop working as a midwife and health visitor for a time. ""I can't do the parenting. I can't get him to these appointments, and work at the same time… I couldn't get my son seen in the right amount of time and see other people's babies in the right amount time. And it was a toss up - and my son won,"" she says. We catch up with Buddy after a lengthy speech and language assessment. ""Draining… that's all I've got for you,"" he says as he leans against a fence, Reindeer Dog tucked under his arm. Buddy often takes Reindeer Dog to give him comfort A school for Buddy It's September and as millions of children start term, Buddy is still being taught in the library. Two months after I first met him, he's getting an EHCP but his education is still not settled. The council agreed to Tunde's request that he go to an independently run school that works with children who struggle in mainstream schools. Before Buddy can start there, the school has already taken over the lessons he receives in the library. But Tunde's now not sure the school will be able to deliver what she believes her son needs to improve his social skills and confidence with children his own age. ""We were all prepared for September… and he's still not at school, he's still having one-to-one,"" she said. ""I think … preparing to be around other kids and then still just being one-to-one with adults has really knocked him back and made him not want to go to school."" Southwark Council says it takes Tunde's concerns very seriously and it will continue to support her family to ensure they receive the provision they need without further delay. It says it knows how hard it can be for families to navigate the system, and how distressing delays in securing support can be. It says it has invested in a specialist information and advice team, and now ensures children are assessed by specialist teachers at the earliest stage, and it is open to reviewing the situation when parents are concerned about education placements. 'The current system is broken' I know there is another side to this story. The huge rise in the number of EHCPs is putting councils under severe financial pressure. It is estimated by the Department for Education that English councils are set to run up a total accumulated Send deficit between £4.3bn and £4.9bn by March 2026. The government says it has invested a billion pounds to help councils pay for EHCPs and £740m on new Send school places . I went to West Sussex County Council to interview one of few people in local government prepared to talk to me on the record about Send funding. Jacquie Russell is a Conservative councillor and cabinet member for children, young people and learning. ""The current system is actually very adversarial. Our parents are increasingly tired and anxious and fed up of fighting… Staff sickness levels are really, really high at the moment,"" she says. ""The current system doesn't work. It is broken. It's not delivering the best outcomes for children."" Jacquie Russell says the current Send system is putting unsustainable pressure on councils Demand for EHCPs is now outstripping funding in West Sussex. In 2015, the council had about 3,400 children with an EHCP. Today there are more than 10,000. As a result the Send deficit has been growing year-on-year, so that at the end of 2025 it stands at more than £123m. ""That [money] is really essentially meant to be for local services. That would have ordinarily gone to repair your roads… and other local services,"" she says. ""The current position is not sustainable."" The government agrees. It is planning major reforms of the Send system, though final plans have not yet been agreed. The minister for school standards, Georgia Gould, told me the upcoming reforms were ""not taking support away from families"". ""We're wanting to put more support in earlier,"" she said. ""Where people have fought for support, and that's in place, we want to make sure that that support continues."" She also told me she wanted to work with parents to get the reforms right and to get support at the ""earliest possible point rather than having to battle"". The minister added that parents would still have a ""legal basis"" to get support. Worried parents held a rally in Westminster last month as the government mulls over reforms to the system For me, and thousands of other parents of Send children, applying for an EHCP feels like a battle about your child's future. Who does not want the best possible education for their son or daughter? But for every parent fighting, there is a council counting the cost. All eyes are now on the government to see if its reforms can relieve the pressure on so many families.

6fc00651c5d4,Best-selling author Jilly Cooper dies at 88,,"Best-selling author Jilly Cooper dies at 88 PA Media Novelist Dame Jilly Cooper, known for her best-selling books including Rivals and Riders, has died at the age of 88. Dame Jilly's most successful works were The Rutshire Chronicles, beginning with Riders in 1985, which portrayed the scandals, sex lives and social circles of the wealthy country set. Follow-up Rivals was published in 1988 and was turned into a hit Disney+ TV series last year. She sold more than 11 million books in total in the UK alone. In a statement, her children Felix and Emily said: ""Mum was the shining light in all of our lives. Her love for all of her family and friends knew no bounds. Her unexpected death has come as a complete shock."" 'Bonkbusters with insight' They added: ""We are so proud of everything she achieved in her life and can't begin to imagine life without her infectious smile and laughter all around us."" She died on Sunday morning after a fall, a statement from her publisher said. Her agent Felicity Blunt remeberend the writer as ""emotionally intelligent, fantastically generous, sharply observant and utter fun"". Blunt added: ""You wouldn't expect books categorised as bonkbusters to have so emphatically stood the test of time but Jilly wrote with acuity and insight about all things - class, sex, marriage, rivalry, grief and fertility. ""Her plots were both intricate and gutsy, spiked with sharp observations and wicked humour.

4e8a22849de3,Dame Jilly Cooper: Undisputed queen of the joyous British bonkbuster,,"Dame Jilly Cooper: Undisputed queen of the joyous British bonkbuster Getty Images Fans bought Cooper's books in their millions, pushing many to the top of the bestseller lists The novels of Dame Jilly Cooper, who has died at the age of 88, are joyous descriptions of a fantasy world where monied men cast smouldering glances and women are instantly aroused. The undisputed queen of the British bonkbuster, some of her biggest titles were the Rutshire Chronicles: unputdownable tales of sexual intrigue among the polo-playing classes - including such classics as Rivals, Riders and The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous. In Rutshire - Cooper's fictional country - everyone drinks like they have hours to live, outdoor sex is practically compulsory, and few vows of marriage survive until the final page. In recent years, her work was criticised for outdated stereotypes of race, gender and sexual consent. But fans bought Cooper's books in their millions, pushing many to the top of the bestseller lists. And in 2024, a Disney+ adaptation of Rivals, with its witty mixture of class-conflict, saucy sex and gentle social satire, proved that her basic recipe was still hugely popular. 'Shrewd and tough': A look back at Jilly Cooper's career Jilly Sallitt was born on 21 February 1937 in Hornchurch, Essex, although her parents came from old established Yorkshire families. Her father was Brigadier WB Sallitt OBE, a veteran of Dunkirk and surely a model for Cooper's fictional male characters. ""I adored my very handsome father,"" she said, ""who got a first at Cambridge, and also played rugger for both Cambridge and the army."" Her mother, Mary Sallitt was a noted beauty. Cooper, who described herself as ""rather plump"" as a teenager, worried about disappointing her. Getty Images Jilly Cooper said she spent far too much time ""longing for boys"" at school The family returned to Yorkshire, where young Jilly was educated at the Moorfield School in Ilkley. There she first met her future husband, Leo Cooper, when she was eight and he was three years older. ""My first memory of Leo,"" she recalled, ""was looking out of my bedroom window in Ilkley and seeing him throw a strawberry jelly at a girl who was rabbiting on about how much land her father had. I thought that terribly stylish."" She went on to the all-girls Godolphin School in Salisbury where she excelled at English and little else. On her own admission, she spent far too much time ""longing for boys"". Her family moved to London in the mid-1950s and, having failed to get the qualifications necessary to go to university, she embarked on a career as a journalist. She began working as a junior reporter on the Middlesex Independent, where she covered everything - including the local football team. Getty Images Jilly and Leo Cooper adopted two children: Felix and Emily However, she was unable to settle. She was sacked from 20 jobs, including stints in public relations and work as a copywriter - before finally working in publishing. She met up again with ""strong and handsome"" Leo Cooper, then working as a publisher of military books. On their first date, he ""unpinned my hair and told me I must never put my hair up again. And then he asked me to marry him."" Having experienced what reads like a scene from her own novels, Jilly did just that. She walked down the aisle with Leo in 1961. Getty Images Jilly Cooper photographed at home, surrounded by dogs Unable to have children of their own, Jilly and Leo adopted Emily and Felix. They set up home in Putney and struggled for money until 1968 - when Cooper got her big break. Over dinner with a Sunday Times magazine editor, Godrey Smith, she entertained him with bawdy tales of life as a hard-drinking, sexually liberated housewife. She was asked to write a piece for the newspaper, and the result had all the Jilly Cooper trademarks. It was totally outrageous, very funny and she was soon a regular contributor. A year later, the column became a book: How to Stay Married - which was full of now dated advice, including such pearls of wisdom as ""if you amuse a man in bed, he's not likely to bother about the mountain of dust underneath it"". In 1970, she wrote a follow-up: How to Survive from Nine to Five. Thereafter, Cooper averaged around a book a year. Getty Images Jilly Cooper published books about how to navigate the minefields of romance, before trying her hand a fiction She also created a TV sitcom, It's Awfully Bad For Your Eyes Darling. It starred Joanna Lumley and aired on the BBC in 1971. During the 13 years she worked for the Sunday Times, she also did serious interviews with a number of high profile figures including Margaret Thatcher, George Best and Rebecca West. And the 1970s saw her publish a flurry of books aimed at helping readers navigate the minefields of romance, including Men and Super Men, Woman and Superwomen, and Work & Wedlock. Then in 1975, she began to dabble in fiction. Her first novel was Emily - a romance based on a magazine article she'd written some years before. A rich, handsome man sweeps the heroine off her feet and bears her away to his ancestral home on a Scottish island - where she has to cope with his eccentric mother and a mysterious former flame. Flatteringly, Harpers & Queen magazine hailed Cooper as the ""Jane Austen of our time"" - although Pride and Prejudice has rather fewer descriptions of lusty sex in improbable places. Getty Images Jilly Cooper's social circle included the future Queen Camilla Emily was followed by a slew of page-turners in similar, breathy vein: Bella, Harriet, Imogen and Prudence. Octavia, in which a gushing party girl falls instantly in love with a blond, sharp-cheeked beau called Jeremy, later became an ITV series. In 1979, Cooper wrote Class: A View from Middle England: a cheerful examination of the intricacies of the system that both holds the country together, and simultaneously divides it. Describing herself as ""upper-middle class"", she tells a variety of real-life anecdotes - including the story of an imperious member of the House of Lords who, having just missed his train, commanded the station master to ""get me another"". Class was becoming a theme that permeated both her fiction and non-fiction. And Cooper's social circle now included some very upper class people indeed. Famously, these included Andrew and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later - of course - became Queen. ""The first time I met her I wore a miniskirt and fishnet stockings,"" Cooper recalled. ""She looked me up and down and said, 'Oh, Andrew had 35 Valentines' this year.' Keep off the grass."" Getty Images Leo and Jilly Cooper photographed in 2004 Over the ensuing five years, her output was prodigious. There were more self-help books, including How to Survive Christmas, and The Common Years: a brilliantly observed look at the time when she lived by and walked on Putney Common. Animals in War was a poignant account of dogs, horses and pigeons that have served and suffered in various conflicts. In 1985, she published Riders: the first of the Rutshire Chronicles. Cooper had left the original manuscript on a London bus, and it had taken her a decade to rewrite it - but it became an international bestseller. Set amid the world of international showjumping, it introduced her hero: Rupert Campbell-Black - a brutish cad who treats women and horses cruelly, before mellowing slightly through the influence of his second wife, Taggie O'Hara. Getty Images Jilly Cooper became a Dame of the British Empire in 2024 Over the ensuing four decades, she published around a dozen Rutshire novels, including Rivals, Polo, Appassionata and Pandora. The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous, about a womaniser who falls victim to a scheme to punish wayward husbands, later became an ITV miniseries starring Hugh Bonneville. Jilly Cooper knew how to keep her reader hooked, weaving together a bewildering variety of characters and constantly switching the narrative. Having spent a lifetime writing about infidelity, she then felt the sting of adultery. In 1990, publisher Sarah Johnson told a newspaper that she and Leo had been having an affair for six years. The revelation was prompted, she said, by Jilly's habit of boasting in print about her perfect marriage. For a while, Jilly and Leo lived semi-separate lives. But, eventually, they reconciled. Getty Images Dame Jilly Cooper surrounded by members of the cast of Disney+'s adaptation of Rivals in 2024 In 1999, she narrowly escaped death in the Ladbroke Grove train crash. With 31 deaths and more than 400 injured, it was one of the worst accidents in the history of British transport. But, having crawled through a broken carriage window, Cooper calmly walked to the nearest street, hailed a taxi, and went to a pre-arranged meeting at the Ritz. In 2004, Jilly Cooper was awarded an OBE. Twenty years later, Buckingham Palace was in touch again - asking her to become a Dame. After Leo's death from Parkinson's disease, she faced life alone. But, fast approaching 90, she was still publishing. In 2023, Tackle! - the latest installation of the Rutshire Chronicles - found Rupert Campbell-Black taking control of the local football team despite hating the sport. While promoting the book, Dame Jilly lavished alcohol and peerless quotes on any journalist that ventured to her home in Gloucestershire. A year later, Disney+'s glossy TV adaption of Rivals brought her a new generation of fans. Even the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak admitted he counted himself amongst them . Dame Jilly seemed to find as much fun in her books as her readers did. ""They're a bit of everything really,"" she once said. ""And happy endings too.""

The 39-year-old, from Llandaff in Cardiff, has previously claimed she was hacked by the now-defunct News Of The World newspaper at the age of 16, which ultimately led to an apology from publishers News Group Newspapers and the award of substantial damages to the young star. The singer, who earned the moniker the Voice of an Angel at the height of her fame, said that reading media coverage at the time ""felt like a knife to the skin"". ""The press intrusion was insane, there was all sorts of dark stuff going on,"" said Church, who joins the line-up on BBC One's Celebrity Traitors this Wednesday. Speaking to The Big Issue, the singer and presenter - who first rose to fame at the age of 11 - said: ""I know a lot of teenagers feel like things are unfair, but the sense of injustice I had was so keen. ""There were stories in the papers all the time and lots of things were blown up, misconstrued and made seedy - when they really weren't. ""There was a lot of shame being thrown at me, with the press desperately trying to make me a figure of sin and push this 'fallen angel' narrative,"" added Church, who now runs a wellness retreat in Powys. Getty Images Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson were dubbed 'the Welsh Posh and Becks' In 2005, the Crazy Chick singer - who had embarked on a career in pop - became involved with Wales international rugby player Gavin Henson, a relationship which drew a lot of media attention - with the couple christened 'the Welsh Posh and Becks'. The pair went on to have two children but split in 2010, weeks after announcing their engagement. During a high-profile legal battle, which was eventually settled in 2012, it was revealed Church had been put under surveillance by News Group Newspaper journalists and her medical records had been hacked. Church said her fury and defiance at the situation helped her survive the media scrutiny and coverage, and ""kept me protected"". ""If I had let that shame in, or internalised it, my life could have gone in a very different way,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nzg4w08jo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/529b/live/5c648fd0-a290-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.jpg,2025-10-06T10:00:37.793000+00:00,70d9344104df2e8fe755d2eb2354e20503122518
02bc67919989,Green Party backs plan to see end of private letting,,"The Green Party has committed itself to phasing out private landlords from the housing system. A motion passed at its party conference at the weekend called for the party ""to seek the effective abolition of private landlordism"" while backing building more council houses. The plan is now official policy for the Green Party of England and Wales, but there are currently no costings for the plans. In England, 19% of all households live in privately rented properties according to the latest government figures, making it the second largest type of housing. In Wales, the latest available figure is 17%. Under the terms of their new policy, the Greens would put more regulation and taxes on private rentals to make it difficult for landlords to make a profit, while boosting housebuilding by councils. It would use existing Green policies such as imposing rent controls, ending buy-to-let mortgages and giving councils the 'right to buy' a rental property when it is sold at a discounted price. The Greens would set up a state-owned housing manufacturer ""to mass produce high quality mass council housing for local authorities"". They would also levy national insurance on rental income, which, according to a report in The Times , is a measure that has also been considered by the Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Green MP Carla Denyer, who is the party's housing spokesperson, suggested the policy was not as a radical as it might sound. ""While the motion to conference had an eye-catching name, it does not actually 'abolish' landlords,"" she said. ""It does, however, address the housing crisis, empowers tenants and improves their wellbeing. It contains a range of policies which, over time, would reduce the proportion of the housing market that is privately rented, and increase the proportion of socially rented homes."" Under the Greens' rules, motions like this, which was put forward by an activist, become party policy if they pass a vote at either of the two conferences it holds each year. Other new policies adopted over the weekend included protecting people who have been in care from discrimination by calling for ""care experience"" to be treated in the same way as age, sex or religious belief under The Equality Act. Ellie Chowns, the Greens' Leader in Parliament, said the party's MPs would now push the government to adopt the measure. She said that ""those who have been in care often face discrimination, harassment and victimisation throughout their lives, in housing, education, health, employment and the justice system"". She added: ""Making care experience a protected characteristic would ensure public bodies make policy with care-experienced people in mind.""

9a9628abc7e5,Kogan appointed chair of football regulator,,"In April Nandy said Kogan was the ""outstanding candidate"" to fill the position, despite not being on the original three-person shortlist. A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport told BBC Sport: ""The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee found David Kogan appointable after his scrutiny hearing and we are now pleased to proceed in announcing him as chair. ""It is vital that the work to set up the regulator continues at pace to strengthen the governance of the national game and for that we need a chair in post and a board put in place. ""We have co-operated fully with the inquiry by the Commissioner of Public Appointments and await the report's publication."" In May Kogan told MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (CMS) during a pre-appointment hearing that he was being ""utterly transparent"" by declaring his donations. The committee endorsed Kogan but said he must work to ""reassure the football community that he will act impartially and in a politically neutral way"". Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage warned that Kogan's ""past donations to the Labour Party will inevitably leave him open to charges of political bias in a job where independence is paramount"". Kogan said he had donated ""very small sums"" to the campaigns, as well as thousands of pounds to Labour MPs and candidates in recent years, but had ""total personal independence from all of them"" and pledged ""total political impartiality"" if appointed. However, his proposed appointment was criticised by the Conservative Party, with  Shadow Culture Minister Stuart Andrew saying it was ""Labour cronyism"". ""The public has a right to know whether this was a fair and impartial process, or yet another case of political patronage disguised as due diligence,"" he said. Kogan, who will be paid a Â£130,000 salary for a three-day week, has been appointed for a five-year term until 19 May 2030. Dame Helen Stephenson and Simon Levine have also been appointed to the board. One of Kogan's biggest priorities is expected to be Sheffield Wednesday. Last month Nandy warned owner Dejphon Chansiri that ""change is coming"" amid continued calls for the Thai businessman to sell the cash-strapped Championship club. Various embargoes have been placed on the club for tax debts and late payments to players and staff. Last week it was revealed that player and staff wages were again not paid on time for the fifth time in seven months. Nandy said that ""if necessary, the football regulator can intervene in order to remove an owner who is threatening the future of the club"".

The documentary series follows his real-life car restoration venture, The Smallest Cog, in Herefordshire. Hammond, from Solihull, said he knew about cars, drove them round race tracks and had run production firms, but when it came to managing the workshop, he said: ""I'm outside my comfort zone"". Describing his mother as ""terrifying"", he said: ""I couldn't get the lads to fill in their timesheets which I absolutely need…and I just couldn't get them to do it - so I brought her in. She's only tiny but she did [it], they listened to her, so they do it now."" Key moments in the series, which premieres on Discovery+ later, include painting an Aston Martin pink, after a request by the customer, racing a classic 1960s sports car at Silverstone , and repairing a Mercedes SL given to Debbie McGee by her celebrity magician husband Paul Daniels. Hammond said each car came with a great story, whether it was a multi-million pound Ferrari or an old Ford Escort, because each one had someone's dreams or memories wrapped up in it. Motor trade 'in my blood' The business began four or five years ago, he said, after he had worked as a broadcaster talking about cars for 30 years, but wanted to be part of the industry. He described the motor trade as being "" in my blood "", because his grandfather was a coachbuilder at Mulliners Ltd in Birmingham and finished his career as an inspector at the end of the Jensen Interceptor line in West Bromwich. ""I thought, 'Well, I'm going to set up this workshop, I'll do it in near home and I'll put some blokes in it and brilliant, now I'm part of the industry, good', and then I thought that might make a good telly show."" The key thing was it was a real business, he said, adding: ""These are people's jobs. The guys working for me are painters, welders, fabricators, mechanics. ""This is their job. They pay rent and mortgage from the money, so I can't just go, 'Now I've had enough, let's just fold it', because it's their jobs so I've got to make it work.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz4wxk6y3o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0e24/live/f52af9a0-a2b5-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T13:57:19.788000+00:00,0647dde3f8c761c3a161529ba7f0f580fb329555
85e26dcc31af,No 10 denies government involved in collapse of China spying case,,"No 10 denies government involved in collapse of China spying case Becky Morton Political reporter and Jack Fenwick Political correspondent AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spies Downing Street has strongly denied the government was involved in the collapse of a prosecution against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who both deny the allegations - were dropped by prosecutors in September , prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. Number 10's press secretary said ""the suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses or restricted the ability of a witness to draw on a particular bit of evidence are all untrue"". It comes after the Sunday Times reported senior Whitehall officials met to discuss the trial early last month before the charges were dropped. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Several sources close to the trial have told the BBC that the CPS would not have made the decision to charge the pair unless it was confident that it had enough evidence to meet the threshold set in the Act. Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. However, last month the director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, who leads the CPS, said ""the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the decision was made by the CPS ""entirely independently of government"" and there was ""no role for any government minister or member of the government in this decision-making process"". He added that the government was ""disappointed"" that the prosecution had not proceeded. Mr Parkinson has also insisted no ""outside pressure"" played a part in the CPS decision. The Sunday Times reported that in a meeting last month, national security adviser Jonathan Powell revealed the government's evidence would be based on the national security strategy, which was published in June and does not refer to China as an ""enemy"". Asked if there had been a meeting in Whitehall in which Mr Powell had said China could not be called an enemy in court, the PM's spokesman said ""no"". He said the government's evidence in the case was ""based on the previous government's policy that was relevant at the time that the alleged offences took place between 2021 and 2023"". The position of the Conservative government at the time was to describe China as an ""epoch-defining challenge"", not an enemy. Getty Images Conservative MP Alicia Kearns previously employed Christopher Cash as a parliamentary researcher The decision to drop charges against the pair has been criticised by MPs, including Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle who said it could leave Parliament vulnerable to espionage. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who previously employed Mr Cash as a parliamentary researcher, said it was ""inexplicable"" that the trial would have collapsed ""without either ministerial or national security advisor or executive involvement"". ""I have no question that the Crown Prosecution Service made this decision independently,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier. ""However, it seems very clear to me that their ability to prosecute was spiked."" ""The evidential standard was met when charges were laid and something has happened, and I'm afraid it happened in the last few weeks before the trial was meant to go to court, where something changed, where the evidential standard was no longer met because something was withdrawn,"" she said. ""That can only happen if a witness was withdrawn, evidence was withdrawn, or the intelligence on which an officer of the state was expecting to operate was withdrawn... ""Either ministers or senior advisors acted with [Keir] Starmer's full knowledge, or they acted in contradiction and contempt of his wishes in a way that spiked the CPS's ability to prosecute."" Kearns, who has been a vocal critic of China, said she was concerned the government was ""putting our national security second"" because it wanted to reset relations with Beijing. In October 2024 David Lammy became only the second foreign secretary in six years to visit China , where he said Beijing and London should ""find pragmatic solutions to complex challenges"".

074254cd4834,Bleak reality of opposition sets in for Conservatives,,"Before us, there is a battalion of unemployed chairs. For the Conservatives right now, the fight even to be listened to is not easy. The speech by the shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride is one of the big set-piece moments of this conference. And yet there were countless empty seats in a modestly sized hall. Next door, in the exhibition centre, there are swathes of empty blue carpet. Some of the fringe events exploring the party's future have been standing room only. But not in the main hall. This party, so often and for so long the dominating force in British politics, is a shrivelled version of its usual self. They have not had a conference like this in more than a quarter of a century. Granted, they were in opposition this time last year too. But many attendees then will have signed up before they knew about that – the general election could have come after it. Plus, 12 months ago, there was a survivors' elation vibe about their proceedings: a leadership election was underway and members of any political party tend to revel in a battle of ideas and personalities, almost whatever the circumstances. This year, the bleak reality of opposition has set in. Even back in 1998, a year and a bit into their last big stint in opposition, they were the principal voice in opposition to a big majority government. Not so now. A year and a bit on from a cataclysmic election defeat, the Tories have become more unpopular. It is Reform UK that have momentum, a sustained lead in the opinion polls and a recent track record of election victories, albeit a very long way away from a general election. In the weeks prior to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester, there has been a steady drip drip of former Tories joining Nigel Farage, some with the parting rhetorical gift of claiming their old party is finished. It is not an entirely downcast mood here though. Perhaps by definition those who have turned up are still up for the scrap ahead. The party has decided to embark on a blitz of policy announcements, after a year in which they have endured a recession in attention amid the boom in interest in Reform. What they want you to notice is their pitch to be seen as economically credible. They want to shrink the state by around £50bn by cutting benefits, cutting foreign aid and cutting the civil service. Most of that money saved would be spent paying down the deficit, but some would go on eye-catching policies like scrapping business rates in England and helping young people save to buy a home . Yet the ghost of Liz Truss lingers: despite their best efforts to politely disown her, the Conservatives' opponents will probably never lose their appetite for reminding voters of the calamity of her brief premiership . And for Kemi Badenoch, the challenge is being noticed – and persuading her party to keep her in her job. Her rivals, Sir Keir Starmer, Reform leader Nigel Farage and the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey have all been around for longer and are all likely better known. Filling those empty chairs, commanding attention is just the beginning of the task she confronts. Has there ever been a tougher time in modern history for the Conservative Party? I'm not sure there has.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ne9yz37go,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2135/live/4ff6b170-a2d0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-06T16:25:19.948000+00:00,bcb9d3ab92f89df1475051214b94c462e3bfe026
